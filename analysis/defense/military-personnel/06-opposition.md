# Military Personnel: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to military personnel reform does not come from a single ideological direction. Instead, different reform proposals face resistance from different coalitions, each with distinct motivations. Fiscal conservatives oppose compensation increases on budgetary grounds. Social conservatives oppose diversity and inclusion initiatives on cultural grounds. Military traditionalists resist changes to the personnel management system on institutional grounds. And anti-militarism advocates on the left oppose expanding military recruiting on philosophical grounds. Understanding these overlapping but distinct opposition coalitions is essential for designing reforms that can navigate the political landscape.

## Fiscal Hawks: Opposing Compensation Increases

### Who They Are

Budget-focused legislators and analysts who view military personnel costs as the fastest-growing and least-controlled segment of the defense budget. These include members of both parties who prioritize deficit reduction, think tanks focused on fiscal responsibility (Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Concord Coalition), and defense budget analysts at organizations like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

### Their Arguments

- **Personnel costs are crowding out modernization.** Military personnel costs (pay, healthcare, retirement, housing) consumed approximately 33 percent of the FY2024 defense budget -- approximately $280 billion. CBO projects these costs will continue to grow faster than inflation due to healthcare costs and retirement obligations.
- **Total compensation already exceeds civilian equivalents.** CBO analyses have consistently found that average military compensation, when including healthcare, retirement, tax advantages, and non-cash benefits, meets or exceeds the 70th percentile of comparable civilian compensation. Fiscal hawks argue that further increases are unnecessary.
- **TRICARE is too generous.** Military healthcare, particularly retiree healthcare under TRICARE for Life, is among the most generous employer-provided health insurance in the country. Fiscal hawks argue that modest fee increases and co-pays would generate billions in savings without materially affecting recruitment or retention.
- **The Blended Retirement System already addressed the pension problem.** The BRS was designed to provide more equitable retirement benefits while reducing the long-term fiscal cost of the military pension system. Fiscal hawks resist proposals to enhance retirement benefits beyond BRS.

### Their Influence

Fiscal hawks have significant influence through CBO scoring of legislation, which can make compensation increases politically difficult by highlighting their long-term costs. They also have allies among defense reform advocates who want to shift resources from personnel to procurement and modernization.

### Counter-Arguments

- Personnel costs are not optional. The all-volunteer force requires competitive compensation by design. Underpaying the force is a false economy if it leads to recruiting shortfalls that require expensive remediation.
- CBO's comparison methodology is contested. Military service involves unique demands (deployments, relocations, physical risk) that have no civilian equivalent, making direct compensation comparisons misleading.
- Healthcare cost growth reflects broader system failures. Rising TRICARE costs are a symptom of the American healthcare system's dysfunction, not military-specific profligacy.

## Social Conservatives: Opposing Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives

### Who They Are

Legislators, advocacy organizations, and commentators who view diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in the military as ideologically motivated social engineering that undermines combat readiness and morale. Key voices include the Heritage Foundation, the Family Research Council, and conservative media figures, as well as specific members of Congress who have introduced legislation to defund military DEI offices and programs.

### Their Arguments

- **DEI is a distraction from combat readiness.** The military's purpose is to fight and win wars, not to serve as a laboratory for social experimentation. Time and resources spent on diversity training, unconscious bias education, and equity programs are diverted from warfighting training.
- **Lowering standards to meet diversity targets.** Some critics argue that diversity initiatives pressure the services to lower physical, cognitive, or behavioral standards to increase representation of women, minorities, or other groups.
- **Transgender policy imposes costs and disrupts readiness.** Opponents argue that the medical costs of gender transition, the administrative burden of policy changes, and the impact on unit cohesion justify restricting transgender service.
- **Critical Race Theory and ideological indoctrination.** Some critics allege that military education and training programs incorporate "woke" ideology that demoralizes conservative service members and alienates the rural, conservative communities from which the military traditionally recruits.

### Their Influence

Social conservative opposition has been highly effective in recent Congresses. The FY2024 NDAA debate included multiple floor amendments targeting DEI programs, and the House passed provisions that would eliminate the Chief Diversity Officer position at DoD, prohibit drag events on military installations, and restrict gender-affirming care at military medical facilities (many of these provisions were modified or removed in conference).

### Counter-Arguments

- Diversity is a military necessity. The force must recruit from and represent the entire nation, not just one demographic segment. Excluding or alienating large portions of the population shrinks the recruiting pool.
- Standards have not been lowered. The integration of women into combat roles, for example, was accompanied by the maintenance of gender-neutral physical standards. RAND studies found no degradation of unit cohesion following DADT repeal or the opening of combat roles to women.
- The cost argument is disproportionate. The estimated annual cost of transgender-related medical care in the military is approximately $2.4-$8.4 million (RAND, 2016), a negligible fraction of the $60+ billion military health budget.

## Military Traditionalists: Resisting Personnel System Reform

### Who They Are

Senior military leaders (active and retired), career-focused service members, and institutional defenders who view proposals to reform the personnel management system -- such as modifying "up-or-out," allowing lateral entry, or creating flexible career paths -- as threats to the military's hierarchical culture and combat effectiveness. This group includes some influential retired generals and admirals, service academy associations, and professional military education faculties.

### Their Arguments

- **Up-or-out maintains a young, vigorous force.** The system ensures that officers and NCOs who are not competitive for the next level depart, preventing stagnation and keeping the force young and deployable.
- **Lateral entry undermines professional development.** Allowing civilians to enter the military at mid-grade ranks without the full progression of military education, command experience, and institutional socialization would create leaders who lack the credibility and cultural competence to lead soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines.
- **Flexible career paths erode commitment.** If service members can take breaks, switch specialties, or customize their career paths, the military loses the reliability and predictability essential for force planning and unit readiness.
- **The current system works.** The U.S. military is the most capable fighting force in the world. The personnel system that produced this force should not be dismantled based on private-sector management fads.

### Their Influence

Military traditionalists have significant influence through the service culture itself. Proposed reforms must be implemented through the chain of command, and if senior leaders are unenthusiastic, implementation will be slow and incomplete. Retired generals and admirals who oppose reforms are frequently quoted in media and called to testify before Congress.

### Counter-Arguments

- Up-or-out drives out talent. The current system forces out many high-performing individuals who excel in their current roles but are not competitive for command-track promotion. This is particularly costly in technical fields where deep expertise is more valuable than breadth.
- Lateral entry is already happening informally. The services routinely commission direct-entry doctors, lawyers, chaplains, and cyber specialists. Expanding this model to other critical fields is an evolution, not a revolution.
- The civilian workforce has changed. The military's labor market competitors offer career flexibility as a standard feature. Refusing to adapt is not a sign of strength but of institutional rigidity.

## Anti-Militarism Advocates: Opposing Recruiting Expansion

### Who They Are

Progressive activists, peace organizations, some academic communities, and civil liberties groups who oppose expanding military recruiting on principled grounds. Key organizations include the American Friends Service Committee, CodePink, and various campus anti-militarism groups.

### Their Arguments

- **Targeting vulnerable populations.** Military recruiting concentrates on low-income communities and communities of color, offering economic opportunity as the primary incentive. This amounts to an "economic draft" that exploits inequality rather than addressing it.
- **Militarism vs. human needs.** Resources spent on military recruiting and compensation would be better directed toward education, healthcare, and poverty reduction -- addressing the root causes that make military service the best option for many young people.
- **JROTC and school access.** The military's presence in high schools through Junior ROTC and recruiter access (enabled by the No Child Left Behind Act's provision requiring schools to provide recruiter access) is inappropriate for minors who cannot yet enlist.
- **Environmental and human rights concerns.** Military operations cause environmental damage and, in some cases, contribute to human rights abuses. Expanding the force enables these harms.

### Their Influence

Anti-militarism advocates have limited direct influence on defense legislation but have been effective on college campuses (periodic efforts to bar military recruiters) and in shaping progressive discourse that may indirectly affect propensity to serve among younger Americans.

### Counter-Arguments

- The all-volunteer force is a civic institution. Military service is a choice, not coercion, and the military provides genuine opportunities for education, skills training, and social mobility.
- Reducing military recruiting does not reduce military commitments. If the nation maintains its strategic posture, a smaller force means either higher deployment tempo for those who do serve or a return to conscription.
- JROTC provides educational benefits. JROTC programs improve graduation rates and provide leadership development, and participation does not obligate military service.

## The Defense Industry: Selective Opposition

### Who They Are

Defense contractors and their trade associations (National Defense Industrial Association, Aerospace Industries Association) who generally support a strong military but may oppose specific personnel reforms that threaten their business model.

### Their Concerns

- **Reducing end strength to fund modernization.** Personnel reforms that reduce the size of the force could reduce demand for equipment, maintenance, and support services.
- **Shifting spending from procurement to pay.** Every dollar directed to pay raises is a dollar not spent on weapons systems and services contracts.
- **Civilian credential recognition.** If military-to-civilian credential translation improves, defense contractors may face more competition for hiring veterans, potentially driving up their own labor costs.

### Their Influence

Defense industry influence on personnel policy is indirect but significant. Contractors have extensive lobbying operations, are major campaign donors, and employ many former military personnel and congressional staff.
