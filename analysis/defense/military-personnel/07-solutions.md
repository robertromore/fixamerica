# Military Personnel: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the military's personnel crisis requires reforms across recruiting, compensation, family support, talent management, and institutional culture. No single intervention will solve the problem. The solutions presented here are organized by domain and designed to be mutually reinforcing -- improving the value proposition of military service from recruitment through retirement.

## Recruiting Modernization

### Expand the Eligible Population

The most effective long-term recruiting strategy is to increase the number of Americans who qualify for service:

- **Future Soldier Preparatory Course expansion.** The Army's program that helps recruits who narrowly miss academic or fitness standards prepare for basic training has shown promising results. Scale this model across all services, with programs tailored to the specific eligibility gaps of each applicant (fitness, academics, or both).
- **Marijuana policy modernization.** Align military drug testing timelines with the reality of state-level legalization. Adopt a "look-forward" policy that disqualifies applicants only for active drug use, not distant past use, and reduce the disqualification period for prior marijuana use to 90 days. Maintain zero-tolerance for active-duty use.
- **Mental health waiver reform.** Streamline and accelerate the waiver process for applicants with a history of treated mental health conditions that are in remission. The current process can take months and discourages applicants. Establish clear, evidence-based criteria under which conditions like managed ADHD, past mild depression, or resolved anxiety are not disqualifying.
- **ASVAB preparation programs.** Fund free ASVAB preparation resources (online courses, tutoring, practice exams) available through high schools and community organizations, particularly in communities with low military familiarity.

### Modernize Recruiting Operations

- **Digital-first recruiting.** Shift the recruiting model from a walk-in recruiter office paradigm to a digital-first approach using social media, targeted online advertising, virtual career fairs, and AI-assisted applicant engagement. The recruiter's role should shift from cold-calling to relationship management of leads generated through digital channels.
- **Recruiter selection and training.** Select recruiters based on communication skills and cultural fluency with the target demographic, not solely on their combat record. Provide training in digital marketing, social media engagement, and consultative sales techniques.
- **Marketing budget increase.** Increase the services' combined marketing and advertising budgets (currently approximately $1.2 billion annually) by at least 25 percent, with the majority of the increase directed toward digital and social media channels.
- **Community engagement.** Expand military presence in underrepresented urban and suburban communities through community service events, STEM education partnerships, and liaison programs that build familiarity without hard-sell recruiting pressure.

### Lateral Entry Programs

- **Cyber and technology lateral entry.** Create a formalized pathway for experienced civilian professionals in cybersecurity, software engineering, data science, artificial intelligence, and space operations to enter military service at ranks commensurate with their experience (E-5 to E-7 for enlisted; O-3 to O-4 for officers), with abbreviated military training focused on military customs, fitness, and operational context.
- **Medical professional direct commissioning expansion.** Expand existing direct commissioning programs for physicians, nurses, psychologists, and other healthcare professionals with streamlined application processes and competitive financial incentives.
- **Pilot programs in critical specialties.** Establish pilot lateral entry programs in acquisition, logistics, and intelligence, with evaluation criteria established before implementation and rigorous assessment after 3 years.

## Compensation Reform

### Pay Competitiveness

- **Targeted pay raises for critical specialties.** Supplement the across-the-board annual pay raise with targeted special duty assignment pay and retention bonuses for occupational specialties experiencing critical shortages (cyber, aviation, nuclear, medical). These targeted pays should be adjusted annually based on civilian salary benchmarking data.
- **Location-based pay adjustment.** Create a supplemental location pay factor for high-cost duty stations that accounts for cost-of-living differences not fully captured by BAH. This would reduce the financial penalty associated with assignments to expensive metropolitan areas.
- **Performance-based pay.** Pilot performance-based pay bonuses at the unit level, rewarding units and individuals who demonstrate superior readiness, training completion, and retention. This would require developing validated performance metrics that go beyond subjective evaluations.

### Benefits Modernization

- **BAH reform.** Recalculate the Basic Allowance for Housing annually using real-time rental market data (rather than lagging surveys), and increase the BAH rate to cover at least the median (50th percentile) rental rate for the appropriate housing type in each location.
- **BRS enhancement.** Increase the government matching contribution to the Thrift Savings Plan from 5 percent to 8 percent of basic pay for service members who continue past their initial obligation, strengthening the mid-career retention incentive.
- **Continuation pay flexibility.** Make the BRS continuation pay (currently a one-time payment at 12 years of service) available at additional career decision points (8 years, 16 years) to provide retention incentives at critical junctures.
- **Basic Needs Allowance expansion.** Raise the BNA income threshold from 150 percent to 200 percent of the federal poverty level and simplify the application process to ensure that no military family qualifies for SNAP or other means-tested federal assistance.

## Housing Improvements

### Privatized Housing Reform

- **Enforceable tenant protections.** Strengthen the military tenant bill of rights with enforceable penalties for housing companies that fail to meet maintenance standards. Give installation commanders the authority to withhold BAH payments or impose fines for documented performance failures.
- **Independent inspection regime.** Establish an independent military housing inspection program (not controlled by the housing company or the installation) with annual inspections and public reporting of results for every installation.
- **Withhold and escrow.** Give service members the legal right to escrow their BAH payment when documented maintenance failures are not remediated within 30 days, with the escrowed funds released only upon certified completion of repairs.
- **Contract renegotiation.** Congress should direct DoD to renegotiate existing 50-year MHPI contracts to incorporate performance standards, enforceable penalties, and government exit rights. Where renegotiation fails, explore legal options for contract modification.

### Barracks Investment

- **Accelerated barracks renovation.** Fund a 10-year, $15 billion barracks modernization program to eliminate the deferred maintenance backlog and bring all unaccompanied housing to modern standards, including individual climate control, adequate storage, and common area amenities.
- **Single-soldier quality of life.** Redesign barracks standards to reflect that junior enlisted personnel are adults entitled to a reasonable standard of living, including private rooms for E-4 and above and semi-private rooms for E-1 through E-3.

## Military Family Support

### Spouse Employment

- **Federal license reciprocity mandate.** Enact legislation requiring that any state-issued professional license held by a military spouse be recognized by any other state to which the service member is transferred under PCS orders, with no additional testing, fees, or waiting periods. This should cover nursing, teaching, law, counseling, real estate, cosmetology, and all other licensed professions.
- **Federal telework preference.** Require federal agencies to provide hiring preference and telework eligibility to qualified military spouses for positions that can be performed remotely, enabling spouses to maintain continuous employment regardless of PCS moves.
- **Spouse employment pilot programs.** Fund pilot programs that connect military spouses with employers who commit to remote-work positions, portable careers, and guaranteed re-hire after PCS moves.

### Childcare Expansion

- **Universal childcare on installations.** Fund the construction of additional Child Development Centers to eliminate waitlists at all military installations within 5 years. Target a ratio of available childcare slots to children under 6 of at least 1:1 for all installation-resident families.
- **Expanded fee assistance.** Increase the childcare fee assistance program for families using off-installation childcare to cover up to 80 percent of local market-rate childcare costs, with the subsidy available to all military families regardless of income.
- **24/7 childcare options.** Establish extended-hour and overnight childcare at major installations to support service members working non-standard hours, shifts, or short-notice deployments.

### PCS Reform

- **Increase reimbursement.** Raise the Dislocation Allowance and PCS reimbursement rates to cover actual documented moving costs, eliminating the out-of-pocket burden on families.
- **Reduce move frequency.** Direct the services to extend average assignment lengths from 2-3 years to 3-4 years where operationally feasible, reducing the frequency of disruptive moves.
- **Advance travel pay.** Provide PCS travel advances as a standard entitlement (not a loan) to ensure families are not financially strained during the transition between duty stations.

## Talent Management Reform

### Modernize the Personnel System

- **Reform up-or-out.** Amend the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) to allow officers in designated specialties (cyber, acquisition, intelligence, medical, legal, engineering) to serve at their current grade beyond the current "pass-over" limits, provided they meet performance standards. Create a "technical track" that allows deep specialization as an alternative to the command track.
- **Flexible career paths.** Establish a formal "career intermission" program across all services, allowing service members to take 1-3 year breaks for education, family care, or personal development, with guaranteed return to service at the same rank. The Navy's Career Intermission Program has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach.
- **Talent marketplace.** Expand the Army Talent Alignment Process (ATAP) model across all services, using a marketplace system where units post their needs and service members apply for assignments, replacing the opaque, centralized assignment process.
- **Individual Development Accounts.** Create individual professional development accounts for each service member, funded at $2,000-$5,000 per year, usable for civilian certifications, graduate courses, technical training, or language study that enhances the member's value to the force.

### Improved Transition Assistance

- **Start earlier.** Require transition planning to begin at least 18 months before anticipated separation, with the first 6 months focused on career exploration and skills assessment, and the subsequent 12 months on concrete preparation (resume building, credential translation, networking, job placement).
- **Credential translation.** Fund a comprehensive military-to-civilian credential mapping program that works with civilian licensing bodies and industry certification organizations to establish formal equivalencies between military training and civilian credentials. A service member who has maintained nuclear reactors, managed logistics for 500 soldiers, or provided emergency medical care should not need to start from scratch in civilian certification programs.
- **Guaranteed interview programs.** Expand partnerships with major employers committed to interviewing and hiring transitioning service members, with DoD providing pre-screened, skills-matched candidate pools.

## Mental Health and Well-Being

### Expand Access

- **Behavioral health workforce.** Fund a 50 percent increase in military behavioral health positions (psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors) and offer competitive recruitment bonuses and loan repayment to fill existing vacancies.
- **Embedded behavioral health.** Expand the Army's Embedded Behavioral Health model -- placing therapists directly in brigade and battalion areas rather than in separate clinics -- across all services. Physical proximity reduces the barrier to seeking care.
- **Telehealth expansion.** Provide confidential telehealth mental health services to all service members and family members, accessible 24/7, with no appointment required for initial assessment. Ensure that telehealth visits carry the same confidentiality protections as in-person care.

### Reduce Stigma

- **Confidentiality reform.** Strengthen confidentiality protections so that routine mental health care (counseling for relationship issues, stress management, adjustment difficulties) cannot be accessed by commanders or factored into security clearance decisions. Only conditions that directly impair a service member's ability to perform duties or handle weapons should trigger command notification.
- **Leader education.** Require all officers and NCOs to complete annual mental health leadership training that includes recognizing warning signs, facilitating referrals, and modeling help-seeking behavior. Leaders who personally seek mental health support should be highlighted as examples, not treated as damaged.
- **Firearms safety.** Implement voluntary lethal means counseling and temporary personal firearm storage programs on installations, modeled on successful civilian community programs, to reduce impulsive suicides.
