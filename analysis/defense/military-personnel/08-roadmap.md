# Military Personnel: Reform Roadmap

## Overview

Reforming military personnel policy requires a phased approach that sequences actions based on urgency, political feasibility, and implementation complexity. The recruiting crisis demands immediate action, but deeper structural reforms -- to the personnel management system, housing infrastructure, and family support programs -- require sustained investment over years. This roadmap organizes reforms into three phases: immediate stabilization (Years 1-2), structural modernization (Years 3-5), and institutional transformation (Years 6-10).

---

## Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization (Years 1-2)

This phase addresses the most urgent problems -- recruiting shortfalls, housing conditions, and family hardship -- through actions that can be taken within existing authorities or through the annual NDAA and appropriations process.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Scale Preparatory Programs** | Expand Future Soldier Preparatory Course and equivalents across all services. Fund capacity for 15,000 participants per year. | At least 8,000 additional recruits per year enter service through preparatory programs. |
| **2. Marijuana Policy Update** | Reduce the disqualification period for prior marijuana use to 90 days; streamline waiver processing. | Waiver processing time reduced from 60+ days to 14 days; 5,000+ additional eligible applicants per year. |
| **3. Emergency Housing Repairs** | Direct $3 billion in supplemental appropriations for the highest-priority repairs in privatized and barracks housing. | 10,000 units brought to acceptable condition within 18 months. |
| **4. Childcare Waitlist Reduction** | Fund construction of 50 additional or expanded Child Development Centers at installations with the longest waitlists. | Waitlist reduced by 50% within 2 years. |
| **5. Spouse License Reciprocity** | Pass federal legislation requiring interstate license recognition for military spouses. | All 50 states recognize military spouse licenses within 12 months of enactment. |
| **6. Pay Raise Plus Targeted Bonuses** | Enact a pay raise at or above the Employment Cost Index, plus increased bonuses for cyber, aviation, nuclear, and medical specialties. | All services meet or exceed FY2027 recruiting targets; critical-specialty retention improves by 5 percentage points. |
| **7. Mental Health Workforce Surge** | Fund 2,000 additional behavioral health positions across DoD with competitive recruitment incentives. | Behavioral health vacancy rate reduced from 20% to 10%. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Stabilize recruiting, address the worst housing and childcare deficits, and demonstrate to the force and the public that Congress and DoD take personnel issues seriously.

## Phase 2: Structural Modernization (Years 3-5)

This phase implements deeper reforms to the compensation system, talent management framework, and family support infrastructure.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. DOPMA Reform** | Amend the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act to create technical career tracks, extend tenure limits for specialists, and authorize lateral entry at mid-career ranks. | At least 500 lateral entrants per year in cyber, technology, and medical fields. |
| **2. Location-Based Pay** | Implement a supplemental location pay factor for the 25 highest-cost duty stations. | Service members at high-cost stations report improved financial well-being in DoD survey data. |
| **3. Barracks Modernization Program** | Authorize and fund the first 5 years of a 10-year, $15 billion barracks renovation program. | 30% of substandard barracks brought to new standards by end of Year 5. |
| **4. Universal Installation Childcare** | Complete Phase 1 construction and begin Phase 2, targeting full elimination of childcare waitlists at all major installations. | Waitlists eliminated at 75% of installations. |
| **5. Transition Overhaul** | Implement 18-month transition timeline, credential mapping program, and employer partnership pipeline. | 90% of separating service members complete TAP at least 6 months before separation; veteran unemployment rate for 18-24 age group equals or is below civilian peers. |
| **6. Digital Recruiting Platform** | Complete development and fielding of a unified digital recruiting platform with AI-assisted applicant engagement, online application processing, and virtual career exploration. | 40% of all recruiting leads generated through digital channels. |
| **7. Privatized Housing Accountability** | Renegotiate MHPI contracts with enforceable performance standards; implement independent inspection regime. | Housing satisfaction scores improve by 20% in annual resident surveys. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Transform the structural systems -- pay, promotion, housing, childcare, transition -- that determine whether military service is a competitive career option for the next generation.

## Phase 3: Institutional Transformation (Years 6-10)

This phase focuses on sustaining reforms, measuring their effects, and making the deeper cultural and institutional changes that ensure lasting improvement.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Talent Marketplace Across Services** | Implement assignment marketplace systems in all services, giving service members meaningful choice in their assignments while meeting mission requirements. | 80% of assignments processed through marketplace system; member satisfaction with assignments improves by 30%. |
| **2. Flexible Career Paths** | Career intermission, part-time service, and sabbatical programs are available across all services with participation rates that demonstrate institutional acceptance. | At least 2,000 service members per year use career intermission or flexible service options; 90% return rate. |
| **3. Mental Health Culture Shift** | Help-seeking rates increase across the force. Confidentiality reforms and leader training have reduced stigma to the point that mental health care is normalized. | Help-seeking rates increase by 50%; active-duty suicide rate declines to within 10% of civilian age-adjusted rate. |
| **4. Barracks Completion** | Complete the 10-year barracks modernization program. | 100% of barracks meet updated standards. |
| **5. Recruiting Pipeline Sustainability** | The combination of expanded eligibility, digital recruiting, community engagement, and improved quality of life produces a sustainable recruiting pipeline. | All services meet recruiting targets for 5 consecutive years without lowering standards or depleting the DEP. |
| **6. Compensation Competitiveness Review** | Conduct a comprehensive review of total military compensation against the 70th percentile civilian benchmark, adjusting pay, benefits, and retirement as needed. | Independent CBO assessment confirms total military compensation meets or exceeds the 70th percentile benchmark. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: The military's personnel system is a strategic asset -- attracting, developing, and retaining the talent needed for 21st-century national defense, while supporting service members and their families with a quality of life that reflects the value of their service.

## Critical Dependencies

- **Congressional Commitment**: Most reforms require NDAA authorization and appropriations. A multi-year bipartisan commitment to personnel investment is essential.
- **Service Implementation**: DoD and the services must implement reforms with genuine commitment, not bureaucratic compliance. Senior leader buy-in is critical.
- **State Cooperation**: Spouse license reciprocity requires state legislative action or federal preemption.
- **Housing Industry Cooperation**: Privatized housing reform requires renegotiation with private companies that hold 50-year contracts.
- **Public Health Progress**: The eligible population will not expand unless civilian public health (obesity, drug policy, mental health) also improves.
