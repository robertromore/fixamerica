# Military Personnel: Overview

## Overview

The all-volunteer force is the foundation of American military power. Since the end of conscription in 1973, the United States has relied on its ability to recruit, retain, compensate, and support an entirely volunteer military workforce of approximately 2.1 million active-duty and reserve personnel. This model has produced the most capable fighting force in history -- but it is now under severe strain. The military is facing its worst recruiting crisis since the all-volunteer force began, with every service except the Marine Corps and Space Force missing recruiting targets in recent years. The Army alone fell short of its FY2023 recruiting goal by approximately 10,000 soldiers, a shortfall of roughly 15 percent.

The recruiting crisis is not merely a marketing problem. It reflects a convergence of structural challenges: a shrinking pool of eligible Americans (only 23 percent of 17-to-24-year-olds meet military qualification standards), a historically competitive civilian labor market, declining veteran connectivity (fewer than 1 percent of Americans serve), and a generational shift in how young people view institutions and career paths. Simultaneously, those already serving face persistent quality-of-life challenges -- substandard military housing, inadequate childcare, frequent relocations that devastate spousal careers, and a mental health crisis reflected in historically elevated suicide rates.

Military personnel policy must address both sides of this equation: attracting new talent into service and ensuring those who serve are compensated fairly, housed adequately, and supported through the unique demands of military life.

## Scope

This analysis covers the human capital dimensions of U.S. defense policy:

- **Recruiting**: The crisis in military recruiting, including eligibility barriers, propensity trends, recruiter capacity, and marketing effectiveness.
- **Retention**: Why service members stay or leave, including the role of deployment tempo, career satisfaction, and alternative civilian opportunities.
- **Compensation and Benefits**: The military pay system (basic pay, Basic Allowance for Housing, Basic Allowance for Subsistence, special and incentive pays), retirement reform (Blended Retirement System), healthcare (TRICARE), and how total military compensation compares to civilian equivalents.
- **Military Families**: The challenges facing military spouses (unemployment, license portability), military children (school transitions), and family readiness programs.
- **Housing**: On-base and privatized military housing conditions, the Basic Allowance for Housing formula, and persistent maintenance failures.
- **Childcare**: The capacity and quality of Child Development Centers on military installations and the gap between demand and availability.
- **Diversity and Inclusion**: The demographic composition of the force, representation in leadership, and the impact of policies on women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ service members.
- **Transition to Civilian Life**: The effectiveness of the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) and the broader challenge of translating military skills to civilian careers.
- **Mental Health and Well-Being**: Suicide prevention, access to behavioral health services, and the stigma surrounding mental health care in military culture.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total Active-Duty End Strength (FY2024) | ~1,328,000 | DoD, 2024 |
| Total Selected Reserve End Strength | ~799,500 | DoD, 2024 |
| Army FY2023 Recruiting Shortfall | ~10,000 (of 65,000 goal) | Army, 2023 |
| Navy FY2023 Recruiting Shortfall | ~6,000 | Navy, 2023 |
| Youth Eligible for Military Service | ~23% of 17-24 age cohort | DoD, 2023 |
| Youth Propensity to Serve | ~9% (historic low) | DoD Joint Advertising Market Research & Studies, 2023 |
| E-5 with Dependents Annual Regular Military Compensation | ~$72,000 | CBO, 2024 |
| Military Spouse Unemployment Rate | ~21% | Blue Star Families, 2023 |
| Active-Duty Suicides (FY2022) | 492 | DoD Annual Suicide Report, 2023 |
| Military Children Experiencing School Changes | 6-9 moves during K-12 | Military Child Education Coalition, 2023 |
| Privatized Housing Units Requiring Major Repair | ~28,000 | GAO, 2023 |
| Child Development Center Waitlist | ~9,000 children | DoD, 2023 |

## Core Tensions

- **Quantity vs. Quality**: Lowering standards to meet recruiting numbers risks degrading force quality, while maintaining standards risks perpetuating shortfalls.
- **Compensation vs. Fiscal Constraints**: Service members deserve competitive pay and benefits, but personnel costs already consume approximately one-third of the defense budget, crowding out modernization.
- **Readiness vs. Quality of Life**: High deployment tempo sustains readiness but degrades family stability, mental health, and retention.
- **Tradition vs. Adaptation**: Military culture values uniformity and hierarchy, but attracting a diverse, tech-savvy generation requires flexibility in career paths, appearance standards, and work-life balance.
- **Military Exceptionalism vs. Civilian Parity**: The military demands sacrifices that justify special benefits, but an ever-widening gap between military and civilian compensation and work expectations creates unsustainable fiscal pressure.
- **Centralized Personnel Management vs. Talent Marketplace**: The legacy "up-or-out" system treats people as interchangeable, while modern talent management demands individualized career development.

## Key Questions

1. Can the all-volunteer force sustain the end strength required by the National Defense Strategy without fundamental changes to recruiting, eligibility, or compensation?
2. Is military compensation competitive enough to attract and retain the talent the force needs, particularly in high-demand fields like cyber, space, and medicine?
3. How should the military modernize its personnel management system to compete with private-sector talent practices while maintaining the unique requirements of military service?
4. What level of investment in military family support -- housing, childcare, spouse employment -- is necessary to sustain retention in an era when dual-income households are the norm?
5. Can the military's mental health crisis be addressed within the existing culture, or does it require a fundamental shift in how the institution approaches psychological well-being?

## Vision of Success

A successful military personnel policy would:

- **Sustain Recruiting**: Every service consistently meets its recruiting targets without lowering standards, drawing from a broad and diverse applicant pool that reflects the nation it defends.
- **Retain Critical Talent**: Mid-career retention rates in critical specialties (cyber, intelligence, medicine, special operations) match or exceed historical benchmarks, with service members choosing to stay because the military offers a compelling career, not just because they lack alternatives.
- **Compensate Fairly**: Total military compensation is competitive with the 70th percentile of comparable civilian employment, with the pay and benefits system transparent, predictable, and responsive to market conditions.
- **Support Families**: Military spouses have access to portable careers, affordable childcare, and quality housing. Military children experience educational continuity. No military family relies on food assistance programs.
- **Manage Talent Effectively**: The personnel system matches individual skills and preferences to organizational needs, offers flexible career paths, and promotes based on merit and potential rather than rigid time-in-grade requirements.
- **Protect Well-Being**: Suicide rates decline to or below civilian age-adjusted norms. Service members access mental health care without stigma or career penalty. The force is physically and psychologically resilient.
