# Military Personnel: Current State

## The Recruiting Crisis

The U.S. military is experiencing its most severe recruiting crisis since the transition to the all-volunteer force in 1973. Multiple services have missed their recruiting targets in consecutive fiscal years, and the pipeline of future recruits -- as measured by the Delayed Entry Program (DEP) -- has been depleted to historically low levels.

### Recruiting Results by Service (FY2022-FY2024)

| Service | FY2022 Goal | FY2022 Actual | FY2023 Goal | FY2023 Actual | FY2024 Goal | FY2024 Actual |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Army | 60,000 | 45,000 | 65,000 | 55,000 | 55,000 | ~55,300 |
| Navy | 37,700 | 33,400 | 37,700 | 31,800 | 40,600 | ~30,800 |
| Air Force | 26,877 | 26,877 | 26,877 | 26,877 | 27,100 | ~27,100 |
| Marine Corps | 33,000 | 31,100 | 31,100 | 31,000 | 31,650 | ~31,700 |
| Space Force | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 1,000 | ~1,000 |

*Sources: Service recruiting commands; Congressional Research Service, "Military Recruiting: Frequently Asked Questions," 2024.*

The Army missed its FY2022 target by 25 percent and its FY2023 target by approximately 15 percent before adjusting its FY2024 goal downward. The Navy has experienced persistent shortfalls. The Air Force and Marine Corps have generally met targets, though the Air Force achieved this partly by drawing down its DEP and the Marine Corps by reducing its end-strength goal. The Army lowered its FY2024 goal and met it through intensive use of the Future Soldier Preparatory Course, which helps otherwise-ineligible candidates meet academic and fitness standards.

### Propensity to Serve

The percentage of young Americans reporting a propensity to serve in the military has declined significantly:

- In 2004, approximately 16 percent of youth aged 16-21 expressed a positive propensity to serve.
- By 2023, that figure had declined to approximately 9 percent, the lowest level ever recorded by the DoD Joint Advertising, Market Research, and Studies (JAMRS) program.
- Among youth who are both eligible and have propensity, the effective recruiting market is estimated at fewer than 400,000 individuals annually for a military that needs to recruit approximately 150,000 per year.

### Eligibility Barriers

Only approximately 23 percent of Americans aged 17-24 meet the military's qualification standards without a waiver. The primary disqualifying factors are:

| Disqualifying Factor | Estimated Disqualification Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Overweight/Obesity | ~31% of 17-24 cohort | CDC, 2023 |
| Drug Use (including marijuana) | ~9% | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Medical/Physical Conditions | ~7% | DoD, 2023 |
| Mental Health Conditions | ~8% | DoD, 2023 |
| Criminal History | ~5% | DoD, 2023 |
| Aptitude (ASVAB below minimum) | ~10% | DoD, 2023 |
| Multiple Disqualifiers (overlap) | Significant overlap among categories | DoD, 2023 |

*Note: Categories overlap significantly; the aggregate does not equal a simple sum.*

## Retention

Retention presents a more mixed picture than recruiting. Overall retention rates remain adequate for most occupational specialties, but critical shortages exist in specific career fields.

### First-Term Retention (Percentage Completing First Enlistment)

| Service | Retention Rate | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| Army | ~52% | Stable |
| Navy | ~53% | Slight decline |
| Air Force | ~60% | Stable |
| Marine Corps | ~45% | Stable |

### Critical Shortage Areas

The services consistently struggle to retain personnel in the following fields:

- **Cyber Operations**: Private-sector salaries for cybersecurity professionals average $120,000-$180,000, far exceeding military compensation for equivalent skill levels. The Army Cyber branch reports retention rates approximately 15 percentage points below the Army average.
- **Aviation (Pilots)**: The commercial airline industry's ongoing pilot shortage has driven airline starting salaries above $100,000 with major airlines offering first-year compensation packages exceeding $200,000. Military pilot retention bonuses (up to $35,000 per year) have not closed the gap.
- **Medical Professionals**: Military physicians and nurses face a growing pay gap with civilian healthcare, particularly in specialties like surgery and emergency medicine.
- **Special Operations**: High deployment tempo and operational stress have driven increased attrition in special operations forces.
- **Nuclear-Trained Sailors**: The Navy's nuclear propulsion program competes directly with civilian nuclear energy and has historically required large retention bonuses (up to $100,000) to maintain critical manning levels.

## Compensation

Military compensation is a complex system combining multiple pay elements. The total package is designed to be competitive with civilian compensation at the 70th percentile of comparable employment, though analyses differ on whether this target is met.

### Military Pay Components

| Component | Description | FY2024 Example (E-5, 6 years service) |
|---|---|---|
| Basic Pay | Primary salary, based on rank and years of service | $38,596/year |
| Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) | Tax-free housing allowance, varies by location and dependents | ~$22,000/year (national average, with dependents) |
| Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) | Tax-free food allowance | $4,766/year (enlisted) |
| Special and Incentive Pays | Hazardous duty, flight pay, foreign language, enlistment/re-enlistment bonuses | Varies widely |
| Tax Advantage | BAH and BAS are not subject to federal income tax | ~$4,000-$6,000/year equivalent |
| Healthcare (TRICARE) | Free or low-cost healthcare for member and dependents | Valued at ~$14,000/year |
| Retirement (BRS) | Blended Retirement System: defined benefit (2% x years x high-36 average) plus TSP match | Vests after 20 years (reduced benefit at 2 years via TSP) |

### Regular Military Compensation by Rank (FY2024 Estimates)

| Rank | Years of Service | Basic Pay | BAH (avg) | BAS | Tax Advantage | Total RMC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E-4 (Specialist/Corporal) | 3 | $32,000 | $19,800 | $4,766 | $3,500 | ~$60,000 |
| E-5 (Sergeant) | 6 | $38,600 | $22,000 | $4,766 | $4,200 | ~$69,600 |
| E-7 (Sergeant First Class) | 14 | $52,000 | $25,200 | $4,766 | $5,400 | ~$87,400 |
| O-3 (Captain) | 6 | $65,800 | $26,400 | $3,282 | $5,800 | ~$101,300 |
| O-5 (Lieutenant Colonel) | 18 | $97,200 | $30,000 | $3,282 | $6,800 | ~$137,300 |

*Sources: Defense Finance and Accounting Service pay tables; CBO, "Approaches to Changing Military Compensation," 2024.*

### Pay Raises

The annual military pay raise is tied by law to the Employment Cost Index (ECI) unless Congress legislates otherwise. Recent pay raises:

| Fiscal Year | Pay Raise | ECI Benchmark |
|---|---|---|
| FY2022 | 2.7% | 2.7% |
| FY2023 | 4.6% | 4.6% |
| FY2024 | 5.2% | 5.2% |

While these raises matched the ECI, critics argue they lagged behind actual inflation during the 2022-2023 inflationary surge, eroding real purchasing power.

## Military Families

Approximately 52 percent of active-duty service members have dependents (spouse, children, or both). The unique demands of military life create distinct challenges for families.

### Military Spouse Employment

Military spouses face chronic underemployment and unemployment:

- The unemployment rate for military spouses is approximately 21 percent, compared to approximately 3.5 percent for the general population (Blue Star Families, 2023).
- Among employed military spouses, 55 percent report being underemployed -- working in positions below their education or experience level.
- The primary drivers are frequent relocations (PCS moves averaging every 2-3 years) and state-by-state professional licensing requirements that do not transfer across state lines.
- Occupations most affected include nursing, teaching, cosmetology, law, counseling, and real estate -- all requiring state-specific licenses.

### Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Moves

The average military family moves every 2-3 years. PCS moves impose significant financial and emotional costs:

| PCS Cost Category | Average Impact |
|---|---|
| Out-of-pocket expenses beyond reimbursement | $2,000-$5,000 per move |
| Spouse career disruption | ~$4,500/year in lost wages |
| Child school transitions | 6-9 school changes during K-12 |
| Housing market losses (buying/selling in short cycles) | Varies; often $10,000+ |

The Dislocation Allowance (DLA), designed to offset PCS costs, has not kept pace with actual moving expenses. Many families report that PCS moves are a net financial loss.

### Childcare

The Department of Defense operates the largest employer-sponsored childcare system in the world, yet demand consistently exceeds capacity:

- DoD Child Development Centers (CDCs) serve approximately 200,000 children.
- An estimated 9,000 children are on waitlists across all installations (DoD, 2023).
- Average waitlist times range from 3 months to over 12 months depending on location.
- Fees are income-based and subsidized, ranging from $47 to $176 per week per child, significantly below civilian rates.
- Many military families, particularly those at installations with long waitlists, rely on off-installation childcare that can cost $1,000-$2,000 per month per child.

### Food Insecurity

Despite improvements, food insecurity persists among some military families:

- The Basic Needs Allowance (BNA), established in 2022, provides supplemental payments to service members whose household income falls below 150 percent of the federal poverty level.
- Approximately 2,000 service members received BNA payments in FY2023, though advocacy groups estimate that food insecurity affects a larger population not captured by the BNA eligibility formula.
- The Military Family Advisory Network's 2023 survey found that approximately 14 percent of military families reported some level of food insecurity.

## Housing

Military housing falls into three categories: barracks (unaccompanied), government-owned family housing, and privatized family housing managed by private companies under 50-year leases.

### Privatized Military Housing

Beginning in 1996, the Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) transferred most on-base family housing to private developers. The program was intended to improve housing quality through private investment, but has been plagued by problems:

- GAO identified approximately 28,000 units in need of major repair or renovation across the privatized housing portfolio (GAO-23-105377).
- Recurring complaints include mold, lead paint, pest infestations, inadequate HVAC, and slow maintenance response times.
- A tenant bill of rights was established in 2020 but enforcement mechanisms remain weak. Service members report retaliation for filing complaints.
- The DoD Inspector General found that military departments lacked adequate oversight of private housing companies and did not consistently hold them accountable for performance failures.

### Barracks Conditions

Unaccompanied housing (barracks) for junior enlisted personnel has received increased scrutiny:

- The Army identified approximately $1.5 billion in deferred barracks maintenance.
- Incidents of mold, pest infestations, non-functional HVAC, and structural deficiencies have been widely documented.
- The FY2024 and FY2025 NDAAs included significant increases in barracks funding, but the backlog remains substantial.

## Diversity

The military's demographic composition has evolved significantly but remains uneven across ranks and branches.

### Active-Duty Demographics (FY2023)

| Demographic Category | Enlisted | Officers | Civilian Comparison |
|---|---|---|---|
| Women | 17.5% | 19.8% | 50.4% of labor force |
| Black/African American | 17.8% | 9.1% | 12.6% of labor force |
| Hispanic/Latino | 18.3% | 8.8% | 18.9% of labor force |
| Asian | 4.7% | 5.8% | 6.7% of labor force |
| White | 52.4% | 72.3% | 58.4% of labor force |

*Sources: DoD Demographics Report, 2023; Bureau of Labor Statistics.*

Key observations:

- Women constitute approximately 17.5 percent of the active-duty enlisted force and 19.8 percent of officers, but are underrepresented in combat arms branches and senior leadership. Only 8 of 43 four-star generals/admirals are women as of 2024.
- Black Americans are well-represented in the enlisted force but significantly underrepresented among officers, particularly at the general/flag officer level.
- Hispanic Americans are underrepresented in both the enlisted and officer corps relative to their share of the overall population.
- The senior enlisted and officer ranks remain disproportionately white and male compared to the junior enlisted force.

### LGBTQ+ Service

Following the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" in 2011 and the lifting of the transgender service ban in 2021, LGBTQ+ individuals serve openly. Key metrics:

- An estimated 6,000-15,000 transgender individuals currently serve in the military (Palm Center, 2023).
- Unit cohesion concerns that were raised prior to both policy changes have not materialized according to RAND Corporation studies and DoD assessments.
- Ongoing challenges include inconsistent access to gender-affirming healthcare across military treatment facilities and the absence of legal protections in some states where service members are stationed.

## Mental Health and Suicide

Military mental health remains a critical concern. The DoD Annual Suicide Report documented 492 active-duty suicides in FY2022, following 519 in FY2021.

### Active-Duty Suicide Rates (per 100,000)

| Year | Active-Duty Rate | U.S. General Population (age-adjusted) |
|---|---|---|
| 2015 | 20.2 | 13.3 |
| 2018 | 24.8 | 14.2 |
| 2020 | 28.7 | 13.5 |
| 2022 | 25.1 | 14.3 (est.) |

*Sources: DoD Annual Suicide Report, 2023; CDC WISQARS.*

Key findings:

- Enlisted personnel under age 30 have the highest suicide rates.
- Firearms are the most common method, accounting for approximately 65 percent of military suicides.
- Risk factors include relationship problems, financial stress, legal issues, and prior mental health conditions. Deployment history alone is not a consistent predictor.
- Stigma remains a significant barrier to seeking care. A 2023 RAND study found that approximately 40 percent of service members who screened positive for a mental health condition did not seek treatment, citing concerns about career impact.
- The military mental health workforce is understaffed. DoD behavioral health positions have a vacancy rate of approximately 20 percent.

## Transition to Civilian Life

Approximately 200,000 service members transition out of the military each year. The Transition Assistance Program (TAP), mandated by law, provides pre-separation counseling, employment workshops, and benefits briefings.

### TAP Effectiveness

- Participation in TAP is mandatory, but compliance with the requirement to begin at least 365 days before separation is inconsistent. Only approximately 50 percent of separating service members complete TAP at least 90 days before their separation date.
- The program has been criticized for being too generic and too compressed. A five-day workshop cannot adequately prepare someone with 10-20 years of military service for a fundamentally different employment environment.
- Veteran unemployment rates are generally comparable to or lower than civilian rates overall, but veterans aged 18-24 experience higher unemployment than their civilian peers.
- The translation of military skills to civilian credentials remains a significant barrier. Military training in fields like logistics, healthcare, and electronics often meets or exceeds civilian certification standards but is not recognized by civilian licensing bodies.
