# Military Personnel: Actions

## Overview

Improving military personnel policy requires action from citizens, communities, and organizations. While Congress and DoD are the primary decision-makers, public awareness, advocacy, and community engagement play critical roles in building the political will for reform and directly supporting service members and their families.

## What Citizens Can Do

### Learn and Understand

- **Understand the all-volunteer force.** Fewer than 1 percent of Americans serve. Most citizens have limited understanding of military compensation, housing conditions, family challenges, or recruiting dynamics. Reading even one comprehensive report (such as the Blue Star Families Military Family Lifestyle Survey or a CBO military compensation analysis) provides a foundation for informed advocacy.
- **Visit a military installation.** Many installations host open houses, job fairs, and community events. Attending these events builds familiarity with military life and reduces the civil-military gap.
- **Talk to service members and veterans.** Personal stories communicate the reality of military life more effectively than statistics. If you know someone who serves or has served, ask about their experience.

### Advocate

- **Contact your elected representatives.** Call, write, or email your senators and House member about military personnel issues:
    - Urge support for competitive military pay raises.
    - Advocate for military spouse license reciprocity legislation.
    - Demand accountability for privatized military housing.
    - Support funding for military childcare and barracks improvements.
    - Push for mental health workforce expansion and stigma reduction.
- **Testify or submit written statements.** When Congress holds hearings on military personnel issues, citizens can submit written statements for the record through the committee websites.
- **Engage at the state level.** Military spouse license reciprocity, veteran credential recognition, and state tax policy for military families are all state-level issues. Contact state legislators and governors' offices.
- **Support nonpartisan military advocacy organizations.** Organizations like Blue Star Families, MOAA, and the National Military Family Association rely on public support to amplify their policy recommendations.

### Support Directly

- **Hire military spouses.** If you are an employer or hiring manager, consider the unique qualifications of military spouses: they are often highly educated, adaptable, and experienced. Offering remote work and flexible scheduling makes your organization more accessible to military families.
- **Recognize military credentials.** If you work in a profession that requires licensing, advocate within your professional association for recognition of military training and experience as equivalent to civilian certification requirements.
- **Mentor transitioning service members.** Organizations like American Corporate Partners, Veterati, and local veteran mentorship programs connect civilians with service members preparing for civilian careers. A few hours of mentorship can make a significant difference.
- **Support military family organizations.** Donate to or volunteer with organizations that directly support military families, including food banks near military installations, childcare co-ops, and spouse networking groups.

### Vote Informed

- **Research candidates' positions on military personnel issues.** Both parties claim to support the troops, but their policy positions differ significantly on compensation, benefits, diversity, and quality of life. MOAA, VFW, and other organizations publish legislative scorecards that track voting records on military personnel bills.
- **Prioritize personnel alongside hardware.** Public attention to defense policy often focuses on weapon systems, bases, and deployments. Ensure that your advocacy includes the people who operate those systems and defend those bases.
