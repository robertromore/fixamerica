# Military Personnel: History

## The Conscription Era (1940-1973)

### World War II and the Universal Draft

The United States relied on conscription for its major wars from the Civil War onward, but the modern draft system was established by the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 -- the first peacetime draft in American history. During World War II, approximately 10 million men were drafted, and an additional 6 million volunteered, creating a military of over 12 million at its peak. The draft was broadly accepted as a shared national obligation, and the wartime military was remarkably representative of American society, drawing from every social class, region, and ethnic group (though in racially segregated units until President Truman's Executive Order 9981 in 1948).

### Korea and Vietnam

The draft continued through the Korean War (1950-1953) and escalated during the Vietnam War (1964-1973). However, the Vietnam-era draft became deeply controversial:

- **Class inequity**: The deferment system allowed college students, graduate students, and those in certain occupations to avoid service, meaning the burden fell disproportionately on working-class and minority communities.
- **Lottery system**: In 1969, the Selective Service shifted to a lottery system based on birth dates to reduce perceived inequities, but the underlying class disparities persisted.
- **Anti-war movement**: Opposition to the draft fueled the broader anti-war movement. Draft resistance, including burning draft cards and fleeing to Canada, became widespread.
- **Military quality concerns**: The combination of unwilling conscripts, declining morale, and drug abuse created serious discipline and effectiveness problems in the late-Vietnam military.

## The All-Volunteer Force (1973-Present)

### The Gates Commission

In 1969, President Nixon established the President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force, chaired by former Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates. The commission, which included economists Milton Friedman and Alan Greenspan, concluded that an all-volunteer force was feasible and desirable if compensation was raised to market-competitive levels. Key arguments:

- **Economic efficiency**: Conscription was an implicit tax on draftees, forcing them to serve at below-market wages. A volunteer force would eliminate this hidden cost by paying market wages openly.
- **Individual liberty**: Compelling military service was a significant infringement on individual freedom that could not be justified in peacetime.
- **Force quality**: Volunteers would be more motivated, disciplined, and effective than reluctant conscripts.
- **Equity**: The draft was not truly equitable because of deferments and exemptions. A volunteer force with competitive pay would draw from a broader pool.

The commission's recommendations were adopted, and the last draft call was issued on December 7, 1972. The all-volunteer force officially began on July 1, 1973.

### Early Challenges (1973-1980)

The early years of the all-volunteer force were rocky:

- **Pay gaps**: Initial pay increases were insufficient to attract enough qualified recruits. By the late 1970s, the Army was failing to meet recruiting targets and accepting recruits with lower aptitude scores.
- **The "Hollow Force"**: By 1980, the Army was widely described as a "hollow force" -- undermanned, undertrained, and demoralized. In 1979, Army Chief of Staff General Edward Meyer publicly testified to this condition before Congress.
- **Racial composition concerns**: The early all-volunteer Army became disproportionately Black and minority, raising concerns about equity and whether the force reflected the nation.
- **Quality decline**: The percentage of recruits scoring in the lowest acceptable aptitude categories (Category IV) rose sharply. A scoring error on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) in 1976-1980 masked the true extent of the quality decline.

### The Reagan-Era Recovery (1980-1991)

The Reagan administration's defense buildup included significant pay raises and benefits improvements that transformed recruiting:

- The Military Pay Act of 1981 provided an 11.7 percent across-the-board pay raise -- the largest single raise in military history.
- Enlistment bonuses, educational benefits (the Montgomery GI Bill, enacted in 1984), and improved marketing attracted higher-quality recruits.
- By the mid-1980s, the percentage of recruits with high school diplomas exceeded 90 percent, and aptitude scores rose significantly.
- The Gulf War (1991) validated the all-volunteer force concept: an entirely volunteer military, trained to a high standard, decisively defeated a large conscript army in 100 hours of ground combat.

### The Post-Cold War Drawdown (1991-2001)

Following the Cold War, the military reduced its active-duty end strength from approximately 2.1 million in 1987 to approximately 1.4 million by 2000. This drawdown was accomplished primarily through reduced recruiting and voluntary separation incentives:

- Recruiting targets were lowered, but the services maintained high quality standards, benefiting from a strong propensity to serve and a recession in the early 1990s.
- The drawdown created promotion bottlenecks that reduced retention among mid-career officers and NCOs.
- By the late 1990s, a booming civilian economy and low unemployment created the first post-Vietnam recruiting challenges. The Army missed its FY1999 recruiting goal by approximately 6,300 -- a warning of vulnerabilities to come.

### The Post-9/11 Era (2001-2020)

The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq placed unprecedented sustained demand on the all-volunteer force:

- **Recruiting stress**: The Army missed its FY2005 target by approximately 7,000 during the height of the Iraq War. To meet subsequent targets, the services expanded the use of waivers for criminal history, medical conditions, and aptitude scores.
- **Stop-loss**: The Army involuntarily extended the service of approximately 120,000 soldiers between 2004 and 2009 through stop-loss orders, a policy critics called a "back-door draft."
- **Deployment tempo**: Active-duty soldiers in combat arms specialties experienced 3-5 deployments, each 12-15 months, with limited dwell time between rotations. This tempo was unprecedented for a volunteer force.
- **Mental health crisis**: The combination of repeated combat deployments, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress contributed to a surge in suicides, substance abuse, and family dissolution.
- **Compensation expansion**: Congress and the executive branch responded with significant pay raises, expanded combat zone tax exclusions, increased bonuses, and creation of new special pays.

### Women in the Military

The integration of women into the military has been a gradual, decades-long process:

- **1948**: The Women's Armed Services Integration Act permanently established women's roles in the military, but limited them to 2 percent of each service.
- **1967**: The 2 percent cap was removed by law, and women began entering non-traditional fields.
- **1975-1976**: The service academies (West Point, Annapolis, Air Force Academy, Coast Guard Academy) admitted women for the first time.
- **1993**: The "Risk Rule" was replaced by the Direct Ground Combat Definition and Assignment Rule, which opened most positions to women but excluded direct ground combat roles.
- **2013**: Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta rescinded the Direct Ground Combat Exclusion, directing the services to open all combat positions to women.
- **2015-2016**: All combat positions, including Army infantry, armor, and special operations, were opened to women. The first women graduated from Army Ranger School in 2015.
- **2024**: Women constitute approximately 17.5 percent of the active-duty force and 19.8 percent of officers. The first female four-star combatant commander (General Laura Richardson, SOUTHCOM) served from 2021 to 2024.

### "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and LGBTQ+ Service

- **1993**: The "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" (DADT) policy replaced the outright ban on homosexual service. Under DADT, gay and lesbian service members could serve as long as they did not disclose their sexual orientation, and commanders were prohibited from asking.
- **1993-2011**: Approximately 14,000 service members were discharged under DADT, at an estimated cost of $500 million in recruiting and training replacements.
- **2010**: Congress passed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, signed by President Obama on December 22, 2010. The policy officially ended on September 20, 2011.
- **2016**: Secretary of Defense Ash Carter announced that transgender individuals could serve openly, with DoD providing medical support for gender transition.
- **2017-2021**: The Trump administration partially reversed the transgender policy, barring most transgender individuals from enlisting and requiring those already serving to serve in their biological sex. The Biden administration reinstated open service in January 2021.

### Compensation Reform

Military compensation has evolved significantly:

- **1947**: The Career Compensation Act standardized military pay across the services.
- **1971**: The Gates Commission recommended competitive pay as essential to the all-volunteer force.
- **1980s**: The Reagan-era pay raises and Montgomery GI Bill established the modern compensation framework.
- **2000**: The Redux retirement system (introduced in 1986 to reduce costs by offering a reduced pension to those retiring before age 62) was repealed due to its negative retention effects.
- **2009**: The Post-9/11 GI Bill provided the most generous educational benefit since World War II, covering full tuition at public institutions, a housing allowance, and a book stipend.
- **2016**: The Blended Retirement System (BRS) was enacted, replacing the legacy all-or-nothing 20-year pension with a system combining a reduced defined benefit (2.0% per year of service applied to high-36 average pay, versus 2.5% under the legacy system) with automatic and matching contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan. BRS became mandatory for new entrants after January 1, 2018.
- **2022**: The Basic Needs Allowance was established to address food insecurity among junior service members with large families stationed in high-cost areas.

### The Current Recruiting Crisis (2022-Present)

The current recruiting crisis, which emerged in FY2022, is the most severe since the early years of the all-volunteer force. It reflects not a single cause but a convergence of structural factors:

- The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted high school recruiting pipelines and eliminated in-person contact between recruiters and potential applicants during 2020-2021.
- A historically tight civilian labor market offered attractive alternatives. In 2022-2023, unemployment fell below 3.5 percent and entry-level civilian wages rose significantly.
- Declining trust in institutions, including the military, among younger Americans. The percentage of Americans expressing "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in the military declined from 73 percent in 2018 to 60 percent in 2023 (Gallup).
- Growing political polarization that has made the military a subject of partisan debate, potentially alienating recruits from both sides of the political spectrum.
- A shrinking pool of Americans with family military connections. In 1995, approximately 40 percent of youth had a parent who served; by 2023, that figure had declined to approximately 12 percent.
