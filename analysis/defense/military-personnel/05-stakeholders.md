# Military Personnel: Stakeholders

## Overview

Military personnel policy affects a vast ecosystem of individuals, families, organizations, and institutions. Understanding who has a stake in these issues -- and the relative power, interests, and influence of each group -- is essential for designing reforms that can attract sufficient support to be enacted and sustained.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Active-Duty Service Members (~1.3 Million)

**Interest**: Fair compensation, quality housing, manageable deployment tempo, career development, mental health support, and a personnel system that rewards talent.

**Power**: Moderate-to-low. Active-duty members cannot unionize, cannot publicly criticize policy, and are limited in political activity by the Uniform Code of Military Justice and DoD regulations. Their collective voice is expressed indirectly through retention data (voting with their feet), through surveys (the DoD Status of Forces Survey), and through advocacy by veterans' organizations and military family groups.

**Key Concerns**:

- Pay competitiveness relative to civilian alternatives, especially in technical fields
- Housing quality and availability
- Deployment predictability and dwell time
- Career flexibility and promotion fairness
- Mental health support without career stigma

### Military Families (~2.6 Million Dependents)

**Interest**: Spouse employment, childcare availability, quality housing, educational continuity for children, healthcare access, and family readiness support.

**Power**: Moderate and growing. Military families are increasingly organized and vocal through advocacy organizations (Blue Star Families, National Military Family Association, Military Officers Association of America). Spousal unemployment and housing conditions have received significant congressional and media attention.

**Key Concerns**:

- Spouse employment and professional license portability across states
- Childcare waitlists and costs
- Housing conditions in privatized military housing
- PCS move frequency and out-of-pocket costs
- Food insecurity among junior enlisted families
- Mental health support for family members

### Military Recruiters (~15,000)

**Interest**: Achievable recruiting targets, adequate resources, a competitive value proposition to offer potential recruits, and reasonable working conditions.

**Power**: Low individually but influential collectively through their direct interaction with the American public. Recruiters are the face of the military for most young Americans.

**Key Concerns**:

- Quotas that exceed the realistic supply of qualified, willing applicants
- Recruiter burnout (high-pressure, high-hour positions with significant career consequences for failure)
- Insufficient marketing budgets and outdated recruiting tools
- Eligibility standards that eliminate candidates who could succeed in service with appropriate preparation
- Lack of competitive enlistment incentives

### Veterans and Veteran Service Organizations

**Interest**: Ensuring that the transition from military to civilian life is well-supported, that veterans' benefits reflect the value of service, and that the military remains a respected institution.

**Power**: High. Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) like the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Disabled American Veterans (DAV), and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) have significant lobbying power, large memberships, and strong bipartisan support in Congress.

**Key Concerns**:

- Transition assistance effectiveness
- Credential recognition and civilian employment
- Mental health and suicide prevention
- Preservation of veterans' benefits (GI Bill, VA healthcare, disability compensation)
- Maintaining the prestige and standards of military service

## Institutional Stakeholders

### Congress

**Interest**: Maintaining a capable military, controlling defense spending, responding to constituent concerns (especially in districts with military bases), and exercising oversight of DoD personnel policies.

**Power**: Very high. Congress authorizes end strength, sets pay levels, funds benefits, and directs personnel policy through the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and appropriations bills.

**Key Players**:

- **Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC)** and **House Armed Services Committee (HASC)**: Primary oversight and legislative authority over military personnel.
- **Personnel Subcommittees**: Directly responsible for compensation, benefits, and manpower legislation.
- **Appropriations Committees**: Control the funding levels that determine what personnel programs actually receive resources.
- **State delegations**: Members from states with large military populations (Virginia, North Carolina, Texas, California, Georgia) have outsized interest in personnel issues.

**Key Concerns**:

- Personnel costs consuming an increasing share of the defense budget
- Recruiting shortfalls threatening force readiness
- Military housing scandals generating constituent complaints
- Balance between military compensation and domestic spending priorities

### Department of Defense (Office of the Secretary)

**Interest**: Maintaining the force at authorized end strength, controlling personnel costs, implementing the National Defense Strategy, and managing the civilian-military workforce.

**Power**: Very high. The Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness set policy on compensation, health, readiness, family support, and equal opportunity.

**Key Organizations**:

- **Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R))**: The principal staff assistant for total force management, readiness, and personnel policy.
- **Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)**: Administers military pay.
- **Defense Health Agency (DHA)**: Manages the military health system and TRICARE.
- **Office of People Analytics**: Conducts research on recruiting, retention, and workforce trends.

### Military Services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force)

**Interest**: Meeting their specific recruiting and retention targets, maintaining the quality of their individual forces, and preserving service culture and traditions.

**Power**: High. Each service chief and secretary has significant authority over how personnel policies are implemented within their service, and each has a direct line to Congress through testimony and posture statements.

**Key Concerns**:

- Service-specific recruiting challenges (the Army's infantry manning, the Navy's nuclear-trained sailors, the Air Force's pilots)
- Retention of critical skills unique to each service
- Balancing force quality with end-strength requirements
- Adapting service culture to attract a changing demographic without losing institutional identity

### DoD Civilian Workforce (~950,000)

**Interest**: Competitive civilian pay, job security, career development, and the ability to support the military mission.

**Power**: Moderate. Civilian employees are represented by federal employee unions (AFGE, NFFE) and have civil service protections, but their interests are often secondary to uniformed personnel in defense policy debates.

**Key Concerns**:

- Pay competitiveness with private sector, particularly for technical positions
- Hiring process speed (the average time to hire a DoD civilian exceeds 100 days)
- Workforce aging and succession planning
- Interaction between civilian and military personnel management systems

## External Stakeholders

### Defense Industry

**Interest**: A stable, well-trained military workforce that sustains demand for defense products and services, and a pipeline of skilled veterans who can fill defense industry positions.

**Power**: High. Defense contractors are major employers in many congressional districts and significant political donors. The revolving door between military service and defense industry employment creates alignment of interest but also conflicts.

**Key Concerns**:

- Military technical training programs that produce skilled workers for the defense industrial base
- Retention of military technical expertise that sustains complex weapon systems
- Veteran hiring as a source of experienced talent
- End-strength levels that drive demand for equipment, maintenance, and support services

### Educational Institutions

**Interest**: GI Bill revenue, ROTC programs, veteran student support, and research partnerships with DoD.

**Power**: Moderate. Universities receive billions in GI Bill tuition payments and host ROTC programs that commission approximately 60 percent of new officers. The Post-9/11 GI Bill has made the military a significant revenue source for higher education.

**Key Concerns**:

- GI Bill benefit levels and eligibility rules
- ROTC program presence and funding
- Veteran student retention and academic support
- Research collaboration with DoD on personnel-related issues

### State Governments

**Interest**: Military bases as economic engines, National Guard readiness, and state-level policies that affect military families (professional licensing, child custody, school enrollment).

**Power**: Moderate. Governors command the National Guard (except when federalized), and state legislatures control professional licensing laws that directly affect military spouse employment.

**Key Concerns**:

- Base closures and their economic impact on communities
- National Guard readiness and federal funding
- Professional license reciprocity for military spouses
- State tax treatment of military pay and benefits

### Military Family Advocacy Organizations

**Interest**: Improving the quality of life for military families through policy advocacy, research, and direct support services.

**Power**: Moderate and growing. These organizations conduct influential surveys, testify before Congress, and generate media coverage of family issues.

**Key Organizations**:

| Organization | Focus | Key Influence |
|---|---|---|
| Blue Star Families | Quality of life, spouse employment, childcare | Annual Military Family Lifestyle Survey (widely cited by Congress and DoD) |
| National Military Family Association | Family readiness, healthcare, education | Policy advocacy, direct member engagement |
| Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) | Compensation, retirement, healthcare | Largest officers' association; significant lobbying presence |
| Military Child Education Coalition | Military children's education | School transition support, state policy advocacy |
| Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) | Survivor support, suicide prevention | Peer support network, congressional advocacy |

## Stakeholder Alignment and Conflict

### Areas of Broad Agreement

- The recruiting crisis is real and requires action.
- Military housing conditions are unacceptable and demand investment.
- Military spouse employment barriers must be reduced.
- Mental health support must be expanded and de-stigmatized.

### Areas of Conflict

| Issue | Stakeholders in Favor | Stakeholders Opposed |
|---|---|---|
| Significant pay increases | Service members, families, VSOs, recruiters | Fiscal hawks in Congress, budget analysts |
| Lowering eligibility standards | Some recruiters, Army leadership | Quality-focused service leaders, some VSOs |
| Expanding diversity initiatives | Some service leaders, advocacy groups | Social conservatives, some traditionalist service members |
| Mandatory childcare expansion | Military families, retention advocates | Budget-conscious legislators, libertarian-leaning members |
| Reforming up-or-out | Talent management reformers, tech-skilled members | Service traditionalists, promotion-eligible senior leaders |
| Reinstating draft registration for women | Gender equity advocates, some service leaders | Social conservatives, some feminist organizations |
