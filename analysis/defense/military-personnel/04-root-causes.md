# Military Personnel: Root Causes

## Overview

The military's personnel challenges -- from recruiting shortfalls to retention gaps to family hardship -- are not isolated problems. They stem from structural forces that operate across American society, the defense bureaucracy, and military culture. This analysis identifies the root causes driving the current crisis and the systemic factors that make reform difficult.

## Shrinking Eligible Population

The single largest structural challenge is that the pool of Americans who are both willing and qualified to serve has been shrinking for decades.

### Physical Fitness and Obesity

- Approximately 31 percent of Americans aged 17-24 exceed the military's weight or body fat standards. This is the largest single disqualifier.
- Childhood obesity rates have tripled since the 1970s, meaning each successive cohort entering the recruiting-eligible age range is less physically fit than the last.
- The Department of Defense has described obesity as a national security threat. A 2022 report by the Council for a Strong America noted that obesity disqualifies more potential recruits than any other single factor.
- The military has responded with programs like the Army's Future Soldier Preparatory Course, which allows recruits who exceed weight standards to enter a pre-basic-training program to lose weight. This addresses the symptom but not the underlying public health problem.

### Drug Use

- Marijuana legalization at the state level has expanded drug use among the recruiting-age cohort. As of 2024, 24 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana.
- The military's zero-tolerance drug policy disqualifies anyone with recent marijuana use, even in states where it is legal. Prior marijuana use requires disclosure and, in some cases, a waiver.
- The disconnect between state law and federal/military policy creates confusion among potential recruits and narrows the eligible pool.
- Other substance use, including prescription drug misuse and vaping-related health issues, further reduces eligibility.

### Mental Health

- Rates of diagnosed mental health conditions among adolescents and young adults have increased substantially. The CDC reports that approximately 42 percent of high school students experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness in 2021.
- A history of mental health treatment, including counseling and medication for conditions like depression, anxiety, and ADHD, can disqualify applicants. While waivers are available, the waiver process is slow and opaque, discouraging applicants.
- The increase in mental health diagnoses reflects both a genuine increase in prevalence and improved detection and reduced stigma around seeking treatment in the civilian population -- perversely meaning that a healthier attitude toward mental health care in civilian society reduces the military-eligible pool.

### Educational Attainment and Aptitude

- The military requires a high school diploma for enlistment (GED holders face much lower acceptance rates) and a minimum score on the ASVAB.
- Declining educational outcomes in some communities, particularly in math and reading, have reduced the pool of applicants who can meet cognitive aptitude standards.
- Pandemic-era learning loss has compounded this problem, with standardized test scores declining significantly in 2021-2023.

## Civilian Labor Market Competition

### Wage Growth

The all-volunteer force competes directly with the civilian labor market for the same age cohort. When civilian wages rise and unemployment falls, military recruiting becomes dramatically harder.

- Between 2020 and 2024, entry-level civilian wages rose by 20-30 percent in sectors that compete most directly with military recruiting (logistics, manufacturing, skilled trades, technology).
- The federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour has been superseded by state and local minimum wages, many of which exceed $15 per hour. Major employers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target now offer starting wages of $15-$20 per hour with benefits and without the constraints of military life.
- Military basic pay for an E-1 (Private) with less than 4 months of service is approximately $1,917 per month ($23,000 per year). While total military compensation (including housing, food, healthcare, and tax advantages) significantly exceeds basic pay, potential recruits often compare only the base salary figure to civilian alternatives.

### Gig Economy and Flexibility

- Younger Americans increasingly value schedule flexibility, geographic stability, and work-life balance -- qualities that are fundamentally incompatible with military service requirements.
- The gig economy and remote work options expanded dramatically during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, offering alternatives that do not require relocation or long-term commitment.
- Military service requires a minimum commitment of 4-6 years of active duty, geographic mobility, deployment to hazardous environments, and subordination of personal preferences to institutional needs. This value proposition has become less attractive relative to civilian alternatives.

## Declining Connection to the Military

### The Civil-Military Gap

The all-volunteer force has created a self-reinforcing cycle of disconnection between the military and civilian society:

- Less than 1 percent of Americans currently serve in the military, down from approximately 9 percent during World War II.
- In 1995, approximately 40 percent of young Americans had a parent who had served in the military. By 2023, that figure had dropped to approximately 12 percent.
- Military recruits disproportionately come from families with prior military service. RAND research indicates that having a family member who served is the single strongest predictor of propensity to serve. As the veteran population ages and shrinks, the recruiting pipeline narrows.
- Geographic concentration compounds the problem. Military bases and the communities that support them are concentrated in the South and rural areas. Large metropolitan areas on the coasts, where the majority of young Americans live, have minimal military presence and few connections to military life.

### Declining Institutional Trust

- Public confidence in the military, while still higher than most institutions, has declined significantly. Gallup polling shows confidence dropping from 73 percent in 2018 to 60 percent in 2023.
- Political polarization has drawn the military into partisan debates over culture war issues (DEI, transgender policy, COVID vaccine mandates), potentially alienating potential recruits from across the political spectrum.
- Social media amplifies negative stories about military life -- housing conditions, sexual assault, mental health challenges, bureaucratic dysfunction -- while the military's own messaging has struggled to adapt to digital platforms.

## Military Culture and Institutional Barriers

### The "Up-or-Out" System

The Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) of 1980 and its enlisted equivalents codify a rigid personnel management system:

- Officers who are not selected for promotion after two consecutive boards are generally separated from service, regardless of their competence in their current role.
- This system was designed for a mass mobilization military where rapid officer turnover was necessary but is poorly suited for a professional force that needs deep expertise in fields like cyber, AI, intelligence, and acquisition.
- Service members who want non-traditional career paths -- lateral entry from civilian fields, breaks in service for education or family, or specialization rather than generalist command tracks -- find the system hostile to their preferences.

### Deployment Tempo and Operational Stress

- During the post-9/11 era, the force sustained deployment-to-dwell ratios of 1:1 or worse for many units, meaning soldiers spent as much time deployed as they spent at home between deployments.
- While deployment tempo has decreased from its Iraq/Afghanistan peak, it remains high relative to the pre-9/11 baseline. The services continue to maintain forward-deployed forces in Europe, the Middle East, the Indo-Pacific, and Africa.
- High deployment tempo directly degrades family stability, mental health, and retention. Service members consistently rank time away from family as the leading reason for leaving the military.

### Resistance to Cultural Change

- The military's institutional culture values conformity, hierarchy, and tradition. While these values are essential for unit cohesion and combat effectiveness, they can create resistance to changes needed to attract a changing demographic.
- Debates over grooming standards, tattoo policies, parental leave, and dual-military couple assignments reflect the tension between institutional tradition and the expectations of a younger, more diverse recruiting pool.
- The integration of women into combat roles and the inclusion of LGBTQ+ service members faced significant institutional resistance despite ultimately being implemented successfully.

## Housing and Quality of Life Failures

### Privatized Housing Dysfunction

The root cause of the military housing crisis is a structural misalignment of incentives:

- Under the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, private companies manage housing for 50-year terms with limited government oversight mechanisms.
- These companies are paid primarily through the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) collected from residents, creating an incentive to maximize occupancy while minimizing maintenance spending.
- Service members cannot easily exit privatized housing or withhold BAH because the BAH is paid directly to the housing company.
- The military departments lack both the staff and the contractual authority to effectively oversee housing company performance.

### Childcare Shortfall

- The demand for childcare on military installations consistently exceeds supply because funding for new Child Development Centers has not kept pace with the growth of dual-income military families.
- Childcare is essential for retention, particularly of women and dual-military couples. A 2021 DoD study found that childcare availability was a "significant factor" in the decision to stay or leave for 37 percent of military parents.
- Off-installation childcare alternatives are often inadequate, particularly at bases in rural areas with limited community childcare infrastructure.

## Compensation System Rigidity

### Pay Table Limitations

- Military basic pay is determined by a uniform pay table based on rank and years of service, with no variation for geographic location, occupational demand, or individual performance.
- This means a cyber operations specialist in San Francisco receives the same basic pay as an infantry soldier in rural Georgia, despite radically different cost of living and civilian earning potential.
- While special and incentive pays (SIP) partially address this problem, the SIP system is slow, bureaucratic, and often inadequate. Adjusting a special pay to respond to a retention crisis in a particular specialty can take years.

### The "20-Year Cliff"

- Under both the legacy retirement system and the Blended Retirement System, the military pension requires a minimum of 20 years of service. For the majority of service members who serve fewer than 20 years, the legacy system provided zero retirement benefit.
- The BRS partially addressed this through TSP matching, which vests after 2 years, but the defined benefit component still requires 20 years of service.
- This creates perverse incentives: service members near the 20-year mark stay even if they are burned out or underperforming, while talented individuals who leave at 8-12 years receive minimal retirement benefit for their service.
