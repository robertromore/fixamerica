# Defense Industrial Base: Reform Roadmap

Rebuilding the Defense Industrial Base requires a phased, multi-year national effort that prioritizes securing the most critical vulnerabilities first, then moves to foster long-term competition and workforce growth.

---

## Phase 1: Securing Critical Vulnerabilities (Years 1-3)

This phase focuses on immediate executive and legislative action to mitigate the most urgent supply chain risks and plug production gaps exposed by the war in Ukraine.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Fund Domestic Production** | Congress fully funds the CHIPS and Science Act. The President uses Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III authorities to invest in domestic rare earth processing and solid rocket motor production. | Construction begins on at least two new domestic semiconductor fabs and one new solid rocket motor plant. |
| **2. Create Strategic Stockpiles** | The DoD establishes and begins acquiring materials for a new Strategic Critical Minerals Stockpile. | Stockpile acquires a 1-year supply of key rare earth elements. |
| **3. Accelerate Munitions Production** | The Army and Navy award multi-year contracts for key munitions (155mm shells, Javelins, Stingers, etc.) to incentivize industry investment in new production lines. | Production rates for key munitions increase by 50% over the baseline. |
| **4. Bridge the "Valley of Death"** | Congress establishes and provides initial funding for a "Transition and Scaling Fund" to support tech startups. | The fund awards its first 10 "bridge" contracts to successful DIU-prototyped technologies. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Stop the bleeding. Mitigate the most immediate risks of a Chinese export ban and begin to ramp up munitions production.

## Phase 2: Fostering Competition and Building the Workforce (Years 4-7)

This phase focuses on implementing deeper structural reforms to the acquisition process and launching a national effort to build a skilled workforce.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Mandate Open Systems Architecture** | The DoD issues a new directive mandating the use of a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) for all new major defense acquisition programs. | The first major program (e.g., a new drone or vehicle) is competed and awarded using a MOSA strategy. |
| **2. Launch Workforce Initiative** | Congress passes a "National Defense Workforce Initiative" to fund apprenticeships, community college programs, and STEM scholarships. | 10,000 new apprentices and students are enrolled in DIB-focused programs. |
| **3. Expand "Friend-Shoring"** | The U.S. signs formal agreements with key allies (e.g., Australia, Canada, UK) to create a secure, integrated supply chain for critical minerals and defense components. | A joint U.S.-Australia rare earth processing facility becomes operational. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Change the rules of the game for the DIB, forcing more competition and modularity while building the human capital needed for the future.

## Phase 3: Achieving a Resilient and Dynamic DIB (Years 8-15)

This phase focuses on realizing the long-term vision of a secure, competitive, and innovative industrial base.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. A Secure and Redundant Supply Chain** | The U.S. has reduced its dependence on China for critical defense-related materials by over 80%. | The Strategic Critical Minerals Stockpile reaches its 3-year supply goal. |
| **2. A Diversified Industrial Base** | The share of DoD contract dollars going to companies outside the "Big Five" has increased by 25%. | At least two new "mid-tier" prime contractors have emerged as a result of the MOSA strategy. |
| **3. A Robust Workforce Pipeline** | The "National Defense Workforce Initiative" is producing a steady stream of skilled workers, and the average age of the DIB workforce begins to decline. | The number of annual graduates from DIB-focused programs meets DoD demand projections. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: The U.S. has rebuilt a 21st-century "Arsenal of Democracy" that is resilient to disruption and can out-innovate and out-produce any adversary.
