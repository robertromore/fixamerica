# Military-Industrial Complex: Roadmap

## Overview

Reforming the military-industrial complex is a long-term undertaking that requires sequencing reforms to build political momentum, establish institutional capacity, and overcome entrenched opposition. The roadmap below organizes proposed solutions into three phases: immediate actions that can be taken through executive authority or minor legislative changes, medium-term structural reforms that require legislation, and long-term systemic changes that require sustained political effort and institutional development.

## Phase 1: Transparency and Quick Wins (Years 1-2)

### Objective

Build public awareness, establish data infrastructure, and implement reforms achievable through executive action or bipartisan consensus.

### Actions

| Action | Mechanism | Lead Actor | Target Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandate real-time lobbying contact disclosure for defense contractors | Executive Order | White House | Year 1, Q1 |
| Publish annual defense market concentration report | DoD directive | USD(A&S) | Year 1, Q2 |
| Require think tank disclosure of defense industry funding in testimony | Congressional rule change | HASC/SASC chairs | Year 1, Q2 |
| Create public dashboard of major program cost/schedule performance | DoD IT initiative | CAPE/CIO | Year 1, Q3 |
| Issue updated revolving door guidance strengthening recusal requirements | DoD directive | DoD General Counsel | Year 1, Q3 |
| Expand "should cost" reviews to all contracts above $100 million | Policy memo | USD(A&S) | Year 1, Q4 |
| Require military justification for all congressional adds above $50 million | NDAA provision | HASC/SASC | Year 2, Q1 |
| Increase SBIR/STTR funding for defense innovation by 25% | Appropriations request | DoD Comptroller | Year 2, Q1 |

### Success Metrics

- Public dashboard operational with data on all 83+ MDAPs
- At least 3 "should cost" reviews completed, documenting savings opportunities
- Market concentration report published, identifying sole-source dependencies
- Think tank funding disclosure adopted by at least 5 major research organizations

### Political Strategy

Phase 1 reforms are designed to be achievable with existing authority or minimal legislative changes. Transparency measures are difficult for opponents to argue against publicly, even if they privately resist. The goal is to create public awareness of the scale of the problem and build the evidence base for more ambitious reforms.

## Phase 2: Structural Legislative Reform (Years 2-4)

### Objective

Enact the two major legislative packages -- the Defense Industry Accountability Act and the Defense Competition and Innovation Act -- that address revolving door restrictions, lobbying reform, competitive procurement, and cost-plus contract reform.

### Actions

| Action | Mechanism | Lead Actor | Target Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Introduce Defense Industry Accountability Act | Federal legislation | Reform coalition in Congress | Year 2, Q2 |
| Introduce Defense Competition and Innovation Act | Federal legislation | Reform coalition in Congress | Year 2, Q3 |
| Extend revolving door cooling-off period to 4 years | Legislation (DIAA) | Congress | Year 3 |
| Ban contractor-funded congressional travel related to defense programs | Legislation (DIAA) | Congress | Year 3 |
| Mandate competitive prototyping for all new MDAPs | Legislation (DCIA) | Congress | Year 3 |
| Create "mid-tier" contractor set-aside (15%) | Legislation (DCIA) | Congress | Year 3 |
| Elevate CAPE to Senate-confirmed position | Legislation (DIAA) | Congress | Year 3 |
| Implement automatic fee reductions for cost overruns exceeding 10% | Legislation (DCIA) | Congress | Year 3-4 |
| Require government data rights for all major program technical data | Legislation (DCIA) | Congress | Year 3-4 |
| Create Defense Acquisition Professional pay scale | Legislation or DoD request | Congress/DoD | Year 4 |

### Success Metrics

- Both bills introduced with bipartisan co-sponsors (minimum 5 from each party)
- At least one bill passed by relevant committee
- 4-year revolving door cooling-off period enacted into law
- Competitive prototyping mandated for at least 3 new major programs
- CAPE elevated and first independent lifecycle cost reviews completed under new authority

### Political Strategy

Phase 2 requires building a legislative coalition that includes fiscal conservatives (deficit hawks), progressive defense reformers, and centrist good-government advocates. The key messaging frame is "strong defense through smart spending" -- reforms are presented as strengthening national security by ensuring that defense dollars are spent effectively, not as cutting defense spending.

**Coalition targets**:

- **Fiscal conservatives**: Attracted by cost controls, audit requirements, and reduced waste
- **Progressives**: Attracted by anti-corruption measures, revolving door restrictions, and reduced industry influence
- **Centrists**: Attracted by evidence-based reforms, competition, and efficiency improvements
- **New entrant advocates**: Technology industry allies who benefit from increased competition and lower barriers to entry

## Phase 3: Systemic Transformation (Years 5-10)

### Objective

Implement deeper structural changes to the defense-industrial relationship, including industrial base diversification, merger review reform, and sustained investment in the government acquisition workforce.

### Actions

| Action | Mechanism | Lead Actor | Target Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Implement Defense Acquisition Career Track with competitive compensation | DoD policy + legislation | USD(A&S)/Congress | Year 5 |
| Expand acquisition workforce by 20% | Budget request + hiring | DoD | Years 5-7 |
| Reform FTC/DoD merger review process for defense sector | Legislation | Congress/FTC | Year 5-6 |
| Establish minimum competition thresholds (3+ qualified bidders) per market segment | DoD policy | USD(A&S) | Year 6-7 |
| Complete supply chain mapping for all critical defense market segments | DoD initiative | USD(A&S) | Year 6 |
| Diversify production sources for at least 5 sole-source critical systems | Procurement actions | Service acquisition executives | Years 6-10 |
| Develop dual-use technology investment strategy | DoD/Commerce collaboration | OUSD(R&E)/Commerce | Year 7 |
| Conduct comprehensive review of defense industrial base health | Congressionally mandated commission | Independent | Year 8 |
| Achieve 60%+ competitive contract rate (up from ~50%) | Acquisition policy | USD(A&S) | Year 10 |

### Success Metrics

- Acquisition workforce expanded by 20% with competitive compensation in place
- Average number of qualified bidders per major competition increased from 1.5 to 2.5+
- Sole-source contract share reduced from ~37% to ~25%
- At least 3 new mid-tier defense firms competing for major program work
- No critical defense market segment dependent on a single domestic supplier
- Average cost overrun on major programs reduced from ~30% to ~15%

### Political Strategy

Phase 3 requires sustained political commitment over multiple administrations and Congresses. The key to sustainability is building institutional capacity (a professionalized acquisition workforce, independent cost estimation, market monitoring) that becomes self-reinforcing and resistant to erosion by future lobbying pressure.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Industry mobilizes effective opposition to Phase 2 legislation | High | High | Build broad coalition; frame as "strong defense" not "cut defense" |
| New administration reverses executive actions from Phase 1 | Medium | Medium | Prioritize codifying key reforms in legislation |
| Acquisition workforce reforms undermined by Congressional pay caps | Medium | High | Seek direct hiring authority outside normal GS scale |
| Competitive procurement mandates increase short-term costs | Medium | Low | Accept short-term costs for long-term competition benefits; fund competitive prototyping |
| International crisis shifts attention away from reform | Medium | Medium | Frame reform as essential to crisis readiness |
| Reform fatigue allows backsliding | High | Medium | Build institutional capacity that sustains reform independent of political attention |

## Sequencing Rationale

The three-phase approach reflects the political reality that comprehensive reform cannot be achieved in a single legislative action. Each phase builds on the previous one:

1. **Phase 1 (transparency)** creates the evidence base and public awareness needed to support Phase 2 legislation
2. **Phase 2 (legislation)** creates the legal framework and institutional authority needed for Phase 3 systemic changes
3. **Phase 3 (systemic)** implements the deep structural changes that require sustained institutional capacity built in Phases 1 and 2

This sequencing also reflects the principle of "irreversibility" -- transparency measures and institutional capacity, once established, are difficult for opponents to dismantle without appearing to favor corruption. Each phase makes the next phase more politically feasible and more resistant to rollback.
