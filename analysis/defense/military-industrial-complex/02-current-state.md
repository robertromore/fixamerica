# Military-Industrial Complex: Current State

## The Big Five Prime Contractors

The U.S. defense industrial base is dominated by five prime contractors that collectively receive the largest share of Department of Defense contract obligations. The post-Cold War merger wave reduced the number of major defense firms from over 50 to these five, creating an oligopolistic market structure with limited competition for the largest programs.

### Revenue and Contract Data (FY2024)

| Contractor | Total Revenue | Defense Revenue | Top DoD Contracts | Market Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lockheed Martin** | ~$71 billion | ~$60 billion | F-35, C-130J, THAAD, Aegis, Trident II | ~$130 billion |
| **RTX (Raytheon)** | ~$74 billion | ~$37 billion | Patriot, StingerJavelin, Pratt & Whitney engines | ~$150 billion |
| **Northrop Grumman** | ~$40 billion | ~$33 billion | B-21 Raider, Sentinel ICBM, JWICS, Triton | ~$75 billion |
| **Boeing Defense** | ~$25 billion | ~$25 billion | KC-46, F/A-18, AH-64 Apache, MQ-25, SLS | ~$120 billion (total) |
| **General Dynamics** | ~$42 billion | ~$32 billion | Columbia-class submarine, Abrams, Gulfstream, IT systems | ~$80 billion |

### Market Concentration

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Top 5 prime contractor share of DoD contract obligations | ~30% | FPDS, 2024 |
| Top 10 contractor share | ~42% | FPDS, 2024 |
| Number of firms receiving 50%+ of DoD contracts | <20 | FPDS, 2024 |
| Number of qualified bidders for major platforms (average) | 1-2 | GAO, 2024 |

The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) for several defense market segments exceeds the Department of Justice threshold for "highly concentrated" markets (above 2,500). In tactical aircraft, nuclear submarines, and intercontinental ballistic missiles, the United States has only a single domestic supplier.

### Sole-Source and Single-Bidder Contracts

According to GAO analysis, approximately 50% of DoD contract dollars in FY2023 were awarded without competitive bidding, either through sole-source contracts or competitions that attracted only a single bidder. This represents a significant increase from the approximately 35% sole-source rate in the early 2000s.

| Contract Type | Share of DoD Contract Dollars (FY2023) | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| Competitive (2+ bidders) | ~50% | Declining |
| Sole-source | ~37% | Increasing |
| Single-bidder competition | ~13% | Stable |

## Lobbying Expenditures

The defense industry maintains one of the most extensive lobbying operations in Washington. Defense firms consistently rank among the top-spending sectors for federal lobbying.

### Annual Lobbying Spending by Top Contractors

| Contractor | Lobbying Spending (2024) | Number of Lobbyists | Former Government Officials |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lockheed Martin | ~$13.5 million | 78 | 60+ |
| RTX (Raytheon) | ~$11.2 million | 67 | 55+ |
| Northrop Grumman | ~$11.8 million | 71 | 50+ |
| Boeing | ~$12.0 million | 82 | 65+ |
| General Dynamics | ~$10.5 million | 58 | 45+ |
| **Sector Total** (defense/aerospace) | **~$140 million** | **~800** | **~500** |

*Sources: OpenSecrets.org lobbying data; Center for Responsive Politics.*

### Trade Associations

In addition to company-level lobbying, defense firms fund powerful trade associations that amplify their influence:

- **National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA)**: ~$30 million annual budget, 1,700+ corporate members
- **Aerospace Industries Association (AIA)**: Represents major prime contractors and Tier 1 suppliers
- **Professional Services Council (PSC)**: Represents IT and services contractors
- **Shipbuilders Council of America (SCA)**: Advocates for naval shipbuilding programs

These organizations provide additional lobbying channels, publish policy papers, and host conferences that bring together industry executives, military officials, and members of Congress.

## The Revolving Door

The movement of personnel between the Pentagon, Congress, and defense industry is one of the most well-documented features of the military-industrial complex.

### Key Data Points

| Metric | Value | Period | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Senior DoD officials who moved to defense contractors | 1,718 | 2014-2019 | GAO-21-416 |
| Former flag/general officers on defense company boards | 100+ | As of 2024 | POGO |
| Registered lobbyists who are former DoD officials | 500+ | As of 2024 | OpenSecrets |
| Average salary increase for officials moving to industry | 200-400% | -- | POGO estimates |
| Former members of Armed Services Committees lobbying for defense firms | 25+ | 118th Congress alumni | OpenSecrets |

### Case Examples

- **The F-35 Program**: A POGO investigation found that over 600 former DoD officials took positions at Lockheed Martin between 2014 and 2019. During this period, the F-35 program continued to receive full funding despite persistent performance failures.
- **Raytheon/Pentagon**: Former Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin served on the board of Raytheon (now RTX) before his nomination, earning over $1.4 million in director compensation and stock holdings. He received an ethics waiver to participate in decisions affecting the company.
- **Boeing Defense**: Boeing has hired extensively from the Pentagon acquisition workforce, including former program executive officers who oversaw contracts subsequently awarded to the company.

### Current Restrictions

The existing revolving door restrictions are widely considered inadequate:

- **18 U.S.C. 207**: Imposes a 1-year cooling-off period for senior officials before they can lobby their former agency. The restriction applies narrowly to direct lobbying contacts, not behind-the-scenes strategic advice.
- **DoD Directive 5500.07**: Implements additional restrictions for procurement officials, but enforcement is minimal. The DoD Inspector General has repeatedly noted the lack of compliance monitoring.

## Campaign Contributions

Defense industry political contributions are strategically targeted toward members of Congress with direct authority over defense spending.

### Total Defense Sector Contributions (2024 Election Cycle)

| Category | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total defense sector contributions | ~$50 million | OpenSecrets |
| PAC contributions | ~$28 million | OpenSecrets |
| Individual contributions (employees) | ~$22 million | OpenSecrets |
| Top recipient committee: Armed Services (House) | ~$4.8 million | OpenSecrets |
| Top recipient committee: Appropriations (Senate) | ~$3.9 million | OpenSecrets |

### Contribution Patterns

- **Bipartisan**: Defense firms contribute roughly equally to both parties, ensuring influence regardless of which party controls Congress.
- **Committee-Targeted**: Members of Armed Services and Appropriations committees receive 3-5 times more defense industry money than other members.
- **Geographic Correlation**: Members whose districts host major defense facilities receive disproportionately large contributions from the contractors operating those facilities.

### Top Individual Contractor PAC Recipients (2024 Cycle)

| Contractor PAC | Total Disbursements | Top 5 Recipients |
|---|---|---|
| Lockheed Martin PAC | ~$4.5 million | Armed Services and Appropriations members (both parties) |
| RTX (Raytheon) PAC | ~$3.8 million | Armed Services and Appropriations members (both parties) |
| Northrop Grumman PAC | ~$3.6 million | Armed Services and Appropriations members (both parties) |
| General Dynamics PAC | ~$2.9 million | Armed Services and Appropriations members (both parties) |
| Boeing PAC | ~$3.2 million | Armed Services and Appropriations members (both parties) |

## Congressional Adds

Congress routinely adds billions of dollars to the defense budget beyond what the Pentagon requests, often for weapons systems, ships, or facilities located in politically important districts.

### FY2024 Congressional Adds

| Category | Amount Above Request | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Shipbuilding | ~$5.2 billion | Additional DDG-51 destroyers, amphibious ships |
| Aircraft | ~$4.8 billion | Additional F-35s, F/A-18s, C-130Js beyond DoD request |
| Ground vehicles | ~$2.1 billion | Abrams upgrades, Stryker variants |
| R&D earmarks | ~$3.5 billion | University research, technology demonstrations |
| Military construction | ~$6.2 billion | Projects in key members' districts/states |
| Other procurement | ~$2.2 billion | Munitions, spare parts, miscellaneous |
| **Total congressional adds** | **~$24 billion** | |

*Sources: CBO analysis of FY2024 NDAA vs. budget request; Congressional Research Service.*

### The Politics of Adds

Congressional adds are sustained by a logrolling dynamic in which members of both parties trade support for each other's preferred programs. Defense firms actively cultivate this dynamic by distributing subcontracts across as many congressional districts as possible:

- **F-35 supply chain**: Lockheed Martin has distributed F-35 subcontracts to over 1,700 suppliers in 45+ states, making it politically impossible for Congress to reduce F-35 procurement.
- **Abrams tank**: The M1 Abrams production line in Lima, Ohio has been kept running even when the Army has said it does not need additional tanks, because the facility is located in a politically important swing state.
- **V-22 Osprey**: Bell and Boeing distributed Osprey subcontracts across 40+ states, building a "political firewall" that sustained funding through decades of development problems.

## Cost Overruns on Major Programs

Chronic cost growth and schedule delays on major weapons programs are the most visible symptom of military-industrial complex dysfunction.

### Current Major Program Performance

| Program | Original Cost Estimate | Current Estimate | Cost Growth | Schedule Delay |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F-35 Joint Strike Fighter** | $233 billion (2001) | $438 billion acquisition; $1.7T lifecycle | +88% acquisition | 12+ years to full-rate production |
| **Columbia-class SSBN** | $109 billion (12 boats, 2014) | $132+ billion | +21% and rising | 12-18 months behind |
| **Sentinel ICBM (GBSD)** | $85 billion (original) | $130+ billion (2024 est.) | +53%+ (Nunn-McCurdy breach) | 2+ years |
| **Ford-class Carrier (CVN-78)** | $10.5 billion (per ship) | $13.3 billion (CVN-78) | +27% | 4-year delay |
| **KC-46 Tanker** | $4.9 billion (development) | Boeing absorbed $7+ billion in cost overruns | 40%+ development growth | 3-year delay |
| **CH-53K King Stallion** | $25.3 billion (program) | $38.5 billion | +52% | 4+ years |

*Sources: GAO Annual Weapons Systems Assessment (2024); Congressional Research Service; DoD Selected Acquisition Reports.*

### Systemic Patterns

The GAO's annual assessment of major defense acquisition programs consistently identifies the same systemic issues:

- **Optimistic cost estimates**: Initial cost estimates routinely understate true program costs by 30-50%, a phenomenon known as "buy-in" where contractors bid low to win contracts and then raise prices once they are the sole source.
- **Requirements instability**: The military services change requirements after program start, increasing costs and causing redesign.
- **Concurrency**: Programs begin production before development is complete, requiring expensive retrofits.
- **Inadequate testing**: Pressure to meet schedules leads to compressed testing, which discovers problems late when they are expensive to fix.

### Nunn-McCurdy Breaches

The Nunn-McCurdy Amendment (10 U.S.C. 4374) requires the DoD to notify Congress when a program exceeds its baseline cost estimate by 15% (significant breach) or 25% (critical breach). A critical breach triggers a potential program cancellation review. However, no major program has ever been canceled solely due to a Nunn-McCurdy breach -- the DoD has invariably certified that the program is essential to national security and must continue. The Sentinel ICBM program triggered a critical Nunn-McCurdy breach in 2024 with a cost increase exceeding 50%.

## Defense Industrial Base Consolidation

### Timeline of Major Mergers and Consolidation

| Year | Event | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 1993 | "Last Supper" dinner hosted by Deputy Secretary William Perry | DoD encouraged defense industry consolidation |
| 1994 | Lockheed merges with Martin Marietta | Created world's largest defense firm |
| 1995 | Lockheed Martin acquires Loral Defense | Expanded electronics/space capabilities |
| 1996 | Boeing acquires Rockwell Defense | Added space and missile defense |
| 1997 | Boeing merges with McDonnell Douglas | Combined two of three fighter jet makers |
| 1997 | Raytheon acquires Hughes Defense | Created missile defense monopoly |
| 1999 | DoD blocks Lockheed Martin-Northrop Grumman merger | Last major antitrust action in defense sector |
| 2002 | Northrop Grumman acquires TRW | Expanded into space and intelligence |
| 2019 | L3 Technologies merges with Harris Corporation (L3Harris) | Created 6th largest defense firm |
| 2020 | Raytheon merges with United Technologies (RTX) | Combined missiles with jet engines |
| 2024 | L3Harris acquires Aerojet Rocketdyne | Consolidated solid rocket motor supply |

### Current Market Structure

The result of three decades of consolidation is a defense market with the following characteristics:

- **Tactical fighter aircraft**: Lockheed Martin (sole producer of F-35); Boeing (F/A-18, but line closing)
- **Nuclear submarines**: General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls (duopoly)
- **ICBMs**: Northrop Grumman (sole source for Sentinel)
- **Strategic bombers**: Northrop Grumman (sole source for B-21)
- **Missile defense**: RTX/Raytheon (Patriot monopoly); Lockheed Martin (THAAD, Aegis)
- **Large solid rocket motors**: L3Harris/Aerojet Rocketdyne (near-monopoly) and Northrop Grumman

In multiple critical market segments, the United States is dependent on a single domestic supplier, creating both pricing power for the contractor and strategic vulnerability for the nation.

### Small and Mid-Tier Firm Attrition

The consolidation trend extends beyond the primes. The number of firms in the defense industrial base has declined significantly:

| Tier | Approximate Count (1990) | Approximate Count (2024) | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prime contractors (Tier 0) | 51 | 5 | -90% |
| Major subcontractors (Tier 1) | ~200 | ~80 | -60% |
| Specialized component suppliers (Tier 2) | ~2,000 | ~800 | -60% |
| Small business defense suppliers | ~40,000 | ~20,000 | -50% |

The shrinking supply base reduces competition, concentrates risk, and limits the Pentagon's ability to find alternative sources when a supplier fails or is acquired by a rival.
