# Military-Industrial Complex: Stakeholders

## Overview

The military-industrial complex involves a wide range of stakeholders with varying degrees of power, interest, and exposure to the consequences of defense spending decisions. Understanding these stakeholders -- their motivations, their leverage, and their interconnections -- is essential to designing viable reform strategies.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Defense Contractors (Prime and Major Subcontractors)

**Role**: Design, develop, produce, and sustain the weapons systems and services purchased by the Department of Defense.

**Key Actors**:

- **Big Five primes**: Lockheed Martin, RTX (Raytheon), Northrop Grumman, Boeing Defense, General Dynamics
- **Tier 1 subcontractors**: L3Harris, Leidos, BAE Systems (U.S. operations), SAIC, Huntington Ingalls Industries
- **IT and services firms**: Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI International, ManTech, Peraton

**Interests**:

- Maximizing contract awards and revenue
- Maintaining sole-source positions on major programs
- Protecting existing program funding against cuts or cancellations
- Shaping requirements to favor their technical capabilities
- Preserving the revolving door pipeline for government talent recruitment
- Preventing regulatory changes that would increase competition or accountability

**Leverage**:

- Control of critical technical capabilities with no domestic alternatives
- Lobbying apparatus ($140+ million annually)
- Campaign contributions ($50+ million per election cycle)
- Geographic distribution of jobs across congressional districts
- Relationships with former government officials now in their employ
- Influence over think tanks and research organizations

**Approximate Economic Footprint**: ~1.7 million direct employees; ~3.5 million including supply chain (National Defense Industrial Association estimate, 2024)

### Pentagon Acquisition Officials

**Role**: Manage the process of defining requirements, soliciting bids, awarding contracts, and overseeing contractor performance for defense programs.

**Key Actors**:

- Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S))
- Service Acquisition Executives (SAEs) for Army, Navy, and Air Force
- Program Executive Officers (PEOs) who oversee portfolios of programs
- Program Managers (PMs) who manage individual weapons programs
- Contracting Officers who execute contract awards and modifications

**Interests**:

- Career advancement within the DoD acquisition workforce
- Avoiding program cancellations that reflect poorly on their management
- Maintaining positive relationships with contractors (potential future employers)
- Demonstrating compliance with complex acquisition regulations
- Some genuine interest in delivering capability to the warfighter

**Leverage**:

- Authority over contract award decisions
- Control of technical requirements and evaluation criteria
- Access to classified program information
- Influence over testing and acceptance standards

**Key Tension**: The acquisition workforce is simultaneously the government's primary check on contractor behavior and a recruiting pool for the defense industry. This dual role creates an inherent conflict of interest that pervades the entire acquisition system.

### Congress (Armed Services and Appropriations Committees)

**Role**: Authorize defense programs (Armed Services Committees), appropriate funding (Appropriations Committees), and conduct oversight of the Department of Defense.

**Key Actors**:

- **Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC)**: 27 members; controls the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
- **House Armed Services Committee (HASC)**: 60+ members; co-authors the NDAA
- **Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense**: Controls defense spending levels
- **House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense**: Controls defense spending levels
- **Individual members** with major defense installations or contractor facilities in their districts

**Interests**:

- Securing defense jobs and contracts for their districts/states
- Receiving campaign contributions from defense industry PACs and individuals
- Demonstrating "strong on defense" credentials to voters
- Maintaining oversight authority (committee turf)
- Some genuine interest in effective national defense and fiscal responsibility

**Leverage**:

- Power to authorize or block weapons programs
- Power to appropriate or withhold funding
- Ability to add unrequested programs to the defense budget
- Subpoena power and oversight hearings
- Influence over the defense budget topline

**Key Tension**: Members of these committees are the primary recipients of defense industry campaign contributions and the primary beneficiaries of defense jobs in their districts. They are also the officials constitutionally responsible for overseeing defense spending. This dual role makes them simultaneously the overseers and the beneficiaries of the system they are supposed to regulate.

### Defense Workers and Communities

**Role**: The employees of defense contractors and the communities that depend on defense facilities for their economic base.

**Key Characteristics**:

- Approximately 1.7 million direct defense industry employees (NDIA, 2024)
- High-skill, well-compensated workforce: average defense industry salary ~$100,000
- Geographically concentrated in specific regions: Southern California, Northern Virginia, Texas, Connecticut, Alabama, Washington State
- Communities often economically dependent on a single defense facility or program
- Organized through unions (IAM, UAW, IBEW) in some sectors, particularly shipbuilding and aircraft manufacturing

**Interests**:

- Job security and good wages
- Continued funding for the programs they work on
- Investment in skills training and workforce development
- Community economic stability

**Leverage**:

- Constituent pressure on members of Congress
- Union political organization in key states
- Public sympathy (defense workers are often portrayed as patriotic contributors to national security)
- Geographic concentration in politically important districts and states

**Key Tension**: Defense workers have legitimate interests in job security and community economic health. However, these legitimate interests are routinely weaponized by contractors and members of Congress to prevent program reforms or cancellations that would serve the broader public interest.

## Secondary Stakeholders

### Taxpayers

**Role**: Fund the entire defense enterprise through federal taxes.

**Interests**:

- Effective use of tax dollars for genuine national defense
- Minimizing waste, fraud, and cost overruns
- Ensuring defense spending does not crowd out other public investments (infrastructure, education, healthcare)
- Transparency and accountability in defense spending

**Leverage**:

- Voting power (diffuse and hard to organize on defense spending issues)
- Occasional public outrage at waste scandals (e.g., $640 toilet seats)
- Support for reform advocacy organizations

**Key Weakness**: Taxpayer interests are diffuse -- each taxpayer bears a small fraction of the cost of any given weapons program -- while contractor interests are concentrated. This creates a classic collective action problem in which the beneficiaries of waste are highly organized and the victims of waste are not.

### Small and Mid-Tier Defense Firms

**Role**: Supply specialized components, services, and niche capabilities as subcontractors to the prime contractors or as direct suppliers to the DoD.

**Key Characteristics**:

- Approximately 20,000 small businesses in the defense supply chain (down from ~40,000 in 1990)
- Often the source of innovative technologies and approaches
- Highly dependent on prime contractors for subcontract opportunities
- Face barriers to entry as direct DoD suppliers (complex regulations, security clearance requirements, long payment cycles)

**Interests**:

- Access to DoD contracts without being forced through prime contractors
- Simpler procurement regulations and reduced compliance burden
- Fair treatment by prime contractors (timely payment, reasonable terms)
- Protection from predatory acquisition by prime contractors
- Increased use of competitive procurement

**Leverage**:

- Small Business Administration set-aside requirements (23% target for small business)
- Innovation capabilities that primes sometimes lack
- Political support from congressional small business caucuses
- Potential allies in reform coalitions

**Key Tension**: Small and mid-tier firms are squeezed by the consolidation of the prime contractor tier. They depend on primes for subcontracts but are also potential competitors. Primes have a pattern of acquiring innovative small firms, capturing their technology, and then eliminating them as independent competitors.

### Think Tanks and Research Organizations

**Role**: Produce policy analysis, threat assessments, and reform proposals that shape the defense policy debate.

**Key Actors**:

- **Defense-industry-funded**: Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Center for a New American Security (CNAS), Atlantic Council, Hudson Institute
- **Independent/reform-oriented**: Project on Government Oversight (POGO), Center for Defense Information (CDI), Stimson Center, Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft
- **Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs)**: RAND Corporation, Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), MITRE Corporation

**Interests**:

- Maintaining research funding (whether from government, industry, or foundations)
- Influencing policy outcomes consistent with institutional and funder interests
- Credibility and reputation within the policy community
- Access to policymakers and media

**Leverage**:

- Production of "expert" analysis that shapes policy narratives
- Personnel who move between think tanks and government (another revolving door)
- Media presence and opinion-shaping capability
- Convening power (conferences, forums) that bring together policymakers and industry

**Key Tension**: Think tanks that receive defense industry funding face a structural conflict of interest in assessing the programs and policies of their funders. While most maintain some editorial independence, the funding relationship creates incentives to produce analysis that validates the need for more defense spending and the programs of specific contractors. Disclosure of defense industry funding is inconsistent and often incomplete.

### The Military Services

**Role**: Define requirements for weapons systems, operate those systems, and advise civilian leadership on military capabilities and threats.

**Key Actors**:

- Service Chiefs (Chief of Staff of the Army, Chief of Naval Operations, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Chief of Space Operations)
- Combatant Commanders who define operational requirements
- Operational test and evaluation organizations

**Interests**:

- Securing the most capable weapons systems for their service
- Maintaining or expanding their share of the defense budget
- Service institutional interests (traditions, force structure, roles and missions)
- Genuine operational effectiveness and warfighter support

**Leverage**:

- Authority to define requirements for new weapons systems
- Operational testing and evaluation of contractor products
- Public credibility and trust
- Relationships with congressional defense committees

**Key Tension**: The services are supposed to be the voice of the warfighter in the acquisition process, ensuring that weapons systems meet genuine operational needs. However, service institutional interests -- maintaining force structure, protecting preferred programs, and competing for budget share -- sometimes diverge from actual operational priorities. Services have been known to inflate requirements to justify their preferred programs and to resist cancellation of underperforming systems that support their institutional interests.

## Stakeholder Interaction Map

The following table summarizes the key relationships and flows between stakeholders:

| From | To | Flow |
|---|---|---|
| Defense contractors | Congress | Campaign contributions, lobbying, job creation |
| Defense contractors | Pentagon officials | Future employment, technical support, lobbying |
| Defense contractors | Think tanks | Funding, research sponsorship |
| Congress | DoD/Contractors | Appropriations, authorizations, congressional adds |
| Pentagon officials | Defense contractors | Contract awards, requirements, program oversight |
| Pentagon officials (former) | Defense contractors | Expertise, relationships, credibility |
| Think tanks | Congress/Pentagon | Policy analysis, threat assessments, reform proposals |
| Defense workers | Congress | Constituent pressure, voting |
| Taxpayers | Congress | Voting, advocacy (diffuse) |

## Power Analysis

| Stakeholder | Political Power | Economic Resources | Information Access | Organizational Capacity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Big Five primes | Very High | Very High | Very High | Very High |
| Congress (defense committees) | Very High | N/A | High | High |
| Pentagon acquisition officials | High | Low | Very High | Medium |
| Think tanks (industry-funded) | Medium | Medium | High | High |
| Defense workers/unions | Medium | Low | Low | Medium |
| Small/mid-tier firms | Low | Low | Medium | Low |
| Reform organizations | Low | Low | Medium | Medium |
| Taxpayers (general public) | Low (diffuse) | N/A | Low | Very Low |

The fundamental imbalance in this stakeholder landscape is that the actors who benefit from the current system (contractors, defense committee members, revolving door participants) are highly organized, well-resourced, and concentrated, while those who bear the costs (taxpayers, warfighters who receive inadequate equipment, communities that lose alternative economic development) are diffuse and poorly organized.
