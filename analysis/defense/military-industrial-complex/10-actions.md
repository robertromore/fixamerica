# Military-Industrial Complex: Actions

## Overview

Citizens can take meaningful action to address military-industrial complex dysfunction, even though the forces sustaining the current system are powerful and well-resourced. The most effective citizen actions focus on building public awareness, pressuring elected officials, and supporting reform organizations. Because the MIC operates through bipartisan institutional capture, effective advocacy must be nonpartisan and focused on transparency, accountability, and good governance rather than on partisan defense spending debates.

## Individual Actions

### 1. Learn the Basics

- Read President Eisenhower's farewell address (widely available online and in archives)
- Review the GAO's annual weapons system assessment report to understand the scale of cost overruns
- Check OpenSecrets.org to see how much defense industry money your members of Congress receive
- Explore the POGO revolving door database to understand the personnel flow between the Pentagon and industry

### 2. Follow the Money in Your District

- Use FPDS.gov (Federal Procurement Data System) to identify defense contracts in your congressional district
- Check OpenSecrets.org for your representatives' defense industry campaign contributions
- Identify which defense contractors have facilities in your area and research their lobbying activity
- Attend town hall meetings and ask your representatives about specific defense spending decisions that affect your district

### 3. Contact Your Elected Officials

**Key messages**:

- Support extending the revolving door cooling-off period for Pentagon officials from 1 year to 4 years
- Demand transparency in defense contractor lobbying contacts with government officials
- Ask why Congress adds billions in unrequested defense spending each year
- Request that your representatives disclose any defense industry campaign contributions when voting on defense bills
- Support competitive procurement mandates that would reduce sole-source contracting

**Most effective contacts**:

- Personalized letters and emails referencing specific programs or spending in your district
- Constituent meetings during congressional recess periods
- Public questions at town halls (especially effective because they create accountability)
- Coordinated contacts with other constituents (group letters, petition deliveries)

### 4. Support Investigative Journalism

- Subscribe to outlets that cover defense procurement (e.g., *Defense One*, *Defense News*, *Breaking Defense*, *The War Zone*)
- Share and amplify investigative reports on defense waste and corruption
- Support nonprofit investigative organizations like POGO and ProPublica that cover defense spending
- Tip journalists about defense spending irregularities you become aware of in your community

### 5. Engage in the Budget Process

- Submit public comments on the President's budget request during the annual budget process
- Attend Armed Services Committee markup hearings (available via webcast) and monitor how your representatives vote
- Track the NDAA conference report to identify congressional adds that benefit specific districts
- Advocate for full funding of the GAO and DoD Inspector General to strengthen oversight capacity

## Organized Advocacy

### Join or Support Reform Organizations

| Organization | Focus | How to Get Involved |
|---|---|---|
| Project on Government Oversight (POGO) | Defense oversight and accountability | Volunteer, donate, share research; sign up for email alerts |
| Taxpayers for Common Sense | Federal spending accountability | Join taxpayer advocacy campaigns; monitor your state's defense earmarks |
| Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft | Responsible defense policy | Attend events; amplify restraint-oriented analysis |
| National Priorities Project | Federal budget transparency | Use budget tools to educate your community about spending tradeoffs |
| Common Cause | Government ethics and transparency | Participate in lobbying reform campaigns |
| Citizens Against Government Waste | Wasteful spending | Monitor annual "Pig Book" identifying defense pork |
| Win Without War | Progressive defense spending reform | Grassroots mobilization and congressional advocacy |

### Build Local Coalitions

- Connect fiscal conservatives concerned about government waste with progressives concerned about military overreach -- MIC reform is a rare area of potential left-right agreement
- Engage veterans' organizations, many of whose members are personally familiar with procurement dysfunction and waste
- Partner with small business organizations that represent mid-tier defense suppliers frustrated by prime contractor dominance
- Collaborate with local economic development groups on defense-community diversification planning

### Advocate for State-Level Action

While defense procurement is primarily a federal issue, state-level actions can support reform:

- Support state pension fund shareholder activism on defense contractor governance and lobbying disclosure
- Advocate for state lobbying registration requirements that cover defense industry contacts with state officials
- Support economic diversification planning for defense-dependent communities to reduce political resistance to program reforms
- Encourage state university researchers to study defense procurement issues and publish independent analysis

## Community Actions

### For Defense-Dependent Communities

Communities with major defense installations or contractor facilities face a particular challenge: they benefit economically from the current system but bear the risk of sudden program cancellations or facility closures. Proactive diversification is in their long-term interest:

- Advocate for economic diversification planning that reduces dependence on a single defense program
- Support workforce development programs that prepare defense workers for dual-use and commercial technology roles
- Engage local elected officials in discussions about the long-term sustainability of defense-dependent economies
- Partner with community colleges and technical schools to develop skills training applicable to both defense and commercial sectors

### For Academic Communities

- Support independent academic research on defense procurement, lobbying, and the revolving door
- Advocate for transparent disclosure of defense industry funding at universities and research centers
- Encourage engineering and policy students to consider government acquisition careers
- Host public forums on defense spending and MIC reform featuring diverse perspectives

## Electoral Actions

### Candidate Evaluation

When evaluating candidates for Congress, consider:

- Do they disclose defense industry campaign contributions?
- Have they supported revolving door restrictions and lobbying reform?
- Do they have a record of scrutinizing defense spending rather than simply voting for higher budgets?
- Do they distinguish between "strong defense" and "more defense spending"?
- Are they willing to challenge specific weapons programs that are over budget or underperforming?

### Campaign Finance

- Support public financing of congressional elections, which would reduce the influence of defense industry campaign contributions
- Advocate for stronger disclosure requirements for PAC contributions
- Support candidates who refuse defense industry PAC contributions (though this is rare due to the competitive disadvantage it creates)

## Effectiveness Tips

- **Be specific**: General complaints about "defense spending" are less effective than specific concerns about named programs, contracts, or revolving door cases
- **Be nonpartisan**: MIC reform is not a left-right issue. Framing reform as patriotic and pro-national-security is more effective than framing it as anti-military
- **Use data**: Reference GAO reports, POGO databases, and OpenSecrets data in your communications with elected officials
- **Be persistent**: The defense lobby operates continuously; citizen advocacy must be sustained, not episodic
- **Build coalitions**: The most effective reform efforts bring together fiscal conservatives, good-government advocates, and progressive reformers who may disagree on other issues but share concerns about defense waste and corruption
