# Military-Industrial Complex: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming the military-industrial complex requires interventions across multiple dimensions simultaneously. No single reform can break the self-reinforcing cycle of industry concentration, political influence, revolving door incentives, and cost overruns. The solutions proposed here address the root causes identified in this analysis and are designed to be mutually reinforcing. They range from immediately achievable administrative reforms to structural changes that would require sustained political effort over years or decades.

## Solution 1: Revolving Door Restrictions

### Problem Addressed

The movement of personnel between the Pentagon, Congress, and defense industry creates pervasive conflicts of interest that distort procurement decisions and undermine accountability (Root Causes 2 and 7).

### Proposal

**Extend the cooling-off period to 4 years** for senior DoD officials (GS-15 and above, and all flag/general officers) before they can work for defense contractors with whom they had direct dealings. Currently, the cooling-off period under 18 U.S.C. 207 is only 1 year for most officials and 2 years for very senior appointees.

**Key provisions**:

- 4-year ban on employment by defense contractors for senior acquisition officials, program managers, and contracting officers who had direct involvement in contract award or oversight decisions
- 2-year ban on employment for other senior DoD officials (non-acquisition roles)
- Lifetime ban on lobbying on behalf of foreign defense firms for all former senior DoD officials
- Reverse revolving door: 2-year cooling-off period for defense industry executives before they can serve in acquisition roles overseeing their former employer
- Mandatory disclosure of all post-government employment for 10 years after leaving DoD service
- Enhanced enforcement through a dedicated compliance office within the DoD Inspector General

**Complementary measures**:

- Increase government civilian pay for acquisition professionals to reduce the financial incentive to leave for industry (currently, acquisition professionals can expect 200-400% salary increases by moving to contractors)
- Create a prestigious "Defense Acquisition Career Track" with competitive compensation, bonuses tied to program performance, and enhanced retirement benefits

### Evidence Base

- The GAO found 1,718 former senior DoD officials took positions with defense contractors between 2014 and 2019 (GAO-21-416)
- A POGO study found that 90% of retired three- and four-star officers who went to work for defense contractors did not report their employment as required under existing regulations
- Countries such as South Korea and Japan impose longer cooling-off periods for defense procurement officials

### Potential Objections and Responses

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| Will deter talent from government service | Higher pay and enhanced career benefits can offset the restriction; many dedicated public servants would accept the restriction |
| Unconstitutional restriction on employment | Courts have upheld reasonable cooling-off periods as valid conditions of public employment; 4 years is proportionate to the scope of the conflict |
| Will lose valuable expertise | The expertise argument is often a pretext; the real value of former officials to contractors is their access and relationships, not their technical expertise |

## Solution 2: Lobbying Reform

### Problem Addressed

The defense industry's $140+ million annual lobbying operation distorts procurement decisions and budget priorities (Root Causes 6 and 7).

### Proposal

**Comprehensive defense lobbying transparency and restrictions**:

- **Real-time disclosure**: Require same-day public reporting of all lobbying contacts between defense contractors (including trade associations) and government officials, including the topic discussed and any materials exchanged
- **Contractor-funded travel ban**: Prohibit defense contractors from funding congressional travel, meals, and events related to defense programs
- **Think tank disclosure**: Require think tanks and research organizations to disclose all defense industry funding in any publication or testimony related to defense policy
- **Lobbying expenditure reporting**: Require defense firms to report lobbying expenditures by program and issue area, not just aggregate totals
- **Trade association transparency**: Require trade associations (NDIA, AIA, etc.) to disclose which member companies funded specific lobbying campaigns and policy positions

### Evidence Base

- OpenSecrets data shows the defense sector consistently ranks among the top 10 lobbying sectors by spending
- Academic research (Alexander, Mazza, and Scholz, 2009) found lobbying returns of $6-$20 per dollar spent, indicating the effectiveness of lobbying in generating contract awards
- The European Union's transparency register provides a model for comprehensive lobbying disclosure

## Solution 3: Competitive Procurement Mandates

### Problem Addressed

Approximately 50% of DoD contract dollars are awarded without meaningful competition, enabling pricing abuse and reducing innovation incentives (Root Causes 1 and 4).

### Proposal

**Mandate competitive procurement with limited exceptions**:

- **Competition requirement**: Require competitive bidding for all contracts above $50 million, with sole-source exceptions requiring written justification approved by the Secretary of the relevant military department and reported to Congress
- **Competitive prototyping**: For all major defense acquisition programs (MDAPs), require at least two competitive prototypes through the technology maturation phase before selecting a single contractor for production
- **Second-source requirements**: For high-volume procurement items (munitions, vehicles, components), require the DoD to qualify and maintain at least two production sources
- **Data rights**: Require the government to retain sufficient technical data rights to enable competition for upgrades, sustainment, and future production lots
- **Modular open systems**: Mandate the use of modular open systems architecture for all new major programs to enable competition at the subsystem level even when the prime contractor is a sole source

### Evidence Base

- GAO analysis found that competitive contracts average 15-25% lower costs than sole-source contracts
- The Great Engine War between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney (1984-2007) for F-16 engines demonstrated that dual-sourcing can reduce costs by 20%+ and improve quality
- The competitive development of the F-22 (Lockheed vs. Northrop) and F-35 (Lockheed vs. Boeing) demonstrated that competitive prototyping produces better designs

## Solution 4: Cost-Plus Contract Reform

### Problem Addressed

Cost-plus contracting creates incentives for cost growth rather than efficiency (Root Cause 4).

### Proposal

**Shift risk to contractors and penalize cost overruns**:

- **Default to fixed-price**: Make firm fixed-price contracts the default for all defense procurement, with cost-plus contracts requiring a written justification that no commercial alternative exists and that the technology risk is genuinely too high for fixed-price contracting
- **Cost overrun penalties**: For any contract type, impose automatic fee reductions when costs exceed the baseline estimate by more than 10%. For overruns exceeding 25%, the contractor must absorb all additional costs up to the full contract value
- **"Should cost" reviews**: Require independent "should cost" reviews for all contracts above $100 million, conducted by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) with access to contractor accounting systems
- **Earned value transparency**: Require real-time public reporting of earned value management data for all major programs, enabling independent monitoring of cost and schedule performance

### Evidence Base

- The KC-46 tanker program demonstrated that fixed-price development contracts can force contractors to absorb overruns (Boeing has absorbed over $7 billion in losses)
- GAO has repeatedly recommended shifting more risk to contractors through fixed-price contracts
- Commercial aerospace (Airbus, Boeing commercial) operates primarily on fixed-price contracts and achieves significantly lower cost growth than defense programs

## Solution 5: Industrial Base Diversification

### Problem Addressed

Excessive concentration in the defense industrial base reduces competition and creates single points of failure (Root Causes 1 and 3).

### Proposal

**Actively promote competition and new entrants**:

- **Small and mid-tier firm set-asides**: Increase the DoD small business contracting goal from 23% to 30% and create a new "mid-tier" category (firms with $500 million to $5 billion in revenue) with a 15% set-aside
- **New entrant support**: Create a Defense Innovation On-Ramp program that provides simplified contracting pathways, mentoring, and bridge financing for commercial technology firms entering the defense market
- **Merger review reform**: Require the DoD to formally object to any merger that would reduce the number of qualified bidders in a critical defense market segment to fewer than three. Give the FTC enhanced authority to block defense sector mergers that reduce competition below this threshold
- **Dual-use investment**: Increase investment in dual-use technologies (applicable to both commercial and defense markets) to reduce the defense industrial base's dependence on government-only products
- **Supply chain mapping**: Require annual public reporting on market concentration by defense market segment, including identification of sole-source and single-point-of-failure dependencies

### Evidence Base

- The DoD's own Industrial Base Strategy (2024) acknowledges the risks of excessive consolidation
- The success of SpaceX in challenging the United Launch Alliance duopoly demonstrates that new entrants can reduce costs dramatically when given the opportunity to compete
- International allies (UK, France, Germany) maintain more competitive defense industrial bases through deliberate industrial policy

## Solution 6: Independent Cost Estimation

### Problem Addressed

Chronic underestimation of weapons system costs enables "buy-in" pricing and results in cost overruns that are discovered only after the government is committed (Root Cause 5).

### Proposal

**Strengthen independent cost estimation and make it binding**:

- **Expand CAPE authority**: The Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office should be elevated to a Senate-confirmed position reporting directly to the Secretary of Defense, with authority to reject program budgets that rely on optimistic cost estimates
- **Independent lifecycle cost reviews**: Require independent lifecycle cost estimates at every major milestone decision, conducted by teams that include external experts with no financial ties to the program's contractors
- **Historical cost database**: Create and maintain a public database of actual costs for completed defense programs, enabling more accurate estimation for future programs
- **Penalty for low-ball estimates**: If a program's actual cost exceeds the baseline estimate by more than 15%, the responsible service must identify offsetting savings from within its own budget before receiving additional funding

### Evidence Base

- The CBO's cost estimates for defense programs have historically been more accurate than DoD's own estimates, demonstrating the value of independent assessment
- GAO's annual weapons systems assessment consistently finds that DoD underestimates costs for new programs
- The Nunn-McCurdy process, while conceptually sound, has never resulted in a major program cancellation, suggesting that the penalties for cost growth are insufficient

## Solution 7: Congressional Earmark Reform

### Problem Addressed

Congressional adds of $20-30 billion annually to the defense budget distort procurement priorities and serve local political interests rather than strategic needs (Root Cause 3).

### Proposal

**Restructure congressional authority over defense spending**:

- **Military justification requirement**: Any congressional add above the Pentagon's request must include a written military justification from the relevant service chief or combatant commander, made public
- **Transparency**: Require every congressional add to identify the sponsoring member(s) of Congress, the contractor(s) that would benefit, and any campaign contributions received from those contractors
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: Require CBO cost-benefit analysis for any congressional add above $100 million
- **Automatic sunset**: All congressional adds expire after 2 fiscal years unless the Pentagon independently validates the requirement and includes it in the next budget request
- **Aggregate cap**: Limit total congressional adds to 2% of the defense topline (approximately $18 billion at current levels), down from the current ~$24 billion

### Evidence Base

- CBO and CRS analyses consistently show that congressional adds are concentrated in the districts and states of Armed Services and Appropriations committee members
- The Abrams tank production line was kept running by congressional adds even when the Army did not request additional tanks
- Several former HASC and SASC chairs have acknowledged that the adds process is driven more by politics than by strategy

## Solution 8: Acquisition Workforce Professionalization

### Problem Addressed

The DoD acquisition workforce is understaffed, underpaid, and outmatched by the contractors it oversees (Root Causes 5 and 7).

### Proposal

**Invest in a world-class government acquisition workforce**:

- **Pay reform**: Create a Defense Acquisition Professional pay scale that offers salaries competitive with the private sector for key acquisition roles (program managers, contracting officers, cost analysts, engineers)
- **Workforce expansion**: Increase the acquisition workforce by 20% over 5 years, focusing on technical disciplines (systems engineering, software, cost analysis)
- **Training and education**: Expand the Defense Acquisition University and create partnerships with leading engineering schools to provide advanced training for acquisition professionals
- **Career incentives**: Create retention bonuses tied to program performance outcomes (cost, schedule, capability delivered)
- **Anti-capture measures**: Rotate acquisition professionals across programs and services every 3-5 years to prevent capture by specific contractors

### Evidence Base

- The DoD acquisition workforce has shrunk by approximately 50% since the early 1990s while the complexity and dollar value of programs has increased
- GAO has repeatedly identified acquisition workforce shortages as a root cause of procurement failures
- The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (2021) recommended significant investment in government technical talent to keep pace with industry
