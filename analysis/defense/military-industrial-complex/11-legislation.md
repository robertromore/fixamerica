# Military-Industrial Complex: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

The military-industrial complex operates within a legal framework established by Title 10 of the U.S. Code, the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and various ethics statutes including 18 U.S.C. 207 (post-employment restrictions). Despite decades of incremental reform, the existing legal framework is insufficient to address the systemic problems of industry consolidation, revolving door corruption, lobbying distortion, and chronic cost overruns documented in this analysis.

This legislative framework proposes two complementary federal bills. The first, the **Defense Industry Accountability Act**, targets the corruption and influence mechanisms -- the revolving door, lobbying opacity, contractor-funded influence operations, and the lack of independent cost oversight. The second, the **Defense Competition and Innovation Act**, targets the structural market failures -- monopolistic consolidation, barriers to new entrants, perverse contracting incentives, and the absence of meaningful penalties for poor contractor performance.

Together, these bills address both the demand side (government officials susceptible to industry influence) and the supply side (an oligopolistic market structure that enables pricing abuse and stifles innovation).

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for military-industrial complex reform.* Congress possesses clear authority under Article I, Section 8 to "raise and support Armies," "provide and maintain a Navy," and "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." The Necessary and Proper Clause provides additional authority to regulate the acquisition process, the defense industrial base, and post-government employment restrictions for officials involved in defense procurement.

The First Amendment implications of lobbying restrictions are addressed in the Legal Considerations section below.

## Federal Legislation

### The Defense Industry Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To strengthen accountability in the defense-industrial relationship by extending revolving door restrictions, mandating lobbying transparency for defense contractors, banning contractor-funded congressional influence activities, and establishing independent cost estimation for all major defense programs.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Revolving Door**: 4-year cooling-off period for senior DoD acquisition officials before employment by defense contractors; 2-year reverse revolving door for industry executives entering government acquisition roles
2. **Lobbying Transparency**: Real-time disclosure of all lobbying contacts between defense contractors and government officials; think tank funding disclosure requirements
3. **Influence Ban**: Prohibition on defense contractor-funded congressional travel, meals, and events related to defense programs
4. **Independent Cost Estimation**: Elevation of CAPE to a Senate-confirmed position with binding authority over program cost baselines

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To strengthen accountability in defense procurement by restricting
revolving door employment, requiring lobbying transparency, banning
contractor-funded congressional influence, and establishing
independent cost estimation for major defense programs.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Defense Industry Accountability
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Government Accountability Office has documented that
1,718 former senior Department of Defense officials took positions
with defense contractors between 2014 and 2019 (GAO-21-416).
(2) The current 1-year cooling-off period under 18 U.S.C. 207 is
insufficient to prevent conflicts of interest that distort
procurement decisions.
(3) The defense industry spends over $140 million annually on
lobbying, employing over 800 registered lobbyists, approximately
500 of whom are former government officials.
(4) Think tanks and research organizations that receive defense
industry funding produce analysis that shapes procurement policy
without adequate disclosure of funding relationships.
(5) Major defense acquisition programs have experienced average
cost growth of 30-50 percent above initial estimates, in part
because the Department of Defense lacks sufficiently independent
cost estimation authority.
(6) Contractor-funded travel and events for Members of Congress
and their staff create relationships that compromise independent
oversight of defense spending.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) COVERED OFFICIAL.--The term "covered official" means--
    (A) any civilian employee of the Department of Defense at
    grade GS-15 or above who served in an acquisition,

    procurement, contract award, or contract oversight activity
    involving that contractor during the official's last 5 years
    of government service.
    (2) For covered officials who did not have direct and
    substantial involvement with a specific contractor but served
    in a senior acquisition policy role, the cooling-off period
    shall be 2 years.

(b) REVERSE REVOLVING DOOR.--
    (1) No individual who served as an officer, director, or
    senior executive (vice president or above) of a defense
    contractor may be appointed to or serve in an acquisition,
    technology, logistics, or contracting position in the
    Department of Defense for a period of 2 years following the
    date of the individual's separation from the defense
    contractor.
    (2) During the first 4 years of government service following
    separation from a defense contractor, an individual described

    (1) For every major defense acquisition program, the Director
    of CAPE shall establish an independent cost baseline estimate
    prior to each major milestone decision (Milestone A,
    Milestone B, Milestone C, and Full-Rate Production Decision).
    (2) No major defense acquisition program may proceed past a
    milestone decision if the program's approved budget is less
    than the CAPE independent cost estimate, unless the Secretary
    of Defense certifies to the Committees on Armed Services of
    the Senate and House of Representatives that--
        (A) the program is essential to national security;
        (B) no alternative program or capability can meet the
        military requirement; and
        (C) the cost risk is being managed through specific,
        identified mitigation measures.

(c) LIFECYCLE COST REPORTING.--The Director of CAPE shall
publish an annual report to Congress providing updated independent
lifecycle cost estimates for all major defense acquisition programs,
including comparison to original baselines and contractor estimates.

(d) PERSONNEL.--
    (1) The Director of CAPE shall have authority to hire cost
    analysts, engineers, and other technical experts at pay rates
    competitive with the private sector, using direct hire
    authority under section 9905 of title 5, United States Code.
    (2) CAPE personnel shall be subject to financial conflict
    of interest screening and shall not have financial interests
    in defense contractors.

SEC. 8. ACQUISITION WORKFORCE COMPENSATION.

(a) DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROFESSIONAL PAY SCALE.--The Secretary of
Defense shall establish a Defense Acquisition Professional pay
scale for civilian employees serving in acquisition, technology,
logistics, and contracting positions at grade GS-13 and above, with
salaries set at not less than the 75th percentile of comparable
private sector compensation for equivalent positions.

(b) RETENTION BONUSES.--The Secretary of Defense may award
retention bonuses of up to 25 percent of base salary for acquisition
professionals who commit to continued government service for
periods of 3 years or more.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

(a) This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of
enactment.
(b) The revolving door restrictions in Section 4 shall apply to
any covered official who separates from government service on or
after the effective date.
(c) The lobbying transparency requirements in Section 5 shall
apply beginning in the first full fiscal year after the effective
date.
```

**Explanation**: The Defense Industry Accountability Act addresses the demand side of military-industrial complex dysfunction -- the mechanisms by which defense contractors influence government decision-making. The 4-year revolving door cooling-off period is calibrated to exceed the typical procurement cycle for major decisions, ensuring that officials cannot angle for industry employment while making procurement decisions that will benefit their future employer. The lobbying transparency provisions create accountability without banning lobbying outright, respecting First Amendment concerns while ensuring the public can monitor influence operations. The independent cost estimation provisions address the chronic problem of optimistic cost baselines that enable "buy-in" pricing.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Industry will argue that revolving door restrictions deter talent from government service
- First Amendment challenges to lobbying disclosure requirements
- Resistance from Congressional committee members who benefit from contractor-funded events
- Difficulty in enforcement if the IG lacks resources

**Refinements**:

- Pair revolving door restrictions with significant pay increases to offset the career restriction
- Include a "safe harbor" provision for whistleblowers who report revolving door violations
- Phase in lobbying transparency requirements over 2 years to allow compliance infrastructure development

### The Defense Competition and Innovation Act

**Purpose**: To restore meaningful competition in defense procurement by establishing set-asides for small and mid-tier firms, mandating competitive prototyping, imposing penalties for cost overruns, and preventing further monopolistic consolidation of the defense industrial base.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Small/Mid-Tier Set-Asides**: Increase small business target to 30%; create new mid-tier category with 15% set-aside
2. **Competitive Prototyping**: Mandate at least two competitive prototypes for all new MDAPs through technology maturation
3. **Cost Overrun Penalties**: Automatic fee reductions for cost growth; contractor absorbs overruns beyond 25%
4. **Competition Thresholds**: Require DoD to maintain at least 3 qualified bidders in each critical market segment; enhanced antitrust review for defense mergers

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To restore competition in defense procurement, support small and
mid-tier defense firms, mandate competitive prototyping for major
defense programs, impose penalties for cost overruns, and prevent
further monopolistic consolidation of the defense industrial base.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Defense Competition and Innovation
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The number of major defense prime contractors has declined
from over 50 in 1990 to 5 in 2024, creating an oligopolistic
market structure with limited competition.
(2) Approximately 50 percent of Department of Defense contract
dollars are awarded without meaningful competition, either through
sole-source contracts or competitions that attract only a single
bidder.
(3) Major defense acquisition programs have experienced average
cost growth of 30-50 percent above initial estimates, costing
taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.
(4) Small and mid-tier defense firms, which are often the source
of innovative technologies, face significant barriers to entry and
are declining in number.
(5) The geographic distribution of defense subcontracts across
congressional districts is designed to maximize political support
rather than production efficiency, increasing program costs.
(6) The lack of qualified alternative bidders in critical defense
market segments creates both pricing power for incumbent contractors
and strategic vulnerability for the nation.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) CRITICAL DEFENSE MARKET SEGMENT.--The term "critical defense
market segment" means a category of defense products or services
designated by the Secretary of Defense as essential to national
security, including but not limited to tactical aircraft, naval
combatant vessels, submarine propulsion, intercontinental ballistic
missiles, missile defense systems, and strategic communication
systems.
(2) MID-TIER DEFENSE FIRM.--The term "mid-tier defense firm"
means a business concern that--
    (A) has average annual revenue of not less than $500,000,000
    and not more than $5,000,000,000 for the 3 preceding fiscal
    years; and
    (B) is not a subsidiary, affiliate, or joint venture partner
    of a prime defense contractor with annual defense revenue
    exceeding $10,000,000,000.
(3) COMPETITIVE PROTOTYPING.--The term "competitive prototyping"
means the development of at least 2 prototype systems by different
contractors through the technology maturation and risk reduction
phase of a major defense acquisition program.
(4) COST BASELINE.--The term "cost baseline" means the approved
program cost estimate established by the Director of Cost
Assessment and Program Evaluation at the most recent major
milestone decision.

SEC. 4. SMALL AND MID-TIER FIRM SET-ASIDES.

(a) SMALL BUSINESS.--Section 15(g)(1) of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 644(g)(1)) is amended by striking "23 percent" with
respect to Department of Defense contracts and inserting
"30 percent" for all Department of Defense prime contract and
subcontract obligations.

(b) MID-TIER DEFENSE FIRM SET-ASIDE.--
    (1) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a goal that not
    less than 15 percent of the total value of all prime
    contracts and subcontracts awarded by the Department of
    Defense shall be awarded to mid-tier defense firms.
    (2) The Secretary shall establish a Mid-Tier Defense
    Innovation Office to--
        (A) identify contract opportunities suitable for mid-tier
        firms;
        (B) provide technical assistance and mentoring to
        mid-tier firms navigating the defense procurement process;
        (C) monitor prime contractor compliance with mid-tier
        subcontracting goals; and
        (D) report annually to Congress on progress toward the
        15 percent goal.

(c) SUBCONTRACTING COMPLIANCE.--
    (1) For any prime contract in excess of $100,000,000, the
    prime contractor shall submit a subcontracting plan that
    identifies specific small business and mid-tier firm
    subcontracting opportunities.
    (2) Failure to meet subcontracting goals without adequate
    justification shall be a negative factor in future source
    selection evaluations.

SEC. 5. COMPETITIVE PROTOTYPING MANDATE.

(a) REQUIREMENT.--For every new major defense acquisition
program initiated after the date of enactment, the Department of
Defense shall fund competitive prototyping through the technology
maturation and risk reduction phase, with a minimum of 2 competing
contractor teams.

(b) DOWNSELECTION.--
    (1) The milestone decision authority may select a single
    contractor for the engineering and manufacturing development
    phase only after competitive prototyping demonstrates that
    at least 2 viable technical approaches have been evaluated.
    (2) The milestone decision authority shall document the
    reasons for contractor selection in a public record, redacted
    only for classified technical details.

(c) DATA RIGHTS.--
    (1) As a condition of receiving competitive prototyping
    funding, each competing contractor shall grant the Department
    of Defense unlimited rights to technical data and computer
    software developed under the prototyping contract.
    (2) The Department shall retain these data rights for the
    purpose of enabling competition in future production lots,
    upgrades, and sustainment.

(d) WAIVER.--The Secretary of Defense may waive the competitive
prototyping requirement for a specific program if the Secretary
certifies to the congressional defense committees that--
    (A) only one domestic source is technically capable of
    developing the system;
    (B) competitive prototyping would delay fielding by more
    than 3 years and the delay poses an unacceptable risk to
    national security; or
    (C) the estimated cost of competitive prototyping exceeds
    20 percent of the total program acquisition cost.

SEC. 6. COST OVERRUN PENALTIES.

(a) FEE REDUCTION.--
    (1) For any defense contract (cost-plus, fixed-price
    incentive, or cost-sharing), if the final contract cost
    exceeds the cost baseline by more than 10 percent, the
    contractor's fee shall be reduced by 1 percentage point for
    every 5 percentage points of cost growth above 10 percent.
    (2) In no case shall the total fee be reduced below zero.

(b) CONTRACTOR ABSORPTION.--
    (1) For any defense contract, if the final contract cost
    exceeds the cost baseline by more than 25 percent, the
    contractor shall absorb all costs in excess of 125 percent
    of the baseline.
    (2) The contractor may not recover absorbed costs through
    any subsequent contract, modification, equitable adjustment,
    or claim.

(c) GOVERNMENT-CAUSED OVERRUNS.--
    (1) The cost overrun penalties in subsections (a) and (b)
    shall not apply to cost growth attributable to changes in
    government-furnished requirements, government-caused delays,
    or directed changes ordered by the contracting officer.
    (2) Any claim of government-caused cost growth must be
    documented by the contractor and verified by the Defense
    Contract Audit Agency within 180 days.

(d) REPORTING.--For any contract where cost growth exceeds
15 percent, the program manager shall submit a report to the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment and
to the congressional defense committees identifying--
    (1) the causes of cost growth;
    (2) the amount attributable to contractor performance versus
    government-caused factors;
    (3) the fee reduction applied under subsection (a); and
    (4) remedial actions taken to prevent further cost growth.

SEC. 7. DEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION THRESHOLDS.

(a) MARKET ASSESSMENT.--
    (1) The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the
    Federal Trade Commission, shall conduct an annual assessment
    of competition in each critical defense market segment.
    (2) The assessment shall identify--
        (A) the number of qualified domestic bidders in each
        segment;
        (B) the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index for each segment;
        (C) any segment in which a single contractor holds more
        than 50 percent market share; and
        (D) any segment in which the number of qualified domestic
        bidders has declined to fewer than 3.

(b) COMPETITION THRESHOLD.--
    (1) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a goal of
    maintaining not fewer than 3 qualified domestic bidders in
    each critical defense market segment.
    (2) For any segment in which the number of qualified domestic
    bidders falls below 3, the Secretary shall develop and submit
    to Congress a plan to restore competition, which may include--
        (A) qualifying new domestic sources through development
        contracts;
        (B) investing in mid-tier firm capabilities;
        (C) establishing government-owned production facilities;
        (D) qualifying allied nation sources through reciprocal
        procurement agreements; or
        (E) requiring the incumbent contractor to license
        technology to potential competitors.

(c) MERGER REVIEW.--
    (1) No merger, acquisition, or joint venture involving two
    or more defense contractors with combined annual defense
    revenue exceeding $5,000,000,000 may be completed without
    prior written approval from the Secretary of Defense.
    (2) The Secretary shall withhold approval for any transaction
    that would reduce the number of qualified domestic bidders in
    any critical defense market segment to fewer than 3.
    (3) The Secretary's determination shall be provided to the
    Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice
    Antitrust Division and shall be given substantial weight in
    any antitrust review.

SEC. 8. MODULAR OPEN SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE.

(a) REQUIREMENT.--All new major defense acquisition programs
initiated after the date of enactment shall employ modular open
systems architecture, as defined in section 4401 of title 10,
United States Code, to enable competition at the subsystem level.

(b) EXISTING PROGRAMS.--For major defense acquisition programs
already in production, the Secretary of Defense shall evaluate the
feasibility and cost-effectiveness of transitioning to modular
open systems architecture during planned upgrades and block
modifications.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE AND IMPLEMENTATION.

(a) This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of
enactment.
(b) The competitive prototyping requirement in Section 5 shall
apply to all major defense acquisition programs that have not
passed Milestone A as of the effective date.
(c) The cost overrun penalty provisions in Section 6 shall apply
to all new contracts awarded after the effective date.
(d) The first annual market competition assessment under
Section 7 shall be completed not later than 1 year after the
effective date.
```

**Explanation**: The Defense Competition and Innovation Act addresses the supply side of military-industrial complex dysfunction -- the market structure that enables pricing abuse and stifles innovation. The small and mid-tier set-asides are designed to preserve a diverse industrial base and prevent further consolidation. The competitive prototyping mandate is based on historical evidence that competition in the development phase produces better designs and more accurate cost estimates. The cost overrun penalties shift financial risk to contractors, incentivizing realistic bidding and efficient execution. The market competition thresholds create a proactive framework for maintaining competition rather than reacting to mergers after the damage is done.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Defense firms will argue that set-asides reduce efficiency and increase costs
- Competitive prototyping increases short-term development costs (offset by lower production costs)
- Cost overrun penalties may discourage firms from bidding on high-risk programs
- Merger review provisions may face legal challenges on antitrust and due process grounds

**Refinements**:

- Include a "technology risk sharing" mechanism for programs with genuinely high technical uncertainty, where the government and contractor share overrun costs proportionally
- Phase in the 30% small business target over 5 years to allow market adjustment
- Create an "innovation incentive" that allows contractors to earn bonus fees for achieving cost and schedule targets, balancing the penalty structure

---

## State Model Legislation

*State-level legislation is not the primary mechanism for defense procurement reform, as defense contracting is overwhelmingly a federal function. However, states can support reform through complementary measures:*

### Model State Defense Industry Transparency Act

**Purpose**: To require defense contractors operating in the state to disclose lobbying activities and revolving door employment involving state officials with influence over defense-related economic development decisions.

**Key Provisions**:

- Require defense contractors receiving state economic development incentives to disclose all federal lobbying expenditures
- Require state pension funds holding defense contractor stock to support shareholder resolutions on lobbying disclosure and executive compensation transparency
- Establish state-level economic diversification planning for defense-dependent communities

---

## Regulatory Framework

### DoD Acquisition Regulation Amendments

**Existing Authority**: The Secretary of Defense has authority under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to implement procurement policy changes.

**Draft Regulation**: The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment should issue a policy memorandum implementing the following:

- Requirement for competitive prototyping on all MDAPs (pending legislation)
- Expanded "should cost" reviews for all contracts above $100 million
- Enhanced earned value management reporting with public access to non-classified data
- Updated source selection criteria that include past performance on cost control as a mandatory evaluation factor

### FTC Coordination

The Federal Trade Commission should coordinate with the DoD on defense sector merger reviews, including:

- Joint analysis of market concentration in critical defense market segments
- Shared assessment of the competitive effects of proposed mergers
- Development of defense-specific antitrust guidelines that balance competition with national security considerations

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

#### First Amendment and Lobbying Restrictions

The First Amendment protects the right to petition the government, which includes lobbying. The Supreme Court has held that lobbying is protected speech (*Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc.*, 365 U.S. 127 (1961)). However, the government may impose reasonable disclosure requirements on lobbying activities without violating the First Amendment. The lobbying transparency provisions in the Defense Industry Accountability Act require disclosure, not prohibition, of lobbying contacts, and are modeled on the existing Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, which has been upheld as constitutional.

The ban on contractor-funded congressional travel and events is more restrictive but is framed as a condition of doing business with the government rather than a general restriction on speech. Defense contractors are not compelled to seek government contracts; the travel ban applies only to firms that choose to participate in the defense market.

#### Fifth Amendment and Takings

The merger review provisions in the Defense Competition and Innovation Act could raise Fifth Amendment concerns if they are perceived as depriving contractors of property rights. However, the provisions do not require divestiture of existing assets; they establish prospective conditions on future mergers. The government's authority to regulate mergers under the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18) is well established, and the addition of a national security review dimension does not create a taking.

#### Due Process

The cost overrun penalty provisions must include adequate due process protections, including:

- Clear definition of the cost baseline against which overruns are measured
- A fair process for determining whether cost growth is government-caused (exempted) or contractor-caused (penalized)
- Opportunity for the contractor to contest penalty determinations through the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals or the Court of Federal Claims

### Preemption Questions

Defense procurement is an exclusively federal function, and state laws that conflict with federal procurement regulations are preempted under the Supremacy Clause. The model state legislation proposed above is designed to complement, not conflict with, federal procurement law by addressing state-level transparency and economic development issues.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Revolving door**: DoD Inspector General investigation and enforcement; civil penalties and contractor debarment
- **Lobbying transparency**: IG-maintained database with compliance monitoring; congressional committee enforcement of testimony exclusion
- **Cost overrun penalties**: Automatic application through contract terms; disputes resolved through existing contract dispute resolution mechanisms (ASBCA, Court of Federal Claims)
- **Merger review**: Secretary of Defense determination with judicial review available under the Administrative Procedure Act

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The competitive prototyping mandate should be reviewed after 10 years to assess its effect on program costs and schedules
- The small business and mid-tier set-aside targets should be reviewed every 5 years and adjusted based on market conditions
- The market competition thresholds should be updated annually based on the Secretary of Defense's market assessment

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Defense Industry Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Consulting circumvention | Former officials could provide "strategic advice" through consulting firms rather than direct employment, evading the cooling-off period | Critical |
| Family member hiring | Contractors could hire family members of current officials to circumvent revolving door restrictions | High |
| Think tank intermediary | Former officials could join defense-funded think tanks during the cooling-off period, maintaining influence without technically "working for" a contractor | High |
| Subthreshold contractors | Firms with less than $25 million in DoD contracts would not be covered, enabling officials to join subsidiary or affiliated firms | Medium |
| Lobbying contact definition | Informal communications (social events, personal relationships) may not meet the statutory definition of "lobbying contact" | High |
| Waiver abuse | Ethics waivers could be granted routinely, undermining the cooling-off period | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Enforcement resource constraints | IG may lack staff and budget to monitor compliance across thousands of former officials | Chronic underfunding of oversight functions |
| Compensation gap | Even with pay increases, government salaries will remain below industry levels, maintaining the financial incentive to leave | Structural pay caps on federal employees |
| Cultural resistance | The revolving door is deeply embedded in defense culture and will be resisted by both government and industry personnel | Institutional norms and social networks |
| Limited applicability to Congress | Congressional staff revolving door restrictions are weaker and not addressed by this bill | Separation of powers; Congress self-regulates |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-circumvention clause**: Amend Section 4 to include consulting, advisory, and board membership roles within the definition of "employment" with a defense contractor
2. **Family member disclosure**: Require covered officials to disclose employment of immediate family members by defense contractors during their government service and for 4 years after separation
3. **Think tank cooling-off**: Include employment by think tanks that receive more than 25% of funding from defense contractors within the revolving door restrictions
4. **Aggregation rule**: Aggregate defense contract revenue across parent companies, subsidiaries, and affiliates when applying the $25 million threshold
5. **Informal contact reporting**: Expand the lobbying contact definition to include any communication regarding a defense program or contract, regardless of formality or setting
6. **Waiver limits**: Cap the number of ethics waivers at 10 per fiscal year and require Senate Armed Services Committee notification for each waiver

### Defense Competition and Innovation Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Set-aside gaming | Large firms could create nominally independent "small" or "mid-tier" subsidiaries to capture set-aside contracts | Critical |
| Prototyping waiver abuse | The national security waiver for competitive prototyping could be routinely invoked to avoid the requirement | High |
| Cost baseline manipulation | Programs could set artificially high baselines to avoid triggering overrun penalties | High |
| Government-caused defense | Contractors could attribute overruns to government-caused changes even when the root cause is contractor performance | High |
| Merger structuring | Defense firms could structure transactions as joint ventures or strategic alliances to avoid the merger review threshold | Medium |
| Data rights resistance | Contractors could claim trade secret protections to resist government data rights, litigating each case individually | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Short-term cost increase | Competitive prototyping increases upfront development costs by 15-30% | Investment in competition has upfront costs |
| Limited international applicability | U.S. reforms may disadvantage domestic firms in international competition | Unilateral regulation in a global market |
| Workforce limitations | Increased competition requires more acquisition personnel to manage multiple contractor relationships | Acquisition workforce shortage |
| Political sustainability | Congressional adds will continue to distort procurement priorities unless earmark reform is also enacted | This bill does not address congressional behavior |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Affiliation rules**: Adopt strict Small Business Administration affiliation rules that treat subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint ventures of large firms as part of the parent company for set-aside purposes
2. **Waiver reporting**: Require the Secretary of Defense to report all competitive prototyping waivers to Congress with a detailed justification; limit waivers to no more than 3 per fiscal year
3. **Independent baseline**: Require CAPE (under the DIAA) to establish the cost baseline, removing the ability of program offices to set their own baselines
4. **Burden of proof**: Place the burden of proof on the contractor to demonstrate that cost growth is government-caused, with DCAA verification
5. **Broad transaction coverage**: Define "merger" to include joint ventures, strategic alliances, exclusive teaming agreements, and any transaction that reduces the number of independent bidders in a market segment
6. **Data rights enforcement**: Create a streamlined dispute resolution process for data rights claims with a presumption in favor of government access for competitively funded development work

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|---|---|
| Industry lobbying against implementation | Build reform coalition before legislation; lock in transparency measures first |
| Bureaucratic resistance within DoD | Tie implementation milestones to leadership performance evaluations |
| Insufficient appropriations for enforcement | Authorize dedicated funding for IG compliance monitoring in the enabling legislation |
| Judicial challenges | Draft provisions to withstand intermediate scrutiny; include severability clause |
| Coordination between DIAA and DCIA | Designate USD(A&S) as the single implementation authority for both bills |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Both bills should include a 10-year sunset clause with mandatory reauthorization, forcing Congress to review their effectiveness
- The GAO should be directed to conduct an independent assessment of implementation effectiveness at years 3, 5, and 10
- The Secretary of Defense should submit annual implementation reports to the congressional defense committees
