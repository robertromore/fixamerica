# Defense Industrial Base: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to fundamentally reform the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) face powerful opposition from entrenched interests that benefit from the status quo and from those who are ideologically opposed to a more interventionist industrial policy.

## Opposition from the "Iron Triangle"

The most significant opposition comes from the three sides of the "Iron Triangle"—the prime contractors, their supporters in Congress, and parts of the DoD bureaucracy—who have a shared interest in preserving the current system.

| Argument | Proponents' Claim | Rebuttal / Counterpoint |
|---|---|---|
| **"Reform is Too Risky"** | The current system, while slow and expensive, ultimately produces the world's most advanced weapon systems. Radical reforms, like breaking up prime contractors or relying on unproven startups, could jeopardize national security and fail to deliver. | The current system is the real risk. Its lack of surge capacity and dependence on Chinese supply chains is a critical national security failure waiting to happen. The risk of inaction is greater than the risk of reform. |
| **"We Need Stability"** | Large, long-term, cost-plus contracts provide the stability needed for companies to make massive, multi-decade investments in shipyards, factories, and a skilled workforce. More competition and shorter contracts would create uncertainty and discourage investment. | The current "stability" is a form of corporate welfare that insulates contractors from accountability for cost overruns and poor performance. Competition, not guaranteed contracts, is the true driver of efficiency and innovation. |
| **"Only Primes Can Do Systems Integration"** | Building a complex system like a fighter jet or an aircraft carrier requires a level of systems integration expertise that only the large prime contractors possess. Startups can build components, but they can't build a whole system. | This is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The current system never gives smaller companies the opportunity to develop that expertise. A "modular open systems approach" would allow the DoD to act as the lead systems integrator, using components from a wide range of competing suppliers. |

**Key Opposing Stakeholders**: The "Big Five" prime contractors, members of Congress with major defense plants in their districts, and some DoD program offices with long-standing relationships with incumbent contractors.

## The Free Market / Libertarian Critique

This opposition comes from those who are ideologically opposed to government intervention in the economy.

| Argument | Proponents' Claim | Rebuttal / Counterpoint |
|---|---|---|
| **"Industrial Policy is Picking Winners and Losers"** | Government attempts to shape the industrial base through subsidies, "on-shoring" mandates, and investments via the Defense Production Act are a form of "industrial policy." The government is notoriously bad at this and will inevitably waste taxpayer money on politically connected firms. | The defense market is not a free market; it is a government-managed monopsony. The government is already "picking winners" through its contracting decisions. The choice is not between industrial policy and a free market, but between a deliberate, strategic industrial policy and an accidental, incoherent one. |
| **"Let the Market Work"** | The most efficient way to build a supply chain is to let companies source materials and components from the lowest-cost producer, wherever they are in the world. Mandating domestic production is a form of protectionism that will raise costs for the DoD and taxpayers. | Prioritizing short-term efficiency over long-term resilience is what created the current strategic vulnerability to China. Paying a premium for a secure, domestic supply chain is a necessary cost of national security, akin to an insurance policy. |

**Key Opposing Stakeholders**: Libertarian think tanks (e.g., Cato Institute), free-market advocacy groups, and some fiscally conservative Republicans.

## The Bureaucratic Resistance

| Argument | Proponents' Claim | Rebuttal / Counterpoint |
|---|---|---|
| **"Startups Can't Meet Our Requirements"** | Commercial startups don't understand the military's rigorous requirements for security, reliability, and performance in harsh environments. Their products are not "militarized" enough. | This is a culture clash. The DoD's requirements process is often overly rigid and calls for bespoke solutions when a modified commercial product would be 80% as good, available immediately, and 90% cheaper. The DoD needs to adapt its requirements to the speed of the commercial market, not the other way around. |
| **"It's Too Hard to Change"** | The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the DoD's internal processes are too complex and deeply entrenched to be fundamentally changed. | This is an argument for accepting failure. Congress can and should grant the DoD new, flexible acquisition authorities and mandate a simplification of the existing rulebook. |

**Key Opposing Stakeholders**: The DoD's acquisition bureaucracy, lawyers, and contracting officers who are trained in and comfortable with the existing, complex system.
