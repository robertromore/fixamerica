# Defense Policy

## Overview

The United States faces a pivotal moment in its defense posture, navigating the transition from two decades of counter-insurgency to an era of renewed great power competition. The Department of Defense (DoD) must simultaneously modernize its forces to deter near-peer adversaries like China and Russia, maintain global stability, and address emerging threats in domains like space and cyberspace. This requires balancing immense fiscal pressures with the need for technological superiority and a ready, resilient all-volunteer force.

Core challenges include a defense budget that, while the world's largest, is strained by rising personnel costs and complex, delayed procurement programs. The military services face significant recruiting and retention hurdles, and the defense industrial base is struggling to adapt to the demands of high-tech, scalable production. Addressing these issues is critical to ensuring the U.S. military can effectively protect national interests and uphold global security commitments in a volatile world.

## Scope

This analysis examines the primary components of U.S. defense policy:

- **National Security Strategy**: The overarching framework for identifying threats and aligning military capabilities with foreign policy goals.
- **Defense Budget and Procurement**: The allocation of resources, acquisition of new weapon systems, and management of the defense industrial base.
- **Military Personnel**: The recruitment, retention, training, and well-being of the all-volunteer force.
- **Force Structure and Readiness**: The size, composition, and operational preparedness of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Space Force.
- **Technology and Innovation**: The development and integration of emerging technologies like AI, autonomy, and cyber capabilities.
- **Alliances and Partnerships**: The role of NATO and other security agreements in collective defense and burden-sharing.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| DoD Budget Request (FY2025) | $850 billion | DoD, 2024 |
| Active Duty Personnel | ~1.3 million | DoD, 2025 |
| Reserve & Guard Personnel | ~0.8 million | DoD, 2025 |
| Total Navy Battle Force Ships | ~296 | U.S. Navy, 2025 |
| Total Air Force Aircraft | ~5,200 | U.S. Air Force, 2025 |
| F-35 Program Lifecycle Cost | ~$1.7 trillion | GAO, 2024 |
| Veterans Population | ~16 million | VA, 2025 |
| U.S. Share of Global Military Spending | ~37% | SIPRI, 2024 |
| Troops Stationed Overseas | ~177,000 | DoD, 2025 |
| Defense Spending as % of GDP | ~3.2% | OMB, 2025 |

## Why This Matters

**Strategic Deterrence**: A capable and credible military is the primary instrument for deterring aggression against the U.S. and its allies. Failure to modernize or maintain readiness invites challenges from adversaries.

**Economic Impact**: The defense budget is the largest category of federal discretionary spending. Procurement decisions shape a vast industrial base, drive technological innovation, and employ millions of Americans, but waste and inefficiency have significant economic costs.

**Global Stability**: U.S. military presence underpins security in key regions, from Europe to the Indo-Pacific. The strength of U.S. alliances and partnerships depends on a reliable American military commitment.

**Human Cost**: Decisions on when and how to use military force have profound human consequences for service members, their families, and civilian populations. The health and well-being of the all-volunteer force and the nation's veterans are a sacred trust.

## Political Context

Defense policy enjoys broad bipartisan support, but consensus frays on key details.

- **Conservatives/Hawks** typically advocate for higher spending levels, a focus on military strength as the primary tool of deterrence, and robust modernization of the nuclear arsenal.
- **Liberals/Progressives** often call for reduced defense spending to fund domestic priorities, greater emphasis on diplomacy and alliances, and increased oversight of the military-industrial complex.
- **Libertarians/Restraint Advocates** argue for a less interventionist foreign policy, a smaller global military footprint, and a defense budget focused strictly on protecting the homeland.

The "iron triangle" of Congress, the DoD, and the defense industry creates powerful constituencies that resist changes to major procurement programs, even those that are over-budget and behind schedule.

## Key Challenges

### Strategic Challenges

- **Pacing Threat from China**: Aligning the force structure, technology, and logistics to effectively deter China in the Indo-Pacific.
- **Resurgent Russia**: Maintaining a credible deterrent in Europe while meeting challenges elsewhere.
- **Emerging Domains**: Defending national interests in space and cyberspace, which have low barriers to entry for adversaries.

### Institutional Challenges

- **Procurement Dysfunction**: The acquisition process is notoriously slow, expensive, and risk-averse, hindering the rapid fielding of new technologies.
- **Recruiting Crisis**: All services are struggling to meet recruiting goals amid a strong civilian job market, declining eligibility, and a smaller pool of young Americans interested in serving.
- **Fiscal Pressures**: Growing national debt and mandatory spending on domestic programs create long-term pressure on the defense budget.

## Reform Principles

Effective defense policy reform should:

1. **Prioritize Strategy**: Budgets and force structure should be driven by a clear, disciplined national security strategy, not the other way around.
2. **Foster Innovation**: Reform procurement to favor speed, agility, and competition, embracing software-defined systems and commercial technology.
3. **Invest in People**: Ensure competitive compensation, high quality of life, and robust support for service members, families, and veterans to sustain the all-volunteer force.
4. **Strengthen Alliances**: Leverage allies and partners as a core strategic advantage, promoting interoperability and burden-sharing.
5. **Demand Accountability**: Enforce rigorous oversight of spending, program performance, and ethical conduct to maintain public trust.
