# Budget and Procurement: Stakeholders

The defense budget and acquisition process is dominated by the powerful, interlocking interests of the "Iron Triangle." Understanding the incentives of these key stakeholders is crucial to understanding why the system is so resistant to reform.

## The "Iron Triangle"

This is the core group of stakeholders whose interactions drive the system.

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **Congress** (Armed Services & Appropriations Committees) | Securing jobs and federal spending for their districts/states to ensure re-election. | **The Funder.** Has the constitutional "power of the purse." Can authorize, fund, add to, or kill programs. |
| **Department of Defense (DoD)** (Military Services, Program Managers) | Acquiring advanced weapon systems to meet military requirements; increasing their service's budget and influence. | **The Customer.** The DoD is the monopsony buyer; it sets the requirements for all major programs. |
| **The Defense Industry** (Prime Contractors) | Winning large, long-term, profitable government contracts. | **The Supplier.** Possesses the unique technical expertise and facilities to build major systems. Employs thousands of voters in key districts and has immense lobbying power. |

**The Dynamic**: The DoD wants a new weapon system. A contractor (e.g., Lockheed Martin) promises to build it, often spreading the subcontracts and jobs across as many congressional districts as possible (a practice known as "political engineering"). Members of Congress then fight to fund the program to protect those jobs. This creates a powerful, self-reinforcing coalition that makes it nearly impossible to cancel a major program, no matter how poorly it performs.

## Other Key Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Role in the System |
|---|---|---|
| **The White House (Office of Management and Budget - OMB)** | Balancing defense spending against other federal priorities (healthcare, education, etc.); enforcing the President's overall budget plan. | **The Arbiter.** OMB acts as the gatekeeper for the President's budget request, often forcing the DoD to make tough choices to fit within overall spending caps. |
| **DoD "Cost Estimators"** (CAPE) | Providing independent, objective cost estimates for major programs to counter the "conspiracy of optimism." | **The Reality Check.** The Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office provides independent analysis directly to the Secretary of Defense. |
| **DoD "Testers"** (DOT&E) | Conducting independent operational testing to see if a weapon actually works in realistic combat conditions. | **The Grader.** The Director, Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) reports directly to Congress and can be a major roadblock for a program that is not performing as promised. |
| **"Good Government" Groups** (e.g., Project on Government Oversight - POGO) | Exposing waste, fraud, and abuse in defense spending. | **The Watchdog.** Uses investigative journalism and analysis to bring public and congressional attention to failing programs. |
| **Taxpayers** | A strong national defense at a reasonable cost. | **The Bill Payer.** Ultimately fund the entire enterprise but have limited direct influence over the complex process. |

## Stakeholder Conflicts

### Congress vs. The DoD

- **The Dynamic**: The DoD, for strategic reasons, may want to cancel an obsolete weapon system (like the A-10 aircraft or a specific class of ship) to free up funds for a more modern one.
- **Congress's Position**: If the A-10 is based in a powerful senator's state, or the ship is built in a key representative's district, that member will use their power on the Armed Services Committee to pass a law forbidding the DoD from retiring the system.
- **Result**: Congress often forces the DoD to spend billions on systems it doesn't want, undermining strategic discipline in favor of local politics.

### Program Managers vs. The Bureaucracy

- **Program Manager's Goal**: To deliver a new capability to the warfighter on time and on budget.
- **The Bureaucracy's Goal**: To avoid risk and ensure all processes are followed.
- **The Conflict**: A program manager who wants to move fast and take a smart risk is often stymied by a multi-layered bureaucracy (legal, contracting, engineering) where dozens of people can say "no" but no one can say "yes."

### DoD vs. OMB

- **DoD's Position**: We need more money to meet the threats outlined in the National Defense Strategy.
- **OMB's Position**: You need to fit your needs within the overall federal budget, which includes non-defense priorities and is constrained by the national debt.
- **The Conflict**: This is the central tension in the development of the President's annual budget request, with OMB forcing the DoD to make internal tradeoffs.
