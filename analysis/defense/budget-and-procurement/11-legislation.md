# Budget and Procurement: Legislation

## Overview

The U.S. defense budget and procurement system is governed by a complex web of statutes, primarily Title 10 of the U.S. Code, the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and the annual defense appropriations bills. The current system, rooted in the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process developed in the 1960s under Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, is widely criticized for being too slow, rigid, and risk-averse to keep pace with modern technological change and strategic competition. The Department of Defense manages an annual budget exceeding $850 billion and over $400 billion in annual contract obligations, making it the largest contracting entity in the world.

Despite decades of reform efforts -- including the Goldwater-Nichols Act (1986), the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (1994), and numerous NDAA provisions -- systemic problems persist. The DoD remains the only federal agency unable to pass a clean financial audit. Major weapon systems routinely exceed cost estimates by 50 percent or more. The average time from requirements identification to initial fielding now exceeds 10 years for major programs, while commercial technology cycles operate on 18-month timelines.

This legislative framework proposes a comprehensive modernization of defense resourcing through two complementary bills. The first, the Defense Acquisition and Financial Accountability Act, addresses internal DoD processes by replacing rigid budget categories with portfolio-based funding, mandating financial auditability with automatic penalties for failure, and streamlining software acquisition. The second, the Defense Industrial Base Resilience Act, addresses the external industrial ecosystem by reducing dependence on adversary supply chains, fostering competition through lower barriers for new entrants, and investing in the workforce needed to sustain defense manufacturing.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for budget and procurement reform.* Congress possesses clear and well-established authority under Article I, Section 8 to "raise and support Armies," "provide and maintain a Navy," and "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." The Appropriations Clause (Article I, Section 9, Clause 7) further vests Congress with exclusive control over federal spending, and the Necessary and Proper Clause provides broad power to structure the administrative processes by which defense funds are allocated and expended.

The reforms proposed in this framework operate entirely within Congress's existing constitutional authority. Portfolio budgeting, audit requirements, carryover authority, and procurement preferences are all matters of statutory design that Congress can modify without constitutional amendment. The primary constitutional tension -- the balance between congressional spending power and Executive operational flexibility -- is addressed through legislative mechanisms (notification requirements, transfer caps, and sunset provisions) rather than constitutional restructuring.

## Federal Legislation

### The Defense Acquisition and Financial Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To overhaul the Department of Defense's budgeting and acquisition processes to increase agility, enforce financial accountability, and accelerate the fielding of new technologies.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **PPBE Reform**: Replaces the legacy PPBE process with a Strategy-Driven Resource Allocation (SDRA) model, utilizing portfolio budgeting to allow flexibility within mission areas.
2. **Audit Triggers**: Establishes automatic budget withholds for DoD components that fail to achieve a clean financial audit by FY2028.
3. **"Use It or Lose It" Repeal**: Allows DoD components to carry over up to 5% of Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds to the next fiscal year to prevent wasteful end-of-year spending.
4. **Commercial First**: Mandates a "commercial preference" in acquisition, requiring justification for any custom military development where a commercial equivalent exists.
5. **Software Color of Money**: Creates a single budget appropriation for software ("BA-8") to enable continuous development and updates (DevSecOps).

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To reform the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution processes of the Department of Defense, ensure financial auditability, and modernize defense acquisition.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Defense Acquisition and Financial Accountability Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Department of Defense (DoD) remains the only Federal agency that has never passed a clean financial audit, despite a statutory requirement to do so since the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-576).
(2) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that cost growth on DoD's portfolio of major defense acquisition programs exceeded $1 trillion over the last two decades (GAO-23-106059).
(3) In FY 2023, the DoD reported over $3.8 trillion in accounting adjustments that could not be adequately documented (DoD OIG Report No. DODIG-2024-065).
(4) The current Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process takes an average of two years to align resources with requirements, creating a "valley of death" for emerging technologies.
(5) The PPBE Reform Commission, established by Section 1004 of the FY2022 NDAA, concluded that the existing process is "not designed for—and is incapable of meeting—the needs of a department that must move at speed and scale" (March 2024 Final Report).
(6) Wasteful "use it or lose it" spending in the final month of the fiscal year accounts for billions of dollars in low-priority expenditures annually, with GAO finding that DoD obligations spike by 35 percent in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year (GAO-13-531).
(7) Software-intensive defense programs experience an average cost overrun of 75 percent and schedule delays of 24 months due to rigid appropriation categories that conflict with modern iterative development practices (GAO-22-104629).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) PORTFOLIO BUDGETING.—The term "portfolio budgeting" means a resource allocation method that appropriates funds to high-level mission areas or capability sets rather than specific program line items.
(2) CLEAN AUDIT.—The term "clean audit" means an unmodified audit opinion from an independent public accountant.
(3) COMMERCIAL ITEM.—The term "commercial item" has the meaning given in 48 CFR 2.101.

SEC. 4. STRATEGY-DRIVEN RESOURCE ALLOCATION.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Defense shall transition from the PPBE process to a Strategy-Driven Resource Allocation (SDRA) framework not later than October 1, 2028.
(b) PORTFOLIO STRUCTURE.—Under SDRA, budget requests shall be organized by capability portfolios (e.g., "Air Dominance," "Undersea Warfare") rather than individual platforms.
(c) TRANSFER AUTHORITY.—Program managers shall have authority to transfer up to 20 percent of funds between projects within a portfolio without prior congressional approval, subject to quarterly reporting.

SEC. 5. FINANCIAL AUDIT ENFORCEMENT.

(a) DEADLINE.—Each military department and defense agency must achieve a clean audit opinion by the end of fiscal year 2028.
(b) PENALTY.—If a department or agency fails to achieve a clean audit by the deadline, the Secretary of Defense shall withhold 1 percent of that component's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) budget for the subsequent fiscal year.
(c) ESCALATION.—The withholding percentage shall increase by 0.5 percent for each subsequent year of non-compliance, up to a maximum of 5 percent.

SEC. 6. CARRYOVER AUTHORITY.

(a) AUTHORITY.—Notwithstanding section 1552 of title 31, United States Code, amounts appropriated for Operation and Maintenance that remain unobligated at the end of a fiscal year shall remain available for obligation for one additional fiscal year.
(b) LIMITATION.—The amount carried over under subsection (a) may not exceed 5 percent of the total O&M appropriation for that account.

SEC. 7. SOFTWARE ACQUISITION REFORM.

(a) SINGLE APPROPRIATION.—There is established a "Software and Digital Technology" budget activity (BA-8) within the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) accounts.
(b) ELIGIBILITY.—All software development, procurement, and sustainment activities shall be funded through this appropriation to enable continuous iterative development.

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) QUARTERLY REPORTS.—The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) shall submit quarterly reports to the congressional defense committees on all fund transfers made under portfolio budgeting authorities.
(b) AUDIT PROGRESS.—The DoD Inspector General shall report semi-annually on the progress of each component toward auditability.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the transition to SDRA and audit remediation—
    (1) $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2028; and
    (3) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2029.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Establishes key terms, including "portfolio budgeting," "clean audit," and "commercial item," to prevent interpretive disputes during implementation. The commercial item definition ties to the existing FAR standard at 48 CFR 2.101.
- **Section 4 (SDRA)**: Moves away from line-item micromanagement. Instead of Congress funding "Widget X," they fund "Air Defense," allowing the DoD to shift money to the best technology as it emerges. The 20 percent intra-portfolio transfer authority balances flexibility with accountability through quarterly reporting.
- **Section 5 (Audit Enforcement)**: Imposes real consequences for the failure to track money. Currently, there is no penalty for failing an audit; this bill changes that. The escalating withhold (1% to 5%) creates increasing pressure while avoiding catastrophic budget disruption in the first year of non-compliance.
- **Section 6 (Carryover Authority)**: Ends the "September spending spree" where units buy office furniture and TVs just to burn their budget. The 5 percent cap prevents excessive accumulation of unobligated balances.
- **Section 7 (Software Reform)**: Creates a single appropriation category for software to solve the "color of money" problem, where DoD cannot use RDT&E funds for sustainment or procurement funds for development, making agile software delivery impossible under current rules.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Primary vehicle is the annual NDAA. Sections 4-6 should be included as a subtitle within Title VIII (Acquisition Policy). Section 7 (Software) may require a separate authorization in the appropriations bill to create the new budget activity.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish portfolio category definitions | 180 days after enactment | DoD Comptroller |
| BA-8 software appropriation guidance | 270 days after enactment | OUSD(C) / OUSD(R&E) |
| Pilot Portfolio Budgets (2-3 portfolios) | FY 2027 Budget Request | DoD Comptroller |
| Audit remediation plans due from each component | 1 year after enactment | Military Departments |
| Full SDRA Transition | Oct 1, 2028 | DoD / OMB |
| Audit Deadline | Sept 30, 2028 | Military Departments |
| First carryover authority reporting | FY 2028 Q1 | OUSD(C) |
| GAO assessment of SDRA pilot results | FY 2030 | GAO |

**Challenges**:

- **Congressional Oversight**: Congress resists portfolio budgeting because it reduces their ability to direct spending to specific districts (earmarks). The defense appropriations subcommittees have developed decades of institutional knowledge around line-item review that portfolio budgeting would disrupt.
- **Cultural Inertia**: The DoD acquisition workforce is trained in compliance, not risk-taking. Transitioning to SDRA requires retraining approximately 180,000 acquisition professionals.
- **Audit Infrastructure**: Achieving a clean audit requires not just policy changes but fundamental IT system modernization. The DoD currently operates over 2,400 financial systems, many of which cannot interoperate.

**Refinements**:

- Include a "congressional veto" mechanism for large transfers within portfolios to assuage oversight concerns. Transfers exceeding $50 million or 10 percent of a portfolio (whichever is less) would require a 15-day notification period during which either armed services committee could object.
- Phase the audit enforcement penalties to allow a "good faith" partial credit for components that demonstrate measurable progress toward auditability, even if they do not achieve a clean opinion by the deadline.
- Add a "software acquisition pathway" provision linking BA-8 to the existing DoD Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP) established by the Adaptive Acquisition Framework, ensuring regulatory consistency.

### The Defense Industrial Base Resilience Act

**Purpose**: To strengthen the domestic defense industrial base, reduce reliance on foreign adversaries for critical minerals and components, and foster competition by lowering barriers for new entrants.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Strategic Supply Chain Security**: Prohibits the procurement of critical components (microchips, rare earths, energetic materials) from "countries of concern" (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) by 2030.
2. **Multi-Year Procurement (MYP)**: Expands MYP authority to munitions and critical subsystems to provide demand certainty for industry investment.
3. **Small Business Innovation**: Increases the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) set-aside and creates a "Phase III" bridge fund to help startups cross the "valley of death."
4. **Antitrust Review**: Requires the DoD to conduct a competition impact assessment for all defense mergers exceeding $100 million.
5. **Workforce Development**: Establishes a grant program for trade schools and community colleges to train skilled workers (welders, machinists) for the defense sector.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To secure the defense industrial base of the United States, promote competition, and ensure supply chain resilience.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Defense Industrial Base Resilience Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The consolidation of the defense sector has reduced the number of prime contractors from 51 in the 1990s to 5 today, reducing competition and innovation.
(2) The United States is dependent on China for over 80 percent of processed rare earth elements essential for advanced weapon systems (USGS, 2024).
(3) The "valley of death" prevents innovative small businesses from transitioning technologies to programs of record, with fewer than 25 percent of successful Phase II SBIR projects transitioning to Phase III (SBA, 2023).
(4) The defense industrial base faces a shortage of over 100,000 skilled tradespeople required to meet production goals.
(5) The Government Accountability Office has identified over 450 critical defense programs with single or sole sources of supply, posing significant risks to surge production capacity (GAO-24-106500).
(6) Foreign adversaries have exploited supply chain dependencies to delay or degrade U.S. weapons production, as documented in DoD's annual Industrial Capabilities Report (2024).
(7) The average time to award a defense contract exceeds 300 days, compared to 60-90 days for equivalent commercial transactions (Section 809 Panel Final Report, 2019).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) COVERED NATION.—The term "covered nation" means the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and any other nation designated by the Secretary of Defense as a threat to defense supply chain integrity.
(2) CRITICAL MINERAL.—The term "critical mineral" means any mineral, element, or processed material identified by the Secretary of the Interior under section 7002(c) of the Energy Act of 2020 (30 U.S.C. 1606) that is essential to the production of defense platforms, weapon systems, or military equipment.
(3) DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE.—The term "defense industrial base" means the worldwide industrial complex that enables research and development, design, production, delivery, and maintenance of military weapons systems, subsystems, and components to meet United States military requirements.
(4) CRITICAL COMPONENT.—The term "critical component" means any subsystem, part, or material designated by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment as essential to the function or performance of a major weapon system, the loss of which would result in mission degradation or failure.
(5) VALLEY OF DEATH.—The term "valley of death" means the gap in funding and programmatic support between the demonstration of a technology's viability and its transition to a program of record.

SEC. 4. SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY.

(a) PROHIBITION.—Beginning on October 1, 2030, funds appropriated to the Department of Defense may not be used to procure any major weapon system containing critical components or critical minerals sourced from a covered nation.
(b) COVERED ITEMS.—The prohibition under subsection (a) applies to microelectronics, rare earth elements and critical minerals, energetic materials, castings and forgings, and any additional category designated by the Secretary of Defense.
(c) WAIVER.—The Secretary of Defense may waive this prohibition for a period of up to 2 years if—
    (1) no alternative domestic or allied source is available;
    (2) the waiver is necessary for urgent operational need; and
    (3) a plan to establish an alternative source within 3 years is submitted to the congressional defense committees.
(d) CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION.—Not later than 30 days before granting a waiver under subsection (c), the Secretary shall notify the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

SEC. 5. MULTI-YEAR PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY.

(a) EXPANSION.—Section 3501 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to authorize the use of multi-year contracts for the procurement of munitions, critical chemicals, and satellite components.
(b) CANCELLATION CEILING.—The cancellation ceiling for such contracts may be set at up to 50 percent of the total contract value to incentivize private capital investment.

SEC. 6. INNOVATION TRANSITION FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established in the Treasury the "Defense Innovation Transition Fund".
(b) PURPOSE.—The Fund shall provide matching capital to Phase II SBIR awardees to scale production and bridge the gap to Phase III programs of record.
(c) AUTHORIZATION.—There is authorized to be appropriated $1,000,000,000 annually for the Fund.

SEC. 7. INDUSTRIAL WORKFORCE GRANTS.

(a) PROGRAM.—The Secretary of Defense shall establish a grant program to support manufacturing workforce training at community colleges and vocational schools.
(b) PRIORITY.—Priority shall be given to institutions located in regions with critical defense manufacturing clusters (e.g., shipyards, arsenals).

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) SUPPLY CHAIN AUDIT.—The Secretary shall submit an annual report identifying all known dependencies on covered nations in major defense acquisition programs, including tier-two and tier-three subcontractors.
(b) COMPETITION REPORT.—The Secretary shall report annually on the state of competition within the defense industrial base, including the number and value of sole-source contracts awarded.
(c) WAIVER LOG.—The Secretary shall publish an unclassified summary of all waivers granted under Section 4(c), including the commodity, covered nation, and expected timeline for source substitution.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $2,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $3,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Establishes precise terminology for consistent application. The broad definition of "covered nation" allows the Secretary to designate additional adversaries as threats evolve, while "critical component" captures both hardware and materials.
- **Section 4 (Supply Chain Security)**: Forces a decoupling from Chinese supply chains for critical items, creating a guaranteed market for domestic or allied producers. The tiered waiver requirements (including a mandatory re-sourcing plan) prevent indefinite dependency.
- **Section 5 (Multi-Year Procurement)**: Gives industry the long-term contracts they need to invest in new factories and workforce, breaking the boom-and-bust cycle of munitions buying. The higher cancellation ceiling signals government commitment.
- **Section 6 (Innovation Transition Fund)**: Directly attacks the "valley of death" by providing capital to scale startups that have proven technology but lack a massive production contract. The matching-capital structure ensures private sector cost-sharing.
- **Section 7 (Workforce Grants)**: Addresses the labor shortage that constrains industrial base expansion. Prioritizing regions near existing defense manufacturing clusters maximizes return on investment.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Standalone bill or incorporated into the annual NDAA as a title on industrial base policy. Companion legislation should be introduced in both chambers simultaneously given bipartisan support for supply chain reshoring.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish covered nation designations | 90 days after enactment | Secretary of Defense |
| Supply Chain Audit | 1 year after enactment | DoD Industrial Policy |
| Workforce Grant NOFA | 180 days after enactment | DoD / Dept of Ed |
| Innovation Fund operational | 1 year after enactment | OUSD(R&E) |
| First multi-year munitions contracts | FY 2028 | Defense Acquisition |
| Sourcing Prohibition | Oct 1, 2030 | Defense Acquisition |

**Challenges**:

- **Cost**: Domestic sourcing is more expensive than sourcing from China; budgets will buy less equipment in the near term.
- **Feasibility**: Some supply chains (e.g., rare earth processing) take 5-10 years to build; the 2030 deadline is aggressive and may require extended waiver use.
- **Allied Coordination**: Ally and partner nations (Australia, Japan, South Korea) have their own industrial base concerns; U.S. reshoring could disrupt allied supply relationships.

**Refinements**:

- Establish a "trusted supplier" tier for Five Eyes and NATO allies to avoid penalizing allied-nation sourcing while still restricting adversary dependencies.
- Create a phased implementation schedule with interim milestones (2028 for electronics, 2029 for energetics, 2030 for minerals) rather than a single cliff date.
- Include an annual cost-benefit report to Congress so that reshoring costs can be weighed against operational risk reduction.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Defense Industry Economic Development Act

**Purpose**: To align state economic development incentives with national defense priorities, fostering local defense innovation clusters.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with existing bases or labs (e.g., CA, VA, AL, TX) should focus on tech transfer; manufacturing states (e.g., OH, MI) on supply chain re-shoring.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Defense Industry Economic Development Act".

SECTION 2. DEFENSE INNOVATION ZONES.
(a) DESIGNATION.—The Department of Commerce shall designate Defense Innovation Zones near military installations and research laboratories.
(b) INCENTIVES.—Businesses located in these zones that receive DoD SBIR grants shall be eligible for a state tax credit equal to 20 percent of the federal grant amount.

SECTION 3. WORKFORCE PIPELINE.
(a) The State Board of Education shall develop a "Defense Ready" certification for high school and community college vocational programs, aligning curriculum with defense manufacturing needs.
(b) Tuition assistance shall be provided for students pursuing "Defense Ready" certifications.

SECTION 4. PROCUREMENT PREFERENCE.
(a) State agencies shall give preference in procurement to businesses that maintain active DoD security clearances and employ workers with "Defense Ready" certifications.
(b) This preference shall apply to contracts for goods and services valued at $500,000 or less.

SECTION 5. ANNUAL REPORT.
The Department of Commerce shall submit an annual report to the Governor and legislature on:
(a) The number of Defense Innovation Zones designated and businesses participating;
(b) Total tax credits issued and estimated economic impact;
(c) The number of "Defense Ready" certifications awarded; and
(d) Federal defense contracts awarded to businesses within the state.

SECTION 6. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Innovation Zones)**: Creates geographic clusters of defense innovation near existing military assets. The tax credit structure piggybacks on federal SBIR awards, ensuring state dollars flow to companies already vetted by DoD for technical merit.
- **Section 3 (Workforce Pipeline)**: Aligns state education systems with defense manufacturing needs. The "Defense Ready" certification creates a recognized credential that signals employability to defense contractors, similar to industry certifications in IT and healthcare.
- **Section 4 (Procurement Preference)**: Uses state purchasing power to support the defense industrial base, creating additional revenue streams for defense-oriented small businesses beyond federal contracts.

**Adaptations by State Type**:

| State Profile | Focus Areas | Example States |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Major military installation states | Tech transfer, base-adjacent innovation zones | VA, CA, TX, HI |
| Manufacturing states | Supply chain reshoring, workforce training | OH, MI, PA, IN |
| Research university states | SBIR pipeline, lab-to-market transition | MA, MD, AL, NM |
| Rural/agricultural states | Dual-use technology, critical minerals | WY, MT, WV, AK |

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Appropriations Clause**: The "Use It or Lose It" repeal modifies the standard appropriation life cycle. This is within Congress's power under Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 ("No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law"), but requires careful drafting to avoid violating the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341).

**Article I vs. Article II Tensions**: Defense procurement authority sits at the intersection of Congress's power to "raise and support Armies" (Article I, Section 8) and the President's role as Commander in Chief (Article II, Section 2). Portfolio budgeting with intra-portfolio transfer authority shifts discretionary spending power from Congress to the Executive Branch. While reprogramming authorities have long been accepted, expanding transfer authority to 20 percent within portfolios will require robust notification and veto mechanisms to satisfy congressional prerogatives. The legislation must be structured so that Congress retains meaningful control over how defense funds are allocated, even as it grants greater flexibility to the Department.

**Youngstown Framework**: *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), established the foundational framework for evaluating Executive Branch action in relation to congressional authority. Under Justice Jackson's concurrence, Executive action falls into three zones: (1) acting with congressional authorization (maximum authority), (2) acting in the absence of congressional direction (twilight zone), and (3) acting contrary to congressional will (lowest ebb). The portfolio transfer authorities in this legislation operate in Zone 1, as Congress explicitly authorizes the transfers. However, if the Executive were to use transfer authority to fund programs Congress has specifically defunded or to circumvent spending prohibitions, such action would fall into Zone 3 and face serious constitutional challenge. The legislation should include explicit language stating that transfer authority does not extend to programs that Congress has specifically zeroed or prohibited.

**Takings Clause**: Prohibitions on foreign sourcing must apply prospectively to avoid takings claims on existing contracts. Existing contracts with foreign suppliers should be grandfathered through their current performance period.

### Case Law

*Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States*, 579 U.S. 162 (2016), is directly relevant to the competition provisions in the Defense Industrial Base Resilience Act. The Supreme Court held that the VA's "Rule of Two" for small business set-asides is mandatory, not discretionary, whenever there is a reasonable expectation that two or more small businesses will submit competitive offers. This precedent reinforces that statutory competition requirements in procurement cannot be waived by agency convenience. The legislation's antitrust review requirements for defense mergers and small business set-aside expansions should be drafted as mandatory directives, consistent with the *Kingdomware* holding, rather than aspirational guidance that contracting officers may ignore.

### Preemption

Federal acquisition regulations (FAR/DFARS) generally preempt state laws regarding federal procurement under the Supremacy Clause. State model legislation in this framework focuses on economic development incentives (tax credits, workforce training), which do not conflict with federal procurement rules. However, states should avoid conditioning incentives on procurement outcomes, which could be preempted under the federal procurement regulatory scheme.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance relies heavily on the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the DoD Inspector General. These agencies require increased staffing to monitor the new supply chain rules. DCAA currently has approximately 3,800 auditors covering over $400 billion in annual contract activity; the expanded supply chain verification and beneficial ownership requirements will necessitate a staffing increase of 15-20 percent. The DoD IG will need additional investigators with supply chain expertise to enforce the sourcing prohibitions effectively.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Commercial" Definition** | Contractors claim "commercial" status for custom items to avoid cost data requirements. | High | Tighten definition of "commercial item" to require actual sales to the public. |
| **Waiver Abuse** | DoD grants endless waivers for Chinese components due to "mission necessity." | High | Cap waivers at 2 years max; require congressional notification for all waivers. |
| **Pass-Throughs** | Primes use shell companies to mask foreign supply chains. | Medium | Require "beneficial ownership" disclosure for all subcontractors. |
| **Color of Money Manipulation** | Program offices split work packages across appropriation categories (RDT&E, Procurement, O&M) to circumvent spending controls or exploit more permissive funding rules. | Medium | Mandate unified program funding accounts for designated pilot programs; expand BA-8 concept to additional categories. |
| **Sole-Source Justification Abuse** | Contracting officers write unnecessarily narrow requirements to justify sole-source awards to incumbent contractors, avoiding competition. | High | Require independent review of sole-source justifications above $10M by the DoD Competition Advocate; publish all sole-source justifications in a public database. |
| **Progress Payment Manipulation** | Contractors structure milestones to front-load payments and reduce financial incentive to deliver on schedule, collecting the majority of contract value before critical testing. | Medium | Tie progress payments to independently verified technical milestones; cap cumulative payments at 80% until final acceptance testing is complete. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Workforce Lag** | Factories built but no workers to run them. | Demographics/Training time. | Heavy investment in trade schools (Section 6). |
| **Inflation** | Multi-year contracts lock in prices that may become untenable. | Economic volatility. | Include Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) clauses in contracts. |
| **Oversight Capacity** | Congressional staff and GAO lack technical expertise to evaluate portfolio-level budget requests, potentially reducing effective oversight. | Decades of line-item budgeting have built oversight processes around programs, not portfolios. | Fund additional CBO and GAO defense analysts; create a Portfolio Budget Review Office within CBO. |
| **Data System Fragmentation** | DoD operates over 2,400 financial and business systems that cannot share data, undermining audit and SDRA implementation. | Legacy IT investment and stovepiped service requirements. | Mandate adoption of a common enterprise resource planning (ERP) standard within 5 years; sunset non-compliant systems. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Truth in Negotiations Act (TINA)**: Strengthen TINA thresholds to ensure the government gets fair pricing on sole-source "commercial" parts. Lower the cost or pricing data threshold from $2 million to $750,000 for items claimed as commercial but sold exclusively to the government.
2. **Supply Chain Illumination**: Mandate the use of AI-driven supply chain mapping tools to detect hidden foreign dependencies. Require all prime contractors to submit machine-readable supply chain data (not just paper certifications) using a standardized schema.
3. **Competition Advocate Empowerment**: Elevate the DoD Competition Advocate to a Senate-confirmed position with independent reporting authority to Congress, insulating the office from pressure to approve non-competitive awards.
4. **Milestone-Based Progress Payments**: For contracts exceeding $100 million, replace percentage-of-completion payment schedules with independently verified milestone-based payments tied to demonstrated technical performance.
5. **Revolving Door Restrictions**: Extend the post-government employment cooling-off period from 2 years to 4 years for senior acquisition officials who managed programs exceeding $1 billion, reducing the incentive to favor future employers during source selection.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Interagency Coordination** | SDRA and supply chain reforms require alignment between DoD, OMB, and congressional appropriations committees, which operate on different timelines and incentive structures. Establish a joint implementation task force with representatives from all three. |
| **Transition Risk** | Shifting from PPBE to SDRA during an active budget cycle risks disruption to ongoing programs. Use a phased rollout beginning with 2-3 pilot portfolios before full transition. |
| **Contractor Resistance** | Incumbent contractors benefit from the current system's complexity and may lobby against reforms. Ensure reform legislation is drafted with input from both traditional and non-traditional defense companies. |
| **Measurement and Accountability** | Without clear metrics, reform success will be difficult to evaluate. Require annual benchmarking reports measuring acquisition cycle time, cost growth, and competition rates against pre-reform baselines. |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **SDRA Pilot**: Review after 5 years by GAO; sunset if no efficiency gains proven against pre-reform baseline metrics.
- **Innovation Fund**: Reauthorization required in 2031; GAO shall report on fund performance (dollars invested, technologies transitioned, jobs created) no later than 2030.
- **Supply Chain Prohibition**: Review by the Secretary of Defense every 3 years to assess whether covered nation designations remain appropriate and whether domestic alternatives are commercially viable.
- **Transfer Authority**: The 20 percent intra-portfolio transfer authority shall sunset after 7 years unless reauthorized, allowing Congress to evaluate whether the flexibility has been used responsibly.
