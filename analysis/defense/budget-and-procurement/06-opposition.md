# Budget and Procurement: Opposition to Reform

Decades of attempts to reform the defense budget and acquisition system have failed or produced only marginal gains. This is because any meaningful reform threatens the powerful, entrenched interests of the "Iron Triangle" that benefit from the status quo.

## Opposition from the "Iron Triangle"

The most formidable opposition to reform comes from the three sides of the Iron Triangle—the defense industry, Congress, and the DoD bureaucracy—which have a shared interest in preserving the current system.

| Argument | Proponents' Claim | Rebuttal / Counterpoint |
|---|---|---|
| **"Reform is Too Risky"** | The current system, while slow and expensive, ultimately produces the world's most advanced weapon systems. Radical reforms, like cancelling a major program or relying on unproven commercial companies, could jeopardize national security. | The current system is the real risk. Its slow pace means technology is often obsolete by the time it is fielded. Its high cost means we can't afford to buy enough of it. The risk of inaction is greater than the risk of reform. |
| **"We Need Budget Stability"** | (From Industry) We can't make long-term investments in factories and skilled workers without the stability of large, multi-year, cost-plus contracts. More competition and shorter contracts would create uncertainty and harm the industrial base. | The current "stability" is a form of corporate welfare that insulates contractors from accountability for cost overruns and poor performance. Competition, not guaranteed contracts, is the true driver of efficiency and innovation. |
| **"You Can't Cut My Program"** | (From Congress) This program (tank, ship, plane) is vital for national security and provides thousands of good-paying jobs in my district. Cutting it would weaken our defense and devastate my local economy. | The DoD has determined this program is no longer needed for its strategy. Continuing to fund it for political reasons is a waste of taxpayer money and takes funds away from higher-priority systems that the warfighter actually needs. |
| **"We Must Follow the Process"** | (From DoD Bureaucracy) The acquisition regulations, while complex, exist to ensure fairness, accountability, and proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars. Bypassing them would lead to fraud and waste. | The current process creates its own, much larger form of waste through massive cost overruns and delays. The goal should be a smarter, more streamlined process, not a rigid adherence to a broken one. |

**Key Opposing Stakeholders**:

- The "Big Five" prime defense contractors.
- Members of Congress with major defense plants or military bases in their districts.
- Parts of the DoD acquisition bureaucracy that are resistant to change.

## Opposition to Budget Cuts

Proposals to reduce the overall level of defense spending face strong opposition from a different coalition.

| Argument | Proponents' Claim | Rebuttal / Counterpoint |
|---|---|---|
| **"The World is Too Dangerous"** | In an era of great power competition with China and Russia, and with threats from Iran and North Korea, now is the worst possible time to cut defense spending. A strong military is the only thing that deters our adversaries. | The U.S. already spends more on defense than the next 10 countries combined. The current budget is more than sufficient if the money were spent more wisely. The real source of national security is a strong economy and investments in diplomacy and technology. |
| **"Cuts Will Harm Readiness"** | Any reduction in the defense budget will inevitably fall on training, maintenance, and munitions, hollowing out the force and leaving it unprepared for a crisis. | This is a false choice. A smarter budget could cut wasteful, underperforming weapon systems and reinvest the savings into readiness. The problem isn't the top-line number, but how it's allocated. |

**Key Opposing Stakeholders**:

- Defense hawks in Congress.
- Foreign policy commentators who advocate for a strategy of military primacy.
- The defense industry and its associated trade groups.
