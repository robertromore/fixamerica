# Budget and Procurement: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The chronic problems of the defense budget and procurement system—particularly the persistent cost overruns and schedule delays in major programs—are not the result of isolated failures but of deep, systemic flaws in the structure and incentives of the process itself.

## The "Iron Triangle"

The single most powerful driver of dysfunction is the "Iron Triangle": a mutually beneficial, self-reinforcing relationship between the three key players in the system.

1. **The Defense Industry (Contractors)**: Wants to win large, stable, profitable contracts. They achieve this by lobbying Congress and making campaign contributions.
2. **Congress**: Wants to bring jobs and federal money to their districts and states to help get re-elected. They achieve this by funding weapon systems built by contractors in their districts.
3. **The Department of Defense (Military Services & Bureaucracy)**: Wants larger budgets and new, high-tech weapon systems to fulfill their mission and maintain their relevance. They achieve this by advocating for new programs to Congress.

**The Dynamic**: The military asks for a new weapon. A contractor promises to build it and create jobs in key congressional districts. Congress funds the program to secure those jobs. All three sides get what they want. The taxpayer, who is not part of this triangle, bears the cost. This dynamic makes it almost impossible to cancel a major weapon system once it has started, regardless of its performance.

## The Flawed Requirements Process

Programs often fail because they are set up for failure from the very beginning.

- **"Requirements Creep"**: The military services often begin with a reasonable set of requirements for a new weapon, but over the long development process, they continuously add new "must-have" capabilities. Each addition increases complexity, cost, and schedule risk.
- **"Technological Optimism"**: Planners consistently overestimate the maturity of new technologies and underestimate the difficulty of integrating them. They plan for the best-case scenario, which almost never occurs.
- **The "Art of the Possible" vs. "The Science of the Impossible"**: The requirements process is often disconnected from technical reality. The services ask for a weapon with the speed of a rocket, the stealth of a B-2, and the cost of a pickup truck, without a clear technical path to achieving it.

## The Broken Budgeting and Acquisition Model

The fundamental processes for funding and managing programs are mismatched and create perverse incentives.

### 1. The Disconnect Between Budgeting and Acquisition

- **The Problem**: The DoD budgets in one-year increments (the annual appropriations process), but it acquires weapon systems over multi-decade timelines.
- **The Impact**: This creates immense funding instability. A program manager for a 15-year project has no guarantee what their budget will be next year. This uncertainty forces contractors to be inefficient and makes long-term planning impossible.

### 2. The "Conspiracy of Optimism"

- **The Problem**: To get a new program approved and funded, both the military and the contractor have a powerful incentive to be overly optimistic in their initial cost and schedule estimates. A realistic, higher estimate might lead Congress to cancel the program before it even starts.
- **The Impact**: Programs are "born broken," with unrealistic baselines that they are guaranteed to exceed. The initial low-ball estimate gets the program started, and once billions are spent, the "sunk cost fallacy" makes it impossible to cancel.

### 3. Risk Aversion in the Bureaucracy

- **The Problem**: For a government program manager, there is no reward for taking a smart risk that pays off, but there is immense career-ending punishment for a failure.
- **The Impact**: This creates a culture of extreme risk aversion. Program managers avoid making decisions, demand endless studies, and add layers of oversight to cover themselves. This bureaucratic sludge is a primary driver of schedule delays.

## Causal Chain of a Failing Program

```text
Military service identifies a need for a new weapon
    ↓
Planners develop overly ambitious requirements ("requirements creep")
    ↓
Contractor and DoD create an optimistic, low-ball cost estimate to get the program funded
    ↓
The "Iron Triangle" ensures Congress funds the program
    ↓
During development, technical challenges emerge, and new requirements are added
    ↓
Costs and schedules begin to slip
    ↓
Risk-averse bureaucracy adds layers of review, causing further delays
    ↓
The program is now years late and billions over budget, but it is "too big to fail" due to sunk costs and the Iron Triangle
    ↓
Result: A late, over-budget weapon system is delivered to the warfighter
