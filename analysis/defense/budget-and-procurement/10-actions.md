# Budget and Procurement: What You Can Do

While the defense budget and acquisition system are notoriously complex, informed citizens can play a crucial role in demanding accountability and supporting reform.

## 1. Follow the Money

- **Understand the Basics**: Learn the difference between budget "authorization" (which sets policy) and "appropriation" (which provides the money). Understand the major spending categories like O&M, Procurement, and RDT&E.
- **Track Major Programs**: Use resources from the GAO and watchdog groups like POGO to track the cost and schedule performance of major weapon systems like the F-35 or the new Columbia-class submarine.
- **Know Your District's Interests**: Find out which defense contractors are major employers in your state or district. This will help you understand your representative's position on defense spending issues.

## 2. Demand Accountability from Congress

Congress holds the "power of the purse" and is the most important lever for change.

- **Ask About Cost Overruns**: At a town hall, ask your Representative or Senator: "The F-35 program is now billions over budget and years behind schedule. What are you doing to hold the contractor and the DoD accountable for this performance?"
- **Challenge the "Jobs" Argument**: When a politician defends a failing program by saying it "creates jobs," push back: "Is this the most cost-effective way to create jobs? Could that money be better spent on a program the military actually needs, or on other domestic priorities like infrastructure or education?"
- **Support Reform Efforts**: Voice your support for reforms like a "BRAC for Weapons" that would allow the DoD to cut wasteful programs. Tell your representatives you support them making tough, strategic choices, even if it means cutting a program with a local presence.

## 3. Support "Good Government" Watchdogs

- **Amplify Their Work**: Support and share the work of non-partisan organizations like the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), the GAO, and the CBO. They provide the objective, data-driven analysis needed to hold the system accountable.
- **Advocate for Transparency**: Demand that the DoD and Congress provide more transparency on program costs, performance, and the lobbying efforts of defense contractors.
