# Budget and Procurement: Current State

## The Defense Budget

The U.S. defense budget is composed of several major appropriation titles that fund different aspects of the Department of Defense.

### DoD Budget Request by Appropriation Title (FY2025)

| Appropriation Title | Amount | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Operations & Maintenance (O&M)** | $339.8 billion | Funds readiness activities: training, base operations, maintenance, fuel, and supplies. |
| **Military Personnel (MILPERS)** | $182.8 billion | Funds pay, allowances, and benefits for uniformed military personnel. |
| **Procurement** | $167.5 billion | Funds the purchase of new weapon systems, vehicles, ships, and aircraft. |
| **Research, Development, Test, & Eval (RDT&E)** | $143.2 billion | Funds science and technology, prototyping, and development of new systems. |
| **Military Construction (MILCON)** | $12.5 billion | Funds the construction of new facilities, runways, barracks, etc. |
| **Family Housing** | $1.7 billion | Funds the operation and maintenance of military family housing. |
| **Total DoD Request** | **$849.8 billion** | *Note: This is the discretionary budget for DoD only.* |

### The Readiness vs. Modernization Tradeoff

The budget reflects the constant tension between funding current readiness (O&M) and investing in future capability (RDT&E + Procurement).

- **Readiness (O&M + MILPERS)**: ~$522.6 billion (61.5% of total)
- **Modernization (RDT&E + Procurement)**: ~$310.7 billion (36.6% of total)

## The Defense Acquisition System

The process for buying major weapon systems is notoriously complex, governed by the DoD 5000 series of regulations.

### The Acquisition Lifecycle

1. **Requirements Generation (JCIDS)**: The Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System is the process where the military services define the need for a new capability.
2. **Budgeting (PPBE)**: The Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution process is how the DoD allocates funds for the new program.
3. **Acquisition (DAS)**: The Defense Acquisition System itself, which includes several key milestones:
    - **Milestone A**: Approves entry into the Technology Maturation & Risk Reduction phase.
    - **Milestone B**: Approves entry into the Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. This is the formal start of a program.
    - **Milestone C**: Approves entry into Production & Deployment.

This linear, milestone-based process was designed for industrial-age hardware programs and is ill-suited for modern, software-intensive systems.

## Acquisition Program Performance

Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) have a long history of poor performance on cost and schedule.

### Case Study: The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter

| Metric | Original Estimate (2001) | Current Estimate (2023) | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Program Acquisition Cost** | $233 billion | $438 billion | +88% |
| **Total Lifecycle Cost** | ~$1.1 trillion | ~$1.7 trillion | +55% |
| **Initial Operational Capability (IOC)** | 2010 (Marines) | 2015 (Marines) | 5-year delay |
| **Full-Rate Production Decision** | 2012 | 2024 | 12-year delay |

*Source: Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports on the F-35 program.*

### Systemic Performance Issues

- **Cost Growth**: According to the GAO, the total acquisition cost for the DoD's portfolio of major programs has grown by over **$700 billion** from initial estimates.
- **Schedule Delays**: The average MDAP experiences a schedule delay of **2.5 years**.
- **Nunn-McCurdy Breaches**: A "Nunn-McCurdy breach" occurs when a program's unit cost grows by more than 15% (significant breach) or 30% (critical breach) over its baseline. Since 1997, there have been over **100** such breaches, including on major programs like the F-35, the Sentinel ICBM, and the Ford-class aircraft carrier.

## Recent Reform Efforts

Congress and the DoD have made numerous attempts to reform the system, with limited success.

- **Better Buying Power (2010-2015)**: A series of initiatives focused on achieving affordability and efficiency.
- **Section 809 Panel (2018)**: A congressionally mandated panel that produced 98 recommendations for streamlining and reforming the acquisition system.
- **Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF)**: The DoD's current reform model, which tries to move away from a one-size-fits-all process. It creates six different acquisition "pathways" tailored to different types of programs:
    1. Urgent Capability
    2. Middle Tier of Acquisition (for rapid prototyping)
    3. Major Capability Acquisition (the traditional path)
    4. Software Acquisition
    5. Defense Business Systems
    6. Acquisition of Services

**Challenge**: While the AAF is a step in the right direction, the underlying culture of risk aversion and bureaucracy remains a powerful obstacle to real change.
