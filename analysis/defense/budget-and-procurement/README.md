# Defense Budget and Procurement

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of how the United States funds its military and buys its weapon systems.

## Overview

The U.S. defense budget is the largest in the world, reflecting the nation's global security commitments. The process of allocating this budget and using it to procure advanced military capabilities is governed by the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) system and the defense acquisition system. These interlocking processes are notoriously complex, slow, and bureaucratic.

This analysis examines the two sides of the defense resources coin. First, it covers the "top-down" budget process: how the total defense spending level is set, how it is allocated among the services and priorities (like readiness vs. modernization), and the political debates surrounding its size. Second, it covers the "bottom-up" procurement process: how the DoD defines requirements for, develops, and buys major weapon systems, and why these programs so often suffer from massive cost overruns and schedule delays. It explores the systemic causes of acquisition failure and the decades-long, often frustrating, quest for reform.
