# Budget and Procurement: Overview

## Overview

The U.S. defense budget and the system for procuring weapon systems are the twin pillars that translate national strategy into military capability. With a total budget approaching $900 billion annually, the Department of Defense (DoD) is the largest discretionary component of the federal budget. The process of allocating these vast resources is a complex interplay between the White House (OMB), the DoD, and Congress. This process is defined by a central tension: balancing investments in the readiness of the current force against the need to fund the development and procurement of next-generation systems (modernization).

The defense acquisition system, the mechanism for spending a large portion of this budget, is widely seen as broken. Major weapon programs are infamous for being years behind schedule and billions over budget. This is not a new problem; it is a chronic condition rooted in the unique nature of the defense market (a government monopsony), perverse incentives within the "Iron Triangle" of the DoD, Congress, and industry, and a risk-averse bureaucracy. Decades of reform efforts have yielded only marginal improvements, and the slow pace of acquisition is now a strategic liability in an era of rapid technological competition with China.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of the defense budget and procurement systems:

- **The Defense Budget Process**: The Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process, the role of the National Defense Strategy, and the congressional appropriations process.
- **Spending Priorities**: The allocation of funds between personnel, operations and maintenance (readiness), procurement, and R&D (modernization).
- **The Acquisition System**: The lifecycle of a major weapon system, from requirements generation to development, production, and sustainment.
- **Procurement Challenges**: Cost overruns, schedule delays, "requirements creep," and the "valley of death" for innovative technologies.
- **Reform Efforts**: Past and present attempts to make the acquisition system faster, cheaper, and more effective.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total Defense Budget Request (FY2025) | ~$895 billion | DoD, 2024 |
| Defense Spending as % of GDP | ~3.1% | OMB, 2024 |
| Largest DoD Appropriation Title | Operations & Maintenance (O&M) | DoD |
| Key Budget Process | Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) | DoD |
| Key Acquisition Law | Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) / Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) | U.S. Code |
| F-35 Program Lifecycle Cost Estimate | ~$1.7 trillion | GAO, 2023 |
| Average Cost Overrun (Major Defense Programs) | ~30-40% | GAO |
| Average Schedule Delay (Major Defense Programs) | ~2.5 years | GAO |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Readiness vs. Modernization**: Every dollar spent on training, maintenance, and munitions for the current force is a dollar not spent on R&D and procurement for the next generation of weapons. This is the central tradeoff in the defense budget.
- **Accountability vs. Speed**: The complex acquisition bureaucracy is designed to ensure accountability and prevent fraud, but it makes the system incredibly slow. Efforts to speed up the process often involve bypassing these controls, creating new risks.
- **Competition vs. Stability**: The DoD needs a stable industrial base, which has led to a consolidated market with few prime contractors. This lack of competition, however, leads to higher prices and less innovation.
- **Requirements vs. Reality**: The military services often set overly ambitious technical requirements for new weapons, leading to "requirements creep" that drives up cost and complexity. This conflicts with the need to field affordable, producible systems quickly.
- **Budget Cycle vs. Development Cycle**: The DoD's annual budget cycle is mismatched with the multi-year, often multi-decade, timeline of a major weapon program, creating funding instability.

## Key Questions

1. Is the current level of defense spending appropriate for the strategic challenges the nation faces?
2. Why have decades of acquisition reform failed to solve the problem of cost overruns and schedule delays?
3. How can the DoD break out of the "readiness vs. modernization" tradeoff and fund both effectively?
4. What fundamental changes are needed to make the acquisition system faster and more adaptable to new technologies like software and AI?

## Vision of Success

A successful budget and procurement system would:

- **Be Strategy-Driven**: The budget would be a clear reflection of the priorities laid out in the National Defense Strategy.
- **Be Agile and Fast**: The acquisition system would deliver cutting-edge technology to the warfighter at the "speed of relevance," not in decades.
- **Deliver on Time and on Budget**: Major programs would consistently meet their cost and schedule targets.
- **Be Competitive and Innovative**: The system would foster a dynamic industrial base and make it easy for non-traditional companies to work with the DoD.
