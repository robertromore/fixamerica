# Budget and Procurement: Reform Roadmap

Reforming the defense budget and procurement system requires a phased approach that starts with achievable process changes and builds momentum for deeper, structural reforms.

---

## Phase 1: Laying the Groundwork for Accountability (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on immediate legislative and administrative actions to increase accountability and create the conditions for more significant reform.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Empower Program Managers** | The Secretary of Defense issues a new directive empowering Program Managers (PMs) with greater authority and linking their tenure and promotion to program performance. | At least 50% of major defense program PMs are on 5-year tenures. The first PM of a breaching program is removed. |
| **2. Pilot Fixed-Price Development Contracts** | Congress authorizes a pilot program requiring at least five new major programs to use fixed-price incentive contracts for their development phase. | Five programs are successfully initiated using fixed-price contracts. |
| **3. Charter "BRAC for Weapons" Commission** | Congress passes legislation chartering an independent "Defense Programs Review Commission" to begin its analysis of legacy weapon systems. | Commission is fully staffed and holds its first public hearing. |
| **4. Establish "Valley of Death" Fund** | Congress establishes and provides initial funding for a "Transition and Scaling Fund" to support tech startups. | The fund awards its first "bridge" contracts. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Introduce real accountability into the system and begin to build the mechanisms for cutting wasteful programs and onboarding new technology.

## Phase 2: Implementing Structural Reforms (Years 3-5)

This phase focuses on implementing the major structural changes to the budget and acquisition processes.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Pass "BRAC for Weapons" Package** | The Defense Programs Review Commission submits its first report to Congress. Congress holds an up-or-down vote on the full package of program cuts. | The legislative package is passed, and the DoD begins implementing the program terminations. |
| **2. Shift to Biennial Budgeting** | Congress passes a "Biennial Budgeting Act for National Defense," shifting the DoD to a two-year budget cycle. | The DoD submits its first-ever biennial budget request. |
| **3. Mandate Fixed-Price Contracts** | Based on the success of the pilot program, Congress passes legislation requiring fixed-price incentive contracts for all new development programs. | All new Milestone B decisions use fixed-price contracts. |
| **4. Scale Software Acquisition Pathway** | The DoD fully implements and scales the new software acquisition pathway across all services. | 50% of all DoD software development is being done using the new DevSecOps model. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Make the big, structural changes to the budget and acquisition systems that have been debated for decades.

## Phase 3: Achieving a Modern Acquisition System (Years 6-10)

This phase focuses on institutionalizing the reforms and realizing the vision of a faster, more competitive, and more accountable system.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. A More Dynamic Industrial Base** | The "Valley of Death" fund and other reforms lead to a measurable increase in the number of non-traditional companies winning major DoD contracts. | The share of DoD contract dollars going to companies outside the "Big Five" increases by 25%. |
| **2. Improved Program Performance** | The combination of empowered PMs, fixed-price contracts, and better budgeting leads to a significant reduction in cost and schedule overruns. | The average cost growth and schedule delay for major programs is reduced by 50% compared to the 2020 baseline. |
| **3. A Strategy-Driven Budget** | The biennial budget process and the "BRAC for Weapons" mechanism allow the DoD to more effectively align its budget with the National Defense Strategy. | Savings from terminated legacy programs are successfully reinvested into higher-priority modernization efforts. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: The U.S. has a budget and procurement system that is a strategic asset, not a liability, enabling the nation to out-innovate and out-produce its adversaries.
