# Budget and Procurement: History

## Historical Development

The history of U.S. defense budgeting and procurement is a story of continuous attempts to impose rational management on an inherently complex and political process, with each generation of reformers grappling with the same persistent problems of cost overruns and inefficiency.

### The McNamara Revolution: PPBS (1960s)

- **Context**: Before the 1960s, the defense budget was largely a bottom-up process where each military service submitted its own "wish list" with little central strategy.
- **The Reform**: As Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, a former Ford Motor Company executive, introduced the **Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS)**.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **Planning**: Started with national strategy and objectives.
    - **Programming**: Linked strategy to specific, multi-year programs and forces.
    - **Budgeting**: Translated the programs into an annual budget.
    - **Systems Analysis**: Used quantitative analysis to evaluate the costs and benefits of different weapon systems.
- **Legacy**: PPBS (now PPBE, with "Execution" added) remains the foundational intellectual framework for the entire DoD budget process to this day. It was a revolutionary attempt to bring corporate-style, data-driven management to the Pentagon.

### The Post-Vietnam Era and the Rise of Reform (1970s-1980s)

- **Context**: The Vietnam War and a series of procurement scandals in the 1970s (e.g., the C-5A cargo plane's massive cost overruns) led to a public outcry and a loss of confidence in the DoD.
- **The "Revolt of the Colonels"**: A group of reform-minded military officers and civilian analysts (the "Fighter Mafia," "Military Reform Movement") argued that the Pentagon was buying overly complex, expensive, and unreliable weapons.
- **Packard Commission (1986)**: In response to scandals over "$600 toilet seats," President Reagan chartered the Packard Commission. Its recommendations led to landmark legislation:
    - **Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986**: While primarily a reform of the operational chain of command, it also strengthened the role of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in the requirements process.
    - **Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) (1990)**: Created a professional, trained, and certified acquisition corps within the DoD.

### The Post-Cold War "Procurement Holiday" (1990s)

- **Context**: With the collapse of the Soviet Union, defense budgets were slashed.
- **"Procurement Holiday"**: The DoD dramatically cut funding for buying new weapon systems. Instead of starting new programs, it focused on life-extending Cold War-era systems.
- **"Acquisition Reform" of the 1990s**: Led by Secretary of Defense William Perry, this wave of reform focused on using commercial practices. It encouraged the use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products and sought to streamline regulations.
- **The "Last Supper" (1993)**: This same period saw the DoD encourage the massive consolidation of the defense industry, reducing the number of prime contractors from over 50 to just 5.

### The Post-9/11 Spending Surge and Its Aftermath (2001-Present)

- **Context**: The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan led to a massive increase in defense spending.
- **Urgent Needs, Bypassed Processes**: The urgent need for equipment like MRAP vehicles led the DoD to bypass the traditional acquisition system, using rapid procurement authorities to field capabilities quickly. This demonstrated that the DoD *could* move fast when it had to.
- **The "Lost Decade"**: The focus on counter-terrorism led to underinvestment in capabilities for great power competition.
- **Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011**: Imposed strict caps on defense spending and led to a period of fiscal austerity known as "sequestration," which severely harmed military readiness.
- **A New Era of Reform (2015-Present)**:
    - **Better Buying Power**: A series of internal DoD initiatives to improve efficiency.
    - **Section 809 Panel (2018)**: A major congressional effort that produced a "roadmap" for acquisition reform, many of whose recommendations are still being debated or slowly implemented.
    - **Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF)**: The DoD's current attempt to create multiple, tailored pathways for acquisition, moving away from the rigid, one-size-fits-all model of the past.

The history of acquisition is cyclical: a period of high spending and scandals leads to a wave of reform, which is followed by a period of budget cuts, and then a new crisis reveals that the fundamental problems were never solved.
