# Budget and Procurement: Solutions

Reforming the defense budget and procurement system requires a multi-pronged approach that attacks the perverse incentives of the "Iron Triangle," simplifies the bureaucracy, and imposes fiscal discipline.

---

## 1. Reform the Budget Process

**A. Shift to Biennial Budgeting**

- **Description**: The annual budget process consumes enormous time and energy and creates funding instability. Shift the DoD to a two-year budget cycle.
- **Implementation**: Congress would pass a two-year defense appropriation bill every other year. The "off year" would be dedicated to more rigorous oversight and long-term planning.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Provides program managers with more stable funding and predictability. Frees up time for Congress and the DoD to focus on strategy and oversight rather than the annual budget grind.

**B. Create a "BRAC for Weapons"**

- **Description**: Just as the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process allowed the DoD to close unneeded bases, a similar mechanism is needed to cancel unneeded or underperforming weapon systems.
- **Implementation**: Charter an independent "Defense Programs Review Commission." The commission would develop an all-or-nothing list of recommended program terminations and cuts. Congress would be required to hold a simple up-or-down vote on the entire package, without amendments.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Breaks the Iron Triangle's grip by making it impossible for individual members of Congress to save their pet projects. Allows the DoD to get rid of legacy systems and reinvest the savings in higher priorities.

## 2. Reform the Acquisition Process

**A. Empower Program Managers and Enforce Accountability**

- **Description**: The current system diffuses responsibility. Give Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and Program Managers (PMs) true authority over their programs and hold them accountable for the results.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Empowerment**: Give PMs authority over requirements, budget, and personnel for their program.
    - **Accountability**: Tie PMs' careers to program performance. A PM who delivers on time and on budget gets promoted. A PM whose program suffers a critical Nunn-McCurdy breach is fired and cannot be reassigned to another major program.
    - **Tenure**: Require PMs to stay on a program for at least five years or through a major milestone to ensure continuity.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates clear lines of responsibility and accountability, rewarding success and punishing failure.

**B. Mandate Fixed-Price Contracts for Development**

- **Description**: The DoD currently uses "cost-plus" contracts for most development programs, which means the contractor is reimbursed for all its costs plus a fee. This creates no incentive to control costs.
- **Implementation**: Require that after a program passes Milestone B (the start of formal development), it must use a fixed-price incentive contract. The government and the contractor would agree on a target price, and then share the pain of any cost overruns or the savings from any underruns.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Forces contractors to have "skin in the game" and creates a powerful incentive to control costs during development.

**C. Adopt a Software-Centric Acquisition Model**

- **Description**: The current hardware-focused acquisition model is broken for software. Create a new, separate pathway designed for modern software development.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Fund Teams, Not Programs**: Instead of funding a specific software "program," fund standing teams of government and contractor software developers.
    - **DevSecOps**: Use modern DevSecOps practices (agile development, security, and operations) to deliver updated software to the warfighter in weeks or months, not years.
    - **Government-Owned Architecture**: The government should own the open systems architecture and data rights, allowing it to swap in new software from competing vendors easily.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Allows the DoD to acquire software at the speed of the commercial sector.

## 3. Foster a More Competitive Industrial Base

**A. Bridge the "Valley of Death"**

- **Description**: Create a dedicated funding mechanism to help innovative small companies transition their successful prototypes into real programs.
- **Implementation**: Establish a "Transition and Scaling Fund" of $5-10 billion. When a company proves its technology through an innovation hub like DIU, this fund would provide immediate bridge funding to scale production while the larger DoD contracting process catches up.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Prevents promising startups from dying while waiting for DoD bureaucracy. Signals to venture capital that the DoD is a serious partner.
