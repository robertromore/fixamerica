# Military Justice: Reform Roadmap

Reforming military justice requires a phased approach that builds on the momentum of the NDAA FY2022 reforms, establishes baseline data, expands proven models, and addresses the cultural and structural roots of persistent problems. Each phase includes specific actions, responsible actors, and measurable success metrics.

---

## Phase 1: Consolidation and Data Collection (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on ensuring the OSTC model is fully operational, collecting baseline data for future comparison, and enacting initial legislative expansions.

| Priority | Action | Responsible Actor | Success Metric |
|----------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1. OSTC Full Staffing | Ensure each service OSTC is fully staffed with experienced prosecutors, investigators, and support staff. | DoD, Service Secretaries | All OSTC offices at 100% authorized strength; average prosecutor experience exceeds 5 years. |
| 2. Defense Counsel Parity | Increase defense counsel funding and staffing to match OSTC expansion. | Congress (NDAA), Service JAGs | Defense-to-prosecution staffing ratio reaches 1:1 for covered offense cases. |
| 3. Baseline Data Collection | Collect comprehensive data on OSTC case outcomes, prosecution rates, conviction rates, and sentencing. | OSTC, DoD IG | First annual OSTC performance report published, comparing outcomes to pre-reform baselines. |
| 4. Racial Disparity Audit | Conduct department-wide audit of military justice outcomes by race and ethnicity. | DoD IG, Service IGs | Audit report published with data at installation, command, and service levels. |
| 5. Retaliation as Covered Offense | Enact legislation making retaliation against reporters a covered offense under OSTC authority. | Congress (NDAA) | Legislation enacted; OSTC begins investigating retaliation cases. |
| 6. Command Climate Survey Reform | Transition command climate surveys to independent administration. | DoD, IG | Independent surveys deployed at all installations. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Establish the data infrastructure and institutional capacity needed to evaluate reforms and justify expansion.

---

## Phase 2: Expansion and Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

This phase expands independent prosecution to all serious felonies, establishes sentencing guidelines, and implements victim protection and restorative justice programs.

| Priority | Action | Responsible Actor | Success Metric |
|----------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1. Expand OSTC to All Felonies | Amend the UCMJ to extend OSTC authority to all offenses punishable by more than one year of confinement. | Congress (NDAA) | Legislation enacted; OSTC caseload expands with corresponding staffing increase. |
| 2. Military Sentencing Guidelines Commission | Establish a commission to develop advisory sentencing guidelines. | Congress (legislation) | Commission chartered; initial guidelines published within 24 months. |
| 3. Victim Advocacy Independence | Create a DoD-wide independent victim advocate program. | DoD, Congress | Independent advocate offices operational at all major installations. |
| 4. Restorative Justice Pilot | Launch restorative justice pilot programs at 10 installations across all services. | DoD, Service JAGs | Pilot programs operational; data collection on outcomes, recidivism, and participant satisfaction underway. |
| 5. NJP Review Board | Establish independent NJP Review Boards within each service. | Congress, Service Secretaries | Review Boards operational; first annual report on NJP appeal outcomes published. |
| 6. Blind Charging Pilot | Implement blind charging review pilot for non-covered offenses. | Service JAGs | Pilot data compared to non-pilot installations for disparity reduction. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Expand proven reforms, close remaining gaps in independent prosecution, and implement new accountability mechanisms.

---

## Phase 3: Cultural Change and Institutionalization (Years 5-10)

This phase focuses on embedding reforms into military culture, evaluating long-term outcomes, and making adjustments based on data.

| Priority | Action | Responsible Actor | Success Metric |
|----------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1. Command Climate as Promotion Factor | Implement mandatory command climate evaluation as a weighted factor in promotion to O-6 and above. | DoD, Service Secretaries | Command climate scores integrated into promotion board precepts. |
| 2. Restorative Justice Expansion | Based on pilot data, expand restorative justice to all installations. | DoD | Restorative justice available as an alternative to NJP at all installations. |
| 3. Sentencing Guidelines Implementation | Military judges begin applying advisory sentencing guidelines. | Military judiciary, Sentencing Commission | Sentencing variance reduced by 30% compared to pre-guidelines baseline. |
| 4. 5-Year Reform Assessment | Conduct comprehensive assessment of all reforms implemented since NDAA FY2022. | GAO, DoD IG, DAC-IPAD | Assessment published; Congress uses findings to adjust reforms. |
| 5. Racial Equity Benchmarks | Evaluate whether racial disparities have narrowed since audit implementation. | DoD IG | Racial disparity ratios reduced by 50% from Phase 1 baseline. |
| 6. Allied Military Benchmarking | Compare U.S. military justice outcomes with allied nations that have adopted independent prosecution. | DoD, GAO | Comparative report published; U.S. outcomes comparable to or better than allies. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: Confirm that structural reforms have produced sustained cultural change and make adjustments where data indicates underperformance.

## Success Metrics Summary

| Metric | Current Baseline | Phase 1 Target | Phase 2 Target | Phase 3 Target |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Sexual assault reporting rate | ~25-30% | 35% | 45% | 55%+ |
| Conviction rate (sexual assault, of cases tried) | ~50% | 55% | 60% | 65%+ |
| Retaliation rate (reported by victims) | ~64% | 50% | 35% | 20% |
| Racial disparity ratio (NJP, Black:White) | 1.3-2.6x | Measured and published | 1.5x or less | 1.2x or less |
| Defense-to-prosecution staffing ratio | ~0.6:1 | 0.8:1 | 1:1 | 1:1 |
| Sentencing variance (same offense, cross-service) | Unmeasured | Measured and published | Reduced 20% | Reduced 30% |
| Command climate survey participation | ~60% | 75% | 85% | 90%+ |

## Risk Factors and Contingencies

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Congressional resistance to OSTC expansion | Build coalition of bipartisan support using OSTC performance data from Phase 1. |
| Insufficient OSTC staffing | Include mandatory staffing floors in authorizing legislation; authorize retention bonuses for experienced JAG prosecutors. |
| Institutional resistance to racial equity audits | Mandate audits by statute rather than directive; assign oversight to DoD IG rather than service self-reporting. |
| Appellate challenges to reformed procedures | Ensure reforms are drafted to withstand constitutional scrutiny; consult with CAAF practitioners during drafting. |
| Cultural resistance to restorative justice | Begin with a pilot that demonstrates results; involve command leadership in program design. |
