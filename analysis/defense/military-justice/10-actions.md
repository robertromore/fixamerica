# Military Justice: Actions

## Overview

Citizens, service members, military families, and advocates can all take concrete steps to advance military justice reform. While much of the reform agenda requires congressional action, sustained public engagement is essential to overcoming institutional resistance and maintaining political momentum. The historic reforms of 2021-2023 succeeded because a coalition of survivors, advocates, bipartisan legislators, and informed citizens refused to accept the status quo.

## For All Citizens

### Educate Yourself

- Read the DoD SAPRO Annual Report (publicly available) to understand the scale of the sexual assault crisis in the military.
- Follow the DAC-IPAD's reports for independent analysis of military justice outcomes.
- Understand the difference between the current OSTC model and the broader reforms proposed, so you can advocate effectively.

### Contact Your Representatives

- Urge your Senators and Representative to support expansion of the Office of Special Trial Counsel's authority to all serious felonies.
- Ask your representatives to support mandatory racial disparity audits in military justice.
- Request that your representatives serve on or engage with the Armed Services Committees, which have jurisdiction over military justice.

### Support Advocacy Organizations

| Organization | How to Engage | Focus Area |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Protect Our Defenders | Donate, volunteer, amplify research | Sexual assault reform, racial equity |
| Service Women's Action Network (SWAN) | Membership, advocacy campaigns | Women in military, assault policy |
| National Institute of Military Justice (NIMJ) | Attend events, support legal scholarship | Systemic military justice reform |
| Survivors United / I Am Vanessa Guillen | Sign petitions, attend events | Victim advocacy, accountability |
| American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) | Military rights campaign, legal support | Due process, civil liberties |
| Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) | Membership, policy campaigns | Veteran and service member advocacy |

### Amplify Survivor Voices

- Share reports and stories from military sexual assault survivors (with their consent and on their terms).
- Support survivor-led campaigns and legislative efforts.
- Challenge narratives that minimize the scale of the problem or blame victims.

## For Current Service Members

### Know Your Rights

- **Article 31 Rights**: You have the right to remain silent and to be informed of your rights before interrogation. Exercise these rights.
- **Right to Counsel**: In any general or special court-martial, you have the right to military defense counsel at no cost and the right to retain civilian counsel at your own expense.
- **Restricted Reporting**: If you are a victim of sexual assault, you may file a restricted report that provides access to medical care and victim advocacy without triggering a criminal investigation. This allows you to receive support while deciding whether to pursue an unrestricted report.
- **Expedited Transfer**: If you report a sexual assault, you have the right to request an expedited transfer to a different unit or installation.
- **Special Victims' Counsel/Victims' Legal Counsel**: Sexual assault victims have the right to their own attorney (SVC/VLC) who represents their interests throughout the process, independent of the prosecution and the chain of command.

### Report Misconduct

- If you witness or are a victim of sexual assault, harassment, or other misconduct, report it. The system will not change unless the scale of the problem is visible.
- Use the OSTC for covered offenses. The Special Trial Counsel is now the decision-maker for prosecution, not your commander.
- Document retaliation. If you experience retaliation after reporting, document specific incidents, dates, and witnesses. Report retaliation to the DoD Inspector General hotline (1-800-424-9098) and your SVC/VLC.

### Participate in Climate Surveys

- Answer command climate surveys honestly. These surveys are the primary tool for identifying command climate problems, and their effectiveness depends on candid participation.
- If you believe a survey is not being administered independently or that responses are not confidential, report this to the IG.

## For Military Families

### Understand the System

- Familiarize yourself with the military justice process, particularly as it relates to domestic violence and family-related offenses. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) is the primary entry point for reporting domestic abuse on a military installation.
- Know that military protective orders (MPOs) can be issued by commanders and that violation of an MPO is a UCMJ offense.

### Access Resources

| Resource | Contact |
|----------|---------|
| Military OneSource (crisis support) | 1-800-342-9647 |

### Advocate for Families

- Support legislation that extends victim protections to military dependents.
- Urge your installation's Family Readiness Group to include military justice awareness in its programming.
- Connect with Blue Star Families and other military family organizations that engage in policy advocacy.

## For Attorneys and Legal Professionals

### Pro Bono Representation

- Volunteer with organizations that provide pro bono legal assistance to service members facing courts-martial. The National Institute of Military Justice maintains a referral network.
- Provide assistance to service members navigating the NJP appeal process, where the right to counsel is not guaranteed.

### Research and Publication

- Conduct and publish research on military justice outcomes, racial disparities, and the effectiveness of recent reforms.
- Submit amicus briefs in cases before the CAAF and federal courts that raise significant military justice issues.

### Policy Engagement

- Testify before congressional committees on military justice reform.
- Provide technical assistance to legislative staff drafting military justice legislation.
- Participate in ABA Standing Committee on Armed Forces Law activities.

## For Journalists and Researchers

### Investigate and Report

- Use FOIA requests to obtain military justice data that is not publicly available, including installation-level discipline data, NJP statistics, and command climate survey results.
- Report on OSTC implementation, including staffing levels, case outcomes, and defense counsel resource parity.
- Investigate specific cases that illustrate systemic problems, including retaliation against reporters and racial disparities in discipline.

### Accountability Journalism

- Compare military justice outcomes across installations and services to identify outliers.
- Track the military's implementation of reform mandates and report on delays, resistance, or non-compliance.
- Interview service members (active, reserve, and veterans) about their experiences with the military justice system, ensuring their anonymity and safety.

## Key Congressional Contacts

| Committee | Role | Relevance |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Senate Armed Services Committee | Authorizes military policy and UCMJ amendments | Primary jurisdiction over military justice reform |
| House Armed Services Committee | House counterpart to SASC | Shares jurisdiction over NDAA |
| Senate Judiciary Committee | Oversight of federal courts, including military appellate review | Secondary jurisdiction |
| Congressional delegations from states with major military installations | Constituent pressure from military families | Political leverage for reform |

## Advocacy Strategy

1. **Sustain Attention**: The biggest risk to military justice reform is that public attention fades between scandals. Sustained advocacy prevents the reform-complacency cycle from repeating.
2. **Build Bipartisan Coalitions**: The OSTC reforms passed because they had bipartisan support (Gillibrand and Ernst). Future reforms should be framed around fairness, accountability, and military effectiveness, not partisan ideology.
3. **Use Data**: Demand and publicize data on military justice outcomes. Data transparency makes it impossible for the institution to claim progress without evidence.
4. **Center Survivors**: Let survivors lead the narrative. The I Am Vanessa Guillen campaign demonstrated the power of survivor-centered advocacy.
5. **Engage Veterans**: Veterans who experienced the military justice system firsthand are powerful advocates for reform. Veterans' organizations should make military justice a priority issue.
