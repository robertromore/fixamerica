# Military Justice: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming military justice requires addressing both the structural deficiencies that enable systemic failures and the cultural dynamics that perpetuate them. The solutions proposed here build on the historic NDAA FY2022 reforms while extending them to areas those reforms did not fully address: the scope of independent prosecution, racial equity, due process protections, sentencing consistency, and command climate accountability. Each solution is grounded in evidence from DoD studies, congressional reports, allied military models, and academic research.

## Solution 1: Expand Independent Prosecution to All Serious Felonies

### Problem Addressed

The OSTC model currently covers a defined list of "covered offenses" including sexual assault, murder, domestic violence, and several other serious crimes. However, many felony-level offenses remain under commander control, creating an inconsistent system where some serious crimes receive independent prosecution and others do not.

### Proposal

Expand OSTC authority to cover all offenses punishable by confinement of more than one year (felony equivalents), including:

- All drug trafficking offenses (as opposed to simple possession)
- Aggravated assault
- Robbery and larceny of significant value
- Fraud and corruption
- Arson
- All offenses currently triable by general court-martial

### Evidence Base

- The United Kingdom's Service Prosecuting Authority exercises independent prosecution authority over all serious criminal offenses in the British military. Canada, Australia, and Germany have adopted similar models.
- A 2022 RAND Corporation study found that the expansion of independent prosecution authority in allied militaries did not result in measurable declines in military discipline or readiness.
- The DAC-IPAD recommended in its 2020 report that prosecution decisions for all penetrative sexual offenses and related serious crimes be removed from commanders, laying the groundwork for broader expansion.

### Implementation

- Amend 10 U.S.C. section 824a to expand the definition of "covered offenses" to include all offenses punishable by more than one year of confinement.
- Increase OSTC staffing proportionally to handle the expanded caseload.
- Retain commander authority over uniquely military offenses (AWOL, disrespect, dereliction of duty) and all non-judicial punishment.

## Solution 2: Victim Advocacy and Protection Improvements

### Problem Addressed

Retaliation against sexual assault reporters remains pervasive (affecting approximately 64% of reporters), and victim services vary significantly across installations and services.

### Proposal

- **Mandatory Retaliation Prosecution**: Make retaliation against sexual assault reporters a covered offense under OSTC authority, ensuring that retaliation cases are investigated and prosecuted independently of the chain of command.
- **Expedited Transfer Enhancement**: Strengthen and standardize the expedited transfer program so that victims who request a transfer receive one within 30 days, with no adverse impact on their career trajectory.
- **Independent Victim Advocate Program**: Create a DoD-wide independent victim advocate program that reports outside the chain of command, replacing the current system where victim advocates are often assigned to the same command as the accused.
- **Safe Housing Guarantee**: Require installations to maintain dedicated safe housing for victims during the investigation and prosecution process.

### Evidence Base

- DoD surveys consistently find that fear of retaliation is the primary deterrent to reporting. Addressing retaliation directly is necessary for any other reform to succeed.
- The RAND Corporation's 2014 study, "Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment in the U.S. Military," found that the quality of victim services was the strongest predictor of reporting rates.

## Solution 3: Racial Bias Audits and Accountability

### Problem Addressed

Black service members are 1.3 to 2.6 times more likely than white service members to receive non-judicial punishment or face courts-martial, depending on the service branch. These disparities have been documented for over 50 years with insufficient institutional response.

### Proposal

- **Mandatory Annual Disparity Audits**: Require each service to conduct and publicly report annual audits of military justice outcomes by race and ethnicity at every stage: investigation, NJP, charges preferred, court-martial referral, conviction, and sentencing.
- **Commander Accountability**: Include racial disparity metrics in commander evaluations. Commanders whose units show statistically significant unexplained disparities would be required to undergo additional training and develop corrective action plans.
- **Blind Charging Reviews**: Implement a pilot program where charging decisions for non-covered offenses are reviewed by a JAG officer with demographic information about the accused redacted.
- **Implicit Bias Training**: Require evidence-based implicit bias training for all commanders, military judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, and investigators, with annual refresher requirements.

### Evidence Base

- The Air Force Inspector General's 2020 report confirmed racial disparities across multiple metrics and recommended data-driven approaches to identifying and addressing bias.
- The civilian federal court system has implemented demographic data collection requirements (under the Equal Justice Initiative's recommendations) that could serve as a model for the military.
- Research on blind auditing in civilian hiring and promotion has shown measurable reductions in discriminatory outcomes.

## Solution 4: Sentencing Reform and Guidelines

### Problem Addressed

Military sentencing has historically been inconsistent, with wide variation in sentences for similar offenses across services and jurisdictions. The transfer of sentencing authority from panels to military judges (NDAA FY2022) was a step forward, but without sentencing guidelines, individual judges retain enormous discretion.

### Proposal

- **Military Sentencing Guidelines**: Establish a Military Sentencing Guidelines Commission (modeled on the U.S. Sentencing Commission) to develop advisory sentencing guidelines for courts-martial.
- **Sentencing Data Transparency**: Require the publication of sentencing data by offense type, service, installation, and demographics to enable analysis of consistency and disparities.
- **Mandatory Minimums for Sexual Assault**: Establish minimum sentences for sexual assault convictions that include a dishonorable discharge and a minimum period of confinement, ending the practice of convicted sex offenders receiving minimal punishment.
- **Sentence Comparison Tool**: Create a database accessible to military judges that shows the range of sentences imposed for comparable offenses across all services.

### Evidence Base

- The civilian Federal Sentencing Guidelines, while imperfect, have reduced sentencing disparity by providing a structured framework for judicial decisions.
- A 2021 DAC-IPAD analysis found significant variation in sexual assault sentences across the services, with some convictions resulting in only a reprimand while others involving similar conduct resulted in years of confinement.

## Solution 5: Expanded Appellate Rights

### Problem Addressed

Military appellate review is limited compared to civilian federal courts. Cases not involving a punitive discharge or confinement of one year or more receive no automatic appellate review. Article 15 (NJP) decisions, which affect tens of thousands of service members annually, have virtually no appellate review mechanism.

### Proposal

- **Lowered Appellate Threshold**: Extend automatic appellate review to all general and special courts-martial convictions, regardless of sentence.
- **NJP Review Board**: Create an independent NJP Review Board within each service to hear appeals of non-judicial punishment decisions, staffed by senior JAG officers and civilian members.
- **Habeas Corpus Clarification**: Clarify by statute that military prisoners have the right to habeas corpus review in federal district courts for constitutional claims.
- **Post-Conviction Review**: Establish a military innocence review process for cases where new evidence emerges or where systemic flaws (such as demonstrated investigator misconduct) are identified.

### Evidence Base

- The limited scope of military appellate review has been criticized by the American Bar Association, the National Institute of Military Justice, and CAAF judges in published opinions.
- Allied militaries provide broader appellate rights without compromising military discipline.

## Solution 6: Restorative Justice for Lesser Offenses

### Problem Addressed

The current system offers commanders a binary choice for minor offenses: non-judicial punishment (which creates a permanent record and can end a career) or informal counseling (which may be insufficient). There is no intermediate option that focuses on accountability, repair, and rehabilitation.

### Proposal

- **Military Restorative Justice Program**: Establish a restorative justice pilot program for minor offenses (simple assault, minor property offenses, disrespect, minor drug possession) where the offender, victim (if any), and affected unit participate in a facilitated process.
- **Diversion From NJP**: Allow commanders to refer appropriate cases to the restorative justice program as an alternative to Article 15, with successful completion resulting in no permanent disciplinary record.
- **Trained Facilitators**: Develop a cadre of trained restorative justice facilitators within each service's JAG corps.
- **Exclusions**: Exclude sexual assault, domestic violence, and other serious offenses from the restorative justice program.

### Evidence Base

- Restorative justice programs in civilian jurisdictions (including New Zealand, where the model originated, and numerous U.S. states) show lower recidivism rates, higher victim satisfaction, and reduced costs compared to traditional prosecution.
- The New Zealand Defence Force has implemented a restorative justice program for minor disciplinary matters with positive results, including improved unit cohesion and reduced repeat offenses.

## Solution 7: Command Climate Accountability

### Problem Addressed

Commanders are currently evaluated on their units' operational readiness but face limited accountability for the health of their command climate, including rates of sexual assault, harassment, and discipline disparities.

### Proposal

- **Command Climate as Promotion Factor**: Require that command climate assessments, including sexual assault prevention effectiveness, be a mandatory evaluation factor in promotion decisions for all battalion/squadron commanders and above.
- **Independent Climate Surveys**: Replace command-administered climate surveys with independently administered surveys conducted by the DoD Inspector General or an external contractor, ensuring that service members can respond honestly without fear of command retaliation.
- **Relief for Command Climate Failure**: Establish clear standards under which a commander can be relieved for sustained failure to maintain a safe command climate, even in the absence of a specific incident or crime.
- **Reporting Rates as a Positive Metric**: Shift the institutional narrative so that higher reporting rates are viewed as a sign of trust in the system rather than a sign of failure, incentivizing commanders to create environments where service members feel safe reporting.

### Evidence Base

- The IRC recommended that command climate be a central factor in officer evaluation and promotion.
- Research on organizational culture change shows that accountability at the leadership level is the most powerful driver of behavioral change throughout an organization.
