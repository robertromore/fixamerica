# Military Justice: History

## Colonial and Early American Period (1775-1916)

### Articles of War

Military justice in the American tradition traces directly to the British Articles of War, which the Continental Congress adopted with minor modifications in 1775 to govern the Continental Army. These articles, drafted largely by John Adams, gave commanders near-absolute authority over discipline. Punishments were severe and summary: flogging, branding, running the gauntlet, and execution were common.

The Articles of War were revised periodically (notably in 1806 and 1874) but retained their essential character as instruments of command authority. Key features included:

- Commanders convened courts-martial, selected the panel members, and reviewed the findings.
- There was no independent appellate review. The convening authority (typically the commanding general) was the final arbiter of guilt and sentence.
- The accused had no guaranteed right to trained legal counsel.
- The system was designed for a small professional army and operated largely outside civilian legal norms.

### World War I Abuses

The massive expansion of the military during World War I exposed the harshness and arbitrariness of the system. Over 100,000 courts-martial were conducted during the war. Harsh sentences for trivial offenses, racial discrimination in the application of discipline, and the lack of due process protections drew widespread criticism.

- The "Houston Riot" courts-martial (1917) resulted in 13 Black soldiers being hanged after a summary trial with no appellate review, a case that highlighted the intersection of racial injustice and military justice.
- Post-war investigations by Samuel T. Ansell, the acting Judge Advocate General, revealed systemic abuses and led to calls for reform that were largely resisted by the military establishment.

## The Uniform Code of Military Justice (1950)

### Elston Act (1948) and the Drive for Reform

Following World War II, the scale of military justice problems was undeniable. Over 2 million courts-martial were conducted during the war, with widely varying standards across the services. Public outcry, congressional investigation, and the advocacy of figures like Secretary of Defense James Forrestal led to a comprehensive reform effort.

### Enactment of the UCMJ

The Uniform Code of Military Justice was enacted on May 5, 1950 (Pub. L. 81-506), and took effect on May 31, 1951. It represented the most sweeping reform of military justice in American history.

**Key innovations of the UCMJ:**

- **Uniformity**: For the first time, all branches of the military operated under a single code of justice.
- **Court of Military Appeals**: Created a civilian appellate court (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces) to provide independent review of serious cases.
- **Right to Counsel**: Guaranteed the right to military defense counsel in general and special courts-martial.
- **Article 31 Rights**: Created a self-incrimination protection (predating *Miranda v. Arizona* by 16 years) requiring that service members be informed of their rights before interrogation.
- **Article 37 (Command Influence)**: Explicitly prohibited unlawful command influence over courts-martial proceedings.
- **Appellate Review**: Established automatic appellate review for cases resulting in a punitive discharge, confinement of one year or more, or a sentence affecting a general officer.

**Retained commander authority:**

Despite these reforms, the UCMJ preserved the commander's central role. Commanders still controlled convening authority (deciding whether to bring charges to trial), selected panel members, and could reduce or set aside findings and sentences through clemency.

## The Military Justice Act of 1968

### Reforms

In response to continuing criticism of the system during the Vietnam War era, Congress enacted the Military Justice Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-632), which introduced further reforms:

- **Military Judges**: Created the position of military judge, a legally trained officer who presides over courts-martial, replacing the former system where the senior panel member served as presiding officer.
- **Judge-Alone Trials**: Allowed the accused to elect trial by military judge alone, rather than by a panel.
- **Expanded Counsel Rights**: Strengthened the right to counsel and required defense counsel to be qualified attorneys.

### Vietnam-Era Pressures

The Vietnam War strained the military justice system severely:

- Courts-martial rates soared as discipline broke down, particularly in rear-area units.
- Racial tensions led to disproportionate punishment of Black service members, sparking unrest on bases and aboard ships (notably the USS *Kitty Hawk* and USS *Constellation* incidents in 1972).
- Fragging (the killing of unpopular officers by their own troops) reached alarming levels, with over 900 documented incidents between 1969 and 1972.
- Anti-war sentiment within the ranks tested the boundaries of free speech and the military justice system's treatment of dissent.

## The Tailhook Scandal and Sexual Assault Awareness (1991)

### The Incident

In September 1991, at the Tailhook Association's annual convention in Las Vegas, over 100 Navy and Marine Corps officers were involved in sexual assaults and harassment of at least 83 women and 7 men. The initial Navy investigation was widely criticized as a cover-up.

### Aftermath

- The Naval Inspector General's initial investigation identified only 2 suspects. A subsequent DoD Inspector General investigation identified 140 officers involved in indecent assaults or related misconduct.
- Not a single officer was convicted at court-martial. Administrative actions (censures, fines) were the most serious consequences.
- The Secretary of the Navy resigned. The Chief of Naval Operations retired early.
- Tailhook became a symbol of both the military's sexual assault problem and the justice system's inability to hold perpetrators accountable.

### Legislative Response

- Congress mandated the creation of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) review of sexual harassment policies.
- The DoD implemented new sexual harassment training requirements and reporting mechanisms.
- Congress opened combat aviation positions to women (1993), partly to address the cultural dynamics that enabled Tailhook.

## Aberdeen Proving Ground and Service Academy Scandals (1996-2003)

- **Aberdeen (1996)**: Drill sergeants at Aberdeen Proving Ground were convicted of sexual assault against trainees, revealing endemic abuse of authority in the training environment.
- **Air Force Academy (2003)**: An investigation revealed decades of sexual assault at the Air Force Academy, with victims systematically discouraged from reporting and sometimes punished for coming forward. Over 140 women reported assaults during a decade-long period.
- These scandals reinforced the pattern: revelations of systemic sexual assault, inadequate institutional response, congressional outrage, incremental reforms, and then a return to the status quo.

## The Modern Reform Movement (2004-2020)

### Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO)

In 2005, following the Air Force Academy scandal, the DoD created the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office to centralize oversight of sexual assault policy across the department. SAPRO introduced:

- Restricted and unrestricted reporting options (allowing victims to access services without triggering an investigation).
- The Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) system.
- Annual prevalence surveys and reporting requirements.

### The Gillibrand-Ernst Reform Efforts

Beginning in 2013, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced the Military Justice Improvement Act (MJIA), which proposed removing commanders' authority to prosecute serious crimes, including sexual assault, and transferring it to independent military prosecutors. The bill attracted bipartisan support but repeatedly failed to overcome procedural hurdles in the Senate.

- **2013-2014**: The MJIA received 55 Senate votes in March 2014 (60 required to overcome a filibuster). The competing McCaskill bill (keeping prosecution authority with commanders but providing other reforms) was enacted instead.
- **2015-2020**: Gillibrand continued to introduce the MJIA each Congress, gradually building support. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) became a key Republican co-sponsor, reflecting bipartisan momentum.
- **Key Opposition**: The Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs, and Senate Armed Services Committee leadership (including Senators Carl Levin and John McCain) opposed removing commander authority, arguing it would undermine military discipline.

### Independent Review Commission (2021)

In February 2021, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin established the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military (IRC). The IRC's July 2021 report recommended:

- Removing prosecution of sexual assault, domestic violence, and related crimes from the chain of command.
- Creating independent Special Victims' Prosecutors within each service.
- Professionalizing prevention through dedicated workforce specialists.
- Enhancing accountability for commanders who fail to maintain safe command climates.

The IRC's recommendations closely mirrored the Gillibrand-Ernst proposals and provided political cover for the Pentagon to accept reforms it had resisted for nearly a decade.

## Historic Reforms: NDAA FY2022-FY2024

### NDAA FY2022 (Pub. L. 117-81)

Enacted December 27, 2021, this legislation represented the most significant change to military justice since the UCMJ itself:

- **Office of Special Trial Counsel (OSTC)**: Established independent prosecutor offices within each military department with authority over "covered offenses."
- **Covered Offenses**: Sexual assault, murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, domestic violence, child abuse, stalking, and other specified serious crimes.
- **Commander Authority Removed**: Commanders lost the authority to decide whether to prosecute covered offenses. Special Trial Counsel exercise independent prosecutorial discretion.
- **Sentencing Reform**: Military judges (rather than panels) became the default sentencing authority.
- **Implementation Timeline**: Full OSTC operational capability required by December 2023.

### NDAA FY2023 (Pub. L. 117-263)

- Expanded the list of covered offenses under OSTC authority.
- Required data collection comparing OSTC outcomes with pre-reform baselines.
- Mandated IG review of OSTC implementation.

### NDAA FY2024 (Pub. L. 118-31)

- Required reporting on OSTC resource adequacy and defense counsel parity.
- Directed a study on extending independent prosecution to all felony-level offenses.
- Enhanced whistleblower protections for service members who report misconduct.
