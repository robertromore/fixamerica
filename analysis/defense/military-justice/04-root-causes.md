# Military Justice: Root Causes

## Overview

The persistent failures of the military justice system, particularly in addressing sexual assault, racial disparities, and due process concerns, are not the result of individual bad actors but of deep structural and cultural features of the military institution. Understanding these root causes is essential to designing reforms that go beyond surface-level fixes.

## Root Cause 1: The Commander-Centric Model

### Description

The UCMJ was designed around the commander as the central authority in the justice process. Commanders convene investigations, decide whether to prefer charges, select the type of court-martial, choose panel members, and exercise clemency. While the 2021-2023 reforms removed commander authority over covered offenses, commanders still control the vast majority of disciplinary actions, including all non-judicial punishment (Article 15) proceedings and courts-martial for non-covered offenses.

### Why It Persists

- **Doctrine of Command Responsibility**: Military doctrine holds that commanders are responsible for everything their units do or fail to do. Proponents of the commander-centric model argue that you cannot hold a commander responsible for discipline if you remove their disciplinary tools.
- **Institutional Inertia**: The military's senior leadership, all of whom rose through the commander-centric system, tends to defend the system that formed them. For decades, the Joint Chiefs unanimously opposed removing commander prosecution authority.
- **Disciplinary Breadth**: The UCMJ covers conduct (e.g., adultery, disrespect, absence without leave) that has no civilian criminal equivalent. Commanders argue they need broad discretion to address uniquely military offenses that affect unit cohesion and readiness.

### Impact

- Victims of sexual assault and other serious crimes historically faced a system where the person deciding whether to prosecute was their commanding officer or the accused's commanding officer, creating obvious conflicts of interest.
- Commanders with no legal training made prosecution decisions that trained prosecutors might have decided differently.
- The perception of commander control deterred reporting, as victims feared the commander would side with the accused (particularly if the accused was a higher-performing service member).

## Root Cause 2: Military Culture of Conformity and Hierarchy

### Description

Military effectiveness depends on unit cohesion, obedience to orders, and a culture of selfless service. These values, while operationally essential, create an environment that can suppress individual complaints, discourage reporting of misconduct, and punish those who challenge the group.

### How It Manifests

- **"Don't Rock the Boat" Mentality**: Service members who report sexual assault, hazing, or other misconduct are often seen as disloyal to their unit, disrupting cohesion, or undermining the mission.
- **Rank Hierarchy as Barrier**: The strict hierarchy makes it difficult for junior service members to report misconduct by superiors. Even when formal reporting mechanisms exist, the power differential discourages their use.
- **Warrior Culture**: Particularly in combat arms branches, a hyper-masculine "warrior culture" can normalize sexual harassment and aggression while stigmatizing vulnerability and help-seeking.
- **Loyalty to Peers Over Principles**: Witnesses to misconduct may refuse to cooperate with investigators out of loyalty to fellow service members, particularly in elite units with strong unit identities.

### Impact

- Creates an environment where sexual assault is underreported and perpetrators are shielded by unit loyalty.
- Whistleblowers and reporters of misconduct face social ostracism and professional retaliation that is difficult to prove and harder to remedy.
- Reforms that depend on cultural change (reporting, bystander intervention) are slow to take effect because they conflict with deeply ingrained institutional norms.

## Root Cause 3: Retaliation and Its Tolerance

### Description

Retaliation against service members who report sexual assault or other misconduct is pervasive and insufficiently punished. Retaliation takes multiple forms: social (ostracism, rumors), professional (negative evaluations, loss of assignments, involuntary separation), and legal (counter-charges against the reporter).

### Why It Persists

- **Diffuse Responsibility**: Retaliation often comes from multiple sources (peers, NCOs, commanders) and manifests as a pattern of small actions rather than a single identifiable act, making it difficult to investigate and prove.
- **Weak Enforcement**: While the UCMJ prohibits retaliation (Article 132), enforcement has been minimal. Retaliation complaints are investigated by the same chain of command that may be enabling the retaliation.
- **Career Incentives**: Commanders who "make problems go away" (including by discouraging reports) are rewarded with smooth command tours. Commanders who have high numbers of sexual assault reports in their units may be perceived as having failed, creating a perverse incentive to suppress reporting.
- **Perception of False Accusations**: A culture that questions the credibility of accusers provides social cover for retaliation, framing it as legitimate skepticism rather than punishment for reporting.

### Impact

- The DoD's own surveys find that approximately two-thirds of sexual assault reporters experience retaliation, making retaliation the single biggest deterrent to reporting.
- Reporters who face retaliation are far more likely to leave the military, taking their skills and experience with them while the perpetrator remains.
- The failure to punish retaliation sends a clear signal to potential reporters about the risks of coming forward.

## Root Cause 4: Insufficient Investigator and Prosecutor Training

### Description

Military criminal investigations are conducted by service-specific organizations (Army CID, NCIS, Air Force OSI) whose investigators historically lacked the specialized training required for complex criminal cases, particularly sexual assault.

### Specific Deficiencies

- **Investigator Rotation**: Military investigators are often rotated through assignments every 2-3 years, preventing the development of deep specialization. Until recently, Army CID investigators were not required to be credentialed law enforcement officers.
- **Forensic Capability**: Military forensic labs have historically been underfunded and understaffed. A 2022 DoD IG report found significant backlogs in processing sexual assault evidence kits.
- **Prosecutor Inexperience**: Military prosecutors (trial counsel) are typically junior JAG officers with 2-5 years of experience, often handling their first serious felony case. They face defense counsel of similar experience levels, but in sexual assault cases, the defense often retains experienced civilian attorneys.
- **Trauma-Informed Practices**: Training in trauma-informed interviewing and investigation techniques has been inconsistent across the services, leading to re-traumatization of victims and loss of evidence.

### Impact

- Poorly conducted investigations lead to cases that cannot be prosecuted, even when the evidence initially appeared sufficient.
- Inexperienced prosecutors lose cases that better-trained civilian prosecutors might have won.
- Victims who endure an inadequate investigation process are less likely to cooperate with future proceedings or encourage others to report.

## Root Cause 5: Structural Lack of Independence

### Description

The military justice system operates within the military hierarchy. Judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, and investigators are all military officers subject to the same promotion system, assignment process, and command structure. This creates structural conflicts of interest that no amount of ethical commitment can fully overcome.

### Specific Concerns

- **Judge Independence**: Military judges are assigned by a Judge Advocate General and can be reassigned. While the UCMJ prohibits interference with judicial decisions, judges operate within a system where their career advancement depends on evaluations by other military officers.
- **Defense Counsel Resources**: Defense counsel offices are typically less well-funded and staffed than prosecution offices. The creation of well-resourced OSTC offices has widened this gap, raising Sixth Amendment concerns.
- **Investigator Reporting**: Military criminal investigative organizations report to service leadership, not to an independent authority. This creates the possibility that investigations may be influenced by institutional interests.

### Impact

- Structural dependency undermines public confidence in the impartiality of military justice, regardless of the personal integrity of individual judges, prosecutors, and investigators.
- Defense counsel shortages mean that accused service members may receive constitutionally inadequate representation.
- The appearance of structural bias provides grounds for appellate challenges that undermine the finality of convictions.

## Root Cause 6: Racial Bias in Military Discipline

### Description

Racial disparities in military justice are persistent and well-documented, but the military has been slow to acknowledge their causes or implement effective remedies. Black service members are overrepresented at every stage of the disciplinary process, from Article 15 proceedings through courts-martial.

### Contributing Factors

- **Discretionary Decision Points**: The military justice system contains numerous discretionary decision points (whether to counsel, issue NJP, prefer charges, refer to court-martial) where implicit bias can influence outcomes. The more discretion, the more opportunity for bias.
- **Disproportionate Surveillance**: Studies have found that Black service members are more likely to be stopped, questioned, and searched by military law enforcement, mirroring civilian policing patterns.
- **Cultural Bias in Subjective Standards**: Military offenses like "conduct unbecoming," "disrespect," and "failure to maintain standards" involve subjective judgments that can be influenced by racial stereotypes about behavior, demeanor, and professionalism.
- **Lack of Demographic Diversity in Leadership**: The military's senior leadership, particularly in combat arms branches, remains disproportionately white, creating the potential for in-group favoritism in discretionary decisions.

### Impact

- Black service members receive non-judicial punishment at rates 1.3 to 2.6 times higher than white service members across the services.
- The perception of racial unfairness undermines unit cohesion, morale, and retention among minority service members.
- Failure to address racial disparities exposes the military to legal challenges and erodes its credibility as a meritocratic institution.

## Root Cause 7: Political Dynamics and Reform Cycles

### Description

Military justice reform has followed a predictable cycle for decades: a scandal generates public outrage, Congress passes incremental reforms, the military claims progress, attention fades, and the underlying problems persist until the next scandal.

### Why the Cycle Continues

- **Military Resistance to External Reform**: The military establishment has historically viewed congressional reforms as threats to command authority and military culture, leading to resistance, slow implementation, and bureaucratic workarounds.
- **Congressional Deference**: The Armed Services Committees have traditionally deferred to military leadership on questions of military justice, accepting Pentagon assurances that internal reforms were sufficient.
- **Absence of Sustained Advocacy**: Unlike civilian criminal justice reform, which has a large and organized advocacy community, military justice reform has fewer stakeholders and less sustained public attention.
- **Data Opacity**: The military's data collection on justice outcomes has historically been fragmented and incomplete, making it difficult for external reviewers to identify trends and hold the institution accountable.

### Impact

- Decades of incremental reform failed to reduce sexual assault prevalence or increase conviction rates.
- The cycle of scandal-reform-complacency has eroded trust among service members that the institution is capable of meaningful change.
- The most significant reforms (OSTC, independent prosecution) came only after sustained multi-year advocacy efforts that overcame institutional resistance.
