# Military Justice: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

The military justice system is governed primarily by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. sections 801-946a), the Manual for Courts-Martial (an executive order implementing the UCMJ), and service-specific regulations. The historic NDAA FY2022 reforms created the Office of Special Trial Counsel and transferred prosecution authority for specified serious crimes from commanders to independent military prosecutors. However, significant gaps remain: independent prosecution does not extend to all serious felonies, due process protections for accused service members lag behind civilian standards, and there is no statutory framework for addressing racial disparities in military discipline.

The legislative approach proposed here addresses these gaps through two complementary federal bills:

- **The Military Justice Modernization Act** expands independent prosecution authority, establishes sentencing guidelines, and mandates racial bias audits.
- **The Service Member Rights and Protections Act** enhances due process, expands the right to counsel, creates whistleblower-style protections for reporting misconduct, and strengthens penalties for retaliation.

Together, these bills complete the reform trajectory begun by the NDAA FY2022 provisions while addressing structural problems that those reforms did not reach.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for this topic area.* Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the power "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces," providing plenary authority to restructure the military justice system by statute. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld Congress's broad discretion in this area, including in *Solorio v. United States*, 483 U.S. 435 (1987), and *Weiss v. United States*, 510 U.S. 163 (1994). The reforms proposed below operate entirely within this existing constitutional authority.

## Federal Legislation

### The Military Justice Modernization Act

**Purpose**: To expand independent prosecution authority to all serious felony-level offenses in the military, establish advisory sentencing guidelines for courts-martial, and mandate systematic audits of racial disparities in military justice.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To modernize the military justice system, expand independent prosecution
authority, establish sentencing guidelines, and require racial disparity
audits in military discipline.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Military Justice Modernization Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The establishment of the Office of Special Trial Counsel
    pursuant to section 824a of title 10, United States Code,
    represents a historic improvement in military justice by
    removing prosecution decisions for specified serious crimes
    from the chain of command.
(2) The current list of "covered offenses" under section 824a
    excludes many serious felony-level offenses, including
    aggravated assault, robbery, drug trafficking, arson, and
    fraud, creating an inconsistent system where some serious
    crimes receive independent prosecution and others do not.
(3) Allied militaries, including the United Kingdom, Canada,
    Australia, and Germany, have adopted independent prosecution
    for all serious military criminal offenses without
    experiencing degradation of military discipline or readiness.
(4) Multiple independent studies, including GAO-19-344 (2019)
    and the Air Force Inspector General Report on Racial
    Disparities (2020), have documented statistically significant
    racial disparities in military justice outcomes that cannot
    be explained by differences in offense rates alone.
(5) Military sentencing lacks the advisory guideline framework
    available in the civilian federal court system, resulting in
    significant variation in sentences for comparable offenses
    across services and jurisdictions.
(6) Continued reform of the military justice system serves the
    interests of military readiness by increasing service member
    confidence in the fairness of the system, improving
    retention, and ensuring accountability.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) COVERED OFFENSE.--The term "covered offense" means any
    offense under chapter 47 of title 10, United States Code
    (the Uniform Code of Military Justice), that is punishable
    by confinement for more than one year.
(2) SPECIAL TRIAL COUNSEL.--The term "Special Trial Counsel"
    has the meaning given that term in section 801 of title 10,
    United States Code.
(3) MILITARY SENTENCING GUIDELINES COMMISSION.--The term
    "Commission" means the Military Sentencing Guidelines
    Commission established under section 6 of this Act.
(4) NON-JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT.--The term "non-judicial punishment"
    means punishment imposed pursuant to section 815 of title 10,
    United States Code (Article 15, UCMJ).
(5) RACIAL DISPARITY RATIO.--The term "racial disparity ratio"
    means the ratio of the rate at which members of a racial or
    ethnic group experience a specified military justice outcome
    to the rate at which white service members experience the
    same outcome, controlling for rank and military occupational
    specialty.

SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF SPECIAL TRIAL COUNSEL AUTHORITY.

(a) AMENDMENT.--Section 824a(c)(3) of title 10, United States
    Code, is amended--
    (1) by striking the existing list of covered offenses and
        inserting the following: "any offense under this chapter
        that is punishable by confinement for a period of more
        than one year, as determined by the maximum authorized
        punishment set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial";
        and
    (2) by adding at the end the following:

                 officer under section 889 of this title
                 (Article 89);
            (iii) failure to obey an order or regulation under
                  section 892 of this title (Article 92); or
            (iv) any other offense designated by the Secretary
                 of Defense as a uniquely military offense for
                 which commander disposition authority is
                 essential to unit discipline, provided that
                 such designation is reported to the Committees
                 on Armed Services of the Senate and the House
                 of Representatives not later than 30 days
                 after such designation."
(b) STAFFING.--Not later than 180 days after the date of
    enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit

    Counsel is adequately staffed to assume the expanded
    caseload, whichever is later.

SEC. 5. RETALIATION AS A COVERED OFFENSE.

(a) AMENDMENT.--Section 824a(c)(3) of title 10, United States
    Code, as amended by section 4, is further amended by adding
    the following as a covered offense:
    "(E) Retaliation, as defined in section 932a of this title
    (Article 132a), committed against any person who--
        (i) has made a report of a covered offense;
        (ii) has participated in an investigation or proceeding
             related to a covered offense; or
        (iii) is known or believed to intend to make such a
              report or participate in such an investigation
              or proceeding."
(b) NEW PUNITIVE ARTICLE.--Chapter 47 of title 10, United States

    (b) Retaliation includes, but is not limited to--
        (1) any adverse personnel action;
        (2) interference with career advancement;
        (3) demotion, transfer, or reassignment undertaken for
            a retaliatory purpose;

        allowances, reduction to the lowest enlisted grade, and
        such other punishment as a court-martial may direct,
        including a dishonorable discharge."

SEC. 6. MILITARY SENTENCING GUIDELINES COMMISSION.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established within the Department
    of Defense a Military Sentencing Guidelines Commission
    (the "Commission").
(b) COMPOSITION.--The Commission shall consist of 7 members
    appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of
    the Senate, as follows:

SEC. 7. MANDATORY RACIAL DISPARITY AUDITS.

(a) ANNUAL AUDIT.--The Secretary of Defense shall direct the
    Inspector General of the Department of Defense to conduct an
    annual audit of military justice outcomes by race and
    ethnicity.
(b) SCOPE.--The audit shall examine, at a minimum--
    (1) rates of investigation by race and ethnicity;
    (2) rates of non-judicial punishment by race and ethnicity,
        controlling for rank and military occupational specialty;
    (3) rates of charges preferred and courts-martial referral
        by race and ethnicity;

(d) CORRECTIVE ACTION.--
    (1) If an audit identifies a racial disparity ratio of 1.5
        or greater at any installation or command for any stage
        of the military justice process, the commander of that
        installation or command shall--
        (A) develop a corrective action plan within 90 days;

    require annual evidence-based implicit bias training for all
    persons who exercise authority at any stage of the military
    justice process, including commanders, military judges,
    prosecutors, defense counsel, investigators, and military
    police.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be
necessary to carry out this Act, including--
(1) additional personnel for each Office of Special Trial
    Counsel;
(2) establishment and operation of the Military Sentencing
    Guidelines Commission; and
(3) implementation of the racial disparity audit and training
    requirements.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

Except as otherwise provided in this Act, this Act shall take
effect 180 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: The Military Justice Modernization Act addresses three major gaps in the current military justice system. First, it expands independent prosecution to all serious felonies, completing the reform trajectory begun by the NDAA FY2022. The exclusion of uniquely military offenses (AWOL, disrespect, failure to obey orders) preserves commander authority over the discipline matters most directly related to military effectiveness. Second, it establishes sentencing guidelines to reduce the wide variation in sentences for comparable offenses. Third, it mandates racial disparity audits with corrective action requirements, moving beyond the voluntary self-assessment model that has failed to produce change.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Opposition from commanders who view any further reduction in their authority as undermining discipline.
- Staffing the expanded OSTC caseload may require significant JAG Corps recruitment and retention incentives.
- The Sentencing Guidelines Commission may face resistance from military judges who view advisory guidelines as an encroachment on judicial discretion.
- The 1.5 disparity ratio trigger for corrective action may be challenged as arbitrary or potentially leading to quota-like outcomes.

**Refinements**:

- Phase the expansion of covered offenses over 24 months to allow OSTC offices to build capacity gradually.
- Include a 5-year sunset provision for the corrective action threshold, requiring Congress to reauthorize based on effectiveness data.
- Allow the Secretary of Defense to add to the exclusion list for uniquely military offenses, subject to congressional notification.

### The Service Member Rights and Protections Act

**Purpose**: To enhance the due process rights of service members in the military justice system, ensure resource parity between prosecution and defense, create whistleblower-style protections for those who report misconduct, and strengthen penalties for retaliation.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To protect the rights of service members in the military justice
system, ensure fair trials, and prevent retaliation against those
who report misconduct.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Service Member Rights and
Protections Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Service members who are accused of offenses under the
    Uniform Code of Military Justice are entitled to due process
    of law under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.
(2) The creation of well-resourced Offices of Special Trial
    Counsel has created a significant resource imbalance between
    prosecution and defense in the military justice system,
    raising concerns about the fairness of proceedings.
(3) Military defense counsel offices are understaffed relative
    to prosecution offices, with defense-to-prosecution staffing
    ratios as low as 0.5:1 in some services.
(4) Service members who report misconduct, including sexual
    assault, fraud, waste, and abuse, face a high risk of
    retaliation that deters reporting and undermines
    accountability.
(5) The military justice system lacks the comprehensive
    whistleblower protections available to civilian federal
    employees under the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C.
    section 2302(b)(8)).
(6) Strengthening the rights of the accused and the protections
    for reporters is essential to maintaining a military justice
    system that is both effective and fair.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) DEFENSE COUNSEL.--The term "defense counsel" means a judge
    advocate assigned to represent a service member in a
    court-martial or other proceeding under chapter 47 of title

        Secretary of Defense.
(3) ADVERSE PERSONNEL ACTION.--The term "adverse personnel
    action" includes--
    (A) any action that affects or has the potential to affect
        the member's current position or career, including
        promotion, reassignment, evaluation, disciplinary or
        corrective action, or separation;
    (B) a threat to take any such action; and
    (C) a withholding of, or threat to withhold, any favorable
        action.

SEC. 4. DEFENSE COUNSEL RESOURCE PARITY.

(a) STAFFING REQUIREMENT.--Not later than 2 years after the date

        evaluations or career advancement for the outcomes of
        cases in which they provided representation.
    (3) Each military department shall establish a Chief Defense
        Counsel position at the grade of O-7 or above, reporting
        directly to the Judge Advocate General.
(d) EXPERT WITNESSES AND RESOURCES.--Defense counsel shall have
    access to expert witnesses, investigators, and forensic
    resources on the same basis as prosecution counsel, funded
    from the defense counsel budget.
(e) ANNUAL REPORTING.--The Secretary of Defense shall submit to
    Congress an annual report on defense counsel staffing levels,
    experience levels, caseloads, and resource expenditures,
    compared to prosecution equivalents.

SEC. 5. ENHANCED RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN NON-JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT.

(a) COUNSEL AVAILABILITY.--Any service member facing non-judicial
    punishment under section 815 of title 10, United States Code
    (Article 15, UCMJ), shall have the right to consult with a
    judge advocate before deciding whether to accept non-judicial
    punishment or demand trial by court-martial.

            member's position, career standing, and reputation;
        (B) refer the matter for appropriate disciplinary action
            against the retaliator, including referral to the

        person could conclude that the communication or activity
        was a contributing factor in the adverse action.
    (2) Once the complainant meets this burden, the respondent
        must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the

        protected communication or activity.
(e) ANTI-RETALIATION TRAINING.--The Secretary of Defense shall
    require annual training for all commanders, supervisors, and

    consequences of violations.

SEC. 7. PRE-TRIAL AND TRIAL PROTECTIONS.

(a) PRE-TRIAL CONFINEMENT LIMITS.--
    (1) No service member shall be held in pre-trial confinement
        for more than 90 days without the charges being referred
        to a court-martial.
    (2) If charges are not referred within 90 days, the service
        member shall be released from confinement, and the
        military judge may dismiss the charges with or without
        prejudice.
    (3) Any period of pre-trial confinement shall be credited
        against the sentence imposed.
(b) DISCOVERY OBLIGATIONS.--

        process from a pool of eligible service members,
        replacing the current system of convening authority
        selection.
    (3) The accused shall retain the right to elect trial by
        military judge alone.
(d) CONVICTION THRESHOLD.--A finding of guilty in a general
    court-martial shall require a unanimous vote of the panel
    members.

SEC. 8. POST-CONVICTION REVIEW.

(a) MILITARY INNOCENCE REVIEW BOARD.--There is established within
    the Department of Defense a Military Innocence Review Board
    to review claims of actual innocence based on new evidence.
(b) ELIGIBILITY.--Any person convicted by court-martial may
    petition the Board if--
    (1) new evidence has been discovered that was not available
        at trial;
    (2) scientific evidence used at trial has been discredited
        by subsequent research; or
    (3) there is evidence of investigator or prosecutor
        misconduct that materially affected the outcome.
(c) REMEDIES.--If the Board finds that a petitioner is likely
    innocent, it shall recommend--
    (1) a new trial;
    (2) dismissal of charges; or
    (3) such other relief as justice requires, including
        restoration of rank, back pay, and benefits.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be
necessary to carry out this Act, including--
(1) additional defense counsel positions;
(2) establishment and operation of the Military Innocence
    Review Board; and
(3) implementation of the whistleblower protection and training
    requirements.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

Except as otherwise provided in this Act, this Act shall take
effect 180 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: The Service Member Rights and Protections Act addresses the other side of the military justice equation: ensuring that the system is fair to accused service members and safe for those who report misconduct. Resource parity between prosecution and defense is a constitutional imperative, not a policy preference. The whistleblower protections mirror civilian federal protections while adapting them to the military context. The panel composition and unanimity reforms bring military trial procedures closer to the constitutional standards applicable in civilian federal courts.

**Potential Challenges**:

- The unanimity requirement for conviction will be opposed by prosecutors who argue it will reduce conviction rates, particularly in sexual assault cases.
- Random panel selection will be opposed by commanders who argue that the convening authority's knowledge of the unit allows for better panel composition.
- Defense counsel resource parity will require significant additional funding at a time of competing defense budget priorities.
- The 90-day pre-trial confinement limit may be challenged in complex cases requiring lengthy investigations.

**Refinements**:

- Phase the unanimity requirement: apply it first to offenses carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, then expand to all general courts-martial after 3 years.
- Allow the military judge to grant extensions of the 90-day pre-trial confinement limit upon a showing of good cause, with a maximum extension of 60 additional days.
- Create a joint defense counsel recruitment and retention program to address staffing shortfalls.

*State legislation is not applicable to this topic area.* Military justice is exclusively a federal matter under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which grants Congress the power to make rules for the government and regulation of the armed forces. States have no jurisdiction over courts-martial or the UCMJ. However, states with large military installations may pass resolutions urging congressional action on military justice reform, and state legislatures may enact laws affecting the treatment of veterans with military justice records (e.g., expungement of certain military convictions for state employment purposes).

## Regulatory Framework

### DoD Directives and Instructions

**Existing Authority**: The Secretary of Defense has broad authority under 10 U.S.C. section 113 to issue directives and instructions implementing the UCMJ and other military justice legislation.

**Recommended Regulatory Actions**:

- **Command Climate Accountability Directive**: Issue a DoD Directive requiring that command climate assessments, including military justice disparity metrics, be a mandatory element of officer performance evaluations for all commanders at the O-5 level and above.
- **Expedited Transfer Enhancement**: Amend DoD Instruction 6495.02 to require that expedited transfer requests from sexual assault victims be processed within 30 days, with no adverse career impact.
- **Restorative Justice Pilot Program Directive**: Issue a DoD Directive authorizing a restorative justice pilot program for minor offenses at 10 installations, with data collection on outcomes, recidivism, and participant satisfaction.
- **Defense Counsel Independence Directive**: Issue a DoD Directive prohibiting defense counsel performance evaluations from being influenced by case outcomes and establishing a career track for military defense attorneys that does not disadvantage them relative to prosecutors.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

#### Article I Military Jurisdiction

Congress has plenary authority under Article I, Section 8 to establish and regulate the military justice system. The Supreme Court has affirmed this authority broadly, including the power to define offenses, establish courts, and determine procedures. *Solorio v. United States*, 483 U.S. 435 (1987) (holding that court-martial jurisdiction depends on the accused's military status, not on a "service connection" test).

#### Fifth Amendment Due Process

The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause applies to military proceedings, though the Supreme Court has held that due process in the military context may differ from civilian standards. *Weiss v. United States*, 510 U.S. 163 (1994). The proposed reforms (particularly the unanimity requirement and enhanced right to counsel) are designed to bring military practice closer to civilian due process standards without exceeding what Congress may constitutionally require.

#### Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel and Jury Trial

The Sixth Amendment's right to jury trial does not apply to courts-martial. *Ex parte Quirin*, 317 U.S. 1 (1942). However, Congress may establish jury-like protections by statute, as it has done through the panel system. The proposed panel reforms (random selection, increased size, unanimity for conviction) are statutory enhancements that go beyond constitutional minimums.

#### *Parker v. Levy* and Military Specificity

In *Parker v. Levy*, 417 U.S. 733 (1974), the Supreme Court recognized that the military is a "separate society" and that "the fundamental necessity for obedience, and the consequent necessity for imposition of discipline, may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it." The proposed reforms are designed to respect this principle by retaining commander authority over uniquely military offenses while expanding independent prosecution and due process protections for serious criminal conduct.

### Preemption Questions

Military justice is exclusively federal. There are no preemption questions, as states have no jurisdiction over the UCMJ or courts-martial proceedings. *See* 10 U.S.C. section 802 (persons subject to the UCMJ).

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- OSTC offices exercise independent prosecutorial discretion for covered offenses, with no commander approval required.
- The DoD Inspector General conducts racial disparity audits and whistleblower retaliation investigations.
- The Military Sentencing Guidelines Commission publishes guidelines and monitors compliance.
- The Military Innocence Review Board reviews claims of actual innocence.
- Congress exercises oversight through the annual NDAA process, SASC hearings, and required reports.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The Military Sentencing Guidelines Commission shall conduct a comprehensive review of its guidelines every 3 years.
- The racial disparity audit corrective action threshold (1.5 ratio) shall sunset after 5 years unless reauthorized by Congress.
- The DoD Inspector General shall submit a 5-year comprehensive assessment of all reforms enacted under these bills to Congress.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Military Justice Modernization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Secretary of Defense exclusion authority | The Secretary may designate offenses as "uniquely military" to exclude them from OSTC authority, potentially creating a backdoor to preserve commander control over serious offenses. | High |
| Advisory sentencing guidelines | Because guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory, judges may ignore them with minimal consequence, reducing their effectiveness. | Medium |
| Corrective action plan evasion | Commanders required to develop corrective action plans for racial disparities may produce plans that satisfy the letter of the requirement without addressing root causes. | Medium |
| Data manipulation | Services may alter data collection methodologies to minimize apparent disparities, or reclassify offenses to shift cases between covered and non-covered categories. | Medium |
| Implicit bias training quality | The Act mandates training but does not specify content standards, allowing services to implement ineffective or perfunctory programs. | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| NJP remains under commander control | Tens of thousands of NJP actions annually remain outside independent oversight, where racial disparities are most pronounced. | Political compromise; removing all commander authority was not achievable. |
| No mandatory minimum sentences | The sentencing guidelines are advisory, meaning extreme leniency for serious offenses remains possible. | Concern about judicial independence and the risk of unjust mandatory minimums. |
| Audit frequency | Annual audits may not capture seasonal or event-driven spikes in disparities. | Resource constraints and data collection logistics. |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Limit the Secretary of Defense's exclusion authority by requiring congressional approval (by joint resolution) for any exclusion of an offense carrying a maximum sentence of 5 years or more.
2. Require military judges to state on the record their reasons for any departure from sentencing guidelines and publish departure rates by judge, offense type, and demographics.
3. Establish an independent review panel (including civilian members) to assess the quality and effectiveness of corrective action plans.
4. Mandate standardized data collection methodologies across all services, audited by the GAO.
5. Direct the National Institute of Justice to develop content standards for military implicit bias training, with regular effectiveness assessments.

### Service Member Rights and Protections Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Retaliation definition breadth | The broad definition of retaliation (including "social ostracism") may be difficult to prove and could be subject to challenge as vague. | Medium |
| Pre-trial confinement extensions | Military judges may routinely grant good-cause extensions, undermining the 90-day limit. | Medium |
| Defense parity measurement | Measuring defense-to-prosecution ratio on an annual basis allows temporary staffing shortfalls during individual cases. | Low |
| Random panel selection gaming | The "randomized process" for panel selection could be manipulated if the eligible pool is defined narrowly. | Medium |
| Innocence Review Board standing | The Board may set overly restrictive standards for what constitutes "new evidence," limiting access. | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Summary courts-martial excluded from counsel requirement | Service members facing summary courts-martial still have no right to counsel, yet summary courts-martial can impose 30 days of confinement. | Summary courts-martial are designed as expedited proceedings; requiring counsel would slow the process significantly. |
| Unanimity requirement may reduce conviction rates | Requiring unanimous panel verdicts could make it harder to convict guilty defendants, particularly in cases relying on credibility determinations. | Balancing accused rights against system effectiveness. |
| Whistleblower investigation timeline | The 180-day timeline for IG investigation may be insufficient for complex retaliation cases. | Resource constraints at DoD IG. |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Define "social ostracism" in implementing regulations with specific, provable criteria (e.g., exclusion from official events, removal from duty assignments, documented pattern of hostile treatment).
2. Require military judges to make written findings justifying any extension of pre-trial confinement beyond 90 days, subject to appellate review.
3. Supplement the annual defense-to-prosecution ratio with a case-level metric: no court-martial shall proceed if defense counsel has been assigned for fewer than 60 days.
4. Define the eligible panel pool broadly (all members of equivalent or higher rank at the installation) and require random selection from the full pool with no commander input.
5. Establish clear standards for the Innocence Review Board that include a broad definition of "new evidence" and a low threshold for granting review (reasonable probability that the new evidence would have affected the outcome).

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| JAG Corps retention | Create special pay incentives and career tracks for experienced military prosecutors and defense counsel to reduce attrition to the private sector. |
| Inter-service inconsistency | Establish a joint military justice oversight office within the Office of the Secretary of Defense to ensure consistent implementation across services. |
| Data infrastructure | Fund a unified military justice data system that tracks cases from initial report through final disposition, accessible to DoD IG, Congress, and researchers. |
| Transition period complexity | Designate a transition period (18-24 months) during which cases initiated under the old framework are handled under the old rules, while new cases follow the new framework. |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- All provisions of both Acts shall be subject to a comprehensive 5-year review by the GAO.
- The Military Sentencing Guidelines Commission shall review and update guidelines every 3 years.
- The racial disparity audit corrective action threshold shall sunset after 5 years unless reauthorized.
- Congress shall hold oversight hearings on OSTC performance not less than annually for the first 5 years after expansion.
