# Military Justice: Current State

## Sexual Assault in the Military

Sexual assault remains the most visible crisis in the military justice system and the primary driver of reform efforts. The Department of Defense Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) tracks both estimated prevalence and formal reporting.

### Prevalence and Reporting

| Metric | FY2018 | FY2021 | FY2022 | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Estimated Sexual Assaults (Active Duty) | ~20,500 | ~35,800 | ~29,000 | Spiked during COVID era, partial decline |
| Formal Reports Filed | 6,053 | 8,866 | 8,942 | Steady increase in reporting |
| Estimated Reporting Rate | ~30% | ~25% | ~31% | Fluctuates around 25-30% |
| Unrestricted Reports | 4,794 | 6,554 | 6,655 | Increasing |
| Restricted Reports | 1,259 | 2,312 | 2,287 | Increasing |

*Source: DoD SAPRO Annual Reports, FY2018-FY2023*

The gap between estimated prevalence and formal reporting remains vast. The DoD's 2021 Workplace and Gender Relations Survey found that the most common reasons for not reporting were belief that nothing would be done (58%), fear of retaliation (54%), and belief that the process would be unfair (44%).

### Prosecution and Conviction Rates

| Stage | Percentage | Note |
|-------|------------|------|
| Reports resulting in investigation | ~75% | Of unrestricted reports |
| Investigations resulting in any action | ~40% | Includes non-judicial and administrative |
| Cases referred to court-martial | ~8-10% | Of all unrestricted reports |
| Convictions at court-martial | ~50% | Of cases actually tried |
| Convictions for a sexual offense (vs. lesser) | ~35% | Many plea to non-sexual offenses |

*Source: DAC-IPAD Reports, 2020-2023; DoD SAPRO, 2023*

The attrition from report to conviction is severe. For every 100 estimated sexual assaults, roughly 30 are reported, 22 are investigated, 8-9 result in any disciplinary action, and fewer than 3 result in a conviction at court-martial.

### Retaliation Against Reporters

The DoD's own surveys consistently find that a majority of service members who report sexual assault experience some form of retaliation.

| Type of Retaliation | Percentage Reporting | Source |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Social retaliation (ostracism, rumors) | ~64% | DoD WGRS, 2021 |
| Professional retaliation (adverse actions) | ~35% | DoD WGRS, 2021 |
| Perceived retaliation from the chain of command | ~30% | DoD WGRS, 2021 |
| Formal retaliation complaints filed | ~200/year | DoD SAPRO, 2023 |
| Retaliation complaints substantiated | ~10% | DoD SAPRO, 2023 |

## Recent Reforms

### NDAA FY2022: Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act

The most significant reform to military justice in decades was enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Pub. L. 117-81). Key provisions include:

- **Independent Prosecution**: Created the Office of Special Trial Counsel (OSTC) within each military department, staffed by experienced judge advocates who exercise independent authority to prosecute covered offenses.
- **Covered Offenses**: Initially covered sexual assault, murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, domestic violence, child abuse, stalking, and other serious offenses. The FY2023 NDAA expanded coverage to include additional offenses.
- **Removal of Commander Authority**: Commanders can no longer decide whether to prosecute covered offenses. That authority now rests solely with the Special Trial Counsel.
- **Sentencing Reform**: Eliminated the role of the panel (jury) in sentencing for most offenses, transferring sentencing authority to military judges.
- **Victim Protections**: Enhanced Special Victims' Counsel/Victims' Legal Counsel programs and expanded the right of victims to be heard at sentencing.

### OSTC Implementation (2023-2024)

The Office of Special Trial Counsel became operational on December 28, 2023. Early implementation data is limited, but initial observations include:

- Each military department stood up OSTC offices with experienced prosecutors.
- The Army OSTC received approximately 2,700 referrals in its first six months.
- Challenges include staffing experienced prosecutors, establishing new workflows with military criminal investigative organizations, and defining jurisdictional boundaries for "covered" vs. "non-covered" offenses.
- Defense attorneys have raised concerns about resource parity, noting that OSTC offices are better funded than defense counsel offices.

### NDAA FY2023 and FY2024 Adjustments

- Expanded the list of covered offenses under OSTC authority.
- Required the DoD Inspector General to review OSTC implementation.
- Mandated data collection on OSTC case outcomes for comparison with pre-reform baselines.
- Directed the Secretary of Defense to report on the feasibility of a unified military justice code that eliminates service-specific variations.

## Courts-Martial Data

### Annual Courts-Martial (All Services)

| Type | FY2020 | FY2021 | FY2022 | Note |
|------|--------|--------|--------|------|
| General Courts-Martial | ~450 | ~500 | ~520 | Most serious cases; felony-equivalent |
| Special Courts-Martial | ~300 | ~350 | ~340 | Intermediate; misdemeanor-equivalent |
| Summary Courts-Martial | ~700 | ~650 | ~600 | Minor offenses; no right to counsel |
| Total | ~1,450 | ~1,500 | ~1,460 | Relatively stable |

### Non-Judicial Punishment (Article 15)

Non-judicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15 of the UCMJ is by far the most common form of military discipline. Commanders impose NJP for minor offenses without the formal procedures of a court-martial.

| Metric | Approximate Annual Volume |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Army Article 15 proceedings | ~50,000-60,000 |
| Navy/Marine Captain's Mast | ~15,000-20,000 |
| Air Force Article 15 proceedings | ~8,000-10,000 |
| Total NJP actions (all services) | ~75,000-90,000 |

*Source: Service JAG reports; Military Justice Review Group estimates*

NJP is the area where commander discretion is broadest and where racial disparities are most pronounced. Service members may refuse NJP and demand a court-martial (except aboard ships), but doing so is widely perceived as career-ending.

## Racial Disparities in Military Justice

Multiple studies have documented significant racial disparities in military discipline, particularly in non-judicial punishment and courts-martial referrals.

### Key Findings

| Study | Finding | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| GAO Report (2019) | Black service members were substantially more likely than white service members to be investigated, tried, and convicted at courts-martial across all services. | GAO-19-344 |
| Protect Our Defenders Analysis (2017) | Black service members were 1.29 to 2.61 times more likely to face military justice or disciplinary action than white service members, depending on the service branch. | Protect Our Defenders, "Racial Disparities in Military Justice" |
| DAC-IPAD Report (2020) | Black Marines were 1.32 times more likely than white Marines to have charges preferred against them and 1.40 times more likely to receive a guilty finding. | DAC-IPAD |
| Air Force IG Review (2020) | Black Air Force members were 1.64 times more likely to face an investigation and 1.45 times more likely to be apprehended by security forces. | Air Force Inspector General |

### Service Responses

Each military service has acknowledged the existence of disparities and initiated reviews:

- **Army**: Conducted a "People First" initiative with data analysis of disciplinary actions by race, but released limited findings.
- **Air Force**: Published a detailed Inspector General report in December 2020 confirming disparities across multiple metrics.
- **Navy/Marine Corps**: Commissioned external reviews but have not released comprehensive statistical analyses.
- **DoD-Wide**: The Secretary of Defense ordered a department-wide review of racial disparities in military justice in 2021. Implementation of recommendations has been uneven.

## Command Influence

Unlawful command influence (UCI) is often called the "mortal enemy of military justice" (*United States v. Thomas*, 22 M.J. 388, 393 (C.M.A. 1986)). It occurs when a commander or other superior uses their authority to influence the outcome of a court-martial or other proceeding.

### Types of Command Influence

- **Actual UCI**: Direct action by a commander that affects the proceeding (e.g., instructing a panel member on how to vote, pressuring a prosecutor to prefer charges).
- **Apparent UCI**: Actions that create a reasonable perception that the proceeding was influenced, even without direct evidence of actual influence. Courts have increasingly recognized apparent UCI as grounds for relief.

### Current Concerns

- The CAAF has identified UCI issues in a growing number of cases, particularly those involving sexual assault, where political pressure to prosecute may create the appearance of influence.
- Senior leaders' public statements about military sexual assault (including statements by Presidents and senior DoD officials) have been cited by defense attorneys as creating an environment of apparent UCI.
- The OSTC model is intended to reduce UCI by insulating prosecution decisions from the chain of command, but critics note that OSTC prosecutors still operate within the military hierarchy and may face institutional pressures.

## Military Appellate Courts

The military appellate system provides review of court-martial convictions:

- **Service Courts of Criminal Appeals (CCAs)**: Each service has a CCA that reviews all cases involving a punitive discharge or confinement of one year or more. Review is automatic and includes factual sufficiency review (unique to military law).
- **Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF)**: A civilian court (five presidentially appointed civilian judges) that exercises discretionary review of CCA decisions and mandatory review of cases involving general officers, death sentences, or cases certified by a Judge Advocate General.
- **U.S. Supreme Court**: May grant certiorari to review CAAF decisions, though it does so rarely (fewer than 5 cases per decade).

### Appellate Trends

- The CAAF has become increasingly active in reviewing sexual assault cases, UCI claims, and Sixth Amendment issues.
- Recent decisions have addressed the scope of victims' rights in the military system, the admissibility of Military Rule of Evidence 513 (psychotherapist privilege) materials, and the constitutionality of panel selection procedures.
- Appellate courts have overturned several high-profile sexual assault convictions on UCI grounds, frustrating reform advocates who view these reversals as evidence of systemic resistance to change.
