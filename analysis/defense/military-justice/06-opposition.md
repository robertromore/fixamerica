# Military Justice: Opposition to Reform

## Overview

Opposition to military justice reform has historically been concentrated in two overlapping groups: senior military leaders who view commander authority over discipline as essential to military effectiveness, and traditionalists who argue that civilian standards of justice are inappropriate for the unique demands of military service. While the passage of the NDAA FY2022 reforms marked a significant defeat for opponents of independent prosecution, resistance continues on several fronts, including the scope of OSTC authority, racial equity reforms, and efforts to expand due process protections for accused service members.

## Senior Military Leadership

### The Joint Chiefs' Position

For nearly a decade (2013-2021), the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously opposed legislation to remove prosecution authority from commanders. Their arguments centered on several themes:

**Command Responsibility Argument**: The Joint Chiefs consistently argued that a commander who is held responsible for everything in their unit must retain the tools to enforce discipline. General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, testified before the Senate in 2013: "Taking the authority away from commanders will not reduce sexual assault." General Mark Milley, Army Chief of Staff, echoed this position in 2015, arguing that removing commander authority would "weaken the ability of commanders to maintain good order and discipline."

**Discipline vs. Justice Framing**: Military leaders framed the debate as one of military discipline rather than criminal justice, arguing that civilian legal norms designed for a voluntary society are ill-suited to an institution that demands obedience, sacrifice, and the willingness to kill and die on orders.

**Slippery Slope Concerns**: Senior leaders warned that removing commander authority for sexual assault would inevitably lead to removing authority for all offenses, fundamentally transforming the nature of command.

### Shift After 2021

The appointment of the Independent Review Commission by Secretary Austin in 2021 and its recommendation to support independent prosecution allowed some military leaders to reverse their positions without appearing to capitulate to congressional pressure. However, this shift was not universal:

- Some retired senior officers continue to publicly oppose the reforms.
- Implementation of the OSTC model has revealed ongoing institutional resistance in the form of slow staffing, limited resource allocation, and bureaucratic friction between OSTC offices and existing JAG structures.
- Some commanders have expressed confusion and frustration about their remaining authority, which some reformers view as a sign that the "discipline loss" narrative remains influential.

## Congressional Opponents

### Senate Armed Services Committee Leadership (Pre-2021)

For years, the Senate Armed Services Committee served as the primary institutional obstacle to Gillibrand-Ernst reform efforts:

- **Senator Carl Levin (D-MI)**: As SASC Chairman, Levin blocked the Military Justice Improvement Act from reaching the Senate floor as a standalone vote, insisting instead on commander-centered reforms.
- **Senator John McCain (R-AZ)**: Opposed removing commander authority, arguing it would undermine the "sacred trust" between a commander and their troops. McCain supported alternative reforms that strengthened commander accountability without removing their prosecution authority.
- **Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC)**: A former JAG officer, Graham was one of the most vocal opponents of independent prosecution, arguing from personal military legal experience that the commander-centric model was superior.

### Current Opposition

Since the enactment of the OSTC reforms, congressional opposition has shifted to:

- Resisting expansion of OSTC authority beyond its current list of covered offenses.
- Opposing mandated racial disparity audits and implicit bias training as "woke" impositions on the military.
- Advocating for increased protections for accused service members as a counterweight to victim-centered reforms, sometimes framing the reforms as creating a presumption of guilt.

## Traditionalist Legal Arguments

### The "Separate Society" Doctrine

Opponents of reform frequently invoke the Supreme Court's characterization of the military as a "separate society" with distinct legal norms:

- In *Parker v. Levy*, 417 U.S. 733 (1974), the Court held that "the military is, by necessity, a specialized society separate from civilian society" and that "the fundamental necessity for obedience, and the consequent necessity for imposition of discipline, may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it."
- Traditionalists argue that this doctrine justifies a justice system that prioritizes discipline over individual rights and that Congress should defer to military expertise on how discipline is best maintained.

### Commander Authority as Military Necessity

The core traditionalist argument is that military justice is not primarily about criminal justice at all. It is a tool of command, designed to enable commanders to fight and win wars. Specific claims include:

- **Speed and Flexibility**: Commanders can act quickly to address discipline problems that would take months to resolve through an independent prosecution system. In a combat zone, speed of action may be essential.
- **Contextual Judgment**: Commanders understand the operational context of their units in ways that an independent prosecutor cannot. A given act of misconduct may warrant severe punishment in one context and leniency in another, depending on the unit's mission, morale, and cohesion.
- **Deterrence Through Visibility**: When a commander personally imposes discipline, the message to the unit is immediate and clear. An impersonal prosecution system may lack the same deterrent effect on unit behavior.

### Critique of These Arguments

Critics of the traditionalist position note that:

- The "speed and flexibility" argument applies to minor disciplinary matters, not to serious felonies that require thorough investigation and fair adjudication.
- "Contextual judgment" has been used to excuse commanders who protected popular perpetrators, shielded senior-ranking accused, or minimized sexual assault to avoid embarrassment.
- The commander-centric model's track record on sexual assault, with persistently low prosecution and conviction rates over decades, undermines the claim that it produces superior outcomes.
- Allied militaries (United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Israel, Germany) have adopted independent prosecution models without suffering the discipline collapse that opponents predicted.

## Opposition to Racial Equity Reforms

### Arguments Against Disparity Audits

Opponents of mandatory racial disparity audits and bias training in the military justice system make several arguments:

- **Meritocracy Claim**: The military is among the most integrated institutions in American society and promotions are based on merit. Disparity data may reflect legitimate differences in behavior rather than bias.
- **Morale Concerns**: Mandatory implicit bias training, opponents argue, demoralizes commanders by implying they are racist and undermines unit cohesion by emphasizing racial categories.
- **Quotas Fear**: Some opponents characterize disparity audits as a precursor to racial quotas in discipline, where commanders would be pressured to achieve proportionate discipline rates regardless of actual conduct.

### Critique

- Multiple independent studies (GAO, Air Force IG, Protect Our Defenders, DAC-IPAD) have confirmed disparities that cannot be explained by differences in offense rates alone.
- No reform proposal calls for quotas. The proposals call for data collection, analysis, and accountability to identify and address bias where it exists.
- Refusing to examine racial disparities because the findings might be uncomfortable is itself a form of institutional avoidance.

## Opposition to Expanded Due Process

### "Swinging the Pendulum Too Far"

Some stakeholders, including some victim advocacy organizations, have opposed certain due process reforms for accused service members, arguing that:

- Expanding the right to counsel, pre-trial discovery, or jury requirements would slow the system and reduce conviction rates.
- Accused service members already receive adequate protections under the UCMJ.
- The current political moment favors victims, and due process reforms could be used as Trojan horses to weaken accountability for sexual assault.

### Critique

- Due process protections are constitutional requirements, not optional policy choices. A system that convicts innocent people is no more just than one that fails to convict the guilty.
- Resource parity between prosecution and defense is a basic fairness requirement that should not be controversial.
- Appellate courts have overturned convictions on due process grounds, demonstrating that inadequate protections create fragile convictions that do not serve anyone's interests.

## Summary of Opposition Positions
