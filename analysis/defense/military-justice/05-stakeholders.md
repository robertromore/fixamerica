# Military Justice: Stakeholders

## Overview

Military justice reform affects a broad range of stakeholders, from the individual service members who interact with the system daily to the advocacy organizations and policymakers who shape its structure. Understanding the interests, influence, and incentives of each stakeholder group is essential to understanding both the obstacles to reform and the pathways through which reform can succeed.

## Service Members

### Victims of Sexual Assault and Serious Crimes

**Interest**: A justice system that takes their cases seriously, protects them from retaliation, and holds perpetrators accountable.

**Current Experience**:

- Approximately 70-75% of sexual assault victims choose not to report, citing fear of retaliation, distrust of the system, and belief that nothing will happen.
- Those who do report face lengthy investigations (average 12-18 months for sexual assault cases), uncertain outcomes, and a high risk of social and professional retaliation.
- Victims frequently describe feeling that they, rather than the accused, are on trial.

**Influence**: Limited direct institutional power, but high public sympathy. Individual victims who tell their stories publicly (e.g., former Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen, whose murder at Fort Hood in 2020 galvanized reform efforts) can catalyze legislative action.

### Accused Service Members

**Interest**: Fair trials, access to competent counsel, protection from unlawful command influence, and proportionate sentencing.

**Current Experience**:

- Accused service members in general courts-martial face a system where their career, liberty, and future are at stake.
- Defense counsel resources are generally inferior to prosecution resources, particularly with the creation of well-funded OSTC offices.
- The military panel (jury) system, where members are selected by the convening authority and require only a two-thirds vote for conviction (three-fourths for sentences over 10 years), offers fewer protections than civilian juries.
- Accused service members may face command pressure to accept plea deals, even in cases where the evidence is weak.

**Influence**: Limited collective voice. Individual high-profile cases generate attention, but accused service members rarely organize as an advocacy group.

### Junior Enlisted Service Members

**Interest**: Fair application of discipline, particularly non-judicial punishment, without regard to race, gender, or personal relationships with leadership.

**Current Experience**:

- Junior enlisted members (E-1 through E-4) are the most likely to face non-judicial punishment and the least empowered to challenge it.
- Article 15 proceedings are summary in nature: the commander acts as investigator, prosecutor, judge, and jury. There is no right to counsel (only an advisor), no formal rules of evidence, and no meaningful appeal.
- Black and Hispanic junior enlisted members face disproportionately higher rates of NJP across all services.

**Influence**: Minimal institutional power. Represented indirectly through advocacy organizations and congressional representatives, but have no collective bargaining or representation mechanism within the military.

### Military Families

**Interest**: Safety of family members (particularly from domestic violence), confidence that the justice system will protect them, and transparency about outcomes.

**Current Experience**:

- Military spouses and children who are victims of domestic violence face a system where the accused's commander plays a central role in determining the response.
- Military installations often lack adequate victim services, and the geographic isolation of many bases limits access to civilian resources.
- The military's handling of dependent victims has improved in recent years but remains inconsistent across installations and services.

**Influence**: Military family advocacy organizations have growing political influence, particularly through groups like the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) and Blue Star Families.

## Commanders

### Senior Commanders (General/Flag Officers)

**Interest**: Maintaining discipline and readiness, retaining authority over their units, and avoiding personal liability for systemic failures.

**Position on Reform**: Senior commanders have historically been the most vocal opponents of removing prosecution authority from the chain of command. The Joint Chiefs unanimously opposed the Gillibrand MJIA proposals from 2013 through 2020, arguing that commander authority is inseparable from command responsibility. Many senior leaders accepted the OSTC reform only after the Independent Review Commission provided political cover.

**Influence**: Enormous institutional influence. The Joint Chiefs testify before Congress, advise the President, and control the implementation of any reform that is enacted. Their support or opposition can determine whether reforms succeed in practice.

### Company/Battalion Commanders

**Interest**: Tools to maintain good order and discipline in their units, clear guidance on what authority they retain, and protection from liability.

**Position on Reform**: Junior and mid-grade commanders have mixed views. Some welcome the removal of prosecution authority for serious crimes, viewing it as eliminating an unwanted burden and potential career risk. Others fear that losing disciplinary authority will erode their ability to lead.

**Influence**: Limited collective voice on policy, but their day-to-day decisions shape the lived experience of military justice for hundreds of thousands of service members.

## Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG)

### Military Judges

**Interest**: Judicial independence, adequate resources, and a system that produces fair outcomes.

**Position on Reform**: Military judges have generally supported reforms that strengthen judicial independence and sentencing authority. The transfer of sentencing authority from panels to judges (in the NDAA FY2022) was broadly welcomed by the military judiciary.

**Influence**: Significant within the legal community. CAAF decisions shape the interpretation and application of military justice reforms.

### Military Prosecutors (Trial Counsel and OSTC)

**Interest**: Sufficient resources, experienced staff, independent authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion, and win rates that demonstrate effectiveness.

**Position on Reform**: OSTC prosecutors support the independent prosecution model but have expressed concerns about staffing levels, retention of experienced attorneys, and the need for career paths that incentivize specialization in military prosecution.

**Influence**: Growing influence as the OSTC model matures and generates outcome data.

### Military Defense Counsel

**Interest**: Resource parity with prosecution, adequate staffing, time to prepare cases, and protection of accused service members' rights.

**Position on Reform**: Defense counsel organizations have been vocal about the growing resource imbalance between prosecution and defense. They support OSTC reforms in principle but warn that an empowered prosecution without a correspondingly empowered defense creates constitutional problems.

**Influence**: Moderate. The defense function receives less institutional support than prosecution, and defense attorneys often leave military service earlier, reducing their influence on policy.

## Congress

### Senate and House Armed Services Committees

**Interest**: Effective military justice, oversight of DoD implementation, and responsiveness to constituent concerns about military sexual assault and service member rights.

**Key Figures**:

- Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY): Principal author of the Military Justice Improvement Act and driving force behind independent prosecution reform since 2013.
- Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA): Key Republican co-sponsor who brought bipartisan credibility to the reform effort.
- Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) and Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS): SASC leadership who negotiated the final form of the OSTC provisions.

**Influence**: Ultimate authority over military justice through the UCMJ and the annual NDAA process. Congressional pressure was the decisive factor in overcoming military resistance to reform.

## Advocacy Organizations

### Protect Our Defenders

**Focus**: Military sexual assault prevention and justice reform. Has published extensive research on racial disparities in military justice and advocates for independent prosecution of all serious crimes.

**Influence**: The most prominent advocacy organization in this space. Provides congressional testimony, publishes research, and supports individual victims.

### Service Women's Action Network (SWAN)

**Focus**: Issues affecting women in the military, including sexual assault, harassment, and career barriers. Advocates for systemic reforms to military justice and culture.

**Influence**: Significant media presence and congressional relationships. Played a key role in building support for the Gillibrand-Ernst reforms.

### Survivors United

**Focus**: Led by Vanessa Guillen's family and other survivors. Advocates for accountability, transparency, and victim-centered reforms.

**Influence**: High public visibility following the Guillen case. The "I Am Vanessa Guillen" campaign generated significant public and congressional attention.

### Defense Advisory Committee on Investigation, Prosecution, and Defense of Sexual Assault in the Armed Forces (DAC-IPAD)

**Focus**: Congressionally established independent advisory committee that provides analysis and recommendations on the investigation, prosecution, and defense of sexual assault in the military.

**Influence**: Significant. DAC-IPAD reports are required by Congress and provide authoritative data on case outcomes, racial disparities, and systemic issues. Recommendations carry weight with both Congress and DoD.

### Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) and Enlisted Associations

**Focus**: Broad service member and veteran interests. Positions on military justice reform vary; MOAA has supported increased protections for victims while cautioning against reforms that could undermine due process for the accused.

**Influence**: Large membership bases and established congressional relationships.

## The Department of Defense

### Secretary of Defense and Senior Civilian Leadership

**Interest**: Implementing congressional mandates, maintaining military readiness, and avoiding scandals that damage public trust and recruiting.

**Position on Reform**: Under Secretary Austin (2021-2025), DoD shifted from opposing to supporting independent prosecution. The establishment of the IRC and endorsement of its recommendations represented a historic reversal of Pentagon resistance.

**Influence**: Controls implementation of reforms, allocation of resources, and the regulatory framework within which military justice operates.

### DoD Inspector General

**Interest**: Oversight of OSTC implementation, investigation of systemic problems, and accountability for failures.

**Influence**: Investigatory authority and reporting requirements ensure congressional visibility into implementation challenges.
