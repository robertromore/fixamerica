# Nuclear Policy: Reform Roadmap

Reforming nuclear policy requires a phased approach that sequences politically achievable risk reduction measures first, builds momentum for structural reforms, and ultimately addresses the deepest challenges of arms control and force structure. Each phase creates the conditions for the next.

---

## Phase 1: Risk Reduction and Transparency (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on executive actions and legislation that can be implemented without international negotiations, reducing immediate nuclear risk and building the domestic foundation for larger reforms.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Pass the Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act** | Enact sole authority reform (two-person rule for first use), No First Use declaration, and nuclear employment policy transparency requirements. | Act signed into law. First unclassified Nuclear Employment Strategy summary published. |
| **2. Resume stockpile transparency** | Executive order directing the declassification and publication of the total U.S. nuclear stockpile number and basic force posture data. | Annual stockpile disclosure resumed. |
| **3. Establish nuclear crisis communication channels** | Propose bilateral crisis communication hotlines with China and expand existing channels with Russia, specifically focused on nuclear incidents and near-misses. | At least one new bilateral communication channel operational with China. |
| **4. Commission independent Sentinel ICBM review** | Congress mandates a genuinely independent review of the Sentinel program's cost, schedule, strategic rationale, and alternatives (including Minuteman III life extension and ICBM elimination). | Independent review panel chartered and funded. Interim report delivered within 12 months. |
| **5. Initiate congressional nuclear strategy review** | The Armed Services Committees hold public hearings on nuclear strategy, including testimony from independent experts and former officials, to build congressional knowledge and public engagement. | At least four public hearings held. Bipartisan working group established. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Reduce the most immediate risks (sole authority, launch-on-warning, opacity), begin to build a constituency for deeper reform, and lay the analytical groundwork for decisions on modernization and arms control.

---

## Phase 2: Modernization Discipline and Arms Control Foundation (Years 3-5)

This phase focuses on implementing the results of the Phase 1 reviews, establishing cost discipline over modernization programs, and beginning arms control engagement.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Pass the Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act** | Enact cost caps on nuclear modernization programs, mandate a CBO triad vs. dyad analysis, establish a framework for CTBT ratification, and require the executive branch to pursue arms control negotiations. | Act signed into law. CBO publishes triad vs. dyad analysis. |
| **2. Implement Sentinel program decision** | Based on the independent review, either restructure the Sentinel program (reduced buy, revised schedule), extend Minuteman III, or begin transition to a dyad. | Decision announced and reflected in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). |
| **3. Begin bilateral arms control engagement** | The State Department initiates formal or informal arms control discussions with Russia and parallel strategic stability talks with China. | At least one round of formal discussions with Russia and one round with China completed. |
| **4. CTBT ratification campaign** | The President submits the CTBT to the Senate, accompanied by updated NNSA and JASON assessments of stockpile stewardship and verification capabilities. | CTBT submitted to the Senate. Foreign Relations Committee holds hearings. |
| **5. De-alert a portion of the ICBM force** | Implement operational de-alerting of a portion of the ICBM force, shifting from launch-on-warning to a delayed-response posture for de-alerted missiles. | At least 100 ICBMs removed from immediate launch-ready status. |
| **6. Allied consultation on extended deterrence** | Conduct intensive consultations with NATO, Japan, South Korea, and Australia on the implications of NFU, de-alerting, and potential ICBM reductions for extended deterrence commitments. | Allied consultation rounds completed. Joint communiques issued. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Bring modernization costs under control, begin the diplomatic process of restoring arms control, and demonstrate to allies and adversaries that U.S. nuclear policy is deliberate and responsible.

---

## Phase 3: Structural Reform and International Agreements (Years 5-10)

This phase pursues the most ambitious objectives: a new arms control agreement, a modernized and right-sized nuclear force, and integration of nuclear policy into a broader framework of international security.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Negotiate a New START successor** | Complete negotiations on a bilateral U.S.-Russia agreement that maintains or lowers deployed warhead limits, restores verification, and addresses new weapon types (hypersonic, tactical nuclear weapons). | Treaty signed and submitted to the Senate for ratification. |
| **2. Establish trilateral transparency framework** | Negotiate a transparency agreement with Russia and China that includes mutual declarations of stockpile size, notifications of missile launches, and a framework for future numerical limits. | Trilateral transparency agreement signed. First data exchange completed. |
| **3. CTBT entry into force** | Senate ratifies the CTBT. United States leads diplomatic effort to achieve entry into force by securing ratification from remaining Annex 2 states. | CTBT ratified by the Senate. |
| **4. Force structure optimization** | Based on the triad vs. dyad analysis and arms control outcomes, implement the optimal force structure, potentially transitioning to a submarine-heavy dyad or a reduced triad. | Force structure decision reflected in the National Defense Strategy and Nuclear Posture Review. |
| **5. Nonproliferation reinforcement** | Strengthen the NPT regime through the 2030 Review Conference, demonstrating U.S. compliance with Article VI disarmament obligations through arms control agreements and stockpile reductions. | Successful 2030 NPT Review Conference with consensus outcome document. |
| **6. Nuclear risk reduction agreement** | Negotiate multilateral agreements on nuclear risk reduction, including a joint declaration against launch-on-warning, protocols for notifying cyber incidents affecting NC3, and rules for behavior near nuclear facilities. | Multilateral risk reduction agreement signed by at least three nuclear-armed states. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: Establish a durable international framework that constrains nuclear arsenals, reduces risks, and moves the world toward the conditions envisioned by the NPT and subsequent disarmament commitments.

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Baseline (2026) | Phase 1 Target | Phase 2 Target | Phase 3 Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Deployed strategic warheads (U.S.) | ~1,700 | ~1,700 | ~1,550 or below | ~1,000 |
| ICBMs on high alert | ~400 | ~400 | ~300 | ~200 or zero |
| Active arms control agreements | 0 | 0 | Interim framework | New treaty in force |
| Annual nuclear weapons spending | ~$50+ billion | ~$50 billion | ~$45 billion | ~$35 billion |
| States party to CTBT (of 44 Annex 2) | 36 | 36 | 37+ | 40+ |

### Qualitative Metrics

- **Democratic accountability**: Nuclear use decisions involve appropriate checks and transparency.
- **Strategic stability**: U.S.-Russia and U.S.-China relationships include functioning communication channels and shared understandings of nuclear stability.
- **Alliance confidence**: Allied nations maintain confidence in extended deterrence without seeking independent nuclear capabilities.
- **Public engagement**: Nuclear policy features in national political discourse, with informed public debate and meaningful congressional oversight.
- **Nonproliferation credibility**: The United States is seen as fulfilling its NPT obligations, strengthening the global nonproliferation norm.
