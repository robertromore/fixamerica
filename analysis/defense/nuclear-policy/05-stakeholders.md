# Nuclear Policy: Stakeholders

## Overview

Nuclear weapons policy involves a uniquely concentrated set of stakeholders. Decisions that affect the survival of civilization are made by a small number of government agencies, military commands, weapons laboratories, and defense contractors, with limited input from Congress and virtually none from the public. Understanding who holds power, who benefits from the status quo, and who is affected by nuclear risk is essential to any reform effort.

## Government Stakeholders

### The President and the National Security Council

The President of the United States is the sole authority for ordering the use of nuclear weapons. The National Security Council (NSC) is the principal forum for advising the President on nuclear policy, strategy, and arms control. The Nuclear Posture Review is directed by the NSC and shapes declaratory policy, force structure decisions, and the role of nuclear weapons in national security strategy.

**Interest**: Maintaining credible deterrence, managing alliance relationships, and preserving presidential flexibility in crisis decision-making.

### U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM)

USSTRATCOM, headquartered at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, is the unified combatant command responsible for strategic deterrence. It oversees the planning, targeting, and operational readiness of all U.S. nuclear forces. The commander of USSTRATCOM (a four-star general or admiral) reports directly to the Secretary of Defense and advises the President on nuclear employment options.

**Interest**: Maintaining a modern, reliable, and diverse nuclear force capable of executing the full range of presidential guidance. USSTRATCOM has consistently advocated for all three legs of the triad and for modernization of every component.

### National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)

The NNSA is a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy, responsible for maintaining and modernizing the nuclear warhead stockpile, managing the weapons laboratories and production complex, and overseeing naval nuclear propulsion. The NNSA Administrator reports to the Secretary of Energy and has a dotted-line relationship to the Secretary of Defense for nuclear weapons matters.

**Interest**: Sustaining the nuclear weapons complex, executing warhead life extension programs and new designs, and recapitalizing aging infrastructure. The NNSA's budget has grown consistently at 7-8% annually.

### Department of Defense (Office of the Secretary)

The Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy shape nuclear strategy, oversee the Nuclear Posture Review, and manage the DoD's portion of nuclear modernization (delivery systems, NC3). The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy handles day-to-day nuclear policy.

**Interest**: Integrating nuclear capabilities into broader defense strategy, ensuring deterrence credibility, and managing the cost of modernization within the defense top line.

### Department of State

The State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence, and Stability (formerly Arms Control, Verification and Compliance) is responsible for negotiating and implementing arms control agreements. The Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation manages nonproliferation policy, including the NPT and sanctions enforcement.

**Interest**: Advancing arms control and nonproliferation objectives, maintaining alliance cohesion, and managing diplomatic relationships with Russia and China on nuclear issues.

### Congress

Congress plays several roles in nuclear policy:

- **Authorization and Appropriation**: The Armed Services Committees and Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittees authorize and fund nuclear programs.
- **Treaty Ratification**: The Senate must provide advice and consent for arms control treaties by a two-thirds vote.
- **Oversight**: The Armed Services, Foreign Relations/Affairs, and Intelligence Committees conduct oversight of nuclear programs and policy.

**Key members and committees:**

| Committee | Jurisdiction |
|---|---|
| Senate Armed Services Committee | DoD nuclear programs, modernization, strategy |
| Senate Foreign Relations Committee | Arms control treaties, nonproliferation |
| Senate Appropriations (Defense/Energy) | Funding for DoD and NNSA nuclear programs |
| House Armed Services Committee | DoD nuclear programs, modernization |
| House Foreign Affairs Committee | Arms control, nonproliferation |
| House Appropriations (Defense/Energy) | Funding for nuclear programs |
| Congressional Budget Office | Cost estimates for nuclear programs |

**Interest**: Members from states with nuclear facilities (New Mexico, California, Tennessee, Missouri, South Carolina) or ICBM bases (Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota) have direct economic interests. The broader Congress is divided between those who support robust modernization and those who advocate for cost control or arms control.

## Nuclear Weapons Laboratories

### Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)

Located in Los Alamos, New Mexico, LANL is the birthplace of nuclear weapons and remains the nation's premier nuclear weapons design laboratory. It is managed by Triad National Security, LLC (a consortium of Battelle, the Texas A&M University System, and the University of California). LANL is responsible for the design and certification of plutonium pits, the primary (fission) component of nuclear warheads.

**Interest**: Sustaining scientific capability, executing the W87-1 warhead and pit production missions, and maintaining its role as the "design agency" for nuclear weapons.

### Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)

Located in Livermore, California, LLNL is the second nuclear weapons design laboratory, managed by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC. LLNL leads the W80-4 warhead program (for the LRSO cruise missile) and contributes to stockpile stewardship through advanced simulation (the National Ignition Facility achieved fusion ignition in December 2022).

**Interest**: Maintaining a competitive design capability, advancing stockpile stewardship science, and executing warhead programs.

### Sandia National Laboratories

Headquartered in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with a second campus in Livermore, California, Sandia is managed by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia (a Honeywell subsidiary). Sandia is responsible for all non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons, including arming, fuzing, firing systems, and surety (safety and security) engineering.

**Interest**: Ensuring the reliability and safety of non-nuclear components across the entire stockpile, and modernizing weapons system integration.

## Defense Contractors

### Major Nuclear Modernization Contractors

| Contractor | Program | Estimated Value |
|---|---|---|
| Northrop Grumman | LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM | $140+ billion |
| General Dynamics Electric Boat | Columbia-class SSBN (SSBN-826) | $128 billion (12 boats) |
| Northrop Grumman | B-21 Raider bomber | Classified (est. $80+ billion) |
| Raytheon (RTX) | AGM-181A LRSO cruise missile | Classified (est. $10+ billion) |
| Lockheed Martin | Trident II D5LE SLBM life extension | ~$15 billion |
| Bechtel National | NNSA facility construction, management | Multi-billion |
| BWX Technologies (BWXT) | Naval nuclear reactors, uranium processing | Multi-billion |

**Interest**: Sustaining production lines, winning follow-on contracts, and maintaining the industrial workforce and facilities. Defense contractors are among the most powerful lobbying forces in Washington, spending hundreds of millions annually on campaign contributions and government relations.

### Subcontractor and Supply Chain Stakeholders

The nuclear modernization enterprise extends well beyond prime contractors. Thousands of subcontractors and suppliers across dozens of states provide specialized components, from guidance systems to propulsion to materials processing. This geographic distribution is both an economic reality and a deliberate political strategy that builds congressional support for programs by spreading jobs and contracts widely.

## Arms Control and Nonproliferation Community

### Key Organizations

| Organization | Focus | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Arms Control Association (ACA) | Arms control policy, analysis, and advocacy | Publishes *Arms Control Today*, provides expert analysis |
| Federation of American Scientists (FAS) | Nuclear weapons data, policy analysis | Maintains the Nuclear Notebook (authoritative open-source stockpile data) |
| Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) | Nonproliferation, nuclear security | Founded by Sam Nunn; funds projects on reducing nuclear dangers |
| Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) | Science-based advocacy on nuclear risk | Analysis of ICBM vulnerability, sole authority reform |
| Ploughshares Fund | Nuclear policy grantmaking | Major funder of arms control advocacy and research |
| International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) | Nuclear disarmament | Nobel Peace Prize 2017; advocates for TPNW |
| RAND Corporation | Defense and nuclear strategy research | Provides analysis to DoD and NNSA |
| Carnegie Endowment for International Peace | Nuclear policy, nonproliferation | Research and Track 1.5/2 diplomacy |
| Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) | Defense and nuclear policy | Bipartisan research on nuclear modernization and strategy |
| Stimson Center | Nuclear risk reduction | Research on escalation dynamics and confidence-building |

**Interest**: Reducing nuclear risk through arms control, transparency, risk reduction measures, and in some cases, disarmament. These organizations provide much of the independent analysis and expertise that informs public debate and congressional oversight.

## Allied Nations Under the Nuclear Umbrella

### NATO Nuclear Sharing

Five NATO member states host U.S. B61 tactical nuclear weapons under nuclear sharing arrangements: Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey. These countries maintain dual-capable aircraft (primarily F-35As, with older F-16s being replaced) that can deliver U.S. nuclear weapons in wartime under NATO authorization.

### Extended Deterrence Partners

| Ally/Region | Arrangement | Key Concern |
|---|---|---|
| NATO Europe | Nuclear sharing, Nuclear Planning Group | Russian conventional and nuclear threats |
| Japan | U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, nuclear umbrella | China's military expansion, North Korea |
| South Korea | U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty, nuclear umbrella | North Korea's nuclear arsenal |
| Australia | AUKUS, Five Eyes, U.S.-Australia alliance | Regional stability, China |

**Interest**: Allied nations depend on the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence for their security. Any perceived weakening of the U.S. nuclear commitment (such as adopting No First Use) raises concerns about "decoupling" and could incentivize independent nuclear programs. Japan and South Korea have both experienced growing domestic debates about acquiring their own nuclear weapons.

## Affected Populations

### Communities Near Nuclear Facilities

Communities surrounding nuclear weapons production facilities, test sites, and ICBM bases bear disproportionate environmental and health risks. These include:

- **Downwinders**: Populations in Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and the Pacific Islands exposed to radioactive fallout from atmospheric nuclear testing. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) has provided limited compensation but excludes many affected communities.
- **Nuclear workers**: Employees at weapons production facilities who have been exposed to radiation and toxic chemicals. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) provides benefits but faces processing backlogs and eligibility disputes.
- **Indigenous communities**: The Navajo Nation and other tribal communities in the Southwest were disproportionately affected by uranium mining and nuclear testing. The legacy of contamination from over 500 abandoned uranium mines on Navajo land continues to cause health impacts.

### Global Populations

The entire human population is a stakeholder in nuclear policy, as a large-scale nuclear exchange could cause a "nuclear winter" with global climate effects, widespread famine, and billions of casualties. Recent modeling by Rutgers University (2022) estimated that even a regional nuclear war between India and Pakistan could cause over 2 billion deaths from famine due to soot-induced cooling.
