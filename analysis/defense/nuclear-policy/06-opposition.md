# Nuclear Policy: Opposition to Reform

## Overview

Nuclear policy reform faces opposition from a powerful and entrenched set of interests that span the executive branch, Congress, the defense industry, and elements of the strategic studies community. Unlike many policy domains where opposition divides neatly along partisan lines, resistance to nuclear reform cuts across traditional political boundaries. Hawks in both parties support unconstrained modernization. Skeptics of arms control span from those who distrust Russia and China to those who view any constraint on presidential authority as dangerous. The nuclear weapons establishment, including the laboratories, NNSA, and defense contractors, has institutional incentives to resist changes that could reduce budgets, narrow missions, or introduce oversight.

## The Nuclear Weapons Establishment

### NNSA and the Weapons Laboratories

The NNSA, LANL, LLNL, and Sandia collectively employ tens of thousands of scientists, engineers, and technicians whose careers and institutional purpose are tied to maintaining and modernizing the nuclear arsenal. While these organizations serve a legitimate national security function, they also have institutional incentives to:

- **Advocate for new warhead programs**: Each new warhead design (W87-1, W80-4, W93) sustains the design capability and workforce at the laboratories.
- **Resist reductions**: Proposals to reduce the stockpile or eliminate warhead types threaten laboratory missions and budgets.
- **Expand infrastructure**: The push for 80+ plutonium pits per year at two production sites reflects both a genuine capacity need and an institutional interest in a larger, more capable complex.

**Opposition tactic**: The laboratories and NNSA frame their programs in terms of "stewardship" and "reliability," making opposition to any specific program appear as opposition to stockpile safety. This framing makes it politically difficult for members of Congress to question individual programs.

### USSTRATCOM

The commander of USSTRATCOM has consistently testified before Congress in support of all three legs of the triad and against any reduction in capability. This is both a legitimate military judgment and a reflection of the institutional interest of the command. USSTRATCOM's public advocacy has been particularly strong in defense of the land-based ICBM mission, even as some analysts question whether ICBMs are strategically necessary given the survivability of the submarine force.

**Opposition tactic**: USSTRATCOM frames any reduction in nuclear forces as increasing risk to the warfighter and weakening deterrence, without engaging with the strategic logic of alternative force structures.

## Defense Industry Opposition

### Prime Contractors

The defense contractors building the next generation of nuclear delivery systems have enormous financial interests in the continuation of these programs:

| Contractor | Program | Estimated Value | Key Congressional States |
|---|---|---|---|
| Northrop Grumman | Sentinel ICBM | $140+ billion | Utah, Colorado, California |
| General Dynamics Electric Boat | Columbia-class SSBN | $128 billion | Connecticut, Rhode Island |
| Northrop Grumman | B-21 Raider | $80+ billion | California, Florida |
| Raytheon (RTX) | LRSO cruise missile | $10+ billion | Arizona, Massachusetts |

**Opposition tactic**: Defense contractors maintain extensive lobbying operations in Washington and contribute to the campaigns of members of Congress on relevant committees. They also distribute subcontracts across as many congressional districts as possible, creating a broad base of economic interest in program continuation. Northrop Grumman, for example, has noted that the Sentinel program involves suppliers in 32 states.

### The ICBM Constituency

The land-based ICBM force is perhaps the most politically protected component of the triad, despite being the most strategically questionable. The five states hosting ICBM bases and missile fields (Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Colorado, Nebraska) have ten U.S. senators, all of whom have strong incentives to support the ICBM mission regardless of strategic analysis. The bipartisan ICBM Coalition in Congress has consistently fought any proposal to reduce the ICBM force or question the Sentinel replacement program.

**Opposition tactic**: ICBM proponents argue that eliminating ICBMs would force an adversary to target only two types of platforms (submarines and bombers) rather than three, reducing the "targeting problem" for the attacker. They also emphasize the "nuclear sponge" theory, that ICBM silos force an adversary to expend hundreds of warheads on sparsely populated areas rather than targeting cities. Critics note that the "nuclear sponge" argument effectively concedes that ICBM fields would be destroyed in a nuclear exchange, sacrificing the communities around them.

## Hawks and Nuclear Maximalists

### Strategic Hawks

A significant faction within both parties, but particularly among Republicans, advocates for maximum nuclear capability with minimal constraints. This position is associated with think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, the Hudson Institute, and the National Institute for Public Policy, and with former officials such as Keith Payne and John Bolton.

**Key arguments:**

- **Peace through strength**: A larger, more capable arsenal deters adversaries more effectively. Any restraint signals weakness.
- **No arms control without verification**: Arms control with Russia and China is futile because neither can be trusted to comply. Russia violated the INF Treaty; China refuses to participate.
- **Presidential authority is sacrosanct**: Sole launch authority is essential for deterrence credibility. Any constraint on the President's ability to respond immediately would embolden adversaries.
- **Missile defense expansion**: The United States should pursue missile defense aggressively, rather than accepting mutual vulnerability.

**Opposition tactic**: Hawks characterize arms control advocates as naive, and proposals for No First Use or sole authority reform as dangerous unilateral disarmament. They invoke the Cold War phrase "better dead than Red" in modern form, suggesting that any compromise on nuclear capability risks national survival.

### The "Two-Peer Problem" Argument

A newer argument, prominent since the 2022 NPR, holds that the United States must expand its nuclear forces to simultaneously deter Russia and China. Proponents argue that:

- The current arsenal was sized for one peer adversary (Russia) and is insufficient for two.
- The United States may need to increase deployed warheads above New START levels.
- New types of weapons (e.g., additional low-yield options, nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles) are needed for regional deterrence.

**Opposition tactic**: This framing drives demand for more weapons and more spending while making arms control appear strategically irresponsible.

## Arms Control Skeptics

### Russia Skeptics

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and its nuclear saber-rattling (including Putin's explicit threats to use nuclear weapons), many policymakers and analysts argue that arms control with Russia is impossible for the foreseeable future.

**Key arguments:**

- Russia violated the INF Treaty by deploying the SSC-8 ground-launched cruise missile, proving it cannot be trusted.
- Russia suspended New START compliance as political leverage over Ukraine.
- Any new agreement would reward Russian aggression and legitimize its nuclear threats.

**Opposition tactic**: Russia skeptics argue that engaging in arms control negotiations would signal weakness and willingness to make concessions to an adversary that does not negotiate in good faith.

### China Skeptics

Similarly, skeptics of engaging China on arms control argue that:

- China refuses to participate in negotiations and provides no transparency about its arsenal.
- China's rapid nuclear expansion indicates it seeks parity, not stability.
- Arms control would constrain the United States while China builds freely.

**Opposition tactic**: China skeptics argue that any trilateral framework would be unverifiable and would benefit China by limiting U.S. and Russian forces while China catches up.

## Opposition to Sole Authority Reform

### Executive Branch Resistance

Every administration, regardless of party, has resisted legislative constraints on presidential nuclear authority. The executive branch views sole authority as an inherent power of the commander-in-chief under Article II of the Constitution.

**Key arguments:**

- **Deterrence credibility**: Any delay or uncertainty in the decision chain would weaken deterrence by signaling to adversaries that the U.S. might not respond quickly.
- **Operational necessity**: In a bolt-from-the-blue ICBM attack scenario, the President has only 10-15 minutes to decide. Adding additional decision-makers would consume precious time.
- **Constitutional authority**: The President's role as commander-in-chief includes the authority to direct military operations, including nuclear use.

**Opposition tactic**: Opponents of sole authority reform argue that any constraint would "tie the President's hands" in a crisis and invite adversary miscalculation.

### Military Resistance

Senior military leaders have generally supported sole presidential authority in public testimony, while some retired officers have privately expressed concern. The military chain of command is built around executing presidential orders, and proposals to interpose additional decision-makers challenge this hierarchy.

## Opposition to No First Use

### Allied Governments

U.S. allies under the nuclear umbrella have been the most vocal opponents of a No First Use policy. Japan, South Korea, and several NATO allies (particularly the Baltic states and Poland) have privately and publicly urged the United States not to adopt NFU, arguing that:

- NFU would weaken extended deterrence by signaling that the United States would not use nuclear weapons to defend allies against overwhelming conventional attack.
- NFU could encourage adversaries to believe they can wage limited conventional wars under a nuclear umbrella.
- NFU could trigger proliferation as allies seek their own nuclear deterrent.

**Opposition tactic**: Allied opposition to NFU is communicated through diplomatic channels and is often cited by U.S. officials as the primary reason for not adopting the policy. The Biden administration explicitly cited allied concerns in its 2022 decision not to adopt NFU.

## Opposition to CTBT Ratification

The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has been pending before the U.S. Senate since 1996 and was rejected by a vote of 48-51 in 1999. Opponents argue that:

- The United States may someday need to resume testing to certify the reliability of new warhead designs or address unforeseen stockpile problems.
- The CTBT verification regime cannot reliably detect very low-yield tests or tests conducted in novel environments.
- Ratification would constrain the U.S. without constraining states that have not signed (North Korea) or that could withdraw.

**Opposition tactic**: CTBT opponents frame ratification as an irreversible constraint on future flexibility, while arguing that the U.S. testing moratorium already provides the diplomatic benefits of the treaty without the legal obligation.
