# Nuclear Policy: Solutions

## Overview

Reducing nuclear risk requires action across multiple dimensions: renewing arms control, reforming nuclear authority, controlling modernization costs, strengthening nonproliferation, and reducing the day-to-day operational risks of maintaining thousands of warheads on alert. No single reform is sufficient. The solutions below are organized from the most immediately achievable to the most structurally ambitious, with each building on the others.

## Solution 1: Arms Control Renewal

### The Problem

The expiration of New START in February 2026 leaves no binding limits on U.S. or Russian strategic nuclear arsenals for the first time since 1972. The absence of verification, data exchange, and communication channels increases the risk of miscalculation and arms racing.

### Proposed Reforms

**Near-term (bilateral U.S.-Russia):**

- **New START successor agreement**: Negotiate a follow-on treaty that maintains or lowers the 1,550 deployed strategic warhead limit, restores on-site inspections and data exchanges, and addresses Russian concerns about missile defense and conventional prompt global strike.
- **Informal reciprocal restraint**: Even without a formal treaty, both sides could declare and observe mutual restraint on deployed warhead numbers, providing a degree of predictability while negotiations proceed.
- **Risk reduction measures**: Reestablish military-to-military communication channels, including the deconfliction line used during the Syria conflict, and negotiate new protocols for notifying each other of missile launches, military exercises near nuclear facilities, and cyber incidents affecting strategic systems.

**Medium-term (multilateral):**

- **Trilateral framework**: Develop a framework for including China in arms control, potentially beginning with transparency and confidence-building measures rather than numerical limits. Options include mutual declarations of stockpile size, notifications of missile launches, and agreement on a common data exchange format.
- **P5 process**: Strengthen the existing P5 (U.S., Russia, China, UK, France) nuclear dialogue to establish shared terminology, increase transparency, and develop norms for responsible nuclear behavior.

**Evidence of feasibility**: Arms control negotiations have succeeded even during periods of intense geopolitical tension. The INF Treaty was negotiated during the most dangerous phase of the late Cold War (1981-1987). New START was negotiated after the 2008 Russia-Georgia war. The key variable is political will, not geopolitical conditions.

### Implementation

Arms control requires presidential leadership and Senate ratification (two-thirds vote). Informal restraint measures can be implemented through executive action. Congressional support can be built by framing arms control as a cost-saving measure and a tool for managing great power competition, rather than as a concession.

## Solution 2: No First Use Policy

### The Problem

The United States reserves the right to use nuclear weapons first, including against non-nuclear threats. This posture increases the risk of nuclear escalation during a conventional conflict, is inconsistent with the stated U.S. position that nuclear weapons exist primarily to deter nuclear attack, and sets a negative example for other nuclear-armed states.

### Proposed Reform

Adopt a declaratory policy of No First Use (NFU), stating that the United States will not use nuclear weapons unless first attacked with nuclear weapons. This would be implemented through:

- A presidential policy directive, codified in the Nuclear Posture Review.
- Legislation requiring congressional authorization before a nuclear first strike (see [Legislation](11-legislation.md)).
- Adjustments to war plans and targeting guidance to align operational planning with declaratory policy.
- Intensive allied consultations to address concerns about extended deterrence.

### Addressing Allied Concerns

The primary objection to NFU is that it would weaken extended deterrence. This can be addressed through:

- **Strengthening conventional deterrence**: Investing in conventional capabilities (precision-guided munitions, missile defense, forward-deployed forces) that can deter aggression without relying on the nuclear threshold.
- **Enhanced security guarantees**: Bilateral assurances and consultations with key allies, including expanded nuclear planning dialogues.
- **NATO Nuclear Planning Group**: Engaging NATO allies directly in discussions about how NFU would be implemented within the alliance framework.

**Evidence of feasibility**: China has maintained a No First Use policy since 1964. India adopted NFU in 2003. Multiple former senior U.S. officials (including former Secretary of Defense William Perry and former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs James Cartwright) have advocated for NFU.

## Solution 3: Sole Authority Reform

### The Problem

The President has sole, unchecked authority to order a nuclear launch. No other individual or institution must concur. This arrangement was designed for Cold War speed-of-response requirements but creates unacceptable risks of impulsive, irrational, or unauthorized use.

### Proposed Reforms

- **Two-person rule for first use**: Require the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense (or a designated successor) for any nuclear first strike. This preserves the ability to respond to a confirmed nuclear attack under sole presidential authority but adds a check on initiating nuclear use.
- **Congressional authorization for first strike**: Require a congressional declaration of war or specific authorization before a nuclear first strike, consistent with the Constitution's assignment of war-declaration power to Congress.
- **Nuclear use certification**: Require the Secretary of Defense to certify that a nuclear launch order is legal (consistent with the law of armed conflict and domestic law) before transmitting it.

### Preserving Deterrence Credibility

Reform proponents argue that adding a second decision-maker does not meaningfully slow response time (the Secretary of Defense is already in the decision chain for authentication) and may actually enhance deterrence by assuring adversaries that U.S. nuclear decisions are deliberate and rational rather than impulsive.

**Evidence of feasibility**: The United Kingdom requires the concurrence of the Prime Minister and (in practice) senior military officials. France's nuclear authority involves consultation with the Prime Minister and the Chief of the Defense Staff. Neither country's deterrent is considered less credible as a result.

## Solution 4: Modernization Cost Control

### The Problem

The United States is pursuing the simultaneous replacement of all three legs of the nuclear triad at an estimated cost of $1.5-2 trillion over 30 years. The Sentinel ICBM program alone has seen costs rise from $96 billion to over $140 billion. Programs of this scale and duration are prone to cost overruns, schedule delays, and requirements creep, and the total cost competes with other defense and domestic priorities.

### Proposed Reforms

- **Independent review of Sentinel ICBM**: Commission a genuinely independent review (not conducted by NNSA, the Air Force, or Northrop Grumman) of the strategic rationale, cost, and alternatives for the Sentinel program, including life extension of Minuteman III, a reduced ICBM force, or elimination of the land-based leg.
- **Cost caps with real teeth**: Establish statutory cost caps on each major nuclear modernization program, with automatic program restructuring or cancellation if costs exceed the cap by a specified threshold (e.g., 25%).
- **Triad vs. dyad analysis**: The Congressional Budget Office should be directed to produce a comprehensive cost and strategic analysis of a nuclear dyad (submarines and bombers only) compared to the current triad, including the cost savings and strategic implications.
- **Warhead consolidation**: Reduce the number of warhead types in the stockpile, consolidating around fewer, more modern designs to simplify production and maintenance.
- **NNSA reform**: Strengthen NNSA governance to improve project management, reduce cost overruns at production facilities, and establish clear priorities rather than attempting all programs simultaneously.

**Evidence of feasibility**: The Congressional Budget Office has repeatedly noted that alternatives to full triad modernization could save hundreds of billions of dollars. Multiple former defense officials have questioned the need for a new ICBM, including former Secretary of Defense William Perry, who has called ICBMs "some of the most dangerous weapons in the world" and advocated for their elimination.

## Solution 5: CTBT Ratification

### The Problem

The United States has observed a nuclear testing moratorium since 1992 but has not ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). This weakens the global norm against testing, reduces U.S. moral authority in opposing other states' tests, and leaves the treaty unable to enter into force (U.S. ratification is required under Annex 2).

### Proposed Reform

The President should submit the CTBT to the Senate for renewed advice and consent, accompanied by:

- An updated assessment from the NNSA and the JASON advisory group confirming that the Stockpile Stewardship Program can maintain warhead reliability without testing.
- A commitment to maintain the Nevada National Security Site in a state of readiness for subcritical experiments.
- An analysis of the verification capabilities of the International Monitoring System, which has matured significantly since the 1999 Senate vote.

**Evidence of feasibility**: The Stockpile Stewardship Program has successfully maintained the arsenal without testing for over 30 years. The directors of all three weapons laboratories have repeatedly certified the reliability of the stockpile without the need for nuclear explosive testing. 187 states have signed the CTBT, and 178 have ratified it.

## Solution 6: Nuclear Risk Reduction Measures

### The Problem

Even without arms control treaties, there are operational measures that can reduce the day-to-day risk of accidental, unauthorized, or inadvertent nuclear use.

### Proposed Reforms

- **De-alerting ICBMs**: Remove a portion of the ICBM force from immediate launch-on-warning status, increasing the decision time available to the President during a crisis. This could involve removing warheads from some missiles or placing missiles in a lower readiness state that requires hours rather than minutes to launch.
- **Eliminating launch-on-warning posture**: Shift from a posture that relies on launching ICBMs before incoming warheads arrive ("use them or lose them") to a posture that relies on the survivable submarine force for retaliation.
- **Dual-capable system protocols**: Establish clear protocols and communication channels to reduce the risk that conventional strikes with dual-capable systems (e.g., F-35s, ships capable of launching both conventional and nuclear cruise missiles) are misinterpreted as nuclear attacks.
- **Cyber resilience**: Invest in hardening NC3 systems against cyber attack, including air-gapping critical systems, implementing zero-trust architectures, and conducting regular red-team assessments.
- **Crisis communication**: Establish or strengthen hotlines and crisis communication channels between the United States and Russia, China, North Korea, India, and Pakistan, specifically for nuclear-related incidents.

**Evidence of feasibility**: The United States has previously de-alerted portions of its bomber force (bombers were taken off alert in 1991). Multiple studies by the National Academies and independent analysts have concluded that de-alerting ICBMs would not undermine deterrence.

## Solution 7: Transparency and Confidence-Building

### The Problem

Secrecy and opacity in nuclear policy fuel worst-case assumptions, hinder democratic accountability, and make arms control harder to achieve.

### Proposed Reforms

- **Stockpile transparency**: Resume the practice (established by the Obama administration in 2010 and discontinued in 2018) of publicly disclosing the total number of warheads in the U.S. stockpile.
- **Nuclear employment policy transparency**: Declassify and publish unclassified summaries of the Nuclear Employment Strategy (the guidance that shapes war plans and targeting), as was done in 2013.
- **Budget transparency**: Require the NNSA and DoD to publish a comprehensive, unclassified accounting of all nuclear weapons-related spending, consolidated in a single document, to enable informed public and congressional debate.
- **Congressional access**: Ensure that all members of Congress (not just those on relevant committees) have access to classified briefings on nuclear strategy, force posture, and modernization programs.
- **Reciprocal transparency with adversaries**: Propose reciprocal transparency measures with Russia and China, such as mutual declarations of stockpile size, mutual invitations to observe warhead dismantlement, and exchanges of nuclear doctrine white papers.

**Evidence of feasibility**: The United States disclosed its stockpile number from 2010 to 2018 without any adverse security consequences. Multiple NATO allies have called for greater transparency as a confidence-building measure.
