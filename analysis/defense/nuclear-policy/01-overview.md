# Nuclear Policy: Overview

## Overview

The United States maintains the most powerful nuclear arsenal in the world, a capability designed to deter existential threats to the nation and its allies. This deterrent rests on a "nuclear triad" of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and nuclear-capable strategic bombers, each providing redundancy against a disarming first strike. For eight decades, nuclear weapons have been the ultimate guarantor of American security, but the strategic environment that shaped this posture has changed dramatically.

The arms control framework that constrained superpower arsenals for half a century is collapsing. The INF Treaty is dead. New START has expired without a successor. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) remains unratified by the United States. China is undertaking the most rapid nuclear buildup since the Cold War, transitioning from a minimal deterrent to a peer-level arsenal. Russia continues to modernize its forces and has suspended its participation in nuclear arms agreements. Meanwhile, the United States has embarked on a comprehensive modernization of all three legs of the triad at an estimated cost of $1.5 to $2 trillion over thirty years, a program driven more by industrial momentum than strategic reassessment.

At the center of these challenges sits a constitutional anomaly: a single individual, the President, possesses sole and unchecked authority to order the launch of thousands of nuclear weapons, a decision that could end civilization in under an hour with no requirement for congressional authorization, judicial review, or even consultation with the Secretary of Defense.

## Scope

This analysis examines the principal components of U.S. nuclear weapons policy:

- **Nuclear Posture and Doctrine**: The role of nuclear weapons in national security strategy, including deterrence theory, targeting policy, and declaratory policy (such as No First Use).
- **Triad Modernization**: The programs to replace all three legs of the nuclear triad, including the Sentinel ICBM, Columbia-class submarine, B-21 Raider bomber, and associated warhead life extension programs.
- **Arms Control and Nonproliferation**: The status and future of bilateral arms control with Russia, prospects for engaging China, and the global nonproliferation regime anchored by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
- **Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3)**: The systems and procedures for presidential authorization, launch detection, and command transmission, including vulnerability to cyber and emerging threats.
- **Sole Authority**: The legal and constitutional framework governing who can order a nuclear strike, and proposals for reform.
- **Nuclear Testing and Stockpile Stewardship**: The testing moratorium, the CTBT, and the NNSA Stockpile Stewardship Program that maintains warheads without testing.
- **National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)**: The semi-autonomous agency responsible for the nuclear weapons complex, including the three national security laboratories and production facilities.

| Nuclear-Armed States | 9 | SIPRI Yearbook, 2024 |

## Core Tensions

- **Deterrence vs. Disarmament**: The United States is legally committed under Article VI of the NPT to pursue nuclear disarmament "in good faith," yet it is simultaneously spending trillions to maintain and modernize its arsenal indefinitely.
- **Sole Authority vs. Democratic Accountability**: The President can order a nuclear strike without any check or consultation, a power incompatible with democratic governance and the constitutional requirement that Congress declare war.
- **Modernization vs. Fiscal Responsibility**: The estimated $1.5-2 trillion cost of full triad replacement competes with other defense and domestic priorities, yet once programs reach production phase they become politically impossible to cancel.
- **Arms Control vs. Great Power Competition**: Pursuing arms control with Russia and China requires diplomatic engagement that may conflict with an adversarial strategic posture and alliance commitments.
- **Extended Deterrence vs. Proliferation Risk**: U.S. allies rely on the American nuclear umbrella for their security, but any perceived weakening of that commitment could incentivize independent nuclear programs in Japan, South Korea, or Saudi Arabia.
- **Readiness vs. Risk**: Maintaining hundreds of ICBMs on high alert reduces response time to minutes, creating risks of accidental or unauthorized launch based on false warning.

## Key Questions

1. Does the United States need all three legs of the nuclear triad, or could a dyad of submarines and bombers provide sufficient deterrence at lower cost and risk?
2. Should the United States adopt a No First Use policy, declaring it will never use nuclear weapons first?
3. How should sole presidential launch authority be reformed to include appropriate checks without undermining deterrent credibility?
4. What arms control framework can constrain the arsenals of Russia, China, and the United States simultaneously?
5. Should the Sentinel ICBM program be restructured, scaled back, or canceled given cost overruns and the declining strategic rationale for land-based missiles?
6. What role should nuclear weapons play in deterring non-nuclear threats, including cyber, biological, and conventional attacks?
7. Should the United States ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty?

## Vision of Success

A successful nuclear policy would be one in which:

- **Deterrence is maintained** at the minimum level necessary to prevent nuclear attack on the United States and its allies, without excess capacity that fuels arms races.
- **Arms control is restored** through new agreements that verifiably limit the arsenals of all major nuclear powers and prevent the development of destabilizing new capabilities.
- **Democratic accountability** governs nuclear use decisions, with appropriate checks on sole presidential authority that balance credibility with constitutional principles.
- **Modernization is disciplined**, with programs sized to strategic need rather than industrial or bureaucratic inertia, and subject to rigorous cost control and independent review.
- **Nonproliferation is strengthened**, with the NPT regime reinforced by U.S. leadership, CTBT ratification, and credible movement toward disarmament obligations.
- **Nuclear risk is reduced** through de-alerting, improved command and control, and confidence-building measures that lower the chance of accidental, unauthorized, or inadvertent nuclear use.
