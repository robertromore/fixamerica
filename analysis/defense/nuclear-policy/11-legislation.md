# Nuclear Policy: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

U.S. nuclear weapons policy operates within a legal framework shaped by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (as amended in 1954), the War Powers Resolution, international treaties (NPT, New START, INF), and decades of executive orders and presidential directives. The most consequential legal feature of American nuclear policy is also its most legally ambiguous: the President's sole authority to order a nuclear strike rests not on any statute but on a combination of constitutional interpretation (Article II commander-in-chief authority), Cold War-era emergency procedures, and unbroken executive practice.

This document proposes two complementary federal bills. The first, the **Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act**, addresses the most urgent governance gaps: sole presidential authority, the absence of a No First Use declaration, and the lack of transparency in nuclear employment policy. The second, the **Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act**, establishes fiscal discipline over the multi-trillion-dollar modernization program, mandates independent review of the Sentinel ICBM, creates a framework for CTBT ratification, and requires the executive branch to pursue arms control negotiations.

Together, these bills aim to restore democratic accountability over the most consequential decisions a government can make, without undermining the credibility of nuclear deterrence.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are proposed. The legislative reforms below operate within existing constitutional authority:*

- **Congress's war powers** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 11): The power to declare war is the constitutional foundation for requiring congressional authorization before a nuclear first strike. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's authority to constrain the initiation of hostilities.
- **Congressional spending power** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1; Article I, Section 9, Clause 7): Congress has plenary authority over appropriations, including the power to set cost caps and conditions on nuclear weapons programs.
- **Treaty power** (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2): The Senate's role in providing advice and consent for treaties provides the constitutional basis for CTBT ratification provisions.
- **Commander-in-chief authority** (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1): The President's authority to direct military operations is preserved for retaliatory strikes; the legislation constrains only the initiation of nuclear use.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To establish democratic accountability over nuclear weapons use decisions by requiring a two-person authorization for nuclear first strikes, declaring a policy of No First Use, and mandating transparency in nuclear employment policy.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Amendments to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) and Title 10 of the United States Code, reported through the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **No First Use Declaration**: Establishes as U.S. policy that the United States will not use nuclear weapons first.
2. **Two-Person Authorization for First Use**: Requires the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense before any nuclear launch order that constitutes a first use of nuclear weapons.
3. **Congressional Authorization for First Strike**: Prohibits the first use of nuclear weapons absent a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization by Congress.
4. **Nuclear Employment Policy Transparency**: Requires the President to submit an unclassified summary of nuclear employment guidance to Congress and the public.
5. **Retaliatory Authority Preserved**: Explicitly preserves the President's authority to order a retaliatory nuclear strike in response to a confirmed nuclear attack on the United States or its allies.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To establish a policy of No First Use of nuclear weapons, to require
a two-person authorization for any first use of nuclear weapons, to
require congressional authorization before a nuclear first strike, and
to mandate transparency in nuclear employment policy.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Nuclear Weapons Policy and
Accountability Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States maintains an arsenal of approximately 3,748
nuclear warheads, of which roughly 1,700 are deployed on strategic
delivery systems capable of being launched within minutes.
(2) Under current practice, the President of the United States
possesses sole and unchecked authority to order the use of nuclear
weapons, including their first use, without any requirement for
consultation with or concurrence from any other official, including the
Secretary of Defense or any member of Congress.
(3) This sole authority arrangement originated in Cold War-era
emergency procedures and has never been the subject of formal
legislative deliberation or statutory authorization.
(4) Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution grants
Congress the sole power to declare war. The first use of nuclear
weapons constitutes an act of war of the most consequential kind.
(5) The bipartisan consensus of multiple former Secretaries of
Defense, former Chairs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former
commanders of U.S. Strategic Command holds that appropriate checks on
nuclear first use are compatible with effective deterrence.
(6) The United Kingdom, France, and other nuclear-armed democracies
maintain effective nuclear deterrents with decision-making processes
that involve more than a single individual.
(7) The 2022 Nuclear Posture Review declared that the "fundamental
role" of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack against the
United States and its allies, a formulation consistent with a No First
Use policy.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) FIRST USE.--The term "first use" means the use of nuclear
weapons against a target when the United States has not first sustained
a nuclear weapons attack by the country or countries against which the
nuclear weapons would be used.
(2) NUCLEAR WEAPONS.--The term "nuclear weapons" has the meaning
given the term "atomic weapon" in section 11(d) of the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2014(d)).
(3) RETALIATORY USE.--The term "retaliatory use" means the use of
nuclear weapons in response to a confirmed nuclear weapons attack on
the United States, its territories, its armed forces abroad, or a
treaty ally.
(4) NUCLEAR EMPLOYMENT GUIDANCE.--The term "nuclear employment
guidance" means the presidential guidance that establishes the policy,
strategy, and targeting objectives for the potential use of nuclear
weapons, including but not limited to the document known as the Nuclear
Weapons Employment Policy.

SEC. 4. DECLARATION OF POLICY.

(a) NO FIRST USE.--It is the policy of the United States not to use
nuclear weapons first.
(b) CONSTRUCTION.--The policy declared in subsection (a) does not
limit the authority of the President to order the retaliatory use of
nuclear weapons in response to a confirmed nuclear attack on the United
States, its territories, its armed forces abroad, or a treaty ally.

SEC. 5. TWO-PERSON AUTHORIZATION FOR FIRST USE.

(a) REQUIREMENT.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no
member of the Armed Forces may carry out any order to use nuclear
weapons that constitutes a first use unless such order is concurred in
by both:
    (1) the President; and
    (2) the Secretary of Defense.
(b) CERTIFICATION.--Before concurring in an order described in
subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall certify in writing or by
secure electronic communication that:
    (1) the proposed use is lawful under the law of armed conflict
    and the domestic law of the United States;
    (2) the proposed use is necessary to address an imminent threat
    to the survival of the United States or a treaty ally; and
    (3) no adequate conventional alternative exists to address the
    threat.
(c) SUCCESSION.--If the Secretary of Defense is incapacitated or
unavailable, the authority under subsection (a)(2) shall pass to the
Deputy Secretary of Defense, and then in accordance with the order of
succession established under section 132a of title 10, United States
Code.
(d) RETALIATORY USE EXEMPTION.--This section does not apply to the
retaliatory use of nuclear weapons in response to a confirmed nuclear
attack.

SEC. 6. CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION FOR FIRST STRIKE.

(a) PROHIBITION.--No funds appropriated or otherwise made available
for any fiscal year may be used for the first use of nuclear weapons
unless such use is authorized by:
    (1) a declaration of war by Congress; or
    (2) a specific statutory authorization for such use enacted
    after the date of enactment of this Act.
(b) EXPEDITED PROCEDURES.--Upon receipt of a request from the
President for authorization under subsection (a)(2), the Senate and
House of Representatives shall consider such request under expedited
procedures, with a vote required within 48 hours of the request being
received.
(c) RETALIATORY USE EXEMPTION.--This section does not apply to the
retaliatory use of nuclear weapons.

SEC. 7. NUCLEAR EMPLOYMENT POLICY TRANSPARENCY.

(a) UNCLASSIFIED SUMMARY.--Not later than 90 days after the date of
enactment of this Act, and not later than 90 days after any subsequent
revision of the nuclear employment guidance, the President shall submit
to Congress and make publicly available an unclassified summary of the
nuclear employment guidance.
(b) CONTENTS.--The unclassified summary required under subsection
(a) shall include, at a minimum:
    (1) the stated role of nuclear weapons in national security
    strategy;
    (2) the circumstances under which the use of nuclear weapons
    would be considered;
    (3) the general categories of targets that nuclear weapons may
    be employed against; and
    (4) any constraints or conditions on nuclear use.
(c) CLASSIFIED BRIEFING.--In addition to the unclassified summary,
the President shall provide a classified briefing on the full nuclear
employment guidance to all members of the congressional defense
committees and the congressional foreign affairs committees not later
than 30 days after any revision.

SEC. 8. ANNUAL REPORT.

Not later than March 1 of each year, the Secretary of Defense shall
submit to the congressional defense committees a report on:
(1) the status and readiness of the nuclear command, control, and
communications system;
(2) any incidents involving the nuclear command authority chain,
including false alarms, communication failures, or unauthorized actions;
(3) the results of any reviews of sole authority procedures; and
(4) the status of nuclear risk reduction measures, including
de-alerting and crisis communication channels with other
nuclear-armed states.

SEC. 9. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision
to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the
remainder of this Act, and the application of the remaining provisions
to any person or circumstance, shall not be affected.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Section 4** establishes No First Use as declaratory policy, aligning U.S. policy with the 2022 NPR's "fundamental role" language while going further to make the commitment explicit.
- **Section 5** introduces the two-person rule for first use only, preserving unitary presidential authority for retaliation. The Secretary of Defense is chosen as the second decision-maker because this official is already in the nuclear command chain and can act within the time constraints of a crisis.
- **Section 6** uses the congressional spending power to prohibit the use of appropriated funds for nuclear first strikes without congressional authorization, a mechanism upheld in analogous contexts (e.g., the Boland Amendments).
- **Section 7** addresses the secrecy that has insulated nuclear policy from democratic oversight.

**Potential Challenges:**

- **Executive resistance**: Every administration has resisted constraints on sole authority, citing commander-in-chief powers. The bill is crafted to apply only to first use, avoiding the strongest Article II arguments.
- **Deterrence credibility**: Opponents will argue that any constraint on the President weakens deterrence. The retaliation exemption and expedited procedures are designed to address this concern.
- **Allied concerns**: NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners may oppose NFU. Intensive consultations will be needed.

**Refinements:**

- The NFU declaration could be paired with strengthened conventional deterrence commitments (increased spending on conventional forces, forward deployment).
- The two-person rule could be expanded to include a panel (e.g., the Vice President and Speaker of the House) rather than just the Secretary of Defense, though this increases complexity.

### Bill 2: Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act

**Purpose**: To establish fiscal discipline over nuclear modernization programs, mandate independent review of the Sentinel ICBM, create a framework for CTBT ratification, and require the executive branch to pursue arms control negotiations.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, reported through the Senate Armed Services Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

**Key Provisions:**

1. **Cost Caps on Modernization Programs**: Establishes statutory cost ceilings on major nuclear modernization programs with automatic restructuring triggers.
2. **Independent Sentinel ICBM Review**: Mandates a congressionally chartered independent review of the Sentinel program.
3. **CBO Triad vs. Dyad Analysis**: Directs the Congressional Budget Office to produce a comprehensive comparison of the costs and strategic implications of the current triad versus a submarine-bomber dyad.
4. **CTBT Ratification Framework**: Establishes a process for the President to submit the CTBT to the Senate, accompanied by updated technical assessments.
5. **Arms Control Negotiation Mandate**: Requires the executive branch to pursue bilateral and multilateral arms control negotiations and report to Congress on progress.

**Draft Text:**

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To establish cost controls on nuclear weapons modernization programs,
to require an independent review of the Sentinel ICBM program, to
establish a framework for ratification of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and to mandate pursuit of nuclear arms
control agreements.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Nuclear Modernization Oversight and
Arms Control Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Congressional Budget Office estimated in October 2023 that
the United States will spend $756,000,000,000 on nuclear forces over
the period 2023-2032, a 37 percent increase over its 2021 estimate for
a comparable period.
(2) The total cost of modernizing the nuclear triad, including
delivery systems, warheads, command and control, and infrastructure, is
estimated at $1,500,000,000,000 to $2,000,000,000,000 over 30 years.
(3) The Sentinel ICBM program experienced a Nunn-McCurdy cost
breach in January 2024, with estimated costs rising from
$96,000,000,000 to over $140,000,000,000.
(4) The United States has not ratified the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), despite maintaining a testing
moratorium since 1992 and despite the fact that the Stockpile
Stewardship Program has successfully maintained the arsenal without
nuclear explosive testing for over 30 years.
(5) As of February 2026, there is no binding nuclear arms control
agreement between the United States and any other nuclear-armed state,
the first time since 1972 that such a void has existed.
(6) Effective congressional oversight and fiscal discipline are
essential to ensuring that nuclear modernization programs serve
strategic requirements rather than institutional or industrial
interests.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) MAJOR NUCLEAR MODERNIZATION PROGRAM.--The term "major nuclear
modernization program" means the LGM-35A Sentinel ICBM program, the
Columbia-class SSBN program, the B-21 Raider program, the Long-Range
Standoff Weapon (LRSO) program, and any warhead life extension or
modification program with a total estimated cost exceeding
$5,000,000,000.
(2) PROGRAM ACQUISITION UNIT COST.--The term "program acquisition
unit cost" has the meaning given in section 4351 of title 10, United
States Code.
(3) INDEPENDENT REVIEW PANEL.--The term "Independent Review Panel"
means the panel established under section 5 of this Act.

SEC. 4. COST CAPS ON NUCLEAR MODERNIZATION PROGRAMS.

(a) COST CEILINGS.--The Secretary of Defense shall establish a cost
ceiling for each major nuclear modernization program, based on the most
recent Selected Acquisition Report or equivalent cost estimate as of
the date of enactment.
(b) RESTRUCTURING TRIGGER.--If the program acquisition unit cost of
any major nuclear modernization program exceeds its cost ceiling by
more than 15 percent, the Secretary of Defense shall:
    (1) notify the congressional defense committees within 30 days;
    (2) submit a restructuring plan within 120 days that identifies
    cost reduction measures, schedule adjustments, or reductions in
    quantity; and
    (3) certify that the restructured program remains essential to
    national security, with an explanation of why alternatives are
    insufficient.
(c) CANCELLATION THRESHOLD.--If the program acquisition unit cost
of any major nuclear modernization program exceeds its cost ceiling by
more than 25 percent, no further funds may be obligated for the
program until Congress enacts a specific authorization for its
continuation based on the restructuring plan submitted under
subsection (b)(2).
(d) ANNUAL REPORTING.--The Secretary of Defense shall include in
the annual budget submission a consolidated accounting of costs for all
major nuclear modernization programs, with comparison to cost ceilings
and projections of total lifecycle costs.

SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT SENTINEL ICBM REVIEW.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is hereby established an Independent
Review Panel on the Sentinel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile
Program (in this section referred to as the "Panel").
(b) COMPOSITION.--The Panel shall consist of 7 members, appointed

    program;
    (3) alternatives to the Sentinel program, including:
        (A) further life extension of the Minuteman III;
        (B) a reduced ICBM force (fewer than 400 missiles);
        (C) a mobile ICBM option;
        (D) elimination of the land-based leg and transition to a
        submarine-bomber dyad; and
    (4) the implications of each alternative for deterrence,
    strategic stability, arms control, and allied extended deterrence.
(e) REPORT.--Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment,
the Panel shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report
containing its findings and recommendations.

to any person or circumstance, shall not be affected.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Section 4** establishes real cost discipline by creating automatic restructuring requirements at 15% overruns and a hard stop at 25% overruns, requiring specific congressional reauthorization.
- **Section 5** creates a genuinely independent review panel with no conflicts of interest (no current or recent DoD, DOE, or contractor employees), ensuring that the Sentinel assessment is not conducted by the organizations that benefit from the program's continuation.
- **Section 6** fills an analytical gap by directing the CBO (the most trusted nonpartisan fiscal analyst) to compare the triad and dyad.
- **Section 7** creates a structured process for CTBT ratification rather than leaving it to presidential discretion.
- **Section 8** mandates arms control engagement, addressing the concern that the executive branch will let arms control atrophy without congressional pressure.

**Potential Challenges:**

- **Executive prerogative**: The arms control mandate may face objections that treaty negotiations are an executive function. The bill frames the requirement as a mandate to pursue negotiations, not to reach a specific outcome, which is within Congress's authority.
- **Sentinel constituency**: The ICBM constituency in Congress will resist the independent review. Bipartisan composition of the panel and the inclusion of continuation as a possible outcome (not just cancellation) may mitigate opposition.
- **CTBT politics**: The Senate rejected the CTBT in 1999, and ratification requires 67 votes. The framework provision does not guarantee ratification but creates the conditions for a serious debate.

**Refinements:**

- The cost cap mechanism could include a "break glass" provision for genuine national emergencies, with expedited congressional review.
- The arms control mandate could be strengthened by conditioning a portion of nuclear modernization funding on certification that the executive branch is actively pursuing negotiations.

## State Model Legislation

*Nuclear weapons policy is exclusively a federal domain. There is no role for state legislation in nuclear force structure, arms control, or nuclear use authority. However, states and localities can pass non-binding resolutions expressing their positions on nuclear policy, as the "Back from the Brink" campaign has demonstrated in over 70 jurisdictions.*

---

## Regulatory Framework

### NNSA Governance Reform

**Existing Authority**: The NNSA was established by the National Nuclear Security Administration Act (Title XXXII of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, 50 U.S.C. 2401 et seq.) as a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy.

**Proposed Regulatory Actions:**

- **Project management standards**: The NNSA Administrator should issue a directive requiring all major construction and warhead programs to comply with GAO-identified best practices for cost estimation, schedule management, and risk assessment.
- **Independent cost estimates**: Require all NNSA programs exceeding $1 billion to undergo independent cost estimation by an entity outside the NNSA (e.g., the Institute for Defense Analyses or the CBO).
- **Workforce planning**: Require NNSA to publish a 10-year workforce plan addressing the skills gap in weapons science, pit production, and facility management.

### NC3 Cybersecurity Standards

**Existing Authority**: DoD Instruction 8500.01 (Cybersecurity), National Security Presidential Memoranda on NC3.

**Proposed Regulatory Actions:**

- **Mandatory red-team assessments**: Require annual red-team cyber assessments of all NC3 systems, with results reported to the congressional defense committees.
- **Air-gap requirements**: Require that the most critical NC3 decision-support systems be air-gapped from external networks.
- **Vulnerability disclosure**: Establish a classified vulnerability disclosure program for NC3 systems.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commander-in-Chief Authority vs. Congressional War Powers**

The central constitutional question is whether Congress can constrain the President's authority to order a nuclear first strike. The Constitution assigns the war declaration power to Congress (Article I, Section 8, Clause 11) while making the President commander-in-chief (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1). The proposed legislation navigates this tension by:

- Applying restrictions only to first use, not retaliation, avoiding the strongest argument that the President must be able to respond immediately to an attack.
- Using the spending power (prohibiting use of appropriated funds for unauthorized first strikes) rather than directly commanding the President, a mechanism with precedent in the Boland Amendments and other funding restrictions on military operations.
- Preserving the President's authority to act within congressionally authorized parameters and in self-defense.

The Supreme Court has not definitively resolved the scope of the President's authority to initiate nuclear war, but lower courts and legal scholars have generally held that the war declaration power is not a nullity and that Congress can limit the President's authority to initiate hostilities.

**Treaty Power and the CTBT**

The CTBT provisions in the Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act direct the President to submit the treaty to the Senate but cannot compel ratification. The Senate retains its constitutional prerogative to provide or withhold advice and consent. The framework provision is designed to create the conditions for a serious debate, not to circumvent the Senate's role.

### Preemption Questions

Nuclear weapons policy is exclusively federal. The Atomic Energy Act and the supremacy clause (Article VI) preempt any state regulation of nuclear weapons. The proposed legislation does not raise preemption issues.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Two-person rule**: Enforced through the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Military officers who carry out a nuclear launch order that lacks the required concurrence would be subject to court-martial.
- **Congressional authorization requirement**: Enforced through the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341), which prohibits the obligation of funds in excess of or without appropriation. Violation is a criminal offense.
- **Cost caps**: Enforced through the existing Nunn-McCurdy framework (10 U.S.C. 4371-4375) as strengthened by Section 4 of the proposed legislation.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Section 7 annual report**: Creates an ongoing accountability mechanism for NC3 and sole authority procedures.
- **Arms control reporting**: The 180-day reporting cycle in Section 8 of the second bill ensures ongoing congressional oversight of negotiation progress.
- **Independent Sentinel review**: The 18-month timeline for the panel report creates a forcing function for a decision on the ICBM mission.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Definitional evasion of "first use" | The President could argue that a preemptive strike against an adversary believed to be preparing a nuclear attack is "retaliatory" rather than "first use," circumventing the two-person rule. | Critical |
| Secretary of Defense as rubber stamp | The two-person rule depends on the Secretary of Defense being willing to exercise independent judgment. A pliant Secretary could concur automatically. | High |
| Classification of employment guidance | The requirement for an "unclassified summary" could be satisfied with a vague document that provides little meaningful information. | Medium |
| Emergency authority workaround | The expedited procedures for congressional authorization could be manipulated by declaring a crisis and pressuring Congress for immediate authorization. | Medium |
| Appointment of compliant SecDef | A President could appoint a Secretary of Defense specifically chosen for willingness to concur with any nuclear use decision. | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No mechanism to assess presidential fitness | The act does not address scenarios where the President is mentally incapacitated or under extreme duress. | The 25th Amendment addresses incapacity but has never been invoked against a sitting President's wishes. |
| NFU is declaratory only | An adversary may not believe the NFU declaration, and the U.S. could reverse the policy through a new presidential directive. | Declaratory policy is not legally binding on future administrations without a treaty or constitutional amendment. |
| Does not address tactical nuclear weapons in Europe | The act focuses on strategic nuclear use but does not specifically address NATO nuclear sharing arrangements. | NATO nuclear sharing involves complex alliance politics that may require separate negotiations. |
| No provision for de-alerting | The act does not mandate changes to the alert status of ICBMs or other forces. | De-alerting is an operational decision that may be better addressed through executive action or the defense authorization process. |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Define "first use" narrowly**: Amend Section 3(1) to specify that "first use" includes any use of nuclear weapons unless the United States has already sustained a nuclear detonation on its territory, armed forces, or treaty allies. This closes the "preemptive retaliation" loophole.
2. **SecDef independence provisions**: Add a provision requiring that the Secretary of Defense's concurrence be accompanied by a written legal opinion from the DoD General Counsel confirming the lawfulness of the proposed use.
3. **Employment guidance specificity**: Amend Section 7(b) to require the unclassified summary to include specific categories of information (e.g., whether launch-on-warning is included, whether countervalue targeting is authorized).
4. **Senate confirmation hearings**: Encourage the Senate Armed Services Committee to question Secretary of Defense nominees on their commitment to independent judgment under the two-person rule.

### Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Cost cap gaming | The DoD could restructure program accounting to shift costs outside the "major nuclear modernization program" category, artificially keeping unit costs below the cap. | High |
| Review panel stacking | Despite conflict-of-interest provisions, panel members could be selected for known sympathies toward the ICBM mission. | Medium |
| CTBT submission without advocacy | The President could submit the CTBT to the Senate as required but actively lobby against ratification, satisfying the letter of the law while defeating its intent. | Medium |
| Arms control reporting as check-the-box | The biannual reporting requirement could be satisfied with boilerplate reports that provide no meaningful information about the status of negotiations. | Medium |
| Waiver of cost caps via NDAA | Congress could override cost caps by including specific waiver language in future National Defense Authorization Acts, under pressure from defense contractors. | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Cannot compel adversary cooperation | The arms control mandate requires the U.S. to pursue negotiations but cannot compel Russia or China to participate. | Arms control is inherently bilateral or multilateral; unilateral mandates have limited effect. |
| CBO analysis may not be definitive | Reasonable experts disagree on the deterrence value of ICBMs; the CBO analysis may not resolve the debate. | The strategic rationale for ICBMs involves qualitative judgments that resist quantitative analysis. |
| 18-month timeline may be too slow | If the Sentinel program continues spending at its current rate, hundreds of millions of dollars will be obligated during the review period. | Congressional review processes are slow relative to acquisition spending rates. |
| No provision for workforce transition | Eliminating or reducing the ICBM program would affect thousands of jobs in missile states; the bill does not address economic transition. | Economic transition planning requires separate legislation or executive action. |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-gaming provision**: Add a provision requiring the Comptroller General to certify that the cost accounting for each major nuclear modernization program is consistent with historical practice and does not artificially exclude costs.
2. **Panel selection transparency**: Require that the names and qualifications of all panel nominees be published 30 days before appointment, with a public comment period.
3. **Spending pause during review**: Add a provision limiting Sentinel program spending to the current rate of obligation (no new production or facility construction) during the 18-month review period.
4. **Economic transition fund**: Authorize a $500 million fund for economic transition assistance to communities affected by ICBM force reductions, including retraining, infrastructure, and economic development grants.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Executive branch may resist implementation | Include congressional subpoena authority for review panel; require Inspector General oversight of compliance |
| Partisan dynamics may block passage | Frame reforms as pro-military (modernization cost control) and pro-deterrence (rational decision-making) rather than as disarmament |
| Classification barriers limit oversight | Expand the membership of classified briefings to all members of the Armed Services Committees, not just subcommittee chairs |
| Defense contractor lobbying | Require disclosure of all lobbying contacts related to nuclear modernization programs |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The Independent Sentinel Review Panel is self-terminating (18-month mandate).
- The cost cap mechanism is ongoing and applies to all future nuclear programs meeting the threshold.
- The arms control reporting requirement continues indefinitely, creating sustained congressional engagement.
- Congress should conduct a comprehensive review of both acts five years after enactment to assess effectiveness and make adjustments.
