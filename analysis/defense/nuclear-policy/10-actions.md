# Nuclear Policy: Actions

## Overview

Nuclear policy has historically been shaped by a small elite of officials, military leaders, and defense intellectuals with minimal public input. Yet public engagement has proven decisive at key moments: the Nuclear Freeze movement of the 1980s helped create the political conditions for the INF Treaty, and public opposition to atmospheric testing drove the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963. Citizen action on nuclear policy is both possible and necessary.

## Individual Actions

### Educate Yourself

- **Read the basics**: Start with the Arms Control Association's factsheets ([armscontrol.org](https://www.armscontrol.org)) and the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Notebook ([fas.org](https://fas.org)) to understand the current arsenal, modernization programs, and arms control status.
- **Understand the money**: Review the Congressional Budget Office's nuclear cost estimates to understand how much of your tax dollars go to nuclear weapons.
- **Use visualization tools**: NUKEMAP ([nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap)) helps make the abstract consequences of nuclear weapons concrete by showing blast, fallout, and casualty estimates for any city.
- **Follow expert analysis**: Subscribe to *Arms Control Today*, the *Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists*, and the Ploughshares Fund's *Press the Button* podcast for ongoing coverage.

### Contact Your Representatives

Nuclear policy decisions are made by Congress and the President. Direct constituent pressure matters, particularly on issues where most members of Congress have not formed strong positions.

**Key asks for your members of Congress:**

- **Support sole authority reform**: Ask your representative and senators to co-sponsor legislation requiring a two-person rule for nuclear first use (e.g., the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act).
- **Demand independent Sentinel review**: Ask your members to support an independent review of the Sentinel ICBM program's cost, schedule, and strategic rationale.
- **Support arms control funding**: Ask your members to fully fund the State Department's arms control and nonproliferation bureaus and support diplomatic engagement with Russia and China.
- **Support CTBT ratification**: Ask your senators to support bringing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty to the floor for a ratification vote.
- **Ask for hearings**: Request that members of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations/Affairs Committees hold public hearings on nuclear strategy and modernization.

**How to contact:**

- Phone your representatives' offices (the most effective individual action). Find contact information at [congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov).
- Write letters (physical letters carry more weight than email).
- Attend town halls and ask questions about nuclear policy.
- Request meetings with staff who handle defense and foreign policy.

### Vote and Engage in Elections

- Ask candidates about their positions on nuclear weapons policy during debates, town halls, and candidate forums.
- Support candidates who advocate for arms control, sole authority reform, and nuclear risk reduction.
- Encourage local party organizations to include nuclear policy in their platforms.

### Support Organizations

Financial contributions and volunteer time sustain the organizations that advocate for nuclear risk reduction and arms control. See the organizations table below.

### Spread Awareness

- Share information about nuclear policy with your community, including social media, community groups, and faith organizations.
- Organize or attend film screenings of documentaries like *Command and Control* or *Countdown to Zero*.
- Invite speakers from arms control organizations to local events, universities, or houses of worship.

## Community and Group Actions

### Form or Join a Local Chapter

Several national organizations have local chapters or affiliates:

- **Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR)**: Local chapters of physicians and health professionals advocating against nuclear weapons.
- **Beyond the Bomb**: A grassroots campaign organizing communities to push for sole authority reform and nuclear risk reduction.
- **Council for a Livable World**: Supports pro-arms-control candidates and organizes constituent engagement.
- **Back from the Brink**: A coalition campaign organizing cities, states, and faith communities to call for U.S. nuclear policy reform, including NFU, sole authority reform, and ending the ICBM program.

### Pass Local Resolutions

The "Back from the Brink" campaign has successfully passed resolutions in over 70 cities, counties, and states calling on the federal government to adopt specific nuclear policy reforms. These resolutions do not change federal law but demonstrate public support and create pressure on elected officials.

**Model resolution elements:**

- Call for No First Use policy.
- Support sole authority reform.
- Demand an independent review of the Sentinel ICBM program.
- Urge CTBT ratification.
- Call for resumption of arms control negotiations.

### Engage Faith Communities

Many religious denominations have official positions opposing nuclear weapons or calling for disarmament:

- The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has called nuclear deterrence morally unjustifiable.
- The United Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America have passed resolutions supporting nuclear disarmament.
- Interfaith organizations like *Faithful America* and the *National Council of Churches* have supported nuclear risk reduction.

### Academic and Professional Engagement

- **Scientists and engineers**: Join the Union of Concerned Scientists or the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to contribute technical expertise to nuclear policy debates.
- **Lawyers**: The Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy provides legal analysis of nuclear weapons issues, including the legality of nuclear threats and the obligations under the NPT.
- **Physicians and health professionals**: International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW, Nobel Peace Prize 1985) and its U.S. affiliate Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) provide health-focused advocacy.
