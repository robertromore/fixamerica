# Nuclear Policy: Root Causes

## Why Nuclear Risks Persist

Despite the end of the Cold War, the reduced size of arsenals, and widespread understanding of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear use, the risk of nuclear war has arguably increased in the 21st century. This is not an accident of history but the result of identifiable structural, political, and institutional factors that perpetuate dangerous policies and resist reform.

## Root Cause 1: Revival of Great Power Competition

The return of great power rivalry between the United States, Russia, and China has destroyed the cooperative security framework that enabled arms control progress in the 1990s and 2000s.

**How this perpetuates nuclear risk:**

- **Threat inflation**: Each power cites the other's modernization to justify expanding its own arsenal, creating a self-reinforcing cycle. China points to U.S. missile defense expansion; Russia points to NATO enlargement and U.S. conventional superiority; the United States points to Chinese and Russian buildups.
- **Diplomatic breakdown**: The deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the escalating U.S.-China strategic competition over Taiwan have made arms control negotiations politically toxic in all three capitals.
- **Zero-sum framing**: Nuclear policy is increasingly treated as a scorecard of relative power rather than a shared interest in survival. Proposals for arms control are dismissed as naive or as concessions to adversaries.

**Evidence:**

- Russia's suspension of New START participation in February 2023, explicitly linking arms control to the broader geopolitical conflict over Ukraine.
- China's refusal to engage in arms control negotiations, arguing that the U.S. and Russia must reduce first, while simultaneously building toward a peer-level arsenal.
- The 2022 Nuclear Posture Review's explicit framing of the challenge of deterring "two nuclear peers" simultaneously.

## Root Cause 2: Erosion of the Arms Control Framework

The systematic dismantlement of arms control treaties since 2002 has removed the guardrails that constrained arsenals, provided transparency, and built confidence.

**How this perpetuates nuclear risk:**

- **No verification**: Without treaty-mandated inspections and data exchanges, each side must rely on national technical means (intelligence) to assess the other's forces, increasing uncertainty and the potential for worst-case planning.
- **No limits**: For the first time since 1972, there are no binding constraints on U.S. or Russian strategic arsenals, creating the conditions for a new arms race.
- **Norm erosion**: Each treaty withdrawal weakened the broader norm that nuclear arsenals should be limited by agreement. The NPT's Article VI disarmament commitment appears increasingly hollow.
- **Institutional atrophy**: The arms control bureaucracy within the State Department and DoD has shrunk as there are fewer agreements to implement, reducing the government's capacity to negotiate new ones.

**Key timeline:**

| Year | Treaty Lost | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| 2002 | ABM Treaty | Unconstrained missile defense; Russia pursues exotic delivery systems |
| 2019 | INF Treaty | Russia deploys SSC-8; U.S. develops ground-launched missiles |
| 2020 | Open Skies | Reduced transparency over military activities |
| 2023 | New START suspended | No inspections or data exchanges |
| 2026 | New START expired | No bilateral nuclear limits of any kind |

## Root Cause 3: Modernization Momentum and Industrial Inertia

The nuclear weapons enterprise generates powerful institutional and economic incentives to sustain and expand programs, independent of strategic necessity.

**How this perpetuates nuclear risk:**

- **Bureaucratic self-perpetuation**: The NNSA, the three weapons laboratories (LANL, LLNL, Sandia), and USSTRATCOM have institutional interests in maintaining a large, modern arsenal. Their budgets, personnel, and organizational purpose depend on it.
- **Contractor lock-in**: Once a major program enters the engineering and manufacturing development phase, the prime contractor (e.g., Northrop Grumman for Sentinel, General Dynamics for Columbia-class) builds political constituencies in key congressional districts. The Sentinel program involves over 10,000 jobs across multiple states.
- **Congressional politics**: ICBM silos are distributed across Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Colorado, and Nebraska, giving senators and representatives from those states a direct interest in continuing the land-based missile mission regardless of strategic merit.
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: After billions have been spent on a program, arguments to continue it ("we've already invested too much to stop") overwhelm cost-benefit analysis. The Sentinel program's Nunn-McCurdy breach in 2024, with costs rising from $96 billion to $140+ billion, did not lead to cancellation but to certification and continuation.
- **"Modernization" as default**: The framing of programs as "replacement" or "modernization" of existing systems makes them appear routine, obscuring the fact that each new system typically has expanded capabilities that can be destabilizing.

**Evidence:**

- The Congressional Budget Office's 2023 estimate that nuclear forces will cost $756 billion over FY2023-FY2032, a 37% increase over its 2021 estimate.
- The Sentinel ICBM program's Nunn-McCurdy breach and subsequent certification despite a roughly 50% cost increase.
- The consistent bipartisan support for nuclear modernization spending in Congress, even as other defense programs face scrutiny.

## Root Cause 4: Sole Presidential Launch Authority

The unrestricted authority of a single individual to order a nuclear strike is not a product of constitutional design but of Cold War-era emergency procedures that were never subjected to democratic deliberation.

**How this perpetuates nuclear risk:**

- **No legal check**: The President can order a nuclear launch at any time, for any reason, without consulting Congress, the courts, the Secretary of Defense, or any other official. The Secretary of Defense's role is to verify the President's identity and transmit the order, not to approve it.
- **Speed over deliberation**: The command and control system is designed to compress decision-making to minutes, driven by the scenario of a bolt-from-the-blue ICBM attack. This leaves no time for the kind of deliberation that decisions of civilizational consequence require.
- **First-strike option**: Because the current posture includes the option to use nuclear weapons first (including preemptively), sole authority means one person can initiate a nuclear war, not merely respond to one.
- **Human factors**: The President is a human being subject to stress, fatigue, cognitive bias, mental health crises, and political pressure. There is no mechanism to assess whether a President is capable of making a rational nuclear decision in the moment of crisis.

**Historical context:**

- During the Watergate crisis, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger reportedly instructed the Joint Chiefs to route any nuclear launch order through him, an extralegal measure that highlights the system's vulnerability.
- In 2017-2018, concerns about President Trump's temperament led Senator Edward Markey and Representative Ted Lieu to introduce the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act, which would have required a congressional declaration of war before a nuclear first strike.

## Root Cause 5: Emerging Technology Threats to Strategic Stability

New technologies are undermining the assumptions on which nuclear deterrence has rested for decades.

**How this perpetuates nuclear risk:**

- **Hypersonic weapons**: Hypersonic glide vehicles and cruise missiles (e.g., Russia's Avangard and Zircon, China's DF-ZF) compress warning times and may be difficult to distinguish from nuclear-armed systems, increasing the risk of misinterpretation.
- **Cyber vulnerabilities**: Nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) systems are increasingly networked and digitized. A cyber attack on early warning systems could produce false indications of an incoming strike, or could disrupt communication during a crisis, leading to unauthorized or inadvertent launch.
- **Anti-satellite weapons**: Both Russia and China have demonstrated the ability to destroy satellites in orbit. Because U.S. early warning depends heavily on space-based infrared sensors, the destruction of these satellites during a crisis could blind the United States at the worst possible moment.
- **Artificial intelligence**: AI-enabled analysis of satellite imagery and signals intelligence could enable an adversary to locate and target mobile launchers or submarines, threatening the survivability that underpins second-strike deterrence.
- **Dual-capable systems**: Missiles and aircraft that can carry either conventional or nuclear warheads create ambiguity. An adversary seeing a conventional strike may assume it is nuclear, triggering escalation.

**Evidence:**

- Russia's deployment of the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle in December 2019.
- China's test of a fractional orbital bombardment system (FOBS) with a hypersonic glide vehicle in July 2021, described by General Mark Milley as "very close to a Sputnik moment."
- Multiple U.S. government reports highlighting cyber vulnerabilities in NC3 systems, including a 2018 GAO report finding cybersecurity weaknesses in every weapon system tested.

## Root Cause 6: China's Strategic Opacity

China's refusal to engage in arms control negotiations and its lack of transparency about nuclear doctrine and force structure create dangerous uncertainty.

**How this perpetuates nuclear risk:**

- **Worst-case planning**: Without reliable information about China's intentions, the United States and its allies default to worst-case assumptions, driving more spending and more aggressive postures.
- **No communication channels**: Unlike the U.S.-Russia relationship, which developed extensive crisis communication mechanisms over decades, the U.S.-China nuclear relationship lacks hotlines, incidents-at-sea agreements, or regular strategic stability dialogues specific to nuclear weapons.
- **Doctrinal ambiguity**: China officially maintains a No First Use policy, but U.S. analysts question whether this would hold under extreme circumstances (e.g., a conventional attack threatening regime survival). The lack of transparency makes it impossible to assess Chinese nuclear decision-making with confidence.
- **Rapid buildup**: The pace and scale of China's nuclear expansion (potentially tripling its arsenal within a decade) outstrips any previous buildup outside of the early Cold War, creating pressure for the United States to respond with its own increases.

## Root Cause 7: Political Dysfunction and the Absence of Public Engagement

Nuclear policy is made by a small elite with minimal democratic input, public debate, or congressional oversight.

**How this perpetuates nuclear risk:**

- **Expert monopoly**: Nuclear strategy is treated as a highly technical domain accessible only to specialists, insulating it from broader democratic deliberation.
- **Bipartisan consensus on spending**: Nuclear modernization enjoys rare bipartisan support, which means neither party has an incentive to challenge the consensus or offer alternatives.
- **Public disengagement**: After the end of the Cold War, public attention to nuclear issues declined dramatically. The nuclear freeze movement of the 1980s, which mobilized millions, has no modern equivalent.
- **Classification**: The pervasive classification of nuclear policy information limits what Congress and the public can know, making informed democratic oversight difficult.
- **Campaign silence**: Nuclear policy rarely features in presidential campaigns or congressional elections, removing electoral accountability from the equation.

**Evidence:**

- The Nuclear Posture Review is produced by the executive branch with minimal congressional input, and Congress rarely holds substantive hearings on nuclear strategy.
- Public opinion polls consistently show that Americans oppose the use of nuclear weapons in most scenarios, yet this preference has little influence on policy.
- A 2019 University of Maryland poll found that only 33% of Americans could correctly identify the approximate size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
