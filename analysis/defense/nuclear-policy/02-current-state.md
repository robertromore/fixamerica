# Nuclear Policy: Current State

## The U.S. Nuclear Arsenal

The United States maintains a nuclear arsenal of approximately 3,748 total warheads in the stockpile, of which roughly 1,700 are deployed on strategic delivery systems. The arsenal is organized around the nuclear triad, with each leg providing distinct survivability and response characteristics.

### Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs)

The land-based leg consists of 400 Minuteman III ICBMs deployed across three missile wings at F.E. Warren AFB (Wyoming), Malmstrom AFB (Montana), and Minot AFB (North Dakota). An additional 50 silos are maintained in "warm" status without missiles. Each Minuteman III carries a single warhead (W78 or W87) following "de-MIRVing" under START I.

The Minuteman III entered service in 1970 and has been sustained through multiple life extension programs. The Air Force maintains these missiles on continuous alert, capable of launch within minutes of a presidential order.

| ICBM Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Missile Type | LGM-30G Minuteman III |
| Deployed Missiles | 400 |
| Total Silos | 450 |
| Warhead Types | W78 (335 kt), W87-0 (300 kt) |
| Range | ~8,000 miles (13,000 km) |
| Operational Since | 1970 |
| Planned Replacement | LGM-35A Sentinel |

**Sentinel Replacement Program**: The LGM-35A Sentinel, developed by Northrop Grumman, is the planned replacement for the Minuteman III. The program was restructured in January 2024 after a Nunn-McCurdy cost breach, with estimated costs rising from $96 billion to over $140 billion. The program remains in the engineering and manufacturing development phase, with initial operational capability (IOC) delayed to the early 2030s. The cost overrun triggered a mandatory certification review under 10 U.S.C. 2433a, and the Secretary of Defense certified the program as essential to national security in July 2024.

### Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs)

The sea-based leg is widely considered the most survivable component of the triad. The U.S. Navy operates 14 Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), each carrying up to 20 Trident II D5 SLBMs. Under New START counting rules, missiles were downloaded to carry fewer warheads than their maximum capacity.

| SLBM Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Submarine Class | Ohio-class (SSBN-726) |
| Number of SSBNs | 14 (typically 12 operational) |
| Missiles per Submarine | 20 Trident II D5 |
| Warhead Types | W76-1 (90 kt), W88 (455 kt) |
| W76-2 (Low-Yield) | ~25 deployed (8 kt) |
| Trident II D5 Range | ~7,000 miles (11,300 km) |
| Operational Since | 1981 (Ohio-class) |
| Planned Replacement | Columbia-class (SSBN-826) |

The W76-2 low-yield warhead, deployed beginning in 2020, provides a sub-strategic option from the submarine force. Its deployment was controversial, with critics arguing it lowers the threshold for nuclear use.

**Columbia-Class Replacement Program**: The Columbia-class SSBN, built by General Dynamics Electric Boat, is the Navy's top acquisition priority. The lead boat, USS *District of Columbia* (SSBN-826), began construction in 2024. The program is estimated to cost approximately $128 billion for 12 submarines. The transition from Ohio to Columbia is critically path-dependent: the first Columbia must enter patrol by 2031 to prevent a gap in at-sea deterrent coverage as Ohio-class boats retire.

### Strategic Bombers

The air-breathing leg provides the most flexible and recallable component of the triad. Currently, nuclear-capable bombers include approximately 46 B-52H Stratofortress aircraft (of 76 total in the fleet) and 20 B-2A Spirit stealth bombers.

| Bomber Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| B-52H (nuclear-capable) | ~46 aircraft |
| B-2A Spirit | 20 aircraft |
| B-21 Raider (in development) | First flight December 2023 |
| Nuclear Weapons (Bombers) | B61-12 gravity bomb, AGM-86B ALCM |
| Planned Cruise Missile | Long-Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO/AGM-181A) |

The B-52H has been in service since 1961 and is expected to fly until the 2050s following re-engining with Rolls-Royce F130 engines under the Commercial Engine Replacement Program. The B-2A provides penetrating stealth capability but its small fleet size limits its contribution.

**B-21 Raider**: Northrop Grumman's B-21 Raider conducted its first flight in November 2023. The Air Force plans to procure at least 100 B-21s, which will replace the B-2A and eventually assume the penetrating bomber nuclear mission. The program remains classified in many details, but initial operational capability is projected for the late 2020s.

**Long-Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO)**: The AGM-181A LRSO, developed by Raytheon, will replace the aging AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missile. It will be carried by both the B-52H and B-21, providing a nuclear-armed standoff capability.

### Warhead Modernization and Life Extension Programs

The NNSA maintains the nuclear stockpile without underground testing through the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. Major ongoing warhead programs include:

| Program | Description | Status | Estimated Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| B61-12 Life Extension Program | Consolidates four B61 variants into one guided bomb | Production ongoing | ~$12 billion |
| W76-2 Modification | Low-yield SLBM warhead | Deployed since 2020 | ~$90 million |
| W80-4 (for LRSO) | Warhead for new cruise missile | Development phase | ~$15 billion |
| W87-1 (for Sentinel) | New warhead for Sentinel ICBM using new plutonium pit | Development phase | ~$15+ billion |
| W93 (for Trident II/UK) | New SLBM warhead, joint with UK | Early development | TBD |
| Plutonium Pit Production | Restoring capability to produce 80+ pits/year | Construction at LANL and SRS | ~$18-24 billion |

The plutonium pit production mission is among the most technically challenging and expensive components of the modernization program. NNSA plans to produce pits at two sites: Los Alamos National Laboratory (30+ pits/year) and the Savannah River Plutonium Processing Facility in South Carolina (50+ pits/year). Both programs face significant schedule risk, with the Savannah River facility not expected to reach full production until the late 2030s at the earliest.

## Nuclear Posture Review

The 2022 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), released as part of the broader National Defense Strategy, reaffirmed the role of nuclear weapons as the "ultimate backstop" to deter strategic attack. Key findings and policies include:

- **Fundamental Role**: The NPR declared that the "fundamental role" of U.S. nuclear weapons is to deter nuclear attack, a narrower formulation than "sole purpose" but broader than prior reviews that emphasized a wider range of deterrence missions.
- **No First Use Rejected**: The Biden administration considered but rejected adopting a No First Use (NFU) policy, citing allied concerns and the threat environment.
- **Triad Reaffirmed**: All three legs of the triad were affirmed as necessary, and all modernization programs were continued.
- **China as a Factor**: For the first time, the NPR explicitly addressed the challenge of deterring two nuclear-armed peer adversaries (Russia and China) simultaneously.
- **Integrated Deterrence**: The NPR emphasized integrating nuclear and conventional capabilities as part of a broader deterrence framework.

## Arms Control Status

The arms control framework that constrained U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals for decades is in severe distress.

### Treaty Status

| Treaty/Agreement | Status | Key Provisions |
|---|---|---|
| New START (2010) | Expired February 2026 | Limited deployed strategic warheads to 1,550; deployed delivery vehicles to 700 |
| INF Treaty (1987) | U.S. withdrew August 2019 | Prohibited ground-launched missiles with ranges of 500-5,500 km |
| ABM Treaty (1972) | U.S. withdrew June 2002 | Limited ballistic missile defense systems |
| Open Skies Treaty (2002) | U.S. withdrew November 2020 | Allowed unarmed aerial observation flights |
| CTBT (1996) | Signed but not ratified by U.S. | Comprehensive ban on nuclear explosive testing |
| TPNW (2021) | U.S. has not signed | Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |

**New START Expiration**: New START, the last remaining bilateral nuclear arms control agreement between the United States and Russia, was extended for five years in February 2021. Russia suspended its participation in the treaty's inspection and data exchange provisions in February 2023, and the treaty expired in February 2026 without a successor agreement. This marks the first time since 1972 that there is no binding limit on U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals.

**Implications of Arms Control Collapse**: Without treaty constraints, both the United States and Russia are free to increase deployed warheads, upload additional warheads onto existing delivery vehicles, and develop new types of strategic weapons without verification or transparency requirements. The loss of on-site inspections eliminates the primary mechanism for building confidence in force posture and intentions.

### China's Nuclear Expansion

The People's Republic of China is undertaking the most significant nuclear buildup of any country since the Cold War. Key developments include:

- **Arsenal Growth**: The DoD estimates China's stockpile has grown from approximately 200 warheads in 2019 to roughly 500 in 2024, and projects it will exceed 1,000 by 2030 and potentially reach 1,500 by 2035.
- **Silo Construction**: Satellite imagery revealed the construction of approximately 350 new ICBM silos in western China (at Yumen, Hami, and Ordos) beginning in 2021.
- **MIRVing**: China is deploying multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) on its DF-5B and DF-41 ICBMs, significantly increasing warhead capacity per missile.
- **Triad Development**: China has deployed the JL-3 SLBM on Type 094A SSBNs and is developing the next-generation Type 096 SSBN. It has also assigned a nuclear mission to the H-6N bomber with an air-launched ballistic missile.
- **Launch-on-Warning**: The DoD assesses that China may be moving toward a launch-on-warning posture, increasing the risk of miscalculation.
- **No Arms Control**: China has refused to participate in any bilateral or trilateral nuclear arms control negotiations, arguing that its arsenal is far smaller than those of the U.S. and Russia and that the two larger powers should reduce first.

## NNSA Budget and Infrastructure

The National Nuclear Security Administration, a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy, manages the nuclear weapons complex.

### NNSA Weapons Activities Budget

| Fiscal Year | Weapons Activities Budget | Change from Prior Year |
|---|---|---|
| FY2021 | $15.3 billion | +7.6% |
| FY2022 | $16.5 billion | +7.8% |
| FY2023 | $17.7 billion | +7.3% |
| FY2024 | $19.1 billion | +7.9% |
| FY2025 (Request) | $20.4 billion | +6.8% |

The NNSA weapons activities budget has grown at approximately 7-8% annually, roughly double the rate of overall defense spending growth. This sustained increase reflects the convergence of multiple warhead programs, infrastructure recapitalization, and plutonium pit production.

### Key NNSA Facilities

| Facility | Location | Primary Mission |
|---|---|---|
| Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) | New Mexico | Weapons design, plutonium science, pit production |
| Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) | California | Weapons design, stockpile stewardship |
| Sandia National Laboratories | New Mexico, California | Non-nuclear components, systems engineering |
| Pantex Plant | Texas | Warhead assembly/disassembly |
| Y-12 National Security Complex | Tennessee | Uranium processing, secondaries |
| Kansas City National Security Campus | Missouri | Non-nuclear components manufacturing |
| Savannah River Site | South Carolina | Tritium production, future pit production |
| Nevada National Security Site | Nevada | Subcritical experiments, readiness |

Many NNSA facilities date to the Manhattan Project and Cold War era, with significant deferred maintenance. The NNSA's "Program of Record" envisions spending over $200 billion on weapons activities over the next decade.

## Nuclear Command and Control (NC3)

The Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) system is the network of sensors, communication links, and command posts that enable the President to authorize nuclear use and transmit orders to forces. Key elements include:

- **Early Warning**: Space-based infrared satellites (SBIRS/Next-Gen OPIR), ground-based radar (PAVE PAWS, upgraded early warning radars), and NORAD's Cheyenne Mountain Complex.
- **Command Centers**: The National Military Command Center (Pentagon), the Airborne Command Post (E-6B Mercury "Looking Glass"), and USSTRATCOM headquarters at Offutt AFB.
- **Communications**: A mix of satellite, ground-based, and airborne systems designed to survive a nuclear attack, including the AEHF satellite constellation and the very low frequency TACAMO (Take Charge and Move Out) system.
- **Decision Timeline**: In a scenario involving incoming ICBMs, the President would have approximately 10-15 minutes to assess the warning, deliberate, and issue launch orders. For SLBMs launched from closer range, the timeline could be as short as 5-7 minutes.

NC3 modernization is a priority, with the DoD investing in next-generation satellites, resilient communications, and cybersecurity. However, concerns persist about the vulnerability of legacy systems to cyber attack, electromagnetic pulse, and anti-satellite weapons.
