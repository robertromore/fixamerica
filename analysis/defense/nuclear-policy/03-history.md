# Nuclear Policy: History

## The Dawn of the Nuclear Age (1939-1949)

### The Manhattan Project

The United States developed nuclear weapons through the Manhattan Project, a secret wartime program initiated in 1942 under the direction of General Leslie Groves and scientific lead J. Robert Oppenheimer. The project culminated in the Trinity test on July 16, 1945, at Alamogordo, New Mexico, the first detonation of a nuclear device.

On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped a uranium-235 bomb ("Little Boy") on Hiroshima, Japan, killing approximately 80,000 people instantly and over 140,000 by the end of 1945. On August 9, a plutonium-239 bomb ("Fat Man") was dropped on Nagasaki, killing approximately 40,000 instantly and 70,000 by year's end. Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945.

### Early Efforts at Control

The immediate postwar period saw a brief window of opportunity for international control. The Baruch Plan (1946), presented to the United Nations by the United States, proposed placing all nuclear materials and activities under an international authority. The Soviet Union rejected the plan, viewing it as an attempt to preserve the American nuclear monopoly under international cover.

The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) established civilian control over nuclear weapons through the newly created Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), transferring authority from the military. This act also initially restricted nuclear cooperation with foreign governments, including the United Kingdom, despite wartime collaboration.

### Soviet Breakthrough

The Soviet Union detonated its first nuclear device ("Joe-1") on August 29, 1949, ending the American monopoly four years earlier than most U.S. intelligence estimates had predicted. This event triggered an immediate debate within the Truman administration over whether to develop the hydrogen bomb, a weapon potentially hundreds of times more powerful than fission devices.

## The Thermonuclear Arms Race (1949-1962)

### The Hydrogen Bomb Decision

In January 1950, President Truman ordered the development of the hydrogen bomb over the objections of many scientists, including members of the AEC's General Advisory Committee led by Robert Oppenheimer. The United States tested its first thermonuclear device ("Ivy Mike") on November 1, 1952, yielding 10.4 megatons, roughly 700 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb. The Soviet Union followed with its own thermonuclear test in August 1953.

### Massive Retaliation and Early Strategy

The Eisenhower administration adopted the doctrine of "massive retaliation" in 1954, articulated by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. This policy threatened overwhelming nuclear response to Soviet aggression anywhere in the world, reflecting the belief that nuclear superiority could substitute for expensive conventional forces (the "New Look" defense policy).

The Strategic Air Command (SAC), under General Curtis LeMay, built a massive force of nuclear bombers that constituted the primary delivery vehicle throughout the 1950s. The Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), first developed in 1960, consolidated nuclear targeting into a single war plan that at its peak targeted thousands of aim points across the Soviet Union and China.

### The ICBM Revolution

The development of intercontinental ballistic missiles fundamentally changed nuclear strategy. The Soviet Union launched the first ICBM (R-7) in August 1957 and orbited Sputnik in October 1957, demonstrating the capability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the continental United States. The "missile gap" became a major political issue, though subsequent intelligence revealed the gap favored the United States.

The U.S. deployed its first operational ICBMs in 1959 (Atlas) and developed the solid-fueled Minuteman in 1962, which became the backbone of the land-based force. The Navy deployed the first submarine-launched ballistic missiles (Polaris A-1) in 1960, creating the sea-based leg of what would become the triad.

### The Cuban Missile Crisis

The October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis represented the closest the world has come to nuclear war. The Soviet Union secretly deployed medium-range nuclear missiles to Cuba, capable of striking most of the continental United States. President Kennedy's naval blockade and subsequent negotiations led to the withdrawal of Soviet missiles in exchange for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba and the secret removal of Jupiter missiles from Turkey.

The crisis had profound effects on nuclear policy. Both superpowers, shaken by the brink of catastrophe, established the "hotline" direct communication link in 1963 and signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) in August 1963, prohibiting nuclear tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater. The crisis also demonstrated the danger of sole presidential authority: during the crisis, decisions of existential consequence rested entirely on Kennedy's judgment, with no formal check on his power.

## Mutually Assured Destruction and Detente (1962-1979)

### MAD Doctrine

Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara formalized the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) in the 1960s. The doctrine held that stability depended on both sides maintaining a secure second-strike capability, the ability to absorb a first strike and still deliver a devastating retaliatory blow. Under this logic, missile defenses were destabilizing because they threatened to undermine the adversary's retaliatory capability.

The doctrine led to a paradoxical strategic landscape in which vulnerability was a source of stability. Both sides built arsenals far exceeding any rational military requirement, peaking at over 30,000 warheads each by the mid-1960s (U.S.) and mid-1980s (USSR).

### The Arms Control Era Begins

The first major arms control agreements emerged in the early 1970s:

- **SALT I (1972)**: The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks produced an interim agreement freezing the number of ICBM and SLBM launchers at existing levels for five years. More significantly, the talks produced the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, limiting each side to two (later one) missile defense sites, codifying the MAD framework.
- **SALT II (1979)**: Signed by Carter and Brezhnev but never ratified by the U.S. Senate (due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan), SALT II set equal ceilings on strategic delivery vehicles (2,250) and limited MIRVed missiles. Both sides informally observed its limits.

### Key Arms Control Milestones (1963-1979)

| Year | Agreement | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| 1963 | Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) | Banned atmospheric, space, and underwater nuclear testing |
| 1968 | Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) | Established nonproliferation regime; nuclear weapons states committed to disarmament |
| 1972 | ABM Treaty | Limited missile defenses to two sites each (later one) |
| 1972 | SALT I Interim Agreement | Froze ICBM and SLBM launchers at existing levels |
| 1974 | Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT) | Limited underground tests to 150 kilotons |
| 1976 | Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty | Limited peaceful nuclear explosions to 150 kt |
| 1979 | SALT II | Set equal ceilings on strategic delivery vehicles (unratified) |

### Nuclear Testing

The United States conducted 1,030 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1992, more than any other nation. Testing moved underground after the LTBT in 1963. The Nevada Test Site (now Nevada National Security Site) hosted the vast majority of tests, with early atmospheric tests also conducted in the Pacific (Bikini Atoll, Enewetak, Johnston Island) and at the Trinity site in New Mexico.

## The Late Cold War and Breakthrough (1979-1991)

### The Reagan Buildup

President Reagan entered office in 1981 with a program of nuclear expansion and modernization. Key initiatives included:

- **Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)**: Announced in March 1983, "Star Wars" envisioned a space-based missile defense system that could render nuclear weapons "impotent and obsolete." While technologically infeasible at the time, SDI accelerated Soviet concerns about an arms race they could not afford.
- **MX/Peacekeeper ICBM**: A new, accurate, MIRVed ICBM carrying 10 warheads, controversial due to its perceived first-strike capability.
- **B-1B Bomber**: A supersonic penetrating bomber to complement the aging B-52.
- **Trident II D5 SLBM**: A highly accurate submarine-launched missile that gave the sea-based force a hard-target kill capability.

### The INF Treaty (1987)

The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed by Reagan and Gorbachev on December 8, 1987, was the first treaty to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons. It banned all ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. Under the treaty, the United States destroyed 846 missiles and the Soviet Union destroyed 1,846 missiles.

### START I (1991)

The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), signed by Bush and Gorbachev on July 31, 1991, was the first treaty to mandate deep reductions in strategic nuclear arsenals. It limited each side to 6,000 accountable warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles. START I entered into force in 1994 (after the Soviet successor states of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine acceded to the NPT as non-nuclear weapons states) and was successfully implemented by 2001.

## Post-Cold War Adjustments (1991-2009)

### Arsenal Reductions

The end of the Cold War brought significant reductions in nuclear forces:

| Year | U.S. Stockpile (approx.) | Key Development |
|---|---|---|
| 1967 (Peak) | ~31,255 warheads | Peak of U.S. stockpile |
| 1991 | ~19,000 | End of Cold War |
| 2001 | ~10,500 | START I fully implemented |
| 2009 | ~5,113 | Obama disclosed stockpile number |
| 2025 | ~3,748 | Current stockpile |

The Presidential Nuclear Initiatives (PNIs) of 1991-1992, announced unilaterally by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev/Yeltsin, withdrew and eliminated thousands of tactical nuclear weapons. The United States removed all ground-launched and sea-based tactical nuclear weapons from deployment, retaining only air-delivered gravity bombs in Europe.

### START II and the Moscow Treaty

- **START II (1993)**: Signed by Bush and Yeltsin, it banned MIRVed ICBMs and would have reduced warheads to 3,000-3,500. Russia ratified it conditionally in 2000, but the U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty in 2002 prompted Russia to withdraw from START II, which never entered into force.
- **ABM Treaty Withdrawal (2002)**: President George W. Bush withdrew the United States from the ABM Treaty, citing the need for missile defense against rogue states (North Korea, Iran). Russia characterized the withdrawal as a major destabilizing step.
- **Moscow Treaty/SORT (2002)**: The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty required each side to reduce deployed strategic warheads to 1,700-2,200 by 2012. However, it contained no verification provisions and did not require warheads to be destroyed.

### Nuclear Posture Reviews

The Nuclear Posture Review became a regularized process for defining nuclear strategy:

- **1994 NPR**: The first post-Cold War review largely preserved Cold War force structure, maintaining the triad and planning for a "resurgent Russia" hedge.
- **2002 NPR**: Introduced the "New Triad" concept, integrating nuclear and conventional strike capabilities with missile defense. Controversial for expanding the potential use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear threats and "rogue states."
- **2010 NPR**: The Obama administration's review narrowed the role of nuclear weapons, pledged not to develop new nuclear warheads, and committed to seeking the "peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons." It maintained the triad but reduced the role of nuclear weapons in deterring non-nuclear threats.

### Testing Moratorium and CTBT

The United States conducted its last nuclear test on September 23, 1992. President George H.W. Bush signed a congressional moratorium on testing, which has been maintained by every subsequent president. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened for signature in 1996. President Clinton signed it, but the Senate rejected ratification in 1999 by a vote of 48-51. The United States maintains its testing moratorium as a matter of policy but is not legally bound by the CTBT.

## Recent Developments (2009-Present)

### New START (2010)

New START, signed by Obama and Medvedev on April 8, 2010, limited each side to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads and 700 deployed delivery vehicles (with up to 100 additional non-deployed launchers). It included a robust verification regime with on-site inspections and data exchanges. The treaty was extended for five years by the Biden administration in February 2021.

### The Arms Control Collapse

Beginning in the late 2010s, the arms control framework entered a period of rapid deterioration:

| Year | Event | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 2002 | U.S. withdraws from ABM Treaty | Removes missile defense constraints |
| 2019 | U.S. withdraws from INF Treaty | Eliminates ban on intermediate-range missiles |
| 2020 | U.S. withdraws from Open Skies Treaty | Reduces transparency and confidence-building |
| 2023 | Russia suspends New START participation | Halts inspections and data exchanges |
| 2026 | New START expires | No binding limits on U.S. or Russian strategic arsenals for first time since 1972 |

### Modernization Decision

Both the Obama and Trump administrations committed to comprehensive modernization of the nuclear triad. The 2015 decision to replace all three legs simultaneously, rather than extending existing systems further or eliminating one leg, locked in a spending trajectory that the Congressional Budget Office estimated at $1.5 to $2 trillion over 30 years (including delivery systems, warheads, command and control, and associated infrastructure).

### Emerging Threats

Several developments have introduced new instabilities:

- **Hypersonic Weapons**: Both Russia and China have deployed or are developing hypersonic glide vehicles and hypersonic cruise missiles that can evade current missile defense systems.
- **Cyber Threats to NC3**: The increasing digitization of nuclear command and control creates vulnerabilities to cyber attack that could affect early warning, communication, or launch systems.
- **Space-Based Threats**: Anti-satellite weapons threaten the space-based sensors and communications that underpin nuclear command and control.
- **Dual-Capable Systems**: The blurring of lines between conventional and nuclear delivery systems creates escalation risks during a conventional conflict.
