# Nuclear Policy: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes U.S. nuclear weapons policy through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Nuclear policy is unusual in that it generates alignments that cut across traditional left-right divisions: hawks in both parties support unconstrained modernization, while restraint advocates span from libertarians to progressives. The enormous costs of modernization create fiscal tensions within the right, while the tension between deterrence and disarmament divides the left. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Strong defense, peace through strength, American primacy | Full modernization, skepticism of arms control, preserve sole authority |
| Liberal | Multilateralism, risk reduction, responsible defense | Arms control renewal, transparency, cautious modernization reform |
| Progressive | Disarmament, anti-militarism, redirecting spending | Deep cuts, NFU, ICBM elimination, arms control primacy |
| Libertarian | Fiscal restraint, non-interventionism, limited government | Reduce arsenal, cut modernization costs, oppose foreign entanglements |
| Constitutionalist | Separation of powers, enumerated powers, original intent | Congressional war powers for nuclear use, treaty process fidelity |
| Populist | Economic nationalism, anti-elite, jobs and strength | Support modernization (jobs), skeptical of arms control with rivals |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, bipartisan compromise, evidence-based policy | Modernize with cost control, pursue arms control where possible |
| Religious Right | Moral responsibility, just war tradition, protecting life | Moral obligation to deter, concern about indiscriminate weapons |
| Democratic Socialist | Demilitarization, social investment, international solidarity | Deep disarmament, redirect spending to domestic programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of 2026-02-05)

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is deterrence credibility; actual motivations include defense contractor interests, ICBM-state jobs, and opposition to any constraint on executive power. |
| Principle consistency | Fiscal conservatism is inconsistently applied to nuclear spending; limited government principles are not applied to sole presidential authority over civilization-ending decisions. |
| Goalpost stability | When arms control proposals address stated concerns (verification, compliance), new objections tend to emerge (China not included, Russia untrustworthy). |
| Zero-sum behavior | Tends to view nuclear policy as zero-sum with adversaries, resisting mutual risk reduction. |

**Justification:** The conservative perspective on nuclear policy exhibits a tension between its stated principles (fiscal responsibility, limited government) and its actual positions (unlimited nuclear spending, unchecked presidential authority). On arms control, stated objections often shift, making negotiation difficult.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- The Heritage Foundation's consistent advocacy for maximum nuclear spending regardless of cost overruns, contradicting its fiscal conservatism on domestic programs.
- Senate Republicans' unified opposition to the CTBT in 1999, despite strong technical evidence that the stockpile could be maintained without testing.
- Bipartisan support for Sentinel certification after the Nunn-McCurdy breach, with conservative members leading the effort despite the 50% cost increase.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees that the arsenal exists in the described configuration and that China is expanding, but disputes the framing that arms control collapse is a problem rather than a liberation from constraints. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Rejects the analysis that modernization momentum and sole authority are "root causes" of nuclear risk. Views great power competition as the primary driver and American strength as the solution, not the problem. |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation, "The Case for a Strong Nuclear Deterrent" (2024). Argues for expanding the arsenal beyond New START levels.
- National Institute for Public Policy, Keith Payne, "Maintaining Credible Nuclear Deterrence" (2023). Defends sole authority and opposes NFU.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Arms control renewal | 2/10 | Arms control with Russia and China is futile and constrains only the U.S. | Loss of advantage; unwillingness to engage diplomatically with adversaries |
| No First Use | 1/10 | NFU invites conventional aggression and undermines extended deterrence | Preserving maximum presidential flexibility; alliance management |
| Sole authority reform | 2/10 | Any constraint on the President weakens deterrence | Protecting executive power as a principle; distrust of congressional involvement |
| Modernization cost control | 3/10 | Cost overruns should be managed but programs must not be cut | Defense contractor interests; ICBM-state jobs |
| CTBT ratification | 2/10 | U.S. may need to resume testing; CTBT is unverifiable | Desire to maintain all options; opposition to multilateral constraints |
| Nuclear risk reduction | 3/10 | De-alerting undermines deterrence | Maintaining maximum readiness posture |
| Transparency | 3/10 | Too much transparency aids adversaries | Maintaining information advantage; limiting public debate |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act | 1/10 | Dangerous constraint on the President that invites adversary aggression | Loss of executive power; opposition to any limit on nuclear use options |
| Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act | 3/10 | Cost caps are reasonable in theory but cannot be allowed to cancel essential programs | Defense industrial base interests; opposition to arms control mandates |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Expand the nuclear arsenal to address the "two-peer problem" (deterring Russia and China simultaneously).
- Deploy the nuclear sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N) as an additional low-yield option.
- Increase missile defense investment to reduce vulnerability.
- Maintain sole presidential authority with no modifications.
- Condition any future arms control on China's participation.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Religious Right (strong defense), Populist (strength and jobs)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on cost control and modernization discipline)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Libertarian (on spending)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by risk reduction and multilateralism; may underweight deterrence credibility concerns. |
| Principle consistency | Principles of multilateralism and risk reduction are applied consistently to nuclear policy. |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are relatively stable; willing to compromise on scope and pace of reform. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Generally seeks mutual benefit through arms control rather than zero-sum outcomes. |

**Justification:** The liberal perspective applies its principles of multilateral engagement, responsible governance, and risk reduction consistently to nuclear policy. Its positions are predictable and negotiable, making it a reliable coalition partner.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Obama administration's New START negotiation and ratification (2010), consistent with stated multilateral principles.
- Biden administration's extension of New START (2021) and pursuit of the "fundamental role" formulation in the 2022 NPR, reflecting incremental but principled movement.
- Liberal think tanks (Brookings, Carnegie) consistently advocating for arms control and risk reduction across administrations.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement with the description of the arsenal, arms control collapse, and modernization costs. May place slightly more emphasis on diplomatic engagement opportunities. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agrees that arms control erosion, sole authority, and modernization momentum are significant problems. May give more weight to Russian and Chinese behavior as drivers. |

**Source references:**

- Brookings Institution, "Nuclear Weapons Policy After New START" (2025). Advocates for successor agreement and transparency measures.
- Center for American Progress, "Responsible Nuclear Policy" (2024). Supports NFU, sole authority reform, and modernization cost control.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Arms control renewal | 9/10 | Essential for managing great power competition and reducing nuclear risk | Concerned about verification and enforcement mechanisms |
| No First Use | 7/10 | Supports in principle but sensitive to allied concerns | Wants NFU paired with strengthened conventional deterrence |
| Sole authority reform | 8/10 | Two-person rule is a reasonable and necessary safeguard | Wants to ensure reform does not undermine deterrence credibility |
| Modernization cost control | 8/10 | Modernization should be disciplined and sized to strategic need | Supports some modernization but wants cost accountability |
| CTBT ratification | 9/10 | Long overdue; strengthens nonproliferation regime | Concerned about Senate arithmetic for 67-vote threshold |
| Nuclear risk reduction | 8/10 | De-alerting, crisis communication, and confidence-building are important | Wants measures to be reciprocal where possible |
| Transparency | 8/10 | Democratic accountability requires informed public debate | Recognizes some information must remain classified |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act | 8/10 | Supports the two-person rule, NFU, and transparency provisions | Wants to ensure allied consultations precede implementation |
| Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act | 8/10 | Supports cost caps, independent Sentinel review, and CTBT framework | Wants to ensure arms control mandate is strong enough to be effective |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Pair NFU with a conventional deterrence enhancement package to address allied concerns.
- Pursue informal reciprocal restraint with Russia while pursuing a formal successor to New START.
- Increase funding for the State Department arms control bureau.
- Strengthen the NPT review process and engage with the TPNW states.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Centrist (pragmatic reform), Progressive (on arms control and NFU)
- **Potential bridges:** Constitutionalist (on war powers), Libertarian (on cost control)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative hawks, Populist (on arms control)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by disarmament, human security, and redirecting military spending to domestic needs. |
| Principle consistency | Anti-militarism and social investment principles are applied uniformly; no inconsistency between nuclear and conventional spending positions. |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are clear and stable: reduce arsenals, adopt NFU, eliminate ICBMs, ratify CTBT, and redirect savings. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Does not view nuclear policy as zero-sum between nations; views nuclear weapons as a collective threat to humanity. |

**Justification:** The progressive perspective on nuclear policy is the most internally consistent of all nine perspectives. Its positions follow directly from its principles, and its proposals are specific and stable.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Rep. Ro Khanna and Sen. Ed Markey have consistently introduced legislation to reduce nuclear spending, adopt NFU, and reform sole authority.
- The Union of Concerned Scientists and Ploughshares Fund (aligned with progressive policy) have maintained consistent positions for decades.
- Progressive Caucus budget proposals consistently redirect nuclear spending to domestic priorities.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with the analysis of the arsenal, arms control collapse, and modernization costs. Would emphasize humanitarian and environmental consequences more. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agrees that modernization momentum, sole authority, and arms control erosion are root causes. Would add military-industrial complex influence as a more central factor. |

**Source references:**

- Union of Concerned Scientists, "Rethinking Land-Based Nuclear Missiles" (2020). Analysis of ICBM strategic rationale.
- Ploughshares Fund, "Nuclear Spending vs. Human Needs" (2024). Comparative spending analysis.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Arms control renewal | 10/10 | Essential and urgent; should pursue multilateral disarmament | Wants to go further than bilateral agreements toward global elimination |
| No First Use | 10/10 | Overdue and essential; no legitimate reason to use nuclear weapons first | None; fully aligned with progressive principles |
| Sole authority reform | 10/10 | No individual should have this power; supports multiple checks | Would prefer even stronger constraints than the two-person rule |
| Modernization cost control | 10/10 | Massive waste; redirect savings to healthcare, education, climate | Would cancel rather than merely cap several programs |
| CTBT ratification | 10/10 | Should have been ratified decades ago | None |
| Nuclear risk reduction | 9/10 | Supports all risk reduction measures | Wants de-alerting to be more comprehensive |
| Transparency | 10/10 | Full transparency is essential for democratic accountability | Challenges the extent of justified classification |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act | 9/10 | Strong support; would prefer even stronger constraints on first use | Views the bill as a good first step but insufficient without deeper cuts |
| Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act | 8/10 | Supports but would go further on cost caps and wants Sentinel cancellation, not just review | Concerned the review process may be co-opted by the defense establishment |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Cancel the Sentinel ICBM outright and transition to a submarine-bomber dyad.
- Reduce deployed warheads to 1,000 unilaterally as a trust-building measure.
- Sign and ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).
- Redirect $50+ billion annually from nuclear programs to domestic priorities.
- Establish a Department of Peace to lead nuclear disarmament efforts.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist (on disarmament and spending redirection), Liberal (on arms control)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on spending cuts), Constitutionalist (on war powers)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Religious Right, Populist

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by fiscal restraint and skepticism of government power; consistent with broader libertarian philosophy. |
| Principle consistency | Limited government and fiscal restraint are applied consistently to nuclear policy, unlike the conservative perspective. |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are stable and principled; willing to accept deterrent minimum. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Does not view nuclear policy as zero-sum; favors mutual disengagement. |

**Justification:** The libertarian perspective applies its principles of limited government and fiscal restraint consistently to nuclear policy, creating a coherent position that favors a smaller, less expensive deterrent. Its consistency makes it a predictable negotiating partner on cost-related issues.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- The Cato Institute's consistent advocacy for reduced nuclear spending and a restrained foreign policy.
- Libertarian criticism of both sole presidential authority (unchecked government power) and unlimited nuclear spending (fiscal irresponsibility).
- Rand Paul and other libertarian-leaning senators have questioned nuclear modernization costs.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agrees with the factual description of the arsenal and costs. Would emphasize the fiscal burden and question the necessity of extended deterrence commitments. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agrees that modernization momentum and government bureaucracy drive unnecessary spending. Disagrees with framing that arms control is the solution; prefers unilateral restraint. |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute, "Rethinking the Nuclear Triad" (2023). Argues for a smaller, submarine-focused force.
- Reason Foundation, analysis of defense spending waste in nuclear programs.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Arms control renewal | 4/10 | Skeptical of international agreements that constrain sovereignty | Prefers unilateral action to treaties |
| No First Use | 6/10 | Generally supportive as it limits government war-making power | Prefers to reduce the arsenal rather than adopt declaratory policies |
| Sole authority reform | 7/10 | No single person should have unchecked power over anything | Supports constraining government power broadly |
| Modernization cost control | 9/10 | Massive waste of taxpayer money; eliminate unnecessary programs | Fiscal restraint is a core principle |
| CTBT ratification | 5/10 | Mixed; supports the moratorium but skeptical of treaties | Sovereignty concerns vs. practical benefits |
| Nuclear risk reduction | 6/10 | Supports reducing dangerous postures; opposes expansive government programs | Prefers simple, unilateral measures over complex international arrangements |
| Transparency | 7/10 | Government secrecy enables waste and abuse | Supports transparency as a check on government |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act | 6/10 | Supports constraining presidential power; mixed on declaratory policy | Prefers simpler legislative approaches |
| Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act | 7/10 | Supports cost caps and independent review; skeptical of arms control mandate | Prefers cutting programs outright to creating new oversight bureaucracies |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Reduce the arsenal to a minimum deterrent (500-1,000 warheads) based on submarines alone.
- Cancel the Sentinel ICBM and the LRSO cruise missile.
- Withdraw from extended deterrence commitments that require maintaining a large arsenal.
- Reduce NNSA budget by 30% through program consolidation.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on spending cuts), Democratic Socialist (on reducing military footprint)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on fiscal discipline), Constitutionalist (on limited government)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (on defense jobs), Religious Right (on strong defense)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by constitutional fidelity and separation of powers. |
| Principle consistency | The principle that Congress must authorize war is applied uniformly, including to nuclear first strikes. |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are anchored in constitutional text and do not shift with political circumstances. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Does not view nuclear policy as zero-sum; views it through the lens of proper constitutional process. |

**Justification:** The constitutionalist perspective provides the strongest and most consistent support for congressional authorization of nuclear first use. Its positions are derived directly from constitutional text and are not subject to political variation.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Constitutional scholars across the political spectrum (Bruce Ackerman, John Yoo's critics) have argued that first use of nuclear weapons requires congressional authorization.
- The War Powers Resolution itself reflects the constitutionalist principle that Congress must authorize hostilities.
- Constitutionalist support for sole authority reform does not vary based on which party holds the presidency.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees with the factual description but is primarily concerned with the constitutional framework, not the strategic details. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Strongly agrees that sole presidential authority and the erosion of congressional war powers are root causes. Less focused on arms control or modernization dynamics. |

**Source references:**

- Ackerman, Bruce. "The Emergency Constitution." *Yale Law Journal* 113 (2004). Argues for constitutional constraints on emergency executive power.
- Fisher, Louis. *Presidential War Power*. University Press of Kansas, 2013. Comprehensive analysis of congressional war authorization requirements.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Arms control renewal | 5/10 | Treaties must go through the Article II treaty process; supports the process but is neutral on specific content | Concerned about executive agreements that bypass the Senate |
| No First Use | 6/10 | Supports as a matter of constitutional principle (first use is an act of war requiring congressional authorization) | Framing matters: prefers congressional authorization requirement over executive declaratory policy |
| Sole authority reform | 9/10 | Congress has the sole power to declare war; nuclear first use is the most consequential act of war | Constitutional text is unambiguous |
| Modernization cost control | 6/10 | Congress's power of the purse gives it authority and responsibility to control spending | Process-focused rather than outcome-focused |
| CTBT ratification | 7/10 | Supports the treaty ratification process being followed properly; the Senate should vote | Cares more about proper process than the specific outcome |
| Nuclear risk reduction | 5/10 | Operational decisions are executive prerogatives within congressionally authorized parameters | Supports congressional oversight but respects executive operational authority |
| Transparency | 7/10 | Congressional access to information is essential for oversight | Classification cannot be used to prevent Congress from exercising its constitutional functions |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act | 8/10 | Strong support for Section 6 (congressional authorization for first strike); supports Section 5 (two-person rule) as a statutory safeguard | Would prefer to ground the bill more explicitly in Article I war powers |
| Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act | 6/10 | Supports congressional oversight provisions; neutral on arms control mandate specifics | Concerned that the arms control mandate may improperly direct executive foreign policy functions |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Amend the War Powers Resolution to explicitly include nuclear first use as requiring congressional authorization.
- Require the President to report to Congress before any change in nuclear alert status.
- Establish a Joint Congressional Committee on Nuclear Weapons with ongoing oversight authority.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (on war powers), Progressive (on constraining executive power)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on limited government), Conservative (on originalist constitutional interpretation)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (often supports strong executive), those who view constitutional process as impediment

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is strength and jobs; actual motivations are heavily influenced by partisan alignment and anti-establishment sentiment. |
| Principle consistency | Economic nationalism is applied inconsistently; supports nuclear spending as jobs program while opposing other government spending. |
| Goalpost stability | Positions shift based on which party holds the presidency and which elites are seen as supporting or opposing nuclear programs. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Strongly zero-sum; views arms control as giving away American advantage. |

**Justification:** The populist perspective on nuclear policy is the least consistent, driven more by partisan dynamics and anti-establishment sentiment than by stable principles. This makes it an unpredictable negotiating partner.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Populist support for Trump's withdrawal from the INF Treaty and Open Skies Treaty contrasted with populist criticism of Obama's arms control efforts, suggesting position is driven by partisan alignment rather than principle.
- Support for nuclear modernization as a jobs and strength program while opposing federal spending in other domains.
- Hostility toward arms control "elites" and international institutions, regardless of the specific proposal.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that America needs a strong nuclear arsenal and that China is a threat. Disputes any framing that suggests the U.S. arsenal is "too large" or that modernization is excessive. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 2/10 | Rejects most root cause analysis. Views the problem as adversary aggression, not American policy choices. The "nuclear weapons establishment" framing contradicts populist anti-elite instincts but the establishment here is aligned with strength. |

**Source references:**

- Trump administration's 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, which expanded the role of nuclear weapons and introduced the W76-2 low-yield warhead.
- Populist media support for "peace through strength" nuclear posture.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Arms control renewal | 2/10 | Can't trust Russia or China; deals benefit adversaries | Anti-establishment; views diplomats as naive |
| No First Use | 1/10 | Shows weakness; invites aggression | Strength as identity; opposition to constraint |
| Sole authority reform | 2/10 | The President must be strong and unconstrained | Varies by which party holds presidency |
| Modernization cost control | 4/10 | Supports American jobs and strength; some waste concern | Jobs in missile states outweigh fiscal concerns |
| CTBT ratification | 2/10 | Constrains America while others cheat | Anti-international institution sentiment |
| Nuclear risk reduction | 3/10 | De-alerting shows weakness | Strength signaling |
| Transparency | 4/10 | Supports knowing what government does; opposes revealing to adversaries | Mixed: anti-secrecy but pro-strength |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act | 2/10 | Ties the President's hands; weakens America | Position may shift if a distrusted President holds office |
| Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act | 3/10 | Some cost oversight is fine but cannot weaken the military or pursue futile arms control | Jobs and strength outweigh fiscal concerns |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Build more nuclear weapons to ensure overwhelming American superiority.
- Deploy new types of tactical nuclear weapons for regional deterrence.
- Demand that allies pay more for the nuclear umbrella.
- Condition any arms control on adversaries making the first concession.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative hawks (on strength), Religious Right (on defending the nation)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on pragmatic modernization)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Libertarian (on arms control and spending)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by pragmatic risk management and bipartisan solutions. |
| Principle consistency | Applies cost-benefit analysis and evidence-based reasoning consistently. |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are relatively stable and open to compromise. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Seeks mutual benefit; willing to accept imperfect solutions. |

**Justification:** The centrist perspective is pragmatic and predictable. Its positions are based on cost-benefit analysis and risk management rather than ideology, making it the most flexible coalition partner.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan support for New START extension in 2021 from centrist members of both parties.
- Centrist think tanks (CSIS, RAND) consistently produce analysis that weighs costs and benefits rather than adopting ideological positions.
- Centrist members of Congress have supported both modernization and arms control, depending on the merits.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement with the factual analysis, including the costs, the arms control collapse, and the China challenge. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agrees with most root cause analysis, particularly modernization momentum and the need for cost discipline. May weight adversary behavior more than the analysis does. |

**Source references:**

- CSIS, "The Future of U.S. Nuclear Deterrence" (2024). Balanced analysis of modernization and arms control.
- RAND Corporation, various reports on nuclear strategy and cost analysis.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Arms control renewal | 7/10 | Supports pursuing agreements but realistic about prospects | Wants verifiable, enforceable agreements |
| No First Use | 5/10 | Open to the concept but concerned about allied reactions and timing | Would support if paired with conventional deterrence strengthening |
| Sole authority reform | 7/10 | Two-person rule is reasonable and does not undermine deterrence | Wants to ensure the mechanism is practical in crisis scenarios |
| Modernization cost control | 9/10 | Cost discipline is essential; taxpayers deserve accountability | Core centrist principle: efficient government spending |
| CTBT ratification | 7/10 | Supports ratification with appropriate safeguards | Wants updated technical assessments to address Senate concerns |
| Nuclear risk reduction | 7/10 | Practical risk reduction measures make sense | Wants reciprocal measures where possible |
| Transparency | 7/10 | Informed public debate is important for democratic governance | Accepts reasonable classification of sensitive details |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act | 6/10 | Supports two-person rule and transparency; cautious on NFU declaration | Wants NFU phased in after allied consultation |
| Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act | 8/10 | Strong support for cost caps, independent review, and CBO analysis | This is exactly the kind of evidence-based, accountable governance centrists favor |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Phase in NFU after completing allied consultations and conventional deterrence enhancements.
- Pursue informal reciprocal restraint with Russia as a stepping stone to a formal agreement.
- Support the Sentinel review but remain open to all outcomes (continuation, modification, or cancellation).
- Increase investment in NC3 modernization and cybersecurity as a bipartisan priority.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (on pragmatic reform), Constitutionalist (on process)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on cost discipline), Libertarian (on fiscal restraint)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (ideological), Democratic Socialist (on scope of reform)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is moral responsibility and just war doctrine; actual positions often align with conservative hawkish consensus. |
| Principle consistency | Just war criteria (proportionality, discrimination, last resort) should logically lead to support for NFU and restrictions on nuclear use, but political alignment with conservatives overrides in practice. |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are moderately stable but influenced by conservative coalition dynamics. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Mixed; moral framework suggests mutual concern, but political alignment encourages zero-sum framing. |

**Justification:** The religious right's moral framework contains genuine tension with nuclear policy. Just war tradition argues against indiscriminate weapons and disproportionate force, which should lead to support for nuclear restraint. However, political alignment with the conservative movement and prioritization of strong national defense often override these moral conclusions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' consistent position that nuclear deterrence is morally acceptable only as a transitional strategy toward disarmament, a position largely ignored by politically conservative Catholic voters.
- Evangelical leaders have generally aligned with the conservative hawkish position on nuclear policy despite theological commitments to peacemaking.
- The Vatican's signing of the TPNW contrasts with the American religious right's support for nuclear modernization.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees with factual description; interprets through moral framework. Concerned about the scale of destruction nuclear weapons can cause. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Partially agrees that sole authority over weapons of mass destruction raises moral concerns. Disagrees with framing that modernization is excessive; views strong defense as a moral duty. |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Arms control renewal | 4/10 | Supports peace but skeptical of agreements with untrustworthy adversaries | Aligned with conservative skepticism of arms control |
| No First Use | 4/10 | Just war doctrine supports restraint, but NFU may weaken deterrence | Moral framework supports it; political alignment opposes it |
| Sole authority reform | 5/10 | Moral weight of nuclear decision argues for deliberation, but President must be strong | Genuinely torn between moral and political commitments |
| Modernization cost control | 5/10 | Stewardship of resources is a moral duty; defense of nation is also a duty | Balances fiscal stewardship with defense support |
| CTBT ratification | 4/10 | Opposes testing (protecting God's creation) but skeptical of treaties | Mixed: environmental morality vs. political alignment |
| Nuclear risk reduction | 5/10 | Supports measures that reduce risk of indiscriminate destruction | Genuine moral concern about accidental nuclear war |
| Transparency | 5/10 | Transparency is a moral good; national security requires some secrecy | Moderate support |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act | 4/10 | Moral framework supports deliberation on nuclear use; political alignment opposes constraints | Internal tension between just war tradition and conservative alliance |
| Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act | 5/10 | Fiscal stewardship is valued; defense is a priority | Supportive of oversight but reluctant to cut programs |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Establish a moral advisory panel on nuclear policy, including religious leaders.
- Ensure that targeting guidance excludes civilian population centers (consistent with just war discrimination).
- Increase humanitarian assistance and diplomacy funding as complement to deterrence.
- Support nuclear risk reduction measures that protect innocent life.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on strong defense), Populist (on national protection)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on risk reduction and humanitarian concerns), Centrist (on pragmatic reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (on disarmament scope), Democratic Socialist (on military spending)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by demilitarization, social investment, and international solidarity. |
| Principle consistency | Opposition to military spending and support for social programs are applied uniformly; no inconsistency in nuclear policy positions. |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are clear: dramatically reduce or eliminate nuclear weapons and redirect spending. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Views nuclear weapons as a collective threat; does not apply zero-sum framing between nations. |

**Justification:** The democratic socialist perspective is highly consistent in applying its principles to nuclear policy. Its positions are clear, stable, and derived directly from its core values of demilitarization and social investment.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Sen. Bernie Sanders has consistently voted against nuclear modernization spending increases.
- Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) platform calls for nuclear disarmament and redirection of military spending.
- International socialist and social democratic parties in Europe (e.g., Labour's historical unilateralist faction) have maintained consistent anti-nuclear positions.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with the analysis, particularly the cost figures, the arms control collapse, and the risks of modernization. Would emphasize opportunity cost (spending on weapons vs. social needs) more. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with the military-industrial complex analysis and modernization momentum. Would center the defense contractor profit motive more prominently. |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Arms control renewal | 9/10 | Essential step toward disarmament | Wants arms control as a stepping stone, not an endpoint |
| No First Use | 10/10 | Nuclear weapons should never be used first, period | Fully aligned with anti-militarist principles |
| Sole authority reform | 10/10 | No individual should wield this power; democratic control is essential | Would prefer even stronger democratic checks |
| Modernization cost control | 10/10 | Cancel most modernization; redirect to healthcare, housing, education | Views modernization as corporate welfare for defense contractors |
| CTBT ratification | 10/10 | Essential for global disarmament | Fully aligned |
| Nuclear risk reduction | 9/10 | Supports all measures that reduce the chance of nuclear use | Wants comprehensive de-alerting |
| Transparency | 10/10 | Full transparency; nuclear secrecy serves corporate and military interests | Challenges the legitimacy of most nuclear classification |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act | 9/10 | Strong support for all provisions; would go further | Views it as a necessary but insufficient step |
| Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act | 8/10 | Supports cost caps and review but wants outright cancellation of Sentinel | Concerned the review process may delay necessary cancellations |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Unilaterally reduce the arsenal to 500 warheads and challenge other states to match.
- Cancel all three legs of modernization and maintain existing systems at lower readiness.
- Sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
- Redirect $100+ billion annually to a Green New Deal, universal healthcare, and public housing.
- Establish a Global Nuclear Disarmament Fund supported by nuclear-armed states.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on disarmament and spending redirection), Libertarian (on spending cuts)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on arms control and risk reduction), Constitutionalist (on democratic accountability)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Populist, Religious Right

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Sole authority reform | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Religious Right | Conservative, Populist |
| Modernization cost control | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right, Constitutionalist | None (though scope varies widely) |
| Arms control renewal | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist | Libertarian | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right |
| CTBT ratification | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Religious Right | Conservative, Populist |
| No First Use | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist | Centrist, Religious Right | Conservative, Populist |
| Transparency | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Populist, Religious Right | Conservative |

**Key insight:** Sole authority reform and modernization cost control have the broadest potential coalitions (6-7+ perspectives with scores of 5 or higher). Arms control and NFU face stronger opposition from the right but still command majority support. The most viable path forward sequences cost control and sole authority reform first, building momentum for arms control and NFU.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Cost-Controlled Modernization with Independent Review*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Libertarian + Centrist + Constitutionalist

**Core Agreement:** Nuclear forces should be modernized to maintain deterrence, but taxpayer money must be spent responsibly with genuine independent oversight. No program should continue on autopilot regardless of cost overruns.

**Policy Description:**

Enact the cost cap and independent review provisions of the Nuclear Modernization Oversight and Arms Control Act without the arms control mandate or CTBT provisions. Establish statutory cost ceilings on all major nuclear programs with automatic restructuring at 15% overruns and congressional reauthorization at 25%. Charter the independent Sentinel review panel. Direct CBO to compare triad and dyad options.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Programs continue; review may validate the triad and Sentinel |
| Liberal | Cost discipline and independent analysis create accountability |
| Libertarian | Fiscal restraint applied to the largest defense programs |
| Centrist | Evidence-based decision-making; bipartisan cost control |
| Constitutionalist | Congressional power of the purse exercised responsibly |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Acceptance of potential program restructuring or cancellation |
| Liberal | Deferring arms control and CTBT provisions to a separate bill |
| Progressive | Accepting review rather than immediate cancellation |
| Libertarian | Accepting that programs may continue if review supports them |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (potentially 6 with Religious Right on fiscal stewardship)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Strong; cost discipline is a durable bipartisan principle
- **Implementation Path:** Attach to the annual NDAA; cost caps and CBO analysis are familiar legislative mechanisms

---

### Compromise 2: *Sole Authority Reform as Constitutional Restoration*

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Libertarian + Constitutionalist + Centrist + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** The decision to initiate nuclear war should not rest with a single individual. Congressional war powers and a two-person authorization rule are constitutional safeguards, not constraints on deterrence.

**Policy Description:**

Enact Sections 5 and 6 of the Nuclear Weapons Policy and Accountability Act (two-person rule for first use and congressional authorization for first strike) while deferring the No First Use declaration. Preserve full presidential authority for retaliation. Frame the reform as restoring the constitutional balance between Congress and the President, not as a disarmament measure.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Establishes meaningful check on nuclear first use |
| Progressive | Introduces democratic accountability to nuclear decisions |
| Libertarian | Constrains unchecked government power |
| Constitutionalist | Restores Article I war powers to nuclear policy |
| Centrist | Rational governance: major decisions should involve more than one person |
| Democratic Socialist | Democratic control over the most consequential government power |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Deferring NFU declaration |
| Progressive | Accepting a two-person rule rather than broader democratic participation |
| Constitutionalist | Accepting the spending power mechanism rather than a direct statutory prohibition |
| Conservative (if engaged) | Accepting any constraint on presidential authority |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 6/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Very strong; constitutional framing transcends partisan shifts
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone bill or NDAA amendment; framed as war powers restoration

---

### Compromise 3: *Nuclear Risk Reduction Package*

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Religious Right + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Regardless of disagreements about arsenal size or arms control, all responsible perspectives should support measures that reduce the risk of accidental, unauthorized, or inadvertent nuclear use.

**Policy Description:**

A package of executive and legislative actions: (1) require annual NC3 cybersecurity assessments reported to Congress; (2) establish or strengthen nuclear crisis communication channels with Russia and China; (3) implement transparency measures including resumed stockpile disclosure; (4) fund NC3 modernization and cyber hardening; (5) de-alert a portion of the ICBM force. These measures do not require international agreements and can be implemented unilaterally.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Concrete risk reduction without waiting for arms control |
| Progressive | Immediate steps toward reducing nuclear danger |
| Centrist | Pragmatic, evidence-based measures that improve safety |
| Constitutionalist | Congressional oversight of NC3 and nuclear procedures |
| Religious Right | Protecting innocent life by reducing accident risk |
| Democratic Socialist | First step toward broader nuclear risk reduction |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | This is not a substitute for arms control or NFU |
| Progressive | Modest scope; does not reduce arsenal size |
| Centrist | De-alerting may face opposition from USSTRATCOM |
| Religious Right | Accepting nuclear risk reduction framing rather than deterrence primacy |
| Conservative (if engaged) | Accepting de-alerting and transparency measures |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Strong; risk reduction is hard to oppose in principle
- **Implementation Path:** Executive action for some measures (communication channels, transparency); legislation for NC3 reporting and de-alerting mandate

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most realistic coalition for nuclear policy reform combines **Liberals, Centrists, Constitutionalists, and Libertarians**, supplemented by **Progressives and Democratic Socialists** on specific measures. This coalition of 6 perspectives has several advantages:

- Five of the six have engagement consistency ratings of 4 or higher, making them reliable negotiating partners.
- The coalition agrees on core principles: democratic accountability, fiscal responsibility, and evidence-based decision-making.
- The framing of nuclear reform as constitutional restoration and cost control appeals across traditional partisan lines.

### Key Obstacles

- **Conservative-Populist bloc**: The strongest opposition comes from conservatives and populists who view any constraint on nuclear capability as weakness. This bloc has enough Senate seats to block treaty ratification (which requires 67 votes) and enough influence to resist standalone legislation.
- **Defense contractor lobbying**: The $1.5-2 trillion modernization program generates powerful industry opposition to cost caps or program restructuring. Contractor influence is concentrated in key committees and states.
- **Executive resistance**: Every administration resists constraints on presidential authority. Executive opposition will be strong regardless of party.
- **Allied pressure**: NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners will push back on NFU and may resist de-alerting, requiring intensive consultation.

### Low Consistency Partners

The **Populist perspective (2/5)** and the **Conservative and Religious Right perspectives (3/5)** present challenges for coalition building. Strategies for engagement:

- **Populist**: Frame cost control as opposing waste by defense contractors (anti-elite framing). Emphasize jobs transition programs for affected communities. Avoid arms control framing.
- **Conservative**: Engage fiscal conservatives on cost discipline. Find champions among conservative members who have questioned specific programs. Emphasize that sole authority reform preserves retaliatory authority.
- **Religious Right**: Engage on the moral dimension of nuclear risk, particularly the protection of innocent life. The just war tradition provides common ground, even if political alignment resists it.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with cost control**: The strongest bipartisan case is fiscal discipline over nuclear modernization. Attach cost caps and the independent Sentinel review to the NDAA.
2. **Frame sole authority reform as constitutional**: The war powers argument is powerful and transcends partisan lines. Pair it with the retaliatory authority exemption to neutralize deterrence objections.
3. **Build the arms control case separately**: Arms control is the most divisive issue. Begin with informal reciprocal restraint and crisis communication before pursuing formal legislation.
4. **Defer NFU**: No First Use is important but politically costly. Sequence it after sole authority reform and allied consultations.
5. **Invest in public engagement**: Nuclear policy suffers from public disengagement. Build public support through transparency, education, and grassroots organizing before seeking the most ambitious legislative goals.
