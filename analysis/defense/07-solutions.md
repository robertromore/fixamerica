# Defense Policy: Solutions

## Reform Framework

Reforming the U.S. defense enterprise requires a multi-pronged approach focused on aligning resources with strategy, accelerating innovation, and investing in the all-volunteer force. The solutions below are designed to be implemented through a combination of legislative action (primarily the annual NDAA), executive branch policy changes, and internal DoD reforms.

### Guiding Principles

- **Strategy-Driven Budgeting**: The budget should follow strategy, not the other way around.
- **Speed and Adaptability**: The acquisition and personnel systems must move faster than our adversaries.
- **Fiscal Discipline**: Every dollar must be spent effectively to maximize national security output.
- **Focus on People**: The all-volunteer force is the military's greatest strategic asset and must be cultivated.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Reform the Acquisition and Budgeting Process

**Description**: Overhaul the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process to enable speed and flexibility.

**Key Components**:

- **Flexible Funding**: Create "portfolio" funding buckets that allow program managers to allocate resources across a group of related projects, rather than rigid, program-specific appropriations.
- **Agile Acquisition Pathways**: Expand the use of Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) authorities for rapid prototyping and rapid fielding, allowing new capabilities to reach warfighters in 2-5 years instead of 10-15.
- **Software-Centric Budgeting**: Create a new budget category for software development that is not tied to specific hardware platforms, allowing for continuous updates.
- **"Divest to Invest" Authority**: Give the Service Secretaries more authority to retire legacy systems and reinvest the savings into modernization priorities, with Congressional oversight.

**Evidence Base**: Successful MTA programs have fielded capabilities significantly faster than traditional acquisition. The software industry has long demonstrated the superiority of agile development over waterfall models.

**Challenges**: Overcoming bureaucratic inertia and Congressional resistance to ceding control over specific program funding.

### Solution 2: Realign Force Structure for Great Power Competition

**Description**: Restructure the military to prioritize capabilities needed for a potential conflict with a near-peer adversary like China, rather than counter-insurgency.

**Key Components**:

- **Invest in "The Small, the Smart, and the Many"**: Prioritize smaller, more numerous, and often autonomous or unmanned platforms (e.g., unmanned ships, collaborative combat aircraft) over a few large, exquisite, and vulnerable platforms.
- **Long-Range Fires**: Increase investment in long-range, precision-guided munitions, including hypersonic missiles and anti-ship missiles.
- **Resilient Logistics**: Harden the supply chains and logistics networks for a contested environment in the Indo-Pacific, including prepositioned stocks and distributed basing.
- **Space and Cyber Capabilities**: Fully fund the Space Force and Cyber Command to ensure dominance in these critical warfighting domains.

**Evidence Base**: Wargames and analysis from think tanks like CSIS and RAND consistently show that the current force structure is vulnerable in a conflict with China. The war in Ukraine has demonstrated the effectiveness of distributed systems and long-range precision fires.

**Challenges**: The high cost of new platforms and the political difficulty of retiring legacy systems with powerful constituencies.

### Solution 3: Modernize Military Personnel and Talent Management

**Description**: Reform the military's industrial-age personnel system to better recruit, retain, and manage talent in the 21st century.

**Key Components**:

- **Flexible Career Paths**: Create technical tracks that allow specialists (e.g., coders, data scientists) to advance to senior ranks without having to become generalist commanders.
- **Lateral Entry**: Allow the services to bring in mid-career professionals with critical skills at higher ranks, rather than requiring everyone to start at the bottom.
- **Modernize Compensation**: Overhaul the pay and benefits system to be more flexible and competitive with the private sector, including targeted bonuses for high-demand skills.
- **Improve Quality of Life**: Address persistent problems with military housing, childcare, and spouse employment that are major drivers of attrition.

**Evidence Base**: The military consistently loses personnel with high-tech skills to the private sector. Pilot programs for flexible career paths have shown promise.

**Challenges**: Overcoming the deeply entrenched "up-or-out" culture of the military personnel system.

### Solution 4: Strengthen Alliances and Promote Burden-Sharing

**Description**: Reinvigorate the U.S. alliance system as a core strategic advantage, while insisting on greater burden-sharing from allies.

**Key Components**:

- **NATO 2% and 20% Commitment**: Continue to press all NATO members to meet the commitment of spending 2% of GDP on defense and 20% of their defense budget on modernization.
- **Indo-Pacific Security Architecture**: Deepen security cooperation with allies like Japan, Australia, South Korea, and the Philippines, including through initiatives like AUKUS.
- **Interoperability**: Prioritize developing and procuring systems that are interoperable with key allies.
- **Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Reform**: Streamline the FMS process to make it easier for allies and partners to buy American defense equipment.

**Evidence Base**: The unified response to the war in Ukraine demonstrated the power of a strong alliance network. Allies provide critical basing, intelligence, and military capacity.

**Challenges**: Balancing U.S. leadership with demands for greater allied contributions; managing divergent strategic priorities among allies.

### Solution 5: Mandate and Empower Independent Audits and Oversight

**Description**: Strengthen financial accountability and program oversight to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse.

**Key Components**:

- **Full Audit Compliance**: Withhold a small percentage of a service's budget until it passes a full, clean financial audit (which none have yet done).
- **Empower IG and GAO**: Increase funding and authority for the DoD Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office to conduct oversight of major programs.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Require independent cost-benefit analysis for all Major Defense Acquisition Programs before they can proceed to full-rate production.

**Evidence Base**: GAO and IG reports consistently identify billions of dollars in waste and mismanagement. The DoD remains the only federal agency that has never passed a full financial audit.

**Challenges**: The sheer complexity of the DoD's finances makes a clean audit extremely difficult; political resistance to the consequences of audit findings.
