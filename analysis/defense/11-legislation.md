# Defense Policy: Legislation

## Overview

Legislative reform in defense policy is primarily channeled through the annual **National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)**, which authorizes Department of Defense (DoD) programs and sets policy, and the subsequent **Defense Appropriations Act**, which provides the actual funding. While the NDAA is a "must-pass" vehicle that ensures stability, it often reinforces the status quo through incremental adjustments rather than structural overhaul.

The legislative framework proposed here addresses the systemic challenges identified in the analysis: a slow and risk-averse acquisition system, a recruitment and retention crisis in the all-volunteer force, and the need to adapt alliances for great power competition. These proposals are designed as standalone bills that could be incorporated as major titles within an NDAA or passed separately to signal a fundamental shift in strategy. They prioritize speed, accountability, and the well-being of service members over legacy programs and bureaucratic inertia.

The three bills form an integrated reform package: the **Defense Modernization and Acquisition Reform Act** fixes the institutional machinery (how we buy and build); the **21st Century Military Personnel and Family Support Act** fixes the human capital crisis (who serves and why they leave); and the **Global Alliance and Deterrence Act** fixes the strategic framework (how we deter through allies and partnerships). Together, they represent a "Soldiers and Supply Chains" approach that leads with politically unassailable investments in people, attaches supply chain security to that momentum, and embeds acquisition reform as the mechanism that pays for both.

The existing statutory foundation includes Title 10 (Armed Forces) and Title 37 (Pay and Allowances), the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-433), the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-355), and the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. ch. 39).

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for defense reform. Congress possesses extensive authority under Article I, Section 8, Clauses 11-16 to "declare War," "raise and support Armies," "provide and maintain a Navy," "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces," and "provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia." The President holds complementary authority as Commander-in-Chief under Article II, Section 2, and the treaty power under Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 (with the advice and consent of the Senate).*

*The proposals below exercise Congress's enumerated powers to restructure the defense enterprise. While some provisions (particularly portfolio budgeting and export control exemptions) grant discretion to the executive branch, they do so within congressionally defined parameters, consistent with the constitutional framework. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 provides the foundational precedent for Congress exercising its authority to reorganize the defense establishment over executive objections.*

## Federal Legislation

The following three bills constitute an integrated defense reform package. They are presented as standalone legislation but are designed to be enacted as titles within the annual NDAA or as a coordinated legislative package. The sequencing is intentional: the Modernization Act creates the institutional reforms, the Personnel Act addresses the human capital crisis, and the Alliance Act strengthens the strategic framework.

### The Defense Modernization and Acquisition Reform Act

**Purpose**: To overhaul the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process, accelerate the fielding of new technologies, and secure the defense industrial base against supply chain vulnerabilities.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Standalone bill or Title I of an NDAA. Amends Title 10 (Armed Forces) and related acquisition statutes.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Portfolio Management**: Replaces line-item budgeting for software and rapid prototyping with portfolio-based appropriations, allowing program managers to shift funds to successful technologies without Congressional reprogramming delays.
2. **Multi-Year Procurement Expansion**: Authorizes multi-year procurement contracts for critical munitions and sub-components to provide demand certainty for the industrial base.
3. **"Valley of Death" Bridge Fund**: Establishes a revolving fund to sustain successful prototypes developed by non-traditional defense contractors while they await integration into major programs of record.
4. **Supply Chain Security**: Mandates the phasing out of all microelectronics and critical minerals sourced from strategic adversaries by 2030.
5. **Audit Penalties**: Imposes automatic budget sequestrations on DoD components that fail to achieve a clean financial audit by FY2028.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To reform the acquisition, budgeting, and industrial base policies of the Department of Defense to ensure technological superiority and fiscal accountability.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Defense Modernization and Acquisition Reform Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The current Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process, established in 1961, is ill-suited for the speed of modern technological development, often requiring 2-3 years to align funding with new requirements (PPBE Reform Commission Final Report, March 2024).
(2) The Department of Defense remains the only major federal agency that has never passed a comprehensive financial audit, with the DoD Inspector General reporting that 5 of 29 auditable entities received disclaimers of opinion in FY2023 (DoD OIG Report DODIG-2024-041).
(3) The defense industrial base lacks the surge capacity to meet the demands of a major conflict; GAO found that 67 of 82 major defense acquisition programs experienced cost overruns totaling $654 billion (GAO-24-106815).
(4) Innovative commercial technologies often fail to transition to military use due to the "valley of death" between research grants and procurement contracts, with only 14 percent of SBIR Phase II projects resulting in production contracts (RAND Corporation, RR-A1679-1, 2023).
(5) Reliance on strategic adversaries for critical minerals and microelectronics poses an unacceptable risk to national security; the USGS estimates that the United States is import-reliant for 100 percent of 12 critical minerals, many sourced primarily from China (USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries, 2024).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) PORTFOLIO BUDGETING.—The term "portfolio budgeting" means the appropriation of funds to a mission area or capability set rather than to specific line-item programs.
(2) COVERED NATION.—The term "covered nation" means the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or the Islamic Republic of Iran.
(3) NON-TRADITIONAL DEFENSE CONTRACTOR.—The term has the meaning given in section 3014 of title 10, United States Code.

SEC. 4. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET FLEXIBILITY.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Defense shall establish a portfolio budgeting framework for software, digital technology, and rapid prototyping activities.
(b) AUTHORITY.—Program executive officers managing portfolios under this section may transfer funds between projects within the same portfolio without prior congressional approval, provided that the transfer does not exceed $20,000,000.
(c) REPORTING.—The Secretary shall submit quarterly reports to the congressional defense committees detailing all fund transfers made under this authority.

SEC. 5. INDUSTRIAL BASE STABILITY.

(a) MULTI-YEAR PROCUREMENT.—Section 3501 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to authorize the Secretary to enter into multi-year contracts for the procurement of critical munitions and sub-components for periods of up to 5 years.
(b) ADVANCE PROCUREMENT.—The Secretary is authorized to use advance procurement funding to purchase long-lead items for munitions to ensure production continuity.

SEC. 6. TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION BRIDGE FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established in the Treasury a "Defense Technology Transition Fund" to support the integration of successful prototypes from non-traditional defense contractors into programs of record.
(b) ELIGIBILITY.—Projects eligible for funding must have successfully completed a prototype phase under Other Transaction Authority (OTA) or Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants.
(c) MATCHING REQUIREMENT.—To receive funding, a military service must commit to matching 50 percent of the transition costs from its own budget.

SEC. 7. SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY.

(a) PROHIBITION.—Beginning on October 1, 2030, no funds appropriated to the Department of Defense may be used to procure any major weapon system containing microelectronics or critical minerals mined, processed, or manufactured in a covered nation.
(b) WAIVER.—The Secretary may waive the prohibition in subsection (a) for a period of 1 year if the Secretary certifies to Congress that no alternative source is available and that the waiver is vital to national security.

SEC. 8. AUDIT ACCOUNTABILITY.

(a) DEADLINE.—Each military department and defense agency must achieve a clean audit opinion by September 30, 2028.
(b) PENALTY.—If a department or agency fails to achieve a clean audit by the deadline, the operation and maintenance (O&M) budget of the Office of the Secretary of that department or the Director of that agency shall be reduced by 5 percent in the subsequent fiscal year.

SEC. 9. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Secretary shall submit an annual report to Congress on the status of the industrial base, including an assessment of surge capacity for key munitions and the progress of supply chain decoupling efforts.
(b) PORTFOLIO BUDGETING REPORT.—Not later than 60 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense committees a detailed accounting of all fund transfers made under the portfolio budgeting authority in Section 4, including—
    (1) the amount of each transfer;
    (2) the originating and receiving programs;
    (3) the rationale for each transfer; and
    (4) the operational impact of each transfer.
(c) BRIDGE FUND REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering shall submit a report on the Defense Technology Transition Fund, including—
    (1) the number of projects funded;
    (2) the number of projects that achieved production contracts;

    (4) such sums as may be necessary for each fiscal year thereafter.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Moves the DoD away from industrial-age budgeting where money is locked into specific "widgets" years in advance. Portfolio budgeting allows managers to move money to what works, fostering the agility needed to counter rapidly evolving threats. The $20 million transfer cap balances flexibility with congressional oversight.
- **Section 5**: Stabilizes the industrial base by providing multi-year demand certainty. When contractors know a 5-year order is coming, they invest in production lines and hire workers. Without this, the "feast or famine" cycle continues.
- **Section 6**: Addresses the "valley of death" where innovative startups fail because they can't survive the 2-year wait for a production contract. This fund provides the bridge capital to keep them alive and integrating. The 50% matching requirement ensures the services have "skin in the game."
- **Section 7**: Secures the supply chain against adversary manipulation. A weapon system that depends on Chinese microelectronics is a weapon system that can be denied or sabotaged in a conflict.
- **Section 8**: Imposes real consequences for financial mismanagement. The DoD has promised a clean audit for decades; this provision puts leadership budgets at risk if they fail to deliver.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Portfolio Budgeting Guidance | 90 days after enactment | DoD Comptroller |
| DFARS Rulemaking (Proposed) | 180 days after enactment | Defense Acquisition Regulation Council |
| Bridge Fund Operational | FY 2027 | OUSD(R&E) |
| Multi-Year Procurement Contracts | FY 2027 | Service Acquisition Executives |
| GAO Portfolio Budgeting Review | 2 years after enactment | Comptroller General |
| Audit Deadline | Sept 30, 2028 | Service Secretaries |
| DFARS Rulemaking (Final) | 1 year after enactment | Defense Acquisition Regulation Council |
| Supply Chain Ban | Oct 1, 2030 | Acquisition & Sustainment |
| Bridge Fund Sunset Review | 5 years after enactment | Congressional Defense Committees |

**Challenges**:

- **Congressional Oversight**: Appropriators may resist portfolio budgeting as it reduces their ability to control specific line items. The defense subcommittees have historically resisted executive flexibility, viewing it as an erosion of the power of the purse.
- **Supply Chain Reality**: Decoupling from China for rare earths by 2030 is an extremely aggressive target that may require significant new mining and processing investments. The Department of Energy estimates that developing domestic rare earth processing capacity will take 7-10 years.
- **Industry Resistance**: Prime contractors benefit from the current system's barriers to entry. They may lobby against provisions that open competition to non-traditional contractors and require supply chain transparency.

**Refinements**:

- Include a "congressional veto" mechanism (joint resolution of disapproval) for portfolio transfers exceeding $50 million to assuage oversight concerns while preserving the speed advantage.
- Add a "friends-shoring" provision to the supply chain ban that allows sourcing from NTIB and Tier 1 ally nations, not just domestic production.
- Create an annual competition for the best-performing portfolio, awarding additional budget flexibility to incentivize adoption.

### The 21st Century Military Personnel and Family Support Act

**Purpose**: To address the recruitment and retention crisis by modernizing military compensation, improving housing and childcare, and creating flexible career paths for technical talent.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Standalone bill or Title II of an NDAA. Amends Title 37 (Pay and Allowances) and Title 10 (Armed Forces) personnel management chapters.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Junior Enlisted Pay Raise**: Mandates a 15% increase in basic pay for grades E-1 through E-4 to ensure no service member earns below the poverty line.
2. **Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) Restoration**: Restores BAH to cover 100% of calculated housing costs (up from 95%), eliminating out-of-pocket expenses for families.
3. **Technical Career Tracks**: Establishes a "technical warrant" track allowing cyber, space, and AI specialists to advance in rank and pay without assuming command responsibilities.
4. **Childcare Expansion**: Authorizes funding to build new Child Development Centers (CDCs) and creates a stipend for off-base childcare when on-base spots are unavailable.
5. **Spousal Employment**: Creates a federal hiring preference for military spouses and funds professional license portability compacts.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To modernize the compensation, benefits, and career management of the Armed Forces to sustain the all-volunteer force.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "21st Century Military Personnel and Family Support Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Armed Forces missed recruiting targets by approximately 41,000 service members in FY2023, the worst shortfall since the inception of the all-volunteer force in 1973 (CBO Report 59535, "The All-Volunteer Force: Issues and Challenges," January 2024).
(2) Approximately 24 percent of active-duty junior enlisted service members reported food insecurity, with an estimated 22,000 service members receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits (DoD Comptroller Report, FY2023).
(3) The shortage of affordable childcare and adequate housing is a primary driver of attrition; the DoD reported a childcare waitlist of over 9,000 families and identified over 171,000 housing units in need of repair (GAO-23-105433).
(4) The military struggles to recruit and retain technical talent due to rigid promotion timelines and compensation structures that lag behind the private sector by 25-40 percent for comparable cybersecurity and software engineering positions (RAND Corporation, RR-A1357-1, 2023).
(5) Military spouse unemployment remains at approximately 21 percent, compared with 3.6 percent nationally, undermining family economic stability and retention (Blue Star Families Annual Military Family Lifestyle Survey, 2024).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) JUNIOR ENLISTED.—The term "junior enlisted" refers to members of the uniformed services in pay grades E-1 through E-4.
(2) TECHNICAL CAREER TRACK.—The term "technical career track" means a personnel management pathway that allows for promotion based on technical proficiency rather than command potential.
(3) BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING.—The term "basic allowance for housing" has the meaning given in section 403 of title 37, United States Code.
(4) MILITARY SPOUSE.—The term "military spouse" means the husband or wife of a member of the uniformed services on active duty or a member of a reserve component in an active status.

SEC. 4. COMPENSATION REFORM.

(a) JUNIOR ENLISTED PAY RAISE.—Effective January 1, 2027, the rates of basic pay for grades E-1 through E-4 shall be increased by 15 percent.
(b) HOUSING ALLOWANCE.—Section 403 of title 37, United States Code, is amended to require that the basic allowance for housing be calculated to cover 100 percent of the national average cost of adequate housing for each pay grade.

SEC. 5. TECHNICAL CAREER MANAGEMENT.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Defense shall establish a technical career track for officers and enlisted personnel in the fields of cyber, space, artificial intelligence, and data science.
(b) PROMOTION.—Personnel in this track shall be eligible for promotion to grades up to O-6 and E-9 based on technical milestones and certifications, without the requirement to hold command positions.
(c) LATERAL ENTRY.—The Secretaries of the military departments may appoint individuals from the private sector with critical technical skills to any grade up to O-5, based on experience and qualifications.

SEC. 6. CHILDCARE AND HOUSING INVESTMENT.

(a) CHILDCARE CONSTRUCTION.—The Secretary shall carry out a program to construct, renovate, and expand Child Development Centers at military installations with the longest waiting lists.
(b) FEE ASSISTANCE.—The Secretary shall provide a monthly stipend to eligible military families to cover the difference between on-base childcare fees and the cost of off-base care when on-base care is unavailable.
(c) BARRACKS MODERNIZATION.—The Secretary shall implement a 10-year plan to replace or renovate all unaccompanied housing that fails to meet minimum privacy and condition standards.

SEC. 7. MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT.

(a) FEDERAL HIRING PREFERENCE.—The head of each executive agency shall establish a hiring preference for military spouses for positions in the competitive service at the GS-11 level and below.
(b) LICENSE PORTABILITY.—The Secretary shall establish a grant program to incentivize states to join interstate licensure compacts for healthcare, education, and legal professions that provide expedited reciprocity for military spouses.
(c) TELEWORK.—The Secretary shall ensure that all DoD civilian positions that can be performed remotely are designated as eligible for telework to facilitate military spouse employment continuity during permanent change of station (PCS) moves.

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

The Secretary shall submit an annual report to Congress on:
(1) The impact of pay raises on recruitment and retention rates, disaggregated by service and pay grade.
(2) The number of personnel accessed through lateral entry and technical tracks, including retention rates compared to traditional accession cohorts.
(3) The status of childcare waiting lists and housing condition assessments at each installation.
(4) Military spouse unemployment rates and utilization of the federal hiring preference.
(5) The number and types of professional licenses granted through interstate compacts funded under this Act.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $4,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 for pay and allowance increases;
    (2) $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 for childcare and housing construction;
    (3) $6,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (4) $7,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (5) $7,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (6) $8,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Addresses the "poverty draft" criticism and ensures that military service is economically viable for young Americans. Restoring 100% BAH removes a hidden tax on military families that has driven attrition among junior NCOs.
- **Section 5**: Allows the military to compete for talent. A cyber expert shouldn't have to leave the keyboard to command a unit just to get a promotion. The lateral entry provision is modeled on successful programs in the British and Australian armed forces.
- **Section 6**: Treats childcare as a readiness issue. If a soldier can't find childcare, they can't deploy or train effectively. The 9,000-family waitlist is a direct threat to force readiness.
- **Section 7**: Addresses the 21% military spouse unemployment rate that makes military families economically fragile and drives mid-career attrition. License portability compacts enable spouses to continue working after each PCS move.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Pay Raise Effective | Jan 1, 2027 | DFAS |
| BAH Restoration | Jan 1, 2027 | DFAS |
| Technical Track Implementation Plan | 1 year after enactment | Service Secretaries |
| Lateral Entry Pilot Launch | 18 months after enactment | Service Secretaries |
| Childcare Construction Plan | 180 days after enactment | DoD Installations |
| Spouse License Portability Grants | 1 year after enactment | OSD P&R |
| Barracks Renovation 10-Year Plan | 1 year after enactment | Service Secretaries |

**Challenges**:

- **Cost**: The pay raise and housing allowance restoration are expensive recurring costs estimated at $4-6 billion annually that will compete with modernization funding. CBO projections suggest this could require either topline increases or offsets from legacy program cuts.
- **Cultural Resistance**: Traditionalists in the military may resist lateral entry and technical tracks as undermining the "warrior culture." The services have historically been slow to embrace alternative career paths, as seen with the limited adoption of the 2019 NDAA's direct commissioning authorities.
- **Implementation Complexity**: Coordinating across DFAS (pay), the services (career tracks), and installation commands (housing/childcare) requires sustained senior leadership attention that may compete with operational priorities.

**Refinements**:

- Phase the pay raise over 2 years (8% in Year 1, 7% in Year 2) to reduce budget shock and allow for adjustment.
- Create a pilot program for lateral entry limited to 100 billets per service before expanding, allowing the services to develop appropriate evaluation criteria.
- Tie childcare construction funding to a competitive application process that prioritizes installations with the longest waitlists and highest attrition rates.

### The Global Alliance and Deterrence Act

**Purpose**: To strengthen U.S. alliances, streamline security cooperation, and enhance deterrence in the Indo-Pacific through targeted funding and authority reforms.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Standalone bill or Title III of an NDAA. Amends the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. ch. 39) and creates new authorities under Title 10.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Indo-Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) Codification**: Permanently authorizes the PDI to fund infrastructure, logistics, and partner capacity building in the Indo-Pacific.
2. **Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Fast-Track**: Creates a "Tier 1" status for key allies (e.g., AUKUS partners, Japan, NATO frontline states) that presumes approval for defensive arms sales and expedites congressional review.
3. **AUKUS Implementation**: Grants full authority for the transfer of nuclear propulsion technology and advanced capabilities under the AUKUS agreement.
4. **Allied Supply Chain Integration**: Authorizes the DoD to treat the industrial bases of National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) countries as domestic for the purposes of certain "Buy American" requirements.

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To strengthen United States alliances, enhance deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region, and reform security cooperation authorities.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Global Alliance and Deterrence Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The network of United States alliances and partnerships is a unique strategic advantage that adversaries cannot match, with treaty obligations extending to over 50 nations (Congressional Research Service, R42146, 2024).
(2) Deterring aggression in the Indo-Pacific requires a resilient, distributed force posture and capable allies; the Department of Defense identified this theater as the priority in the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS, October 2022).
(3) The current Foreign Military Sales process takes an average of 18-24 months to fulfill orders, hampering the ability of allies to respond to acute threats (DSCA FMS Case Processing Metrics, FY2023).
(4) The AUKUS partnership represents a generational opportunity to integrate the defense industrial bases of the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, with potential savings of $5-10 billion through co-production over the next decade (CBO estimate, 2024).
(5) Only 10 of 31 NATO members met the 2 percent of GDP defense spending target in 2023, despite the 2014 Wales Summit pledge (NATO Annual Report, 2024).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) COVERED ALLIANCE.—The term "covered alliance" means a multilateral or bilateral defense treaty to which the United States is a party, including the North Atlantic Treaty, the Australia-New Zealand-United States Treaty, and bilateral defense treaties with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the Philippines.
(2) TIER 1 ALLY.—The term "Tier 1 Ally" means a nation designated by the President under Section 4 that maintains comparable export control, intelligence-sharing, and technology security regimes.
(3) NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRIAL BASE.—The term has the meaning given in section 4801 of title 10, United States Code.

SEC. 4. INDO-PACIFIC DETERRENCE INITIATIVE.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.—The Secretary of Defense shall carry out the Indo-Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI) to prioritize activities that enhance the lethality and survivability of United States forces in the Indo-Pacific.
(b) ACTIVITIES.—Funds may be used for:
(1) Modernizing and hardening bases and infrastructure.
(2) Pre-positioning stocks of fuel, munitions, and equipment.
(3) Conducting joint exercises with allies and partners.

SEC. 5. FOREIGN MILITARY SALES REFORM.

(a) TIER 1 DESIGNATION.—The President may designate a country as a "Tier 1 Ally" if such country is a member of NATO, a major non-NATO ally, or a member of the National Technology and Industrial Base.
(b) EXPEDITED REVIEW.—The congressional review period for sales of defense articles to Tier 1 Allies shall be reduced to 15 days.
(c) PRESUMPTION OF APPROVAL.—There shall be a presumption of approval for the sale of defensive systems to Tier 1 Allies, unless the President determines that such sale would compromise national security.

SEC. 6. AUKUS IMPLEMENTATION.

(a) TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER.—The President is authorized to transfer nuclear propulsion information and technology to the Government of Australia in accordance with the AUKUS agreement.
(b) EXPORT CONTROL EXEMPTION.—Defense articles and services transferred between the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia shall be exempt from certain licensing requirements under the Arms Export Control Act, provided that the recipient countries maintain comparable export control regimes.

SEC. 7. ALLIED INTEROPERABILITY.

(a) STANDARDS.—The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State, shall establish interoperability standards for command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems shared with Tier 1 Allies.
(b) JOINT EXERCISES.—The Secretary shall conduct not fewer than 4 major bilateral or multilateral exercises per year in the Indo-Pacific theater involving Tier 1 Allies.
(c) CO-PRODUCTION.—The Secretary may enter into co-production agreements with NTIB countries for the manufacture of critical munitions, provided that technology security protections are maintained.

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Secretary of Defense shall submit an annual report to Congress on the implementation of the PDI and the status of allied defense capabilities, including—
    (1) spending and obligation rates for PDI-funded activities;
    (2) the status of infrastructure modernization at Indo-Pacific installations;
    (3) the number and value of FMS cases processed under Tier 1 expedited review;
    (4) allied progress toward burden-sharing targets; and
    (5) implementation status of AUKUS technology transfer authorities.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
(1) $10,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 for the Indo-Pacific Deterrence Initiative;
(2) $11,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
(3) $12,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2029; and
(4) $13,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
(5) $14,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect immediately upon enactment.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Ensures that funding for the Pacific is ring-fenced and not raided for other priorities. It focuses on logistics and infrastructure--the unglamorous but essential elements of deterrence.
- **Section 5**: Addresses the complaint that the U.S. is too slow to arm its friends. By speeding up sales to trusted allies, we enhance their ability to defend themselves. The 15-day expedited review replaces the current 30-day window.
- **Section 6**: Removes the bureaucratic hurdles (ITAR) that hinder technology sharing with our closest allies, making AUKUS a reality.
- **Section 7**: Creates a framework for allies to manufacture key munitions under license, reducing pressure on the U.S. industrial base and strengthening allied capacity simultaneously.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| PDI Spending Plan | 90 days after enactment | INDOPACOM / DoD |
| Tier 1 Ally List | 60 days after enactment | President / State Dept |
| AUKUS ITAR Exemption | 180 days after enactment | State Dept DDTC |
| Allied Interoperability Standards | 1 year after enactment | DoD CIO / J6 |
| First Co-Production Agreement | 18 months after enactment | OUSD(A&S) |

**Challenges**:

- **Export Control Concerns**: Some in Congress and the State Department worry that loosening export controls could lead to technology leakage to adversaries through allied nations with weaker counterintelligence. The ITAR exemption for AUKUS is particularly sensitive given the nuclear propulsion technology involved.
- **Industrial Capacity**: Even with faster approvals, the U.S. industrial base may struggle to produce the weapons allies want to buy, creating a delivery backlog that undermines the speed advantage. Current FMS delivery timelines average 18-24 months after contract.
- **Allied Political Will**: Tier 1 designation creates expectations that allies will meet burden-sharing targets, but enforcement mechanisms are limited to diplomatic pressure. The 2% GDP spending pledge has been inconsistently honored by NATO allies since the 2014 Wales Summit.
- **Senate Treaty Prerogatives**: The Senate may view Tier 1 ally designations and AUKUS implementation authorities as encroaching on the treaty power. Careful framing as statutory security cooperation (not treaty commitments) will be essential.

**Refinements**:

- Add a technology security certification requirement for Tier 1 allies that includes periodic compliance reviews by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency.
- Create an allied munitions co-production fund that provides seed capital for establishing production lines in allied countries.
- Include a provision requiring the President to notify Congress 30 days before suspending or terminating a Tier 1 designation.

## State Model Legislation

While defense is a federal power, states play a critical role in supporting military families, veterans, and the defense industrial base. Approximately 44 percent of military families live off-base and interact primarily with state and local systems for employment, education, and professional licensing. States with significant defense industrial bases (California, Virginia, Texas, Connecticut, Washington) also have a direct economic interest in workforce development for defense manufacturing.

### Model State Military Spouse and Veteran Opportunity Act

**Purpose**: To remove barriers to employment for military spouses and veterans, making the state a "military-friendly" jurisdiction. This model act consolidates best practices from existing state-level military support legislation into a comprehensive framework.

**Applicability**: All 50 states and U.S. territories. Particularly relevant for states with large military installations or defense manufacturing sectors.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. PROFESSIONAL LICENSE RECIPROCITY.
(a) The State licensing boards for all professions shall grant a license by endorsement to any military spouse or veteran who holds a current, valid license in good standing in another jurisdiction with substantially similar requirements.
(b) The license shall be issued within 30 days of application.

SECTION 2. VETERAN HIRING PREFERENCE.
(a) In all hiring for State government positions, a preference shall be given to qualified veterans and military spouses.
(b) Private employers may implement a voluntary veteran hiring preference policy without violating State equal employment opportunity laws.

SECTION 3. IN-STATE TUITION.
(a) Any active duty member of the armed forces, veteran, or their spouse/dependent stationed in or residing in this State shall be eligible for in-state tuition rates at all public institutions of higher education, regardless of length of residency.

SECTION 4. DEFENSE INDUSTRY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.
(a) The State shall establish a Defense Industry Workforce Development Program to train workers for advanced manufacturing, cybersecurity, and engineering positions within the defense industrial base.
(b) The program shall be administered through the State's community college system and may partner with defense contractors operating within the State.
(c) The State may apply for matching federal funds under the Defense Industrial Base Resilience Act.

SECTION 5. MILITARY INSTALLATION SUPPORT.
(a) The State shall establish a Military Installation Sustainability Commission to coordinate State support for federal military installations.
(b) The Commission shall work with local governments to ensure compatible land use planning around military installations.
(c) The State shall provide tax incentives for businesses that locate within designated defense industry zones near military installations.
```

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize the license reciprocity provisions based on their existing professional licensing frameworks. States with significant defense industrial bases should prioritize Section 4 workforce development. States with major military installations should emphasize Sections 2 and 5. States that already participate in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact or Nurse Licensure Compact can use those as models for additional professional categories.

**Implementation Precedent**: As of 2024, 48 states have enacted some form of military spouse licensing accommodation, but coverage varies widely by profession. This model act creates a comprehensive framework that covers all state-licensed professions rather than the piecemeal approach most states have taken.

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Defense (DoD), with supporting roles for the Department of State (export controls) and Office of Personnel Management (spouse hiring preference).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Acquisition Regulations**: Update the DFARS (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement) to implement the new portfolio budgeting and multi-year procurement authorities. The Defense Acquisition Regulation Council shall publish a proposed rule within 180 days of enactment.
2. **Personnel Policies**: Revise DoD Instructions 1315.07 (Military Personnel Assignments) and 1320.13 (Commissioned Officer Promotion Reports) to operationalize the technical career tracks and lateral entry. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness shall publish implementing guidance within 1 year of enactment.
3. **Export Controls**: The State Department must amend the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 C.F.R. Parts 120-130) to create the exemptions for AUKUS and Tier 1 allies. DDTC shall publish a proposed rule within 180 days.
4. **Financial Management**: The DoD Comptroller shall issue revised financial management regulations (DoD 7000.14-R) establishing audit remediation timelines and the automatic sequestration mechanism within 90 days of enactment.
5. **Housing Standards**: The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment shall issue updated Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) for barracks and family housing within 1 year of enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **IG Audits**: The DoD Inspector General will audit compliance with the new acquisition authorities and the audit readiness mandate. The IG shall conduct annual reviews of portfolio transfer authority and report findings to the congressional defense committees.
- **Congressional Oversight**: Quarterly reports on fund transfers and annual reports on industrial base health provide transparency. The Armed Services Committees shall hold annual hearings on portfolio budgeting effectiveness.
- **Administrative Penalties**: Under the audit accountability provision (Section 8), the automatic 5% O&M reduction is self-executing and may not be waived by the Secretary without a joint resolution of Congress.
- **GAO Reviews**: The Comptroller General shall conduct biennial assessments of the Defense Technology Transition Fund and supply chain decoupling progress.

### Enforcement and Compliance

The enforcement architecture relies on three pillars:

1. **Automatic statutory penalties**: The audit sequestration provision (Section 8 of the Modernization Act) is self-executing, removing the need for political will to impose consequences. This addresses the historical pattern where Congress threatens consequences for audit failure but never follows through.

2. **Executive branch oversight**: The DoD Inspector General conducts annual compliance reviews. The IG has independent authority under the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, to access all DoD records and report directly to Congress. Quarterly portfolio transfer reports provide real-time visibility into how funds are being used.

3. **Legislative oversight**: The Armed Services and Appropriations committees receive detailed annual reports. GAO conducts independent biennial assessments. The sunset clauses ensure that authorities expire unless Congress affirmatively reauthorizes them, forcing periodic review.

This layered approach ensures accountability even if one mechanism fails. The portfolio budgeting authority includes a built-in sunset clause to prevent permanent expansion of executive discretion without congressional review. The Tier 1 ally recertification requirement ensures that export control relaxations remain justified by allied compliance.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Article I vs. Article II Tensions**: These proposals navigate the fundamental tension between Congress's Article I power to "raise and support Armies" and "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" and the President's Article II authority as Commander-in-Chief. Portfolio budgeting grants executive discretion within congressionally defined boundaries, consistent with the framework established in *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). Under Justice Jackson's concurrence, these provisions fall within "Category One" (presidential action with congressional authorization), where executive power is at its maximum.
- **Appropriations Power**: The portfolio budgeting pilot challenges the traditional interpretation of Congress's power of the purse by granting executive flexibility. However, it is constitutional as long as Congress sets the overall limits and purpose. The $20 million transfer cap in Section 4(b) provides a meaningful constraint.
- **Appointments Clause**: Lateral entry provisions for officers must comply with the Appointments Clause. Officers must be appointed by the President (and confirmed by the Senate for higher ranks), not just hired by the Secretary. *Weiss v. United States*, 510 U.S. 163 (1994), affirmed the President's authority to appoint military officers and Congress's role in structuring that process.
- **Treaty Power**: The Global Alliance Act's provisions on AUKUS technology transfer and Tier 1 ally designations interact with the President's treaty power under Article II, Section 2. Congressional authorization of these transfers supplements rather than conflicts with executive authority, placing them firmly within Youngstown Category One.

### Preemption

Federal law regarding military personnel and benefits generally preempts state law under the Supremacy Clause. The state model legislation focuses on areas where states have concurrent jurisdiction (professional licensing, state employment, in-state tuition). Federal defense procurement law preempts state regulation of defense contracts under the doctrine of federal field preemption.

The license portability provisions in the Personnel Act work through incentive grants rather than federal mandates, avoiding Tenth Amendment concerns. States voluntarily join interstate compacts in exchange for federal funding, following the cooperative federalism model upheld in *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Portfolio" Definition** | DoD could define portfolios too broadly, effectively creating a slush fund with no oversight. | High | Statutorily define the specific portfolios and cap transfer amounts (Section 4(b)). |
| **Waiver Abuse** | The "national security waiver" for Chinese components could be used indefinitely to avoid hard choices. | Medium | Limit waivers to 1 year and require a plan to eliminate the dependency. |
| **"Technical" Commanders** | Services might use technical tracks to park underperforming officers rather than true experts. | Medium | Establish strict qualification standards and independent promotion boards for the technical track. |
| **Tier 1 Ally Creep** | The President could over-designate Tier 1 allies to circumvent congressional arms sales review. | High | Cap the number of Tier 1 designations and require Senate Foreign Relations Committee concurrence. |
| **Audit Penalty Evasion** | DoD components could restructure to shift failing units into components that passed audit, avoiding the 5% O&M penalty. | Medium | Apply the penalty at the military department level, not the component level, and prohibit organizational restructuring to evade audit requirements. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Cultural Inertia** | Laws change, but culture doesn't. Services may ignore new authorities. | Deep-seated traditions. | Congressional hearings and withholding promotion confirmations for leaders who obstruct reform. |
| **Cost Growth** | Pay raises and housing fixes are expensive. | Fiscal constraints. | Offset costs by retiring legacy weapon systems (Divest to Invest). |
| **Interagency Coordination** | AUKUS and supply chain provisions require State Department and Commerce Department cooperation that DoD cannot compel. | Stovepiped federal agencies. | Establish an interagency implementation council chaired by the NSC with mandatory participation and reporting deadlines. |
| **Allied Capacity Limits** | Even with FMS reform, key allies may lack the defense industrial workforce or infrastructure to absorb new systems. | Decades of allied underinvestment. | Pair FMS reform with a co-production and technology transfer initiative that builds allied capacity rather than just selling finished systems. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **GAO Review**: Mandate a GAO review of the portfolio budgeting pilot after 2 years to assess abuse or success before permanent authorization.
2. **Sunset Provisions**: The bridge fund authorization expires after 5 years, forcing a review of its effectiveness.
3. **Tier 1 Ally Review**: Require the President to recertify Tier 1 designations every 3 years and report to Congress on each designee's compliance with export control and human rights standards.
4. **Audit Remediation Plans**: Require any DoD component that fails audit to submit a remediation plan with milestones to the congressional defense committees within 90 days.

### General Implementation Concerns

The three-bill reform package faces a common challenge: the "Iron Triangle" of defense contractors, congressional appropriators, and Pentagon bureaucrats who benefit from the current system. Each reform threatens at least one leg of this triangle:

- **Portfolio budgeting** threatens appropriators' line-item control.
- **Supply chain decoupling** threatens contractors who profit from cheap Chinese components.
- **Pay raises funded by legacy system cuts** threatens both contractors (whose programs get cut) and the services (who lose platforms they are emotionally attached to).
- **FMS reform** threatens the State Department's monopoly on arms transfer decisions.

The recommended mitigation strategy is to sequence reforms so that popular provisions (pay raises, supply chain security) build political momentum that carries the more controversial provisions (portfolio budgeting, audit penalties) through the legislative process. This is the "Soldiers and Supply Chains" strategy described in the Perspectives Analysis.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The portfolio budgeting authority (Section 4) shall sunset 5 years after enactment unless reauthorized.
- The Defense Technology Transition Fund (Section 6) shall be subject to a GAO effectiveness review at the 3-year mark, with findings reported to the defense committees.
- The Tier 1 Ally designation (Section 4 of the Global Alliance Act) shall be reviewed every 3 years by the President, with a report to the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees.
- All appropriation authorizations shall be subject to the annual NDAA reauthorization cycle.

### Case Law

- *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) - Established the three-category framework for evaluating executive power relative to congressional authorization. Portfolio budgeting and export control reforms fall within Category One (executive acts with congressional approval).
- *Weiss v. United States*, 510 U.S. 163 (1994) - Affirmed the President's authority to appoint military officers, relevant to the lateral entry and technical track provisions.
- *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987) - Upheld conditional federal spending as a tool for incentivizing state action, supporting the license portability grant program.
- *INS v. Chadha*, 462 U.S. 919 (1983) - Struck down the legislative veto; informs the design of the portfolio transfer oversight mechanism to use joint resolutions rather than one-house vetoes.

### Cross-Cutting Themes

These six subtopics and the parent-level legislation share several reform themes that should be implemented consistently:

- **Audit accountability** appears in the parent Modernization Act and the budget-and-procurement legislation.
- **Supply chain security** spans the parent Modernization Act and arms-sales export controls.
- **Personnel welfare** connects the parent Personnel Act with civil-military relations workforce provisions.
- **Congressional oversight** is a thread across all legislation, reflecting constitutionalist and progressive priorities for accountability.
