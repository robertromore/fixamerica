# War Powers: Stakeholders

## Overview

The war powers debate involves a complex set of institutional actors, political interests, and affected populations. Unlike many policy areas where stakeholders are primarily domestic, war powers decisions directly affect foreign populations and international relations. The following analysis identifies the principal stakeholders, their interests, their power to influence outcomes, and the tensions between them.

## The President and Executive Branch

### Interests

- Preserve maximum flexibility to respond to perceived threats
- Maintain the accumulated body of precedent for unilateral military action
- Control the narrative around national security decisions
- Avoid constraints that could be exploited by adversaries or limit diplomatic leverage

### Power and Influence

The President is the dominant stakeholder in war powers disputes. Key sources of power include:

| Source of Power | Description |
|---|---|
| Commander-in-Chief authority | Constitutional authority to direct military operations |
| Information control | Access to intelligence and classified operations that Congress cannot independently verify |
| First-mover advantage | Ability to initiate military action and present Congress with a fait accompli |
| Appointment power | Selects military commanders, intelligence leaders, and legal advisors who interpret war powers |
| Veto power | Can veto legislation constraining war powers; override requires two-thirds of both chambers |
| Bully pulpit | Can frame public debate and rally support for military operations |

### Internal Divisions

- **National Security Council staff** tend to favor executive flexibility and resist congressional constraints
- **Office of Legal Counsel** provides legal justifications for presidential authority; operates within a culture of executive supremacy
- **Department of State** sometimes favors congressional authorization for diplomatic legitimacy but typically defers to the White House
- **Department of Defense** prefers clear legal authority for operations but resists congressional micromanagement of military decisions

## Congress

### Interests

- Institutional prerogative: preserving Article I authority over war-making
- Individual political interests: avoiding politically risky votes while retaining ability to criticize
- Oversight: obtaining information about military operations to fulfill constitutional responsibilities
- Constituent service: responding to constituents affected by military operations (veterans, military families)

### Power and Influence

Congress possesses substantial formal powers that it has consistently failed to exercise:

| Formal Power | Usage Record |
|---|---|
| Declare war | Not used since 1942 |
| Authorize force (AUMF) | Used in 1991, 2001, 2002; no new AUMF since |
| Power of the purse | Rarely used to constrain operations; Boland Amendments (1980s) a notable exception |
| War Powers Resolution enforcement | Never successfully invoked the 60-day withdrawal clock |
| Oversight hearings | Conducted but limited by classification and executive privilege claims |
| Subpoena power | Rarely used for war powers issues; executive branch often resists compliance |

### Key Actors Within Congress

- **Senate Foreign Relations Committee**: Primary jurisdiction over war powers legislation; Senators Kaine, Young, Murphy, and Paul have been leading reform advocates
- **House Foreign Affairs Committee**: Jurisdiction over authorization of force; has passed 2001 AUMF repeal measures
- **Armed Services Committees**: Jurisdiction over military operations and NDAA; tend to be more deferential to executive branch
- **Intelligence Committees**: Oversight of covert operations; limited to "Gang of Eight" briefings for most sensitive operations
- **Congressional leadership**: Speaker and Majority Leader control whether war powers resolutions reach the floor; often block votes to avoid dividing their caucus

### Internal Divisions

- **Hawks vs. doves**: Cross-partisan division between members who favor executive flexibility for military operations and those who prioritize congressional authority
- **Institutional vs. partisan loyalties**: Members are more likely to challenge a president of the opposing party than their own, undermining consistent institutional assertion of war powers
- **Defense-state members**: Representatives from districts with major military installations or defense contractors face constituent pressure to support military operations

## The Military

### Interests

- Clear legal authority for operations to protect personnel from legal liability
- Operational effectiveness and speed of action
- Adequate resources and political support for assigned missions
- Force protection and rules of engagement that prioritize troop safety
- Institutional autonomy in military decision-making

### Power and Influence

- The Joint Chiefs of Staff and combatant commanders advise the President and brief Congress on military operations
- Military leaders' public testimony can shape the political debate (though active-duty officers are constrained by norms against political activity)
- Retired generals and admirals are influential voices in media and policy debates
- The military's institutional credibility with the American public gives its positions significant weight

### Tensions

The military has an ambivalent relationship with war powers reform:

- **Favors clear authority**: Military lawyers (JAGs) and commanders prefer clear statutory authority to vague presidential assertions, which can expose personnel to legal risk
- **Resists constraints**: Operational commanders resist requirements for prior congressional approval that could delay time-sensitive operations
- **Professionalism**: The professional military ethos emphasizes civilian control; senior officers are generally reluctant to take sides in political disputes between the branches

## The Federal Judiciary

### Interests

- Maintain judicial independence and the separation of powers
- Avoid entanglement in political disputes between the elected branches
- Uphold constitutional principles, including individual rights affected by military operations

### Power and Influence

The courts have chosen a minimal role in war powers disputes:

- The political question doctrine has effectively removed the judiciary from the field
- *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer* (1952) remains the most significant judicial statement on executive power and war, establishing Justice Jackson's three-zone framework
- *Hamdi v. Rumsfeld* (2004) and *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* (2006) addressed detention authority under the 2001 AUMF but did not directly address the scope of the authorization or the WPR
- Judicial reluctance to adjudicate war powers disputes has made them an absent stakeholder, empowering the executive by default

## The American Public

### Interests

- Physical security from foreign threats
- Democratic accountability over decisions to go to war
- Avoiding unnecessary or ill-conceived military conflicts
- Fiscal responsibility in military spending
- Accountability for the human costs of war (American casualties, veteran care)
- Information necessary to make informed judgments about military policy

### Power and Influence

The public's influence on war powers is indirect and episodic:

| Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|---|---|
| Electoral accountability | Limited; war powers rarely decisive in elections except after major failures (Vietnam, Iraq) |
| Public opinion polls | Influence congressional willingness to challenge the President; "rally around the flag" effect initially supports operations |
| Protest movements | Historically significant (Vietnam, Iraq War protests) but limited in duration and policy impact |
| Media coverage | Shapes public awareness; declining coverage of military operations reduces public engagement |

### Affected Populations

Military personnel and their families bear the direct costs of war powers decisions. As of 2024:

- Approximately 1.3 million active-duty service members
- 800,000 reserve and National Guard members
- Millions of military family members
- Over 18 million living veterans
- Communities surrounding military installations

The all-volunteer force means that the costs of war are borne disproportionately by a small segment of the population, reducing the broader public's stake in war powers accountability.

## Foreign Nations and Populations Affected by U.S. Military Action

### Interests

- Sovereignty: nations where U.S. military operations occur have an interest in controlling the use of force within their borders
- Civilian protection: populations in conflict zones bear the heaviest costs of U.S. military operations
- International law compliance: the international community has an interest in the United States adhering to the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force except in self-defense or with Security Council authorization
- Diplomatic relations: U.S. military operations affect alliance relationships and regional stability

### Affected Populations

| Category | Estimated Scale | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Civilian deaths from post-9/11 wars | 387,000-929,000+ | Brown University Costs of War (2023) |
| Refugees and displaced persons from post-9/11 wars | 38 million | Brown University Costs of War (2021) |
| Countries with U.S. military operations (post-9/11) | 85+ countries (counterterrorism operations) | Costs of War / Smithsonian Magazine |
| Nations hosting U.S. military bases | ~80 countries, ~750 bases | David Vine, *Base Nation* (2015) |

Foreign populations are the stakeholders most directly affected by war powers decisions and the least represented in the domestic policy debate. The constitutional war powers framework is designed to ensure accountability to the American people; no mechanism ensures accountability to foreign populations harmed by U.S. military operations.

## Civil Liberties and Antiwar Organizations

### Key Organizations

| Organization | Focus | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) | Due process, surveillance, targeted killing | Litigation, advocacy, public education |
| Brennan Center for Justice | War powers reform, constitutional law | Research, legislation, litigation |
| Win Without War | Anti-intervention, military spending | Grassroots advocacy, coalition building |
| Concerned Veterans for America | Military restraint, war powers | Advocacy from a conservative/libertarian perspective |
| Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft | Military restraint, diplomacy | Research, policy proposals |
| Constitution Project (now part of POGO) | Congressional oversight, war powers | Bipartisan policy recommendations |
| Project on Government Oversight (POGO) | Government accountability, oversight | Investigations, advocacy |
| Just Security | National security law | Legal analysis, scholarship |
| Costs of War Project (Brown University) | Documenting costs of post-9/11 wars | Research, data, public education |

### Power and Influence

These organizations shape the policy debate through research, litigation, and public advocacy. Their influence is greatest when public attention is focused on military operations (as during the Iraq War debate) and weakest when military operations are conducted below the threshold of public visibility (as with drone strikes and special operations).

## Defense Industry

### Interests

- Continued demand for weapons systems, platforms, and services
- Maintenance of U.S. military presence globally
- Resistance to constraints that could reduce military spending or operational tempo

### Power and Influence

- Annual lobbying expenditures exceeding $100 million (Center for Responsive Politics)
- Campaign contributions to members of Armed Services, Appropriations, and Foreign Affairs committees
- Employment in congressional districts nationwide, creating constituent pressure to support military spending
- Revolving door between Pentagon, congressional staff, and defense contractor positions

The defense industry's interest in maintaining high levels of military spending and operations creates a structural bias toward executive war-making authority and against constraints on the use of force.

## Stakeholder Alignment on Key Issues

| Issue | Exec Branch | Congress | Military | Courts | Public | Antiwar Orgs | Defense Industry |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Preserve broad AUMF | Strongly favor | Mixed | Ambivalent | No position | Unaware/opposed | Strongly oppose | Favor |
| WPR reform | Oppose | Split (reformers vs. status quo) | Ambivalent | No position | Support when aware | Strongly support | Oppose |
| Congressional war votes | Oppose | Split (avoid votes vs. assert authority) | Ambivalent | No position | Support | Strongly support | Oppose |
| Transparency for operations | Oppose | Support (in principle) | Ambivalent | No position | Strongly support | Strongly support | Oppose |
| Sunset clauses on AUMFs | Oppose | Growing bipartisan support | Ambivalent | No position | Support | Strongly support | Oppose |
