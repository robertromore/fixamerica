# War Powers: Root Causes

## Overview

The erosion of congressional war powers is not the result of a single event or decision. It is the product of structural forces, institutional incentives, and accumulated precedent that have systematically shifted the balance of war-making authority from Congress to the President over more than seven decades. Understanding these root causes is essential because reforms that address only symptoms -- such as tightening the language of the War Powers Resolution -- will fail if the underlying dynamics remain unchanged.

## Root Cause 1: Executive Information Advantage

The President and the executive branch possess an overwhelming advantage in intelligence, military expertise, and real-time operational awareness. This information asymmetry enables the executive to:

- **Frame the narrative**: The President defines the threat, characterizes the urgency, and controls what information Congress receives about military operations. The intelligence community reports to the President, and the executive branch decides what to classify and what to share with Congress.
- **Present fait accompli**: By deploying forces or initiating strikes before seeking authorization, the President forces Congress to choose between supporting ongoing operations and being accused of undermining troops in the field.
- **Control legal interpretation**: The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) within the Department of Justice produces classified legal opinions justifying presidential war-making authority. These opinions are often withheld from Congress and are treated as authoritative within the executive branch.

The information advantage is compounded by the growth of the national security state since 1947. The intelligence community's budget exceeds $100 billion annually, and it employs hundreds of thousands of personnel. Congressional oversight committees have small staffs, limited access to classified operations, and no independent intelligence collection capability.

## Root Cause 2: Congressional Political Incentives

The single most important reason Congress has failed to exercise its war powers is that doing so is politically costly. The incentive structure for individual members of Congress systematically favors abdication:

- **No upside to voting**: If a military operation succeeds, the President gets the credit. If it fails, members who voted to authorize it share the blame. The optimal political strategy is to avoid a vote entirely.
- **Rally-around-the-flag effect**: In the immediate aftermath of a military crisis, opposing the President is politically dangerous. The 2001 AUMF was passed in three days; the 2002 Iraq AUMF was debated during the 2002 midterm campaign, when voting against authorization was characterized as weakness.
- **Collective action problem**: Reforming war powers requires a majority of Congress to assert institutional prerogatives against the executive. Individual members gain nothing from this effort; the political rewards of institutional reform are diffuse, while the risks of opposing a popular military operation are concentrated.
- **Blame shifting**: By allowing the President to act unilaterally, Congress retains the ability to criticize operations without bearing responsibility for them. This is politically valuable regardless of whether the operation succeeds or fails.

The result is what constitutional scholar Jack Goldsmith has called "a de facto delegation of war power from Congress to the President," not through any formal legal change but through the systematic failure to exercise existing constitutional authority.

## Root Cause 3: Imperial Presidency Precedent Accumulation

Each act of unilateral presidential war-making expands the body of precedent available to future presidents. This ratchet effect operates through several mechanisms:

- **OLC opinions build on each other**: Legal justifications for one military operation become the foundation for justifying the next. The legal theories used to justify the Korean War were cited for Vietnam, which was cited for the 1991 Gulf War, which was cited for Kosovo, which was cited for Libya, and so on.
- **Congressional acquiescence becomes consent**: When Congress fails to challenge a presidential assertion of war-making authority, the executive branch treats the silence as tacit acceptance, strengthening the precedent.
- **"Historical gloss" doctrine**: The Supreme Court in *NLRB v. Noel Canning* (2014) and other cases has recognized that longstanding executive practice, acquiesced in by Congress, can inform the meaning of constitutional provisions. Decades of executive war-making without meaningful congressional challenge has arguably shifted the constitutional baseline.
- **Bipartisan expansion**: Because presidents of both parties have expanded executive war powers, neither party has an institutional interest in rolling back the practice. Democratic presidents (Truman, Clinton, Obama) have been as aggressive in claiming unilateral authority as Republican presidents (Nixon, George W. Bush, Trump).

The accumulation of precedent creates a one-way ratchet: each assertion of presidential authority, if unchallenged, becomes the new floor for the next assertion.

## Root Cause 4: AUMF Elasticity

The 2001 AUMF's 60 words have proven infinitely elastic. The concept of "associated forces" -- which does not appear in the statute's text but was developed through executive interpretation -- has allowed the authorization to be extended to groups with tenuous or no connection to the September 11 attacks.

Key mechanisms of AUMF elasticity:

- **Undefined terms**: The statute does not define "organizations," "persons," "aided," or "harbored," leaving the executive branch to interpret these terms expansively.
- **Associated forces doctrine**: The executive branch developed this extra-statutory concept to cover groups that had "entered the fight alongside" al-Qaeda, even if they had no role in the September 11 attacks.
- **Inherited hostility**: Groups that splintered from al-Qaeda-affiliated organizations (like ISIS, which was at war with al-Qaeda) were treated as inheritors of the 2001 AUMF authority under the theory that they were successor organizations.
- **Geographic expansion**: The 2001 AUMF contains no geographic limitation, allowing its use from West Africa to Southeast Asia.
- **Classified target lists**: The executive branch maintains classified lists of groups and individuals covered by the 2001 AUMF. Members of Congress cannot publicly disclose or debate these classifications.

The elasticity of the AUMF is not merely a legal problem; it is a democratic accountability problem. When the legal authority for war is infinitely expandable and the target list is classified, there is no meaningful way for Congress or the public to assess whether military operations are within the scope of what was authorized.

## Root Cause 5: Judicial Abdication

The federal courts have consistently refused to adjudicate war powers disputes, invoking the political question doctrine to decline jurisdiction. Key doctrinal reasons:

- **Political question doctrine**: Under *Baker v. Carr* (1962), courts avoid cases that involve "a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department" or a "lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards." Courts have treated war powers disputes as falling within this exception.
- **Standing requirements**: Courts have generally held that individual members of Congress lack standing to challenge presidential war-making because they have not suffered a concrete, particularized injury distinct from the general interest of all citizens.
- **Equitable discretion**: Even when courts have jurisdiction, they often decline to exercise it in national security cases, deferring to the political branches on matters of military strategy and foreign affairs.
- **Ripeness and mootness**: Military operations often begin and end before litigation can be resolved, making cases moot. Alternatively, courts find that disputes are not ripe until Congress has exhausted its own remedies (such as cutting off funding).

The judiciary's refusal to engage has removed the one branch of government that could serve as an impartial arbiter of war powers disputes. Without judicial enforcement, the War Powers Resolution is effectively a recommendation that presidents can ignore without legal consequence.

## Root Cause 6: National Security State Institutional Momentum

The post-1947 national security establishment has created a permanent institutional infrastructure for military intervention that generates its own demand for operations:

- **Combatant commands**: The Unified Command Plan divides the world into geographic areas of responsibility, each with a four-star commander whose institutional role is to identify and address threats within their region. This structure creates bureaucratic incentives for military engagement.
- **Special Operations Command**: SOCOM has grown from a small, specialized force to a 70,000-person command conducting operations in over 80 countries. The expansion of special operations has enabled the executive branch to conduct military operations below the threshold of public visibility and political accountability.
- **Intelligence community**: The CIA's covert action authorities (Title 50) allow the executive branch to conduct lethal operations -- including drone strikes -- outside the military chain of command and with limited congressional notification (the "Gang of Eight" rather than the full intelligence committees).
- **Defense industry**: The military-industrial complex has a direct financial interest in maintaining a high operational tempo and developing new weapons systems. Defense contractors spend heavily on lobbying and campaign contributions that reinforce hawkish foreign policy preferences in Congress.
- **Revolving door**: Senior military officers, intelligence officials, and defense industry executives cycle between government service and private sector positions, creating a community of interest that favors interventionist policies and resists constraints on executive authority.

## Root Cause 7: Definitional Obsolescence

The War Powers Resolution's key terms were designed for conventional military deployments involving ground troops and naval vessels. Modern military operations frequently fall outside these definitions:

| Modern Operation Type | WPR Applicability Gap |
|---|---|
| Drone strikes | No "introduction of Armed Forces into hostilities" in the traditional sense |
| Cyber operations | No physical deployment of forces; unclear if "hostilities" applies |
| Special operations raids | Short-duration actions that may not trigger reporting requirements |
| Proxy warfare | U.S. personnel advise, fund, and supply partner forces that conduct combat |
| Arms sales to belligerents | Not covered by WPR despite enabling foreign military operations |
| Covert action under Title 50 | Governed by separate statutory framework; WPR applies only to "Armed Forces" |

Presidents have exploited these definitional gaps to conduct extensive military operations without triggering WPR requirements. The Obama administration's claim that Libya operations were not "hostilities" -- despite seven months of bombing -- was the most extreme example, but the pattern is systemic.

## Root Cause 8: Public Disengagement

The all-volunteer force, established in 1973, has insulated the American public from the direct costs of war. When military service is borne by a small percentage of the population and the financial costs are funded through deficit spending rather than war taxes, the public has diminished incentive to demand congressional accountability for military operations.

Key factors in public disengagement:

- **All-volunteer force**: Less than 1% of the U.S. population serves in the military at any given time, and military service is concentrated in specific geographic regions and demographic groups
- **Deficit financing**: Post-9/11 wars cost an estimated $8 trillion (Brown University Costs of War Project) but were funded through borrowing rather than tax increases, shielding the public from the immediate fiscal costs
- **Low casualty operations**: Drone strikes, special operations raids, and air campaigns produce far fewer American casualties than conventional warfare, reducing public pressure for congressional oversight
- **Media coverage decline**: Sustained media coverage of military operations has declined significantly since the early years of the Iraq War, reducing public awareness and engagement

## Interaction Effects

These root causes reinforce each other in a self-perpetuating cycle:

1. The executive branch uses its information advantage to initiate military operations
2. Congress avoids politically risky votes to authorize or constrain the operations
3. The lack of congressional challenge creates precedent for future unilateral action
4. Courts decline to adjudicate the resulting disputes
5. Broad AUMFs provide legal cover for mission creep
6. The national security establishment expands to support ongoing operations
7. The public, insulated from the costs of war, does not demand accountability
8. The cycle repeats, with each iteration further eroding the constitutional framework

Breaking this cycle requires addressing multiple root causes simultaneously. Reforming the War Powers Resolution alone, without changing congressional incentive structures and closing definitional loopholes, will produce another statute that presidents ignore and Congress declines to enforce.
