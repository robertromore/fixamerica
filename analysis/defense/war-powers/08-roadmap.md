# War Powers: Reform Roadmap

Restoring congressional war powers requires a phased approach that builds political momentum through achievable early victories before tackling the most structurally difficult reforms. Each phase is designed to change the political incentive structure in ways that make subsequent reforms more feasible.

---

## Phase 1: Build the Foundation (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on transparency, coalition building, and addressing the least controversial reforms to establish momentum and demonstrate bipartisan viability.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Repeal the 2001 AUMF with transition period** | Congress passes legislation repealing the 2001 AUMF effective 180 days after enactment, providing a transition period for the executive branch to identify any ongoing operations that require new authorization. | 2001 AUMF is repealed; executive branch submits transition plan to Congress identifying all operations requiring new authority. |
| **2. Enact transparency requirements** | Congress passes a War Powers Transparency Act requiring quarterly public reports on all military operations, legal authorities, and civilian casualty estimates. | First quarterly report is published; public can identify all countries where U.S. military operations are occurring. |
| **3. Establish bipartisan war powers caucus** | Members of both parties form a formal Congressional War Powers Caucus to coordinate reform efforts across committee jurisdictions. | Caucus is established with at least 30 members from both parties; holds first public hearing. |
| **4. Commission independent review** | Congress charters a bipartisan National War Powers Commission to study the current framework and recommend comprehensive reforms. | Commission is chartered, members appointed, and initial hearings conducted. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: End the "forever war" legal framework embodied in the 2001 AUMF. Establish baseline transparency that enables informed public debate. Build the bipartisan coalition necessary for structural reforms in Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

This phase enacts the core legislative reforms: replacing the War Powers Resolution, establishing enforcement mechanisms, and addressing modern warfare categories.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Pass the War Powers Reform Act** | Congress enacts comprehensive legislation replacing the 1973 War Powers Resolution with a modern framework including a 20-day authorization requirement, automatic funding cutoffs, and expanded definitions covering cyber and drone operations. | New War Powers Reform Act is signed into law; first presidential report filed under new framework. |
| **2. Enact narrow replacement authorizations** | Where ongoing military operations are justified, Congress passes specific, narrow authorizations with 3-year sunset clauses, geographic limitations, and quarterly reporting requirements. | Specific authorizations are enacted for any genuinely necessary ongoing operations; each authorization names specific groups and theaters. |
| **3. Reform Senate rules for war votes** | The Senate adopts a rule change prohibiting filibuster of war powers authorization resolutions. | Senate rule change is adopted; first war powers vote occurs under new expedited procedures. |
| **4. Establish congressional standing for judicial review** | Congress enacts legislation granting one-third of either chamber standing to challenge unauthorized military operations in federal court, with expedited judicial review procedures. | Standing statute is enacted; federal courts accept jurisdiction in test case. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Replace the failed 1973 framework with enforcement mechanisms that shift the burden of inaction from Congress (which must currently act to stop operations) to the President (who must obtain authorization to continue them). Establish judicial review as a credible check.

---

## Phase 3: Institutionalize and Normalize (Years 6-10)

This phase focuses on ensuring that reforms become embedded in institutional culture and survive changes in administration and congressional leadership.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. First sunset reauthorization cycle** | Congress conducts its first full debate and vote on whether to reauthorize existing military operation authorizations as their 3-year sunset clauses trigger. | Authorization is renewed, modified, or allowed to expire after substantive congressional debate and recorded vote. |
| **2. Normalize annual war powers review** | Annual review votes on ongoing operations become routine congressional business, analogous to the NDAA authorization process. | Annual review votes are conducted for all ongoing operations; members are on record. |
| **3. Modernize for emerging technologies** | Congress updates the War Powers Reform Act to address AI-enabled autonomous weapons, unmanned systems, and other emerging military capabilities. | Updated definitions and authorization requirements are enacted for autonomous weapons and AI-enabled military operations. |
| **4. Build international norms** | The United States works with allies to establish international standards for democratic authorization of military force, including NATO consultation requirements. | Joint statement with allies endorsing democratic authorization norms for military force. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: The reformed war powers framework becomes embedded in institutional practice. Regular congressional authorization votes for military operations are accepted as normal democratic governance rather than unusual assertions of congressional power.

| Unauthorized military operations | Zero operations beyond 20 days without authorization | Congressional monitoring |
| Judicial review | At least one court rules on merits of war powers challenge | Court records |
| Specific authorizations | All ongoing operations covered by specific, time-limited authorizations | Congressional records |

### Long-Term (6-10 years)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| Sunset reauthorization | At least one authorization successfully renewed through new vote | Congressional records |

## Risks and Contingencies

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Executive branch veto of reform legislation | High | Build veto-proof bipartisan coalition; attach provisions to must-pass NDAA |
| Court declines to exercise jurisdiction | Medium | Design standing statute to address specific judicial concerns; build factual record |
| Crisis triggers rally-around-flag, delays reform | Medium | Maintain reform momentum during peacetime; pre-position legislation for quick action |
| New military operation undermines political will | Medium | Frame reforms as supporting effective operations, not opposing military action |
| Partisan shifts destroy bipartisan coalition | Medium | Anchor reforms in institutional interests that transcend party; cultivate champions in both parties |
