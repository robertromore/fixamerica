# War Powers: Solutions

## Overview

Effective war powers reform must address the structural root causes of congressional abdication and executive dominance, not merely amend the language of existing statutes. The solutions below are organized from most fundamental to most specific, reflecting the principle that procedural reforms will fail without changes to the underlying incentive structures.

## Solution 1: Replace the War Powers Resolution with a Modern Framework

### Problem Addressed

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 has failed to constrain executive war-making. Its key provisions are routinely evaded, its definitions are obsolete, and its enforcement mechanism (the 60-day clock) has never been successfully invoked. The legislative veto provision in Section 5(c) is likely unconstitutional after *INS v. Chadha* (1983).

### Proposed Reform

Replace the WPR with a comprehensive War Powers Reform Act that addresses its structural weaknesses:

- **Shorten the reporting trigger**: Reduce the period for mandatory presidential reporting from 48 hours to 24 hours, and shorten the automatic withdrawal period from 60 days to 20 days. The current 60-day window is too long; it allows the executive to conduct entire military campaigns (as in Libya) before the withdrawal requirement takes effect.
- **Expand definitions**: Define "hostilities" to explicitly include drone strikes, cyber attacks causing physical damage or casualties, special operations raids, and the provision of targeting intelligence to foreign forces engaged in combat. Close the definitional loopholes that presidents have exploited.
- **Automatic funding cutoff**: Rather than relying on a congressional vote to compel withdrawal (which *Chadha* may preclude), make the funding cutoff automatic: no appropriated funds may be used for military operations beyond the 20-day period absent specific statutory authorization. This shifts the burden to Congress to affirmatively authorize operations rather than requiring Congress to act to stop them.
- **Eliminate the self-defense loophole for non-imminent threats**: Narrow the exception for self-defense to cases where U.S. territory, forces, or citizens are under attack or face a genuinely imminent threat. Require that the President certify the nature and imminence of the threat in the mandatory report.
- **Anti-circumvention provisions**: Prohibit the executive branch from conducting operations under Title 50 (covert action) or through proxy forces that would constitute "hostilities" if conducted directly by U.S. Armed Forces.

- National War Powers Commission (Baker-Christopher Commission, 2008): Bipartisan panel recommended replacing the WPR with a new consultation and authorization framework
- Senator Tim Kaine and Senator Todd Young, various legislative proposals (2019-2024): Bipartisan WPR reform bills

### Implementation

Federal legislation; see [Legislation](11-legislation.md) for draft text (War Powers Reform Act).

## Solution 2: Repeal the 2001 AUMF and Replace with Narrow Authorizations

### Problem Addressed

The 2001 AUMF has been stretched beyond recognition, authorizing operations against groups in countries that had no connection to the September 11 attacks. Its open-ended nature eliminates the constitutional requirement for congressional deliberation about whether and against whom the nation is at war.

### Proposed Reform

- **Repeal the 2001 AUMF** with a 180-day transition period to allow the executive branch to adjust ongoing operations
- **Replace with narrow, threat-specific authorizations** that name specific groups, define geographic scope, and include mandatory 3-year sunset clauses
- **Require new authorization for new groups or theaters**: If the executive branch identifies a new group as a threat requiring military force, it must seek a new, specific authorization from Congress
- **Prohibit "associated forces" expansion**: The replacement authorization must not include catch-all language allowing executive expansion to unnamed groups. Any extension to new organizations requires congressional approval.
- **Mandate quarterly reporting**: Detailed quarterly reports to Congress on all operations conducted under the authorization, including groups targeted, countries of operation, civilian casualties, and expenditures

### Evidence Base

- Congressional Research Service, "The War Powers Resolution: Concepts and Practice" (updated periodically): Documents the scope of 2001 AUMF expansion
- Brown University Costs of War Project: Documents 22+ countries and 41+ groups targeted under the 2001 AUMF
- Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), various repeal bills (2001-2024): Longest-running legislative effort to repeal the 2001 AUMF
- Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 2018 AUMF hearings: Bipartisan recognition of the need for reform

### Implementation

Federal legislation; see [Legislation](11-legislation.md) for draft text (Authorization for Use of Military Force Sunset and Accountability Act).

## Solution 3: Mandatory Congressional War Votes

### Problem Addressed

Congress avoids war votes because they are politically risky. The current system allows Congress to avoid responsibility by neither authorizing nor prohibiting military operations. This dynamic rewards abdication and punishes engagement.

### Proposed Reform

- **Expedited floor procedures**: When the President initiates military operations, require both chambers to vote on an authorization resolution within 15 legislative days. The vote is privileged (cannot be blocked by committee chairs or leadership) and requires a recorded roll-call vote (no voice votes).
- **No-filibuster rule**: War powers authorization votes in the Senate cannot be filibustered. The stakes of war and peace are too high for a minority of senators to prevent a vote.
- **Voting transparency**: All war powers votes must be recorded roll-call votes, ensuring that every member of Congress is on the record.
- **Mandatory annual review votes**: For any ongoing authorization, Congress must vote annually on whether to continue the authorization. Failure to vote results in automatic expiration.

### Evidence Base

- National War Powers Commission (2008): Recommended expedited congressional procedures for war powers votes
- Senator Murphy, Lee, and Sanders, "National Security Powers Act" (2022): Included expedited floor procedures for war powers resolutions
- James Madison, Federalist No. 58: "The power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people."

### Implementation

Changes to the rules of the House and Senate, combined with statutory requirements.

## Solution 4: Judicial Review Mechanisms

### Problem Addressed

Courts have refused to adjudicate war powers disputes, leaving no impartial arbiter to enforce the constitutional allocation of authority. The political question doctrine has effectively granted the executive a judicial blank check.

### Proposed Reform

- **Congressional standing statute**: Enact a statute granting a defined number of members of Congress (e.g., one-third of either chamber) standing to challenge unauthorized military operations in federal court
- **Expedited judicial review**: Establish a procedure for expedited judicial review of war powers disputes, with cases heard by a three-judge panel and direct appeal to the Supreme Court
- **Narrow the political question doctrine**: Include a statutory finding that the constitutionality of military operations conducted without congressional authorization is a justiciable question, not a political question. While Congress cannot override the Supreme Court's interpretation of justiciability, a clear statutory statement would signal congressional intent and provide a basis for courts to reconsider the doctrine.

### Evidence Base

- *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952): The Supreme Court can and has adjudicated disputes over the scope of executive military authority
- Fisher, Louis, "Judicial Review of the War Power," *Presidential Studies Quarterly* (2005): Argues for expanded judicial role
- Barron, David J. and Martin S. Lederman, "The Commander in Chief at the Lowest Ebb," *Harvard Law Review* (2008): Scholarly analysis of judicial deference problems

### Implementation

Federal legislation establishing standing and expedited procedures; may require test case to establish constitutionality.

## Solution 5: Transparency and Reporting Requirements

### Problem Addressed

Military operations are often conducted in secrecy, with the executive branch using classification to shield politically sensitive operations from congressional and public scrutiny. Congress cannot exercise oversight over operations it does not know about.

### Proposed Reform

- **Real-time notification**: The President must notify the full membership of both Intelligence Committees (not just the "Gang of Eight") of any military operation within 48 hours. Covert operations may be briefed in classified settings, but the fact that an operation occurred may not be concealed from Congress.
- **Quarterly public reports**: Unclassified quarterly reports listing all countries where U.S. military operations are occurring, all groups targeted, aggregate civilian casualty estimates, and legal authorities relied upon.
- **Annual war powers report**: An annual public report from the President to Congress providing a comprehensive accounting of all uses of military force, legal authorities, costs, and outcomes.
- **Classification reform**: Prohibit the classification of legal interpretations that serve as the basis for military operations. The legal authority for war must be public, even if operational details are classified.
- **Inspector general oversight**: Mandate that the DoD Inspector General conduct an annual audit of war powers compliance, including whether all required reports have been filed and whether operations have been conducted within the scope of congressional authorization.

### Evidence Base

- Brennan Center for Justice, "Reducing Overclassification Through Accountability" (2011): Documented the extent of overclassification in national security
- 9/11 Commission Report (2004): Recommended increased transparency and congressional oversight of intelligence operations
- Government Accountability Office, multiple reports on civilian casualty reporting deficiencies (2017-2024)

### Implementation

Federal legislation combined with executive branch directive.

## Solution 6: Address Congressional Incentive Problems

### Problem Addressed

Even with reformed procedures, Congress may continue to avoid war votes if the political incentive structure remains unchanged.

### Proposed Reform

- **Automatic authorization votes**: Statute requires that any ongoing military operation be subject to an up-or-down authorization vote within 20 days, with no ability for leadership to block the vote. This removes the ability of congressional leadership to prevent votes from reaching the floor.
- **Political cover through process**: Bipartisan war powers study commissions that report to Congress can provide political cover for members to take positions on military operations, reducing the individual political risk of casting a vote.
- **Public pressure mechanisms**: Require that all WPR reports and congressional responses be made public promptly, creating transparency that enables constituent accountability.
- **Member accountability tracking**: Nonpartisan organizations should track and publicize members' war powers votes and positions, making it politically costly to avoid engagement.

- Howell, William and Jon Pevehouse, *While Dangers Gather* (2007): Empirical analysis of congressional influence on military operations

### Implementation

Statutory reforms combined with civil society advocacy.

## Solution 7: Define Modern Warfare Categories

### Problem Addressed

The War Powers Resolution's definitions were designed for conventional military deployments and do not clearly cover drone strikes, cyber operations, special operations, or proxy warfare.

### Proposed Reform

Establish clear statutory definitions for modern forms of military force:

| Category | Proposed Definition | Authorization Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Kinetic military operations | Any use of lethal force by U.S. Armed Forces, including drone strikes and missile attacks | Full WPR and authorization requirements |
| Offensive cyber operations | Cyber operations intended to degrade, disrupt, or destroy adversary systems or cause physical effects | Presidential notification + 20-day authorization requirement |
| Special operations | Raids, direct action, and unconventional warfare by special operations forces | Full WPR and authorization requirements |
| Proxy warfare | Provision of targeting intelligence, operational planning, or in-flight refueling to foreign forces engaged in combat | Congressional notification; authorization required if U.S. role is essential to the operation |
| Arms transfers to active belligerents | Transfer of weapons to nations or groups engaged in armed conflict | Congressional notification and 30-day review period |

- Chesney, Robert, "Military-Intelligence Convergence and the Law of the Title 10/Title 50 Debate," *Journal of National Security Law and Policy* (2012)

### Implementation
