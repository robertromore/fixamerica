# War Powers: Actions

## Overview

War powers reform depends on sustained public engagement. The constitutional framework envisions Congress as the body accountable to the people for decisions about war and peace. When the public is disengaged, Congress has no political incentive to reclaim its authority. The actions below are organized by level of commitment and are designed to build the constituency pressure necessary to overcome the structural obstacles to reform.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- **Understand the basics**: Read the text of the 2001 AUMF (60 words), the War Powers Resolution, and Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. Understanding what the law says -- and how it has been ignored -- is the essential first step.
- **Follow war powers reporting**: Track military operations and war powers debates through organizations like Just Security (justsecurity.org), Lawfare (lawfaremedia.org), and the Quincy Institute (quincyinst.org).
- **Read the costs**: The Brown University Costs of War Project (watson.brown.edu/costsofwar) documents the human, economic, and political costs of post-9/11 military operations.
- **Monitor your representatives**: Check whether your senators and representative have co-sponsored war powers reform legislation. The congressional record and organizations like GovTrack (govtrack.us) make this information accessible.

### Contact Elected Officials

- **Call and write your members of Congress**: Demand that they co-sponsor war powers reform legislation, including 2001 AUMF repeal and War Powers Resolution replacement. Phone calls to district and Capitol Hill offices are the most effective form of constituent contact.
- **Attend town halls**: Ask your representative directly whether they support congressional authorization requirements for military operations. Public questions at town halls receive more attention than private communications.
- **Support members who take positions**: Members of Congress who vote on war powers take political risks. Support them -- regardless of party -- with constituent praise, letters to the editor, and campaign contributions.
- **Contact leadership**: Speaker of the House and Senate Majority Leader control whether war powers bills reach the floor. Demand that they schedule votes on pending war powers legislation.

### Amplify the Message

- **Write letters to the editor and op-eds**: Local newspapers remain influential in shaping constituent opinion. Write about war powers reform in the context of your community's connection to the military.
- **Use social media**: Share information about war powers issues, pending legislation, and congressional votes. Tag your representatives.
- **Engage veterans**: Veterans and military families have unique credibility on war powers issues. Support veteran-led organizations advocating for reform.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- **Form local war powers reform groups**: Connect with neighbors, community organizations, and local political groups to build awareness and organize constituent pressure on elected officials.
- **Partner with veterans' organizations**: Local VFW and American Legion posts, as well as newer organizations like Common Defense and VoteVets, can provide credibility and reach for war powers advocacy.
- **Host educational events**: Organize community forums, film screenings, or speaker events focused on war powers and military oversight. Invite constitutional law professors, veterans, and representatives from reform organizations.

### Engage Civic Institutions

- **University engagement**: Law schools and political science departments can host forums on war powers reform. Student organizations can organize educational campaigns and advocacy efforts.
- **Faith community engagement**: Religious organizations have a long history of engagement with questions of war and peace. Coordinate with interfaith organizations to include war powers reform in social justice advocacy.
- **Bar association engagement**: Local and state bar associations can organize continuing legal education programs on war powers law, raising awareness within the legal community.

### How Organizations Can Support Reform

- **Coalition building**: War powers reform has unusual bipartisan potential. Organizations from the left (Win Without War) and right (Concerned Veterans for America, Cato Institute) share the goal of congressional war powers accountability. Cross-ideological coalitions are essential for overcoming the structural obstacles to reform.
- **Lobby days**: Coordinate constituent visits to congressional offices, particularly targeting members on the Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, and Intelligence committees.
- **Electoral accountability**: Track and publicize congressional votes and positions on war powers. Endorse and support candidates who commit to war powers reform.
- **Litigation support**: Support organizations like the ACLU and Brennan Center that pursue litigation to establish judicial review of war powers disputes.

## Electoral Actions

- **Ask candidates about war powers**: During primary and general election campaigns, ask candidates directly whether they support congressional authorization requirements for military operations, 2001 AUMF repeal, and War Powers Resolution reform.
- **Support reform candidates**: Contribute to and volunteer for candidates who commit to war powers reform, regardless of party.
- **Organize candidate forums**: Host forums specifically focused on foreign policy and war powers, ensuring that candidates must articulate positions on these issues.
- **Track voting records**: After elections, hold elected officials accountable for their war powers positions and votes. Publicize deviations from campaign commitments.

## Priority Actions for Maximum Impact

The following actions offer the highest ratio of impact to effort for individuals seeking to advance war powers reform:

1. **Call your senators and representative** to demand co-sponsorship of 2001 AUMF repeal legislation and War Powers Resolution reform. A single phone call from a constituent has outsized influence.
2. **Write a letter to your local newspaper** connecting war powers to your community (military families, fiscal costs, democratic values). Local media shapes how members of Congress perceive constituent priorities.
3. **Attend a town hall** and ask your representative on the record whether they support requiring congressional authorization before military operations. Public questions create accountability.
4. **Join one organization** from the table above and participate in at least one advocacy action per quarter.
5. **Share information** about war powers issues on social media and in conversations with friends and family. Public awareness is the necessary precondition for political change.
