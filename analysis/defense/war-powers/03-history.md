# War Powers: History

## Constitutional Convention and Founding Design

The allocation of war powers was among the most carefully debated issues at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. The Framers were acutely aware of the dangers of concentrating the power to initiate war in a single executive, having fought a revolution against a king who could unilaterally commit the nation to conflict.

### Key Debates

The original draft of the Constitution, proposed by the Committee of Detail, gave Congress the power "To make war." On August 17, 1787, James Madison and Elbridge Gerry moved to change "make" to "declare," explicitly leaving the President the power to "repel sudden attacks" while reserving the deliberative decision to initiate war for Congress. The motion passed, and the distinction was widely understood to mean that the President could defend the nation in an emergency but could not take the country into war without congressional consent.

Key statements from the founding period:

- **James Madison** (1793): "The constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the Legislature."
- **Alexander Hamilton** (Federalist No. 69): The President's Commander-in-Chief power "would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces... while that of the British King extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies, all which by the Constitution under consideration would appertain to the Legislature."
- **Thomas Jefferson** (1789): "We have already given in example one effectual check to the Dog of war by transferring the power of letting him loose from the Executive to the Legislative body."

### Constitutional Text

The final constitutional allocation creates an interlocking system:

| Branch | Power | Constitutional Source |
|---|---|---|
| Congress | Declare war | Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 11 |
| Congress | Grant letters of marque and reprisal | Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 11 |
| Congress | Raise and support armies | Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 12 |
| Congress | Provide and maintain a navy | Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 13 |
| Congress | Make rules for governing the armed forces | Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 14 |
| Congress | Call forth the militia | Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 15 |
| Congress | Appropriate funds (no military appropriation for more than two years) | Art. I, Sec. 9, Cl. 7; Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 12 |
| President | Commander in Chief | Art. II, Sec. 2, Cl. 1 |

## Early Republic: Setting Precedents (1789-1860)

### The Quasi-War with France (1798-1800)

The undeclared naval war with France established early precedents for congressional control. Congress authorized limited naval hostilities through a series of statutes rather than a formal declaration of war. The Supreme Court in *Bas v. Tingy* (1800) and *Talbot v. Seeman* (1801) confirmed that Congress could authorize limited as well as general war, and that the President's military actions must conform to the scope Congress defined. In *Little v. Barreme* (1804), Chief Justice Marshall held that even the Commander in Chief must comply with congressional limits on the use of force, finding a Navy captain liable for seizing a ship outside the scope of congressional authorization.

### Barbary Wars (1801-1805, 1815)

President Jefferson initially took a cautious approach to the Barbary pirates, arguing that without a congressional declaration of war, U.S. naval forces could only defend against attacks and could not take offensive action. He sought and obtained congressional authorization for offensive operations. The First Barbary War established the precedent that the President needed congressional authorization for offensive military operations abroad, though the exact scope of the President's defensive authority remained debated.

### Mexican-American War (1846-1848)

President Polk provoked the Mexican-American War by ordering troops into disputed territory along the Rio Grande, then presented Congress with a fait accompli when Mexican forces attacked. Congress declared war, but the episode drew sharp criticism for executive manipulation of the war power. Abraham Lincoln, then a freshman congressman, introduced the "Spot Resolutions" challenging Polk's claim that American blood had been shed on American soil, accusing the President of provoking the war without congressional consent.

## The Civil War and Presidential War Powers (1861-1865)

President Lincoln exercised the broadest unilateral war powers of any president to that date, taking a series of extraordinary actions between the fall of Fort Sumter (April 1861) and the convening of Congress (July 1861):

- Called up 75,000 militia and expanded the regular Army and Navy beyond congressionally authorized levels
- Imposed a naval blockade of Southern ports
- Suspended habeas corpus
- Authorized military spending without congressional appropriation

Lincoln justified these actions as exercises of the Commander-in-Chief power and the President's duty to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." Congress retroactively ratified Lincoln's actions in August 1861. The Supreme Court in the *Prize Cases* (1863) upheld Lincoln's blockade authority in a 5-4 decision, holding that the President could respond to an insurrection without waiting for Congress to declare war, though the dissent argued that only Congress could convert a domestic insurrection into a war with legal consequences.

The Civil War established a critical precedent: in a genuine emergency where Congress is unavailable or unable to act, the President can exercise broad military authority -- but the expectation was that Congress would subsequently authorize or constrain the President's actions.

## World Wars and the High-Water Mark of Congressional War Powers

### World War I

President Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany on April 2, 1917. Congress debated for four days before voting to declare war on April 6, with substantial opposition (50 Representatives and 6 Senators voted against). The process exemplified the constitutional design: the President recommended war, Congress deliberated and voted.

### World War II

The last formal declarations of war in U.S. history followed the attack on Pearl Harbor:

| Date | Declaration Against | Vote (Senate) | Vote (House) |
|---|---|---|---|
| December 8, 1941 | Japan | 82-0 | 388-1 |
| December 11, 1941 | Germany | 88-0 | 393-0 |
| December 11, 1941 | Italy | 90-0 | 399-0 |
| June 5, 1942 | Bulgaria | 73-0 | 357-0 |
| June 5, 1942 | Hungary | 73-0 | 360-0 |
| June 5, 1942 | Romania | 73-0 | 361-0 |

No formal declaration of war has been enacted since June 5, 1942.

## The Korean War: The Pivotal Break (1950-1953)

President Truman's decision to commit U.S. forces to combat in Korea in June 1950 without a congressional declaration or authorization marked the decisive break from the constitutional framework. Truman initially cited a UN Security Council resolution as legal authority, terming the deployment a "police action" rather than a war. Key aspects of this precedent:

- Truman's advisors, including Secretary of State Dean Acheson, explicitly argued against seeking congressional authorization, fearing a divisive debate
- Congress acquiesced, appropriating funds for the war without demanding a vote on authorization
- The Korean War involved over 5.7 million U.S. service members, with 36,574 killed and 103,284 wounded
- The scale of combat in Korea without congressional authorization established that a president could fight a major war on executive authority alone

The Korean War created the template for executive war-making that every subsequent president would follow: assert authority, deploy forces, present Congress with a fait accompli, and rely on Congress's reluctance to deny funding to troops already in the field.

## Vietnam and the Reassertion of Congressional Authority

### Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964)

The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (P.L. 88-408), passed on August 7, 1964, after reported attacks on U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin, authorized the President "to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression." The resolution passed the House 416-0 and the Senate 88-2 (Senators Wayne Morse and Ernest Gruening dissenting).

The Tonkin Gulf Resolution became the legal basis for the massive escalation of the Vietnam War. At its peak, over 500,000 U.S. troops were deployed in Vietnam. Key problems:

- The second Tonkin Gulf incident (August 4, 1964) almost certainly did not occur; the Johnson administration misled Congress about the evidence
- The resolution's broad language gave the President effectively unlimited authority to wage war in Southeast Asia
- Congress had authorized war without debate, deliberation, or a clear understanding of what it was authorizing

### War Powers Resolution (1973)

The War Powers Resolution (P.L. 93-148) was enacted on November 7, 1973, over President Nixon's veto, in the aftermath of Vietnam and revelations about secret bombing campaigns in Cambodia and Laos. Its key provisions:

- **Section 2(c)**: The President's Commander-in-Chief power to introduce forces into hostilities is exercised only pursuant to a declaration of war, specific statutory authorization, or a national emergency created by an attack on the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces
- **Section 3**: Requires consultation with Congress before introducing forces into hostilities "in every possible instance"
- **Section 4(a)(1)**: Requires a written report to Congress within 48 hours when forces are introduced into hostilities or imminent hostilities
- **Section 5(b)**: Forces must be withdrawn within 60 days (extendable to 90) unless Congress declares war, enacts a specific authorization, extends the period, or is physically unable to meet
- **Section 5(c)**: Congress can direct withdrawal of forces at any time by concurrent resolution (effectively invalidated by *INS v. Chadha*, 1983)

Nixon's veto message called the WPR "clearly unconstitutional" and argued it would "seriously undermine this Nation's ability to act decisively and convincingly in times of international crisis." No subsequent president has accepted the WPR's constitutionality, and its enforcement mechanisms have never been successfully invoked.

## Post-Cold War Military Operations

### Persian Gulf War (1991)

President George H.W. Bush sought and obtained congressional authorization for Operation Desert Storm (P.L. 102-1, January 14, 1991), but explicitly stated that he did not need it. The authorization passed the Senate 52-47 -- the closest war vote in modern history -- after a genuine deliberative debate. The Gulf War represented a rare case where the constitutional process functioned approximately as designed, though Bush's assertion that he could have acted without authorization undermined the precedent.

### Somalia (1992-1994)

President Bush deployed forces to Somalia in December 1992 for a humanitarian mission; the mission evolved under President Clinton into nation-building and combat operations, including the October 1993 "Black Hawk Down" battle in Mogadishu. Neither president sought specific authorization, and Congress responded to the Mogadishu disaster by setting withdrawal deadlines through appropriations riders rather than invoking the WPR.

### Kosovo (1999)

NATO's 78-day bombing campaign against Serbia represented one of the starkest violations of the War Powers Resolution. President Clinton did not seek congressional authorization; the House voted down a resolution authorizing the air campaign (213-213 tie) and then voted down a resolution requiring withdrawal, effectively taking no position. The administration argued that NATO operations did not constitute "hostilities" under the WPR and that the President had inherent authority to conduct them. A federal court dismissed a challenge by members of Congress (*Campbell v. Clinton*, 2000) on standing grounds.

## The Post-9/11 Era

### 2001 AUMF and Afghanistan

The 2001 AUMF was passed on September 18, 2001, three days after the attacks. It authorized force against those who "planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons." The sole dissenter, Rep. Barbara Lee, warned that the authorization was "a blank check to the President to attack anyone involved in the September 11th events -- anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests."

Lee's warning proved prescient. The 2001 AUMF was initially used for the invasion of Afghanistan but was subsequently stretched to cover operations against dozens of groups in multiple countries. The executive branch developed the "associated forces" doctrine to justify operations against groups that did not exist on September 11 -- including ISIS, which was at war with al-Qaeda -- on the theory that they had entered the fight alongside al-Qaeda or its offshoots.

### 2002 Iraq AUMF and the Iraq War

The 2002 Iraq AUMF (P.L. 107-243) authorized the President to "use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq." Congress voted to authorize force in October 2002 based on intelligence assessments -- subsequently shown to be deeply flawed -- that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had links to al-Qaeda. The Iraq War resulted in over 4,400 U.S. military deaths, tens of thousands of U.S. casualties, and estimates of Iraqi civilian deaths ranging from 150,000 to over 600,000.

### Libya (2011)

President Obama's intervention in Libya through NATO airstrikes beginning in March 2011 produced a significant war powers controversy. The administration argued that the operation did not constitute "hostilities" under the WPR because U.S. forces were not engaged in "sustained fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces" and there was no risk of U.S. casualties. This interpretation was rejected by the administration's own Office of Legal Counsel, and the State Department's Legal Adviser (Harold Koh) substituted a more permissive reading. The operation continued for over seven months without congressional authorization.

### Ongoing Tensions

The period from 2001 to the present has been characterized by continuous military operations under broad executive authority, with Congress failing to either effectively authorize or constrain the use of force. The 2001 AUMF has become the longest-running authorization for the use of military force in American history, stretching across four presidential administrations and covering operations its drafters never contemplated.
