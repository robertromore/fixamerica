# War Powers: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

The constitutional framework for war powers is structurally sound but has been hollowed out by executive practice and congressional abdication. No constitutional amendment is needed to restore democratic accountability over the use of military force. What is needed is statutory reform that closes the loopholes in the War Powers Resolution of 1973, replaces the open-ended 2001 AUMF with narrow and time-limited authorizations, and creates enforcement mechanisms that the executive branch cannot ignore and Congress cannot evade.

This document proposes two federal bills:

1. **The War Powers Reform Act** replaces the 1973 War Powers Resolution with a modernized framework featuring a 20-day authorization trigger, automatic funding cutoffs, expanded definitions covering cyber operations and drone strikes, and elimination of the self-defense exception for non-imminent threats.
2. **The Authorization for Use of Military Force Sunset and Accountability Act** repeals the 2001 AUMF and replaces it with a narrow, threat-specific authorization with a 3-year sunset, geographic limitations, and quarterly reporting.

**Key principles guiding this legislation**:

- Congressional authorization must be specific, time-limited, and subject to regular renewal
- The definitions of "hostilities" and "use of force" must be modernized to cover drone strikes, cyber operations, and proxy warfare
- Enforcement mechanisms must be automatic, not dependent on affirmative congressional action to trigger
- Transparency to Congress and the public must be the default, with classification limited to genuinely sensitive operational details
- The 2001 AUMF must be repealed and replaced, not merely amended

---

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for this legislation. The existing constitutional framework provides ample authority:

- **Article I, Section 8** grants Congress the power "To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water" and "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces."
- **Article II, Section 2** designates the President as "Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States."
- **Article I, Section 9, Clause 7** (the Appropriations Clause) provides that "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law," giving Congress ultimate control over military funding.

The proposed legislation operates within these existing authorities by reasserting congressional prerogatives that have been gradually ceded through executive overreach and congressional acquiescence. The Supreme Court recognized in *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer* (1952) that Congress has broad authority to regulate the use of military force, and that presidential power is at its "lowest ebb" when acting contrary to the expressed or implied will of Congress.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: War Powers Reform Act

**Purpose**: To replace the War Powers Resolution of 1973 (P.L. 93-148) with a comprehensive modern framework that closes the loopholes exploited by presidents since 1973, expands the definition of covered military operations to include drone strikes, cyber attacks, and proxy warfare, shortens the authorization timeline, and establishes automatic enforcement mechanisms that do not depend on affirmative congressional action.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Expanded Definitions**: Defines "hostilities" to include drone strikes, offensive cyber operations causing physical damage, special operations raids, and the provision of essential combat support (targeting intelligence, in-flight refueling) to foreign forces engaged in armed conflict.
2. **20-Day Authorization Trigger**: The President must obtain specific statutory authorization within 20 days of initiating military operations (reduced from the current 60-day period). The shorter timeline prevents presidents from conducting entire military campaigns before the withdrawal requirement takes effect.
3. **Automatic Funding Cutoff**: Absent specific statutory authorization after 20 days, no appropriated funds may be used to continue military operations. This self-executing mechanism avoids the *INS v. Chadha* problem of the legislative veto by relying on Congress's Appropriations Clause power rather than a concurrent resolution.
4. **Narrow Self-Defense Exception**: The President may use force without prior authorization only in response to an actual or genuinely imminent attack on U.S. territory, forces, or citizens. "Imminent" is defined to require evidence of a specific planned attack, not a general or speculative threat. The self-defense exception does not apply to preemptive strikes against non-imminent threats.
5. **Anti-Circumvention Provisions**: Operations conducted under Title 50 (covert action), through proxy forces, or by intelligence agencies are subject to the same authorization requirements if they would constitute "hostilities" if conducted directly by U.S. Armed Forces.
6. **Expedited Congressional Procedures**: War powers authorization resolutions receive privileged consideration -- they cannot be blocked by committee chairs or leadership, must receive a floor vote within 15 legislative days, and are exempt from the Senate filibuster.
7. **Annual Renewal Requirement**: Any ongoing authorization must be renewed annually through a recorded roll-call vote. Failure to renew results in automatic expiration.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To replace the War Powers Resolution of 1973 with a comprehensive
framework for congressional authorization and oversight of the
use of military force.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "War Powers Reform Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds the following:
(1) Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution vests in Congress
the power to declare war, to raise and support armies, to
provide and maintain a navy, and to make rules for the
government and regulation of the land and naval forces.
(2) Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution designates the
President as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy.
(3) The constitutional design requires that the decision to
initiate sustained military operations be made by Congress,
while the conduct of authorized operations is directed by
the President.
(4) The War Powers Resolution of 1973 (Public Law 93-148;
50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.) has failed to achieve its purpose
of ensuring congressional participation in decisions to use
military force. Presidents have routinely evaded its
requirements, and Congress has never enforced its automatic
withdrawal provisions.
(5) Modern military capabilities, including drone strikes,
offensive cyber operations, special operations, and proxy
warfare, have created new forms of hostilities not
contemplated by the War Powers Resolution, which was
designed for conventional troop deployments.
(6) A modernized statutory framework is necessary to restore
the constitutional balance between Congress and the
President regarding the use of military force.

(b) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this Act is to replace the War
Powers Resolution with a comprehensive framework that--
(1) defines covered military operations to include all forms
of hostilities, including drone strikes, offensive cyber
operations, special operations, and essential combat
support to foreign forces;
(2) requires the President to obtain specific statutory
authorization from Congress within 20 days of initiating
covered military operations;
(3) establishes automatic funding restrictions that take
effect absent statutory authorization;
(4) narrows the emergency self-defense exception to cases
of actual or genuinely imminent attack;
(5) prevents circumvention through Title 50 covert action
authorities or proxy warfare; and
(6) establishes expedited congressional procedures to ensure
timely floor votes on authorization resolutions.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) COVERED MILITARY OPERATION.--The term "covered military
operation" means any of the following:
    (A) The introduction of units of the Armed Forces of the
    United States into hostilities or into situations where
    hostilities are imminent.
    (B) The use of lethal force by any agency or
    instrumentality of the United States, including drone
    strikes and targeted killing operations, whether
    conducted under Title 10 or Title 50 authorities.
    (C) Offensive cyber operations directed against a foreign
    nation, organization, or person that are intended to
    cause, or reasonably expected to cause, physical damage,
    casualties, or significant disruption of critical
    infrastructure.
    (D) Special operations raids, direct action missions, and
    unconventional warfare operations.
    (E) The provision of targeting intelligence, operational
    planning, or in-flight refueling to the armed forces of
    a foreign nation or non-state armed group that is
    engaged in hostilities, where such support is essential
    to the conduct of the foreign force's combat operations.
(2) HOSTILITIES.--The term "hostilities" means any situation
in which--
    (A) units of the Armed Forces of the United States are
    actively engaged in exchanges of fire with hostile
    forces;
    (B) lethal force is employed by any agency or
    instrumentality of the United States against any foreign
    nation, organization, or person; or
    (C) offensive cyber operations described in paragraph
    (1)(C) are conducted.
    The term "hostilities" does not include--
    (D) humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations
    where no use of force is anticipated;
    (E) routine training exercises with allied or partner
    forces where no combat operations are planned or
    anticipated; or
    (F) diplomatic protection of U.S. embassies and consulates
    by Marine security detachments.
(3) IMMINENT ATTACK.--The term "imminent attack" means an
attack that--
    (A) is based on specific intelligence indicating a
    particular planned attack;
    (B) is expected to occur within such a short period that
    there is no reasonable opportunity for prior
    congressional authorization; and
    (C) cannot be deterred or prevented through diplomatic
    means or law enforcement action.
    The term does not include general or speculative threats,
    however serious, or the long-term presence of terrorist
    organizations in foreign countries.

SEC. 4. REPEAL OF WAR POWERS RESOLUTION.

covered military operation may continue for more than 20
calendar days after the initial use of force unless Congress
has enacted a specific statutory authorization for such
operation.

(b) EMERGENCY SELF-DEFENSE EXCEPTION.--The President may use
force without prior statutory authorization when--

identification.

SEC. 8. ANTI-CIRCUMVENTION.

(a) COVERT OPERATIONS.--Covered military operations conducted
under Title 50 of the United States Code (covert action) are
subject to the authorization requirements of this Act if they
would constitute hostilities or a covered military operation
under Section 3 if conducted by the Armed Forces under Title 10.

provides training, equipment, or intelligence to partner nation
forces, and those forces subsequently engage in hostilities,
such support does not constitute a covered military operation
unless the United States provides essential combat support as

(5) estimated costs of operations during the reporting
period; and
(6) any changes in the scope, geography, or targets of
operations since the previous report.

SEC. 12. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the
Act and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

```

**Explanation**: The War Powers Reform Act addresses each of the identified failures of the 1973 War Powers Resolution:

- **Shortened timeline** (20 days instead of 60): Prevents presidents from conducting entire military campaigns before the authorization requirement takes effect. The Libya campaign demonstrated that 60 days is long enough to prosecute a major air war.
- **Automatic funding cutoff**: Shifts the burden of action. Under the current WPR, Congress must act to force withdrawal; under this Act, the President must obtain authorization to continue operations. This avoids the *Chadha* problem because it relies on Congress's Appropriations Clause power rather than a legislative veto.
- **Expanded definitions**: Closes the loopholes that allowed presidents to argue that drone strikes, cyber operations, and proxy warfare are not "hostilities."
- **Narrow self-defense exception**: Eliminates the abuse of the "imminent threat" rationale by requiring specific intelligence of a particular planned attack, not general threat assessments.
- **Anti-circumvention**: Prevents the executive from evading the framework by conducting operations under Title 50 or through proxy forces.
- **Expedited procedures**: Ensures that Congress cannot avoid voting by allowing leadership to block floor consideration.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Executive branch will argue the Act unconstitutionally constrains the Commander-in-Chief power
- The definition of "imminent attack" may be contested in practice
- Classification disputes may arise over the required contents of presidential reports
- The anti-circumvention provisions may be difficult to enforce when operations are highly classified

**Refinements**:

- Include a mechanism for judicial review of disputes over the definition of "imminent attack"
- Establish an independent congressional war powers counsel to monitor compliance
- Create a classified reporting track that satisfies notification requirements without compromising genuine operational security

---

### Bill 2: Authorization for Use of Military Force Sunset and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (P.L. 107-40), replace it with a narrow, threat-specific authorization limited to identified terrorist organizations, impose a 3-year sunset clause, and establish geographic limitations and quarterly reporting requirements.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Repeal of 2001 AUMF**: The 2001 AUMF is repealed effective 180 days after enactment, providing a transition period.
2. **Narrow Replacement Authorization**: Authorizes force only against specifically named organizations (al-Qaeda, ISIS) and any associated forces that meet a strict co-belligerency standard.
3. **Geographic Limitations**: Operations are authorized only in specifically named countries, with a mechanism for the President to request addition of new countries subject to congressional approval.
4. **3-Year Sunset**: The authorization expires automatically after 3 years, requiring Congress to affirmatively vote to renew.
5. **Quarterly Reporting**: Detailed quarterly reports on all operations, groups targeted, countries of operation, civilian casualties, and costs.
6. **Prohibition on Executive Expansion**: The President may not extend the authorization to new groups or countries without congressional approval.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force enacted on
September 18, 2001, and to provide a narrow, time-limited
replacement authorization against specific terrorist
organizations.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Authorization for Use of Military
Force Sunset and Accountability Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law
107-40), enacted on September 18, 2001, has been in effect
for more than 24 years, making it the longest-running
authorization for the use of military force in American
history.
(2) The 2001 AUMF has been interpreted by successive
administrations to authorize military operations against at
least 41 organizations in at least 22 countries, far
exceeding the scope contemplated by Congress when it
authorized force against those responsible for the
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
(3) Many of the groups currently targeted under the 2001
AUMF did not exist on September 11, 2001, and have no
operational connection to the attacks of that date.
(4) The executive branch has expanded the scope of the 2001
AUMF through the extra-statutory "associated forces"
doctrine, which has no basis in the text of the statute
and has never been approved by Congress.
(5) Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution requires that
Congress, as the representative body of the American
people, make the decision to commit the nation to armed
conflict.
(6) Open-ended authorizations for the use of military force
are incompatible with the constitutional structure and have
produced over two decades of continuous military operations
without meaningful democratic accountability.
(7) A narrow, time-limited authorization is sufficient to
address genuine terrorist threats while restoring
congressional control over decisions about war and peace.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) ASSOCIATED FORCE.--The term "associated force" means an
organized, armed group that--
    (A) has entered the fight alongside al-Qaeda or the
    Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS);
    (B) is a co-belligerent with al-Qaeda or ISIS in
    hostilities against the United States or its coalition
    partners; and
    (C) poses a direct and imminent threat to the United
    States, its territories, or its armed forces.
    A group may not be designated an associated force
    solely on the basis of--
    (D) shared ideology with al-Qaeda or ISIS;
    (E) past organizational affiliation that has been
    severed; or
    (F) a general statement of support for al-Qaeda or ISIS
    without operational coordination.
(2) COVERED NATION.--The term "covered nation" means a nation
in which the use of force is authorized under this Act, as
listed in Section 5(b).
(3) HOSTILITIES.--The term "hostilities" has the meaning given
in the War Powers Reform Act of 2026, if enacted, or, if not
enacted, means any situation in which lethal force is employed
by any agency or instrumentality of the United States against
any foreign organization or person.

SEC. 4. REPEAL OF 2001 AUMF.

The Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40;
50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is repealed effective 180 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.--The President is authorized to use the Armed
Forces of the United States, and to direct other agencies and
instrumentalities of the United States, to use necessary and
appropriate force against the following organizations:
(1) Al-Qaeda;
(2) The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), including
ISIS-Khorasan, ISIS-West Africa, and ISIS-Greater Sahara;
(3) Al-Shabaab; and
(4) Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

(b) GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE.--Force authorized under this section may
be used in the following nations:
(1) Afghanistan;
(2) Iraq;
(3) Syria;

(5) Yemen; and
(6) Libya.

(c) ADDITION OF COVERED ORGANIZATIONS OR NATIONS.--
(1) The President may request the addition of an organization
or nation to the lists in subsections (a) and (b) by
submitting a report to Congress that includes--
    (A) the name and description of the organization or
    nation;
    (B) specific evidence that the organization meets the
    definition of "associated force" under Section 3(1) or
    that military operations in the nation are necessary to
    address a covered organization;
    (C) the proposed scope and duration of operations; and
    (D) an assessment of alternatives to the use of force.
(2) The addition takes effect 30 days after the report is
submitted, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of
disapproval during such period.
(3) This subsection does not authorize the President to
initiate hostilities in a new nation or against a new
organization without complying with the War Powers Reform
Act of 2026.

SEC. 6. LIMITATIONS.

(a) PROHIBITION ON EXPANSION.--The President may not use force
under this Act against any organization or in any nation not
listed in Section 5, except as provided in Section 5(c).

(b) NO GROUND COMBAT FORCES.--This Act does not authorize the
sustained introduction of ground combat forces into any covered
nation for the purpose of offensive ground combat operations,
unless Congress enacts a separate authorization for such
operations.

(c) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OF WAR.--All operations under this
Act shall comply with the laws of war, including the Geneva
Conventions and applicable customary international law.

(d) NO AUTHORITY FOR DETENTION.--This Act does not authorize

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) QUARTERLY REPORTS.--Not later than 90 days after the date
of enactment of this Act, and every 90 days thereafter, the
President shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress
an unclassified report, with a classified annex as necessary,
that includes--
(1) a description of all military operations conducted under
this Act during the reporting period;
(2) the nations in which operations were conducted;
(3) the organizations targeted;
(4) the number of operations conducted;
(5) an assessment of civilian casualties resulting from
operations during the reporting period, including the
methodology used to make such assessment;

not named in Section 5(a) or added pursuant to Section 5(c);
(3) authorize military operations outside the nations listed
in Section 5(b), except as provided in Section 5(c); or
(4) limit the President's authority to defend the United
States, its territories or possessions, or the Armed Forces
of the United States from actual or imminent attack.

SEC. 10. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act, or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of the
Act and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected thereby.
```

**Explanation**: The AUMF Sunset and Accountability Act directly addresses the core problem of the 2001 AUMF: its open-ended nature has allowed two decades of executive expansion without democratic accountability. Key design choices:

- **Named groups only**: The authorization lists specific organizations rather than using open-ended language that can be stretched to cover new groups.
- **Geographic limitations**: Operations are limited to named countries, preventing the geographic creep that took the 2001 AUMF from Afghanistan to over 22 countries.
- **Strict "associated forces" definition**: The co-belligerency standard requires operational coordination, not mere shared ideology. This closes the loophole that allowed the executive to extend the 2001 AUMF to ISIS (which was at war with al-Qaeda).
- **3-year sunset**: Forces Congress to vote on whether to continue military operations, ending the current pattern of permanent authorization through congressional inaction.
- **No ground combat authorization**: Limits the authorization to counterterrorism operations; any ground invasion requires separate authorization.
- **Quarterly reporting**: Ensures Congress and the public have regular access to information about operations conducted under the authorization.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Executive branch will argue that naming specific groups creates a "whack-a-mole" problem as terrorist organizations rebrand or splinter
- The 180-day transition period may be insufficient for complex operational adjustments
- The geographic limitation may be challenged if a covered organization operates in an unlisted country
- The sunset clause creates uncertainty that adversaries could exploit

**Refinements**:

- The 30-day addition mechanism in Section 5(c) provides flexibility for genuinely emerging threats
- The sunset clause should be paired with expedited renewal procedures to ensure continuity if Congress decides to extend
- An intelligence community assessment should accompany any renewal debate to inform congressional deliberation

---

## State Model Legislation

War powers are a federal matter under the Constitution, and state model legislation is not applicable to this topic. State legislatures have no direct role in authorizing the use of military force. However, state legislatures can:

- Pass resolutions calling on Congress to exercise its war powers responsibilities
- Enact laws restricting the use of state National Guard units in overseas deployments absent a congressional declaration of war or specific AUMF
- Support litigation challenging unauthorized military operations through amicus briefs

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Executive Branch Implementation

No new regulatory agency is required. Implementation responsibilities fall to existing entities:

| Entity | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Office of the President | Submit required notifications and reports; obtain authorization within 20 days |
| Department of Defense | Ensure all military operations comply with authorization requirements; track and report civilian casualties |
| Office of Legal Counsel (DOJ) | Provide legal opinions on the scope of authorized operations; publish unclassified summaries of legal authorities |
| Comptroller General (GAO) | Monitor compliance with funding restrictions; report violations to Congress |
| Director of National Intelligence | Ensure intelligence agencies comply with anti-circumvention provisions; include covert operations in required reporting |
| Inspector General (DoD) | Conduct annual audits of war powers compliance |

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Article I, Section 8 (Congressional War Powers)**: Both bills operate squarely within Congress's enumerated powers to declare war, regulate the armed forces, and control appropriations. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's authority to structure and limit the use of military force since *Little v. Barreme* (1804).

**Article II, Section 2 (Commander in Chief)**: The executive branch will argue that the War Powers Reform Act unconstitutionally constrains the Commander-in-Chief power by imposing a 20-day authorization requirement and automatic funding cutoff. However, the *Youngstown* framework recognizes that presidential power is at its "lowest ebb" when acting against Congress's expressed will, and Congress's appropriations power provides constitutional authority for funding restrictions. The Act preserves the President's ability to respond to actual or imminent attacks.

**Political Question Doctrine**: Courts may continue to avoid war powers disputes despite the congressional standing provision. However, the Act's automatic funding restrictions are enforceable through the Appropriations Clause without requiring judicial intervention -- they are self-executing restrictions on the executive branch's spending authority.

***Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)**: Justice Jackson's concurrence provides the controlling framework. Category One (President acts with congressional authorization) is strongest; Category Three (President acts against congressional will) is weakest. These bills ensure that military operations beyond the self-defense exception fall into Category Three absent affirmative authorization.

***Hamdi v. Rumsfeld*, 542 U.S. 507 (2004)**: The plurality recognized that "a state of war is not a blank check for the President" and that the 2001 AUMF's authorization must be interpreted in light of its text and purpose. The AUMF Sunset Act makes this principle explicit by limiting the authorization's scope and duration.

***INS v. Chadha*, 462 U.S. 919 (1983)**: The War Powers Reform Act avoids the legislative veto problem that undermined Section 5(c) of the 1973 WPR. Instead of requiring a concurrent resolution to compel withdrawal, the Act uses automatic funding restrictions that take effect through the operation of the Appropriations Clause, not through legislative action. Congress acts by authorizing (or declining to authorize) operations, not by voting to disapprove them.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

The bills rely on three reinforcing enforcement mechanisms:

1. **Automatic funding cutoff**: The primary enforcement mechanism. No affirmative congressional action is required; funds are simply unavailable for unauthorized operations after 20 days.
2. **Comptroller General monitoring**: The GAO serves as an independent compliance monitor, reporting violations to Congress.
3. **Congressional standing for judicial review**: If enacted alongside the War Powers Reform Act, allows members of Congress to seek judicial enforcement of the authorization requirements.

### Preemption

War powers are exclusively a federal matter. No preemption analysis is necessary.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### War Powers Reform Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| "Imminent attack" definition gaming | The executive branch may interpret "specific intelligence indicating a particular planned attack" broadly, claiming classified intelligence supports a finding of imminence | Critical |
| Reclassification of operations | Operations may be reclassified from "hostilities" to "training," "advising," or "force protection" to avoid triggering the Act | High |
| Technological circumvention | New forms of military capability (e.g., autonomous weapons) may not fit existing definitions of "covered military operations" | Medium |
| Partner nation loophole | The anti-circumvention provision for proxy warfare requires "essential combat support"; the executive may argue that intelligence sharing or equipment provision is not "essential" | High |
| Classification of required reports | Excessive classification of reports could undermine transparency requirements | Medium |
| Expedited procedures circumvention | Congressional leadership may find procedural mechanisms to delay floor votes despite the expedited procedures | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| No enforcement against the President personally | The Act restricts funds but imposes no personal penalty on a President who violates its terms | Separation of powers; enforcement against the President requires impeachment |
| Congressional will to enforce | The Act creates mechanisms but cannot guarantee Congress will use them; political incentives to avoid war votes remain | Structural political incentives unchanged by statute alone |
| Classified operations detection | Congress may not know about operations that violate the Act if they are conducted covertly | Information asymmetry between branches |
| Speed of judicial review | Even with expedited procedures, court challenges may not be resolved before military operations are complete | Inherent limitations of judicial process |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Establish an independent congressional war powers counsel with security clearances and staff to monitor classified operations and report potential violations to committee chairs
2. Require the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community to conduct annual audits of whether covert operations comply with the Act's anti-circumvention provisions
3. Include a "technology update" provision requiring Congress to review the Act's definitions every 5 years to address emerging military capabilities
4. Create a congressional war powers legal advisor modeled on the Senate Legislative Counsel, providing independent legal analysis to counter executive branch OLC opinions
5. Establish statutory penalties (reduction in appropriations authority) for executive branch officials who misclassify reports to avoid transparency requirements

### AUMF Sunset and Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Article II fallback | The President may cite Article II Commander-in-Chief authority to continue operations after the AUMF expires, arguing that the sunset does not limit inherent constitutional authority | Critical |
| Associated forces expansion | Despite the narrow definition, the executive may apply the "co-belligerency" standard loosely to add new groups | High |
| Geographic workaround | Operations in non-listed countries may be conducted under Article II self-defense or other authorities | Medium |
| 30-day addition mechanism abuse | The addition mechanism for new groups/countries could be used routinely, circumventing the purpose of the named-group limitation | Medium |
| Intelligence agency operations | CIA operations in countries not covered by the Act may continue under Title 50 authorities | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Transition period gaps | The 180-day transition period may not provide sufficient time for operational adjustments in complex theaters | Operational complexity |
| Named-group rigidity | Terrorist organizations rebrand, splinter, and reform; a named-group approach may become outdated within the 3-year authorization period | Nature of non-state threats |
| No detention authority | The Act does not authorize detention, potentially complicating operations that result in captures | Deliberate limitation; detention requires separate legal framework |
| Sunset uncertainty | Adversaries may calculate that the authorization will not be renewed, adjusting their behavior accordingly | Inherent tradeoff between accountability and deterrence |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Pair the 180-day AUMF repeal transition with a mandatory executive branch report identifying all operations that require new authority, with proposed alternative legal bases
2. Establish a congressional fast-track procedure for adding genuinely new threats (beyond the 30-day mechanism) while maintaining the named-group principle
3. Require intelligence community assessments of the threat landscape 6 months before each 3-year sunset to inform the renewal debate
4. Create a separate detention authority framework through companion legislation, ensuring captured individuals are processed under clear legal standards
5. Include a provision requiring the President to certify that no operations are being conducted under Article II authority that would require authorization under this Act

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|---|---|
| Partisan enforcement: Congress challenges the opposing party's president but not their own | Build bipartisan institutional incentives; permanent war powers caucus; automatic procedural triggers |
| Executive branch resistance to reporting | Comptroller General enforcement; IG audits; statutory penalties for non-compliance |
| Public disengagement from war powers issues | Mandatory public reporting; civil society engagement; media access to unclassified reports |
| Interaction between the two bills | Draft both bills as complementary; include cross-references; enact simultaneously if possible |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

Both bills include built-in review mechanisms:

- The War Powers Reform Act requires a 5-year review of definitions to address emerging technologies
- The AUMF Sunset Act expires after 3 years, requiring a full renewal debate
- Annual renewal votes on ongoing authorizations ensure regular congressional engagement
- Quarterly reporting provides the factual basis for informed congressional oversight
