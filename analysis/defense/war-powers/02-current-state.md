# War Powers: Current State

## Status of Existing Authorizations

### 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (P.L. 107-40)

The 2001 AUMF remains in effect more than 24 years after its passage on September 18, 2001. Enacted three days after the September 11 attacks with only one dissenting vote (Rep. Barbara Lee, D-CA), the statute's operative language consists of just 60 words:

> That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.

Despite this narrow text, successive administrations have interpreted the 2001 AUMF to authorize military operations against a continually expanding list of targets:

| Administration | Key Expansions | Legal Theory |
|---|---|---|
| Bush (2001-2009) | Operations in Afghanistan, Iraq (supplementary), Philippines, Horn of Africa | Direct connection to 9/11 plotters and Taliban |
| Obama (2009-2017) | Operations against ISIS in Iraq/Syria, AQAP in Yemen, Al-Shabaab in Somalia | "Associated forces" doctrine; groups co-belligerent with al-Qaeda |
| Trump (2017-2021) | Expanded strikes in Somalia, Niger, expanded definition of ISIS "associated forces" | Continued and broadened "associated forces" doctrine |
| Biden (2021-2025) | Continued operations against ISIS remnants in Syria, al-Shabaab in Somalia | Maintained Obama-era legal framework; sought to narrow but did not repeal |

As of 2025, the 2001 AUMF has been cited to justify military operations in at least 22 countries against at least 41 distinct groups, according to the Brown University Costs of War Project. The Congressional Research Service has documented over 50 unclassified instances of Executive Branch reliance on the 2001 AUMF, and the full classified list is believed to be substantially longer.

### 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq (P.L. 107-243)

The 2002 Iraq AUMF was repealed by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2024, signed into law on March 29, 2023, as part of P.L. 118-1. The repeal had bipartisan support in both chambers, with the Senate voting 66-30 for repeal in March 2023 after years of failed attempts. The repeal was largely symbolic, as the Biden administration had stated it no longer relied on the 2002 AUMF for any ongoing operations, but it removed a legal authority that could have been invoked by future presidents for unrelated military actions in Iraq or the broader region.

### Other Active Authorities

| Authority | Status | Current Use |
|---|---|---|
| 2001 AUMF (P.L. 107-40) | Active | Operations against ISIS, al-Shabaab, AQAP, and "associated forces" |
| Article II Commander-in-Chief | Standing constitutional authority | Cited for self-defense strikes, force protection, and responses to imminent threats |
| Title 10 (Armed Forces) | Standing statutory authority | All DoD military operations |
| Title 50 (Intelligence) | Standing statutory authority | CIA covert operations, including lethal drone strikes |

## War Powers Resolution Compliance

### Structure of the WPR

The War Powers Resolution (P.L. 93-148, 50 U.S.C. 1541-1548) establishes three key requirements:

1. **Consultation** (Section 3): The President "in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities."
2. **Reporting** (Section 4): The President must submit a report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing forces into hostilities or situations where hostilities are imminent.
3. **Withdrawal** (Section 5): Unless Congress authorizes the use of force within 60 days (extendable to 90), the President must withdraw forces.

### Compliance Record

No president has acknowledged the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution's binding provisions. The compliance record since 1973 reveals a consistent pattern of executive circumvention:

| Administration | Notable WPR Issues |
|---|---|
| Ford (1975) | Reported Mayaguez incident; did not trigger 60-day clock |
| Carter (1980) | Iran hostage rescue; no WPR report filed |
| Reagan (1982-83) | Lebanon deployment reported "consistent with" (not "pursuant to") WPR; Marines remained after 60 days until congressional authorization obtained |
| George H.W. Bush (1989-91) | Panama invasion: no WPR report. Gulf War: sought and obtained authorization but stated it was not constitutionally required |
| Clinton (1993-99) | Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo: reported "consistent with" WPR; Kosovo bombing continued beyond 60 days without authorization |
| George W. Bush (2001-09) | Obtained AUMFs for Afghanistan and Iraq but expanded operations well beyond their scope |
| Obama (2011) | Libya: claimed NATO-led operation did not constitute "hostilities" under the WPR despite 7 months of bombing |
| Trump (2017-21) | Syria strikes (2017, 2018): claimed Article II authority; no WPR compliance. Soleimani strike (2020): reported "consistent with" WPR; invoked Article II self-defense |
| Biden (2021-25) | Houthi strikes (2024): initially cited Article II self-defense; later obtained limited reporting to Congress |

The phrase "consistent with the War Powers Resolution" -- used in virtually every presidential war powers report since 1973 -- is itself a deliberate evasion. By reporting "consistent with" rather than "pursuant to" the WPR, presidents avoid acknowledging its constitutional authority and triggering the 60-day automatic withdrawal clock under Section 5(b).

## Recent Military Operations Without New Authorization

### Syria Strikes (2017 and 2018)

President Trump ordered cruise missile strikes against Syrian government targets in April 2017 (59 Tomahawk missiles against Shayrat Airbase) and April 2018 (coordinated strikes with the UK and France against chemical weapons facilities) without congressional authorization or a new AUMF. The administration cited Article II Commander-in-Chief authority and the President's interest in promoting regional stability and deterring chemical weapons use. Neither strike triggered the WPR reporting and authorization requirements, and Congress did not challenge the President's authority.

### Soleimani Strike (January 2020)

The January 3, 2020, drone strike that killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani at Baghdad International Airport was one of the most consequential uses of executive military authority in recent decades. The Trump administration provided shifting legal justifications:

- Initially cited Article II self-defense to address an "imminent threat"
- Subsequently cited the 2002 Iraq AUMF (despite the strike targeting an Iranian official)
- The classified War Powers notification to Congress reportedly contained no evidence of a specific imminent attack plan

The House passed a War Powers Resolution (H.Con.Res. 83) directing the President to cease hostilities with Iran, but the Senate version was non-binding and the effort had no practical effect.

### Houthi Operations (2024-2025)

Beginning in January 2024, the United States conducted sustained military operations against Houthi targets in Yemen in response to attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The Biden administration initially cited Article II self-defense authority, arguing that protecting freedom of navigation and U.S. naval vessels constituted self-defense not requiring congressional authorization. After several weeks of strikes, the administration began providing informal briefings to congressional leadership but never sought a new AUMF or acknowledged the WPR's applicability.

Key aspects of the Houthi operations as a war powers case study:

| Issue | Status |
|---|---|
| Legal authority cited | Article II self-defense |
| Congressional authorization sought | No |
| WPR report filed | Reported "consistent with" WPR |
| Duration beyond 60 days | Yes; operations continued for months |
| Congressional challenge | Several members introduced resolutions; none passed |

## Congressional Reform Attempts

Multiple legislative proposals to reform war powers or repeal/replace the 2001 AUMF have been introduced in recent Congresses without being enacted:

| Bill | Congress | Key Provisions | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| S.J.Res. 10 (Kaine-Young) | 117th (2021) | Repeal 2001 and 2002 AUMFs; require new authorization | Passed Senate Foreign Relations Committee; no floor vote |
| H.R. 256 (Lee) | 117th (2021) | Repeal 2001 AUMF | Passed House 268-161; Senate did not act |
| National Security Powers Act (Murphy-Lee-Sanders) | 117th (2022) | Comprehensive WPR replacement; automatic funding cutoff; cover arms sales and sanctions | Introduced; did not advance |
| S. 1872 (Kaine-Young) | 118th (2023) | Replace 2001 AUMF with 2-year sunset authorization | Introduced; committee referral |
| War Powers Accountability Act | 118th (2024) | Require congressional vote within 20 days of hostilities; automatic funding cutoff | Introduced; did not advance |

The bipartisan repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF in 2023 represented the first successful AUMF repeal since the authorizations were enacted, but it addressed the less controversial of the two authorizations. The 2001 AUMF repeal remains the central unsolved challenge.

## Judicial Engagement

Federal courts have consistently declined to adjudicate war powers disputes on political question doctrine grounds:

| Case | Year | Holding |
|---|---|---|
| *Campbell v. Clinton* | 2000 | Members of Congress lacked standing to challenge Kosovo operations |
| *Doe v. Bush* | 2003 | Dismissed challenge to Iraq War authorization as political question |
| *Smith v. Obama* | 2016 | Army captain lacked standing to challenge ISIS operations under 2001 AUMF |
| *Bates v. Trump* (Houthi challenge) | 2024 | Pending; members of Congress challenged Houthi strikes |

The judiciary's refusal to engage has removed what could be a critical check on executive war-making authority, leaving the contest between Congress and the President as a purely political struggle in which the executive consistently holds the advantage.
