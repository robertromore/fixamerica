# Intelligence Oversight: History

## Historical Development

The history of U.S. intelligence oversight is a recurring cycle: intelligence agencies, operating in secrecy, gradually expand their activities beyond legal and ethical boundaries until a crisis or exposure forces reform. Each wave of reform creates new oversight mechanisms, which are then slowly eroded by executive secrecy, agency resistance, and the passage of time -- until the next crisis begins the cycle anew.

### The Origins: No Oversight by Design (1947-1974)

- **The National Security Act of 1947**: Created the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the modern intelligence community. The Act was deliberately vague about CIA's authorities, granting it the power to perform "other functions and duties related to intelligence" as directed by the National Security Council -- a catchall provision that became the basis for decades of covert action.
- **Congressional Deference**: During the Cold War, Congress chose not to exercise meaningful oversight. Senator Leverett Saltonstall, a member of the CIA subcommittee, captured the prevailing attitude in 1966: "It is not a question of reluctance on the part of CIA officials to speak to us. Instead, it is a question of our reluctance, if you will, to seek information and knowledge on subjects which I personally, as a member of Congress and as a citizen, would rather not have."
- **Unchecked Activities**: Without oversight, the CIA conducted:
    - **MKULTRA (1953-1973)**: Mind control experiments on unwitting American citizens using LSD and other drugs.
    - **COINTELPRO (FBI, 1956-1971)**: Domestic surveillance and disruption of political organizations, including the civil rights movement and anti-war groups.
    - **Operation CHAOS (CIA, 1967-1974)**: Illegal domestic surveillance of American anti-war activists.
    - **Assassination plots**: Attempts to assassinate foreign leaders, including Fidel Castro, Patrice Lumumba, and others.
    - **Warrantless wiretapping**: The NSA's Project SHAMROCK collected all international telegrams entering or leaving the United States from 1945 to 1975, and Project MINARET monitored the communications of American citizens on government watch lists.

### The Church Committee and the Birth of Oversight (1975-1978)

- **The Catalyst**: In December 1974, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published a front-page *New York Times* article revealing the CIA's "massive, illegal domestic intelligence operation" against anti-war activists. This came on the heels of Watergate and a broader erosion of public trust in government.
- **The Church Committee (1975-1976)**: The Senate established the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, chaired by Senator Frank Church (D-ID).
    - **Scope**: The most comprehensive investigation of U.S. intelligence activities ever conducted. The committee held 126 full committee meetings, 40 subcommittee hearings, interviewed over 800 witnesses, and produced 14 volumes of reports.
    - **Key Findings**: Documented decades of illegal domestic surveillance, assassination plots against foreign leaders, warrantless wiretapping of American citizens, infiltration of domestic political organizations, and experimentation on unwitting human subjects.
    - **Recommendation**: Permanent, dedicated congressional oversight committees with statutory authority.
- **The Pike Committee (House, 1975-1976)**: Conducted a parallel investigation that focused on intelligence failures and budget waste. Its final report was leaked and published by *The Village Voice*, embarrassing the committee and strengthening arguments for secrecy.
- **Institutional Reforms**:
    - **Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI)**: Established in 1976 (S.Res. 400).
    - **House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI)**: Established in 1977 (H.Res. 658).
    - **Executive Order 11905 (Ford, 1976)**: Banned political assassinations by U.S. intelligence agencies.
    - **Executive Order 12036 (Carter, 1978)**: Strengthened restrictions on domestic intelligence activities.
    - **Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA, 1978)**: Created the FISA Court to provide judicial oversight of electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, replacing the previous practice of unilateral executive authorization.

### Iran-Contra and the Limits of Oversight (1985-1987)

- **The Scandal**: Senior Reagan administration officials secretly sold arms to Iran (in violation of an arms embargo) and used the proceeds to fund the Contras in Nicaragua (in violation of the Boland Amendment, which prohibited such funding). The operation was run from the National Security Council staff, deliberately bypassing congressional oversight.
- **Key Figures**: National Security Advisor John Poindexter and NSC staffer Lt. Col. Oliver North orchestrated the scheme. CIA Director William Casey was deeply involved but died before he could testify.
- **Oversight Failure**: The affair demonstrated that the executive branch could circumvent congressional oversight by running covert operations through non-IC channels (the NSC) and by deliberately withholding or misleading Congress.
- **Reforms**:
    - **Covert Action Notification**: The Intelligence Authorization Act of FY1991 codified the requirement for the President to issue a written "finding" for all covert actions and to notify Congress "in a timely fashion." The Act also explicitly defined "covert action" for the first time.
    - **Inspector General Act for CIA**: The CIA Inspector General Act of 1989 established a statutory (Senate-confirmed) Inspector General at the CIA, replacing the previous internal IG who reported to the CIA Director.

### Post-Cold War and the "Peace Dividend" (1991-2001)

- **Budget Cuts**: Intelligence spending declined by approximately 18 percent in real terms between 1991 and 1998, as the Cold War rationale for massive intelligence capabilities diminished.
- **9/11 Commission Precursors**: Multiple intelligence failures in the 1990s foreshadowed the catastrophic failure of 9/11:
    - The IC failed to anticipate India's nuclear tests in 1998.
    - The 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania revealed gaps in counterterrorism intelligence.
    - The bombing of the USS *Cole* in 2000 exposed coordination failures between the CIA and FBI.
- **Aldrich Ames (1994) and Robert Hanssen (2001)**: Two devastating espionage cases -- Ames at the CIA and Hanssen at the FBI -- revealed catastrophic counterintelligence failures and raised questions about internal oversight mechanisms.

### September 11 and the Post-9/11 Intelligence Expansion (2001-2008)

- **The Intelligence Failure**: The 9/11 attacks represented the most catastrophic intelligence failure in American history. The 9/11 Commission found that the IC had significant intelligence on the hijackers but failed to "connect the dots" due to inadequate information sharing between agencies, particularly between the CIA and FBI.
- **The Immediate Response**:
    - **USA PATRIOT Act (2001)**: Dramatically expanded surveillance authorities, including "roving wiretaps," access to business records (Section 215), and reduced barriers between foreign intelligence and criminal investigations.
    - **President's Surveillance Program (PSP)**: President Bush secretly authorized the NSA to conduct warrantless wiretapping of Americans' international communications without FISA Court approval, in what the administration called the "Terrorist Surveillance Program." This was revealed by *The New York Times* in December 2005.
    - **Enhanced Interrogation**: The CIA established a network of secret "black site" prisons and employed techniques -- including waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and stress positions -- that many experts and subsequent government investigations classified as torture.
- **The 9/11 Commission (2002-2004)**: The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States conducted a comprehensive review and made 41 recommendations for reform.
- **Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA, 2004)**: The most significant structural reform since 1947:
    - Created the **Director of National Intelligence (DNI)** to coordinate the IC (replacing the Director of Central Intelligence).
    - Established the **National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC)** for integrated threat analysis.
    - Created the **Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB)** to provide independent oversight of counterterrorism programs' impact on civil liberties.
    - Mandated information sharing across agencies.
- **FISA Amendments Act of 2008**: Created **Section 702**, legalizing (with modifications) a version of the warrantless surveillance program. Gave the government authority to collect communications of non-U.S. persons located abroad, even when those communications passed through U.S. infrastructure.

### The Snowden Revelations and Their Aftermath (2013-2018)

- **The Disclosures**: In June 2013, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified documents to journalists at *The Guardian* and *The Washington Post*, revealing:
    - **Bulk metadata collection (Section 215)**: The NSA was collecting the telephone metadata (call records) of virtually all Americans under a secret interpretation of Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act.
    - **PRISM (Section 702)**: The NSA was collecting data directly from major internet companies (Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc.) under Section 702 authority.
    - **Upstream collection**: The NSA was tapping into the internet backbone to collect communications transiting U.S. fiber-optic cables.
    - **Foreign leader surveillance**: The NSA was monitoring the communications of allied heads of state, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
    - **FISA Court rulings**: Previously secret FISA Court opinions revealed that the court had found the NSA in violation of its own rules on multiple occasions but had continued to approve the programs.
- **Impact on Oversight**:
    - **DNI James Clapper's Testimony**: In March 2013, DNI Clapper told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the NSA did "not wittingly" collect data on millions of Americans -- a statement later shown to be false. This severely damaged the credibility of IC leadership before Congress and the public.
    - **Revelation of Oversight Gaps**: The disclosures showed that the FISA Court had approved surveillance programs based on legal interpretations that the public (and most of Congress) did not know existed.
- **Reforms**:
    - **USA FREEDOM Act (2015)**: Ended the NSA's bulk telephone metadata collection program, replacing it with a more targeted system where the government must query records held by telecommunications companies.
    - **Executive Order 12333 Reforms**: The Obama administration issued PPD-28 (2014), imposing new restrictions on signals intelligence collection, including limits on the retention of non-U.S. persons' data.
    - **PCLOB Reports**: The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board issued detailed reviews of the Section 215 and Section 702 programs, finding the former lacked adequate legal basis.

### Recent Developments (2018-Present)

- **Section 702 Reauthorization Battles**: Section 702 has become the central battleground for intelligence oversight:
    - The 2018 reauthorization (FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act) largely preserved existing authorities.
    - The 2024 reauthorization (Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act) extended Section 702 through April 2026 after contentious debate. A bipartisan coalition in the House pushed for a warrant requirement for U.S. person queries but was narrowly defeated.
- **FISA Court Compliance Issues**: Declassified FISA Court opinions have revealed repeated FBI compliance violations in querying Section 702 data, including queries related to political candidates, members of Congress, and Black Lives Matter protesters.
- **Inspector General Independence**: The firing or forced resignation of multiple inspectors general across administrations (including IC IG Michael Atkinson in 2020, who had forwarded the Ukraine whistleblower complaint to Congress) has raised concerns about IG independence.
- **AI and Emerging Technologies**: The IC's increasing use of artificial intelligence for data analysis, facial recognition, and open-source intelligence collection raises new oversight questions that the existing legal framework was not designed to address.
- **Executive Order 14086 (2022)**: Issued in response to the European Court of Justice's *Schrems II* decision, this order imposed new safeguards on signals intelligence collection, including a redress mechanism for EU citizens, and codified elements of PPD-28.
