# Intelligence Oversight: Current State

## The Intelligence Community Structure

The U.S. Intelligence Community comprises 18 agencies and organizations, coordinated (but not fully controlled) by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), a position created by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004.

### IC Member Agencies

| Agency | Parent Department | Primary Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)** | Independent | IC coordination, integration, and budget management |
| **Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)** | Independent | Human intelligence (HUMINT), covert operations, all-source analysis |
| **National Security Agency (NSA)** | DoD | Signals intelligence (SIGINT), cybersecurity, cryptology |
| **Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)** | DoD | Military intelligence, all-source analysis for the Joint Chiefs |
| **National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)** | DoD | Geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), imagery analysis |
| **National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)** | DoD | Design, build, and operate reconnaissance satellites |
| **FBI Intelligence Branch** | DOJ | Domestic counterintelligence and counterterrorism |
| **Department of Homeland Security (I&A)** | DHS | Domestic threat analysis, information sharing |
| **Drug Enforcement Administration (OIA)** | DOJ | Narcotics-related intelligence |
| **Department of State (INR)** | State | Diplomatic intelligence and analysis |
| **Department of the Treasury (OIA)** | Treasury | Financial intelligence, sanctions enforcement |
| **Department of Energy (OICI)** | Energy | Nuclear weapons intelligence, energy security |
| **Army Intelligence (G-2)** | DoD/Army | Army-specific tactical and operational intelligence |
| **Navy Intelligence (ONI)** | DoD/Navy | Naval intelligence, maritime threats |
| **Marine Corps Intelligence** | DoD/USMC | Marine Corps-specific intelligence |
| **Air Force Intelligence (A2)** | DoD/USAF | Aerospace intelligence, targeting |
| **Space Force Intelligence** | DoD/USSF | Space domain awareness, space-based threats |
| **Coast Guard Intelligence** | DHS | Maritime law enforcement intelligence |

### IC Budget

The IC budget is divided into two major components:

| Budget Category | FY2024 Amount | Oversight |
|---|---|---|
| **National Intelligence Program (NIP)** | $72.4 billion | DNI / SSCI / HPSCI |
| **Military Intelligence Program (MIP)** | $29.3 billion | USD(I&S) / Armed Services Committees |
| **Total IC Budget** | **~$101.7 billion** | Multiple committees |

*Source: ODNI, "U.S. Intelligence Community Budget" (2024). The NIP topline has been disclosed since FY2007; detailed breakdowns remain classified.*

The IC budget has grown substantially since 9/11, when total intelligence spending was approximately $30 billion. The topline NIP figure has been publicly released since 2007, but the detailed allocation among agencies and programs remains classified. This means Congress and the public know *how much* is being spent on intelligence in aggregate but not *how* it is being allocated across agencies and programs.

## Congressional Oversight

### The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI)

- **Established**: 1976 (following the Church Committee)
- **Membership**: 15 Senators (8 majority, 7 minority)
- **Jurisdiction**: Authorization of all national intelligence activities; oversight of IC agencies
- **Key Powers**: Authorization of the NIP budget; confirmation of the DNI, CIA Director, and other senior IC officials; receipt of covert action notifications
- **Term Limits**: Members serve a maximum of 8 years (currently)

### The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI)

- **Established**: 1977
- **Membership**: Varies (typically 20-25 Members)
- **Jurisdiction**: Authorization of national intelligence activities; oversight of IC agencies
- **Key Powers**: Authorization of the NIP budget; receipt of covert action notifications
- **Partisan Dynamics**: HPSCI has become significantly more partisan in recent years, particularly during the Trump administration, when the committee became a focal point for disputes over the Russia investigation and impeachment proceedings

### Limitations of Congressional Oversight

- **Information Asymmetry**: Committee members and staff depend on the IC itself to provide the information needed for oversight. The agencies control what Congress sees and when.
- **Classification Barriers**: Most oversight occurs in classified settings. Members cannot discuss what they learn in public, limiting their ability to raise concerns or build public support for reform.
- **Staffing**: The SSCI and HPSCI staffs are small relative to the scope of what they oversee (approximately 30-40 professional staffers each for a $100+ billion enterprise).
- **Competing Priorities**: Committee members have many other responsibilities and cannot devote full attention to intelligence oversight.
- **Gang of Eight**: For the most sensitive covert actions and intelligence activities, notification is limited to the "Gang of Eight" (the chairs and ranking members of SSCI and HPSCI, plus the Speaker and Minority Leader of the House and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate). This constrains informed debate even within the committees.
- **Partisan Weaponization**: Since approximately 2017, HPSCI in particular has been used as a vehicle for partisan investigations, diverting attention from substantive IC oversight.

## The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court)

### Structure and Operations

- **Established**: 1978, by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
- **Composition**: 11 federal district court judges, designated by the Chief Justice of the United States (no Senate confirmation for FISA Court service)
- **Location**: A secure facility within the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.
- **Proceedings**: Almost entirely *ex parte* (only the government presents arguments); no defense counsel or public advocate in most cases
- **Appellate Body**: Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR), consisting of 3 federal judges

### Performance Data

| Metric | 2023 Data | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Applications submitted by government | 466 | FISA Court Annual Report |
| Applications approved in full | 462 | FISA Court Annual Report |
| Applications approved with modifications | 3 | FISA Court Annual Report |
| Applications denied in full | 1 | FISA Court Annual Report |
| Approval rate | 99.6% | Calculated |

*Note: These numbers represent traditional FISA orders for individualized surveillance. Section 702 certifications follow a different process.*

### Section 702 of FISA

Section 702, added by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, authorizes the government to collect the communications of non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. It is the legal basis for programs like PRISM and Upstream collection.

- **Reauthorization**: Section 702 was reauthorized in April 2024 (the Reforming Intelligence and Securing America Act) after intense debate, extending the authority through April 2026.
- **Controversy**: The 2024 reauthorization expanded the definition of "electronic communications service providers" who can be compelled to assist with collection, raising concerns about surveillance scope.
- **Warrantless Queries**: A central controversy is the FBI's ability to query Section 702 data using U.S. person identifiers without a warrant. The 2024 reauthorization imposed new restrictions requiring court orders for queries related to criminal investigations but left a significant national security exception.
- **Scale**: The number of non-U.S. persons targeted under Section 702 reached approximately 246,073 in 2023 (ODNI Annual Statistical Transparency Report).

## The Inspector General System

### Key IC Inspectors General

| Inspector General | Agency | Notable Role |
|---|---|---|
| **IC Inspector General (IC IG)** | ODNI | Community-wide authority; receives whistleblower complaints across the IC |
| **CIA Inspector General** | CIA | Internal CIA oversight; historically subject to politicization |
| **NSA Inspector General** | NSA | Oversees NSA surveillance compliance |
| **DoD Inspector General** | DoD | Oversees defense intelligence agencies (DIA, NGA, NRO) |
| **DOJ Inspector General** | DOJ | Oversees FBI intelligence activities |

### Independence Concerns

- The IC IG was established by the Intelligence Authorization Act of FY2010 but lacks independent subpoena authority and depends on the DNI for budget and staffing.
- Several IC IGs have been fired or forced out under both Democratic and Republican administrations, raising concerns about political interference with independent oversight.
- The IC IG's ability to investigate complaints is constrained by agencies' ability to deny access to certain compartmented programs on "sources and methods" grounds.

## The Classification System

### Current Framework

Classification authority flows from Executive Order 13526 (issued by President Obama in 2009, building on predecessors dating to the Truman administration). Classification levels are:

| Level | Standard | Volume |
|---|---|---|
| **Top Secret** | Exceptionally grave damage to national security | ~5% of classified material |
| **Secret** | Serious damage to national security | ~35% of classified material |
| **Confidential** | Damage to national security | ~60% of classified material |

*Note: Percentages are approximate estimates from the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO).*

### Over-Classification Problem

- The Public Interest Declassification Board (PIDB) has estimated that 50 to 90 percent of classified information is over-classified, meaning it either never should have been classified or should have been classified at a lower level.
- In FY2023, the government made an estimated 16.4 million classification decisions (ISOO Annual Report).
- The cost of maintaining the classification system was estimated at $18.5 billion in FY2023, the last year for which data is available (ISOO).
- Mandatory declassification review backlogs at the National Archives exceed 430 million pages.
- Automatic declassification provisions in EO 13526 (25-year rule) have numerous exemptions that agencies routinely invoke.

## Whistleblower Protections

### Current Legal Framework

| Protection | Coverage | Key Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| **Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA, 1998)** | IC employees reporting to Congress through the IC IG | No protection against retaliation; only provides a reporting channel |
| **Presidential Policy Directive 19 (PPD-19, 2012)** | IC employees and contractors reporting waste, fraud, abuse | Administrative, not statutory; can be revoked by any President |
| **Intelligence Authorization Act of FY2014** | Extended some protections to IC contractors | Limited to prohibition on security clearance retaliation |

### Key Gaps

- IC employees are explicitly **excluded** from the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act (WPEA) that cover most other federal employees.
- There is **no statutory right to a private cause of action** (lawsuit) for IC whistleblowers who face retaliation.
- Security clearance revocation -- the most devastating form of retaliation, as it effectively ends an IC career -- receives only limited administrative protection under PPD-19.
- Reporting channels require whistleblowers to trust the very institutions they may be reporting on. The IC IG is housed within ODNI, which is part of the executive branch chain of command.
