# Intelligence Oversight: Solutions

Reforming intelligence oversight requires a multi-layered approach that strengthens each of the three branches' ability to check intelligence activities, reduces the structural advantages that secrecy confers on the executive branch, and creates genuine protections for those who report wrongdoing from within the system.

---

## 1. Classification Reform

### A. Mandatory Declassification Timelines with Teeth

- **Description**: Replace the current system of discretionary declassification with binding timelines that automatically declassify most intelligence records after a fixed period, with narrow exceptions requiring affirmative agency action and independent review.
- **Implementation**:
    - Establish a default 10-year automatic declassification period for Confidential material, 15 years for Secret, and 25 years for Top Secret (the current EO 13526 provides for 25 years but is riddled with exemptions).
    - Require agencies seeking to extend classification beyond the default period to submit a written justification to an independent review board with the authority to overrule the agency.
    - Create a "Presumption of Openness" standard: information should be unclassified unless a specific, articulable harm to national security can be demonstrated.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Reduces the volume of over-classified material, makes declassification the default rather than the exception, and enables historical accountability for intelligence activities.

### B. Independent Classification Review Authority

- **Description**: Establish an independent body with the authority to audit classification decisions across the IC, order declassification, and impose consequences for systematic over-classification.
- **Implementation**:
    - Transform the existing Public Interest Declassification Board (PIDB) from an advisory body into an independent authority with binding declassification power, modeled on the Government Accountability Office.
    - Staff the authority with personnel holding the highest security clearances, enabling review of all classification decisions.
    - Require annual audits of a random sample of classification decisions across all IC agencies, with public reporting on over-classification rates.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates an external check on classification decisions and introduces accountability for over-classification.

### C. Penalties for Over-Classification

- **Description**: Introduce administrative consequences for officials who systematically over-classify material.
- **Implementation**: Include over-classification as a factor in performance reviews for classifying officials. Establish an administrative penalty structure (ranging from mandatory retraining to loss of classification authority) for repeated violations, as documented by the independent review authority.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Shifts the incentive structure so that there is a cost to over-classifying, not just to under-classifying.

## 2. Strengthened Whistleblower Protections

### A. Statutory Protections for IC Whistleblowers

- **Description**: Extend the Whistleblower Protection Act to IC employees, with appropriate modifications for the classified environment.
- **Implementation**:
    - Enact legislation providing IC employees with a private right of action (the ability to sue in court) if they face retaliation for protected disclosures.
    - Protect disclosures made to the IC IG, congressional intelligence committees, and designated agency officials.
    - Prohibit security clearance revocation as a form of retaliation, with judicial review of clearance actions where retaliation is alleged.
    - Establish an independent adjudicatory panel (outside the IC chain of command) to hear retaliation complaints.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates meaningful legal protections that encourage internal reporting and reduce the pressure to go to the media.

### B. Secure Reporting Channels

- **Description**: Create multiple independent channels for IC employees to report wrongdoing without depending solely on institutions that may be compromised.
- **Implementation**:
    - Establish a dedicated IC Whistleblower Ombudsman within the legislative branch, with staff holding appropriate clearances.
    - Create an encrypted, anonymous reporting system accessible to all IC employees and contractors.
    - Require the IC IG to conduct and report an annual assessment of the health of internal reporting channels.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Reduces the bottleneck of reporting through a single channel (the IC IG) and provides alternatives when the IG is compromised or unresponsive.

### C. Anti-Retaliation Enforcement

- **Description**: Establish robust enforcement mechanisms to deter and punish retaliation against whistleblowers.
- **Implementation**:
    - Authorize courts to award compensatory damages, back pay, reinstatement, and attorneys' fees to prevailing whistleblowers.
    - Create personal liability for supervisors who are found to have retaliated.
    - Require the IC IG to track and publicly report (in unclassified form) retaliation complaints and their outcomes.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates real consequences for retaliation, shifting the cost-benefit calculation for supervisors who might otherwise punish whistleblowers.

## 3. FISA Court Reform

### A. Appoint a Public Advocate (Amicus Curiae)

- **Description**: Create a standing panel of security-cleared attorneys to serve as public advocates before the FISA Court, presenting arguments against the government's position in significant cases.
- **Implementation**:
    - Establish a panel of 5-7 attorneys with Top Secret/SCI clearances, appointed by the FISA Court from nominations by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.
    - Require the FISA Court to appoint an advocate in all cases involving novel legal questions, new surveillance technologies, programmatic surveillance (such as Section 702 certifications), and cases where the court believes a contrary argument would assist its deliberations.
    - Give the advocate access to all government submissions and the right to present written and oral arguments.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Transforms the FISA Court from a one-sided proceeding into something closer to an adversarial process, improving the quality of judicial review.

### B. Reform FISA Court Appointment Process

- **Description**: Diversify the appointment process for FISA Court judges to reduce the concentration of power in the Chief Justice.
- **Implementation**:
    - Require that FISA Court judges be nominated by the Chief Justice from a list of candidates submitted by the Judicial Conference, with input from the Chief Judges of all federal circuits.
    - Mandate that the court's membership reflect geographic and professional diversity, including judges with civil liberties and defense backgrounds (not exclusively former prosecutors).
- **Anticipated Impact**: Produces a more balanced court that is more likely to critically evaluate government surveillance requests.

### C. Publish Significant FISA Court Opinions

- **Description**: Require the declassification and publication of FISA Court opinions that establish significant legal interpretations.
- **Implementation**:
    - Require the Attorney General to conduct a declassification review of all FISA Court opinions within 180 days of issuance.
    - Mandate the publication of opinions (or declassified summaries) that interpret statutes, establish new legal standards, or address constitutional questions.
    - Create a FISA Court transparency report that includes aggregate statistics on applications, approvals, modifications, and denials.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Ends the practice of "secret law" and enables public and congressional debate about the legal scope of surveillance authorities.

## 4. Congressional Oversight Reform

### A. Expand Committee Resources

- **Description**: Dramatically increase the professional staff and technical capacity of the intelligence oversight committees.
- **Implementation**:
    - Double the authorized staff levels for SSCI and HPSCI (from approximately 30-40 to 60-80 each).
    - Create dedicated technical positions for experts in cybersecurity, AI, telecommunications, and surveillance technology.
    - Establish a classified Congressional Research Service division dedicated to intelligence oversight analysis.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Reduces the information asymmetry between the committees and the IC, enabling more informed and probing oversight.

### B. End Gang of Eight Restrictions

- **Description**: Reform the Gang of Eight notification system to enable genuine committee deliberation on covert actions and sensitive programs.
- **Implementation**:
    - Require that all covert action notifications be provided to the full membership of SSCI and HPSCI within 48 hours, with appropriate security arrangements.
    - If the President determines that extraordinary circumstances require initial limited notification, require full committee notification within 14 days.
    - Permit notified members to consult with committee counsel and take notes for personal use.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Transforms Gang of Eight notification from a rubber stamp into a genuine consultation process with the potential for committee deliberation and pushback.

### C. Mandatory Public Hearings

- **Description**: Require regular public hearings on intelligence oversight topics to enable informed public debate.
- **Implementation**:
    - Require at least four public hearings per year by each committee on intelligence oversight topics, including annual public testimony by the DNI, CIA Director, and NSA Director.
    - Require an annual unclassified public report on IC activities, budget trends, and oversight findings.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates regular opportunities for public accountability and reduces the extent to which intelligence oversight occurs entirely behind closed doors.

## 5. Inspector General Independence

### A. Statutory Protections for IC IGs

- **Description**: Protect IC inspectors general from politically motivated removal.
- **Implementation**:
    - Require the President to provide written justification to Congress 30 days before removing any IC inspector general.
    - Establish a for-cause removal standard for IC IGs, requiring documented evidence of malfeasance, incapacity, or neglect of duty.
    - Grant the IC IG independent subpoena authority (currently lacking) and guarantee budget independence.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Insulates IGs from political retaliation and strengthens their ability to conduct independent investigations.

### B. IC IG Empowerment

- **Description**: Expand the IC IG's authority to investigate across the community and to access all relevant programs.
- **Implementation**:
    - Eliminate the ability of agency heads to deny the IC IG access to programs on "sources and methods" grounds.
    - Grant the IC IG the authority to compel testimony from IC employees and contractors.
    - Require the IC IG to report directly to Congress (in addition to the DNI) on significant findings.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Closes the loopholes that agencies use to prevent IG access and ensures community-wide oversight capacity.

## 6. Section 702 and Surveillance Reform

### A. Warrant Requirement for U.S. Person Queries

- **Description**: Require a court order (warrant or FISA Court order) before querying Section 702 data using U.S. person identifiers.
- **Implementation**:
    - Amend Section 702 to require a probable cause court order for all queries using U.S. person identifiers, with a narrow emergency exception requiring retroactive court approval within 72 hours.
    - Apply this requirement to all IC agencies, including the FBI.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Closes the "backdoor search" loophole that allows warrantless surveillance of Americans' communications collected under foreign intelligence authority.

### B. Reduce Incidental Collection

- **Description**: Impose stricter minimization procedures to limit the collection, retention, and use of Americans' communications incidentally collected under Section 702.
- **Implementation**:
    - Require the destruction of incidentally collected U.S. person communications within 30 days unless a court order is obtained.
    - Prohibit the use of incidentally collected communications as evidence in criminal proceedings unrelated to national security.
    - Require annual public reporting on the estimated number of U.S. persons whose communications are collected under Section 702.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Limits the conversion of a foreign intelligence surveillance program into a domestic surveillance tool.
