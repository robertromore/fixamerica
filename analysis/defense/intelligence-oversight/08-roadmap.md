# Intelligence Oversight: Reform Roadmap

Reforming intelligence oversight requires a phased approach that builds momentum by starting with achievable, bipartisan reforms and progressively advancing toward deeper structural changes. The sequencing is designed to create new constituencies for reform at each stage and to demonstrate that stronger oversight does not compromise national security.

---

## Phase 1: Building Accountability Infrastructure (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on reforms that have the broadest political support and that lay the groundwork for subsequent, more ambitious changes.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. IC Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act** | Enact statutory protections for IC whistleblowers, including a private right of action and prohibition on clearance retaliation. | Legislation signed into law. First whistleblower cases filed under the new statute. |
| **2. IG Independence Protections** | Enact for-cause removal protections for IC IGs and grant independent subpoena authority to the IC IG. | Legislation signed into law. IC IG exercises subpoena authority in at least one investigation. |
| **3. FISA Court Public Advocate Pilot** | Establish a standing panel of security-cleared amici curiae for FISA Court proceedings involving novel legal questions or programmatic surveillance. | Panel appointed. Amici participate in at least 10 proceedings in the first year. |
| **4. Committee Resource Expansion** | Double the authorized staff levels for SSCI and HPSCI, with dedicated technical positions. | Staff hiring completed. Committees conduct at least one technically-focused oversight investigation per year. |
| **5. Classification Audit** | Commission a comprehensive, independent audit of classification practices across the IC, with a public report on over-classification rates. | Audit completed. Public report issued with findings and recommendations. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Establish the legal and institutional infrastructure for meaningful oversight -- protected whistleblowers, independent inspectors general, an adversarial voice in the FISA Court, and an informed Congress.

---

## Phase 2: Structural Reforms (Years 3-5)

This phase implements the deeper structural changes to the classification system, FISA Court, and congressional oversight framework.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Intelligence Community Transparency and Accountability Act** | Enact comprehensive legislation establishing mandatory declassification timelines, an independent classification review authority, and public IC budget topline disclosure. | Legislation signed into law. Independent review authority operational. First declassification orders issued. |
| **2. FISA Court Reform** | Reform the FISA Court appointment process, mandate the public advocate in all significant cases, and require publication of opinions establishing significant legal interpretations. | Appointment reform enacted. First declassified FISA Court opinions published. |
| **3. Gang of Eight Reform** | Amend the National Security Act to require full committee notification for covert actions and sensitive programs within 14 days of presidential authorization. | Legislation enacted. First full-committee covert action briefing conducted. |
| **4. Section 702 Warrant Requirement** | At the next reauthorization, amend Section 702 to require a court order for all U.S. person queries. | Amendment enacted. FISA Court begins processing U.S. person query applications. |
| **5. Classification Penalty Framework** | Implement administrative penalties for systematic over-classification, based on findings from the Phase 1 audit. | Penalty framework published. First over-classification findings issued by the independent review authority. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Transform the structural dynamics of oversight by reducing executive branch secrecy advantages, creating adversarial processes in the FISA Court, and empowering Congress with full information.

## Phase 3: Institutionalizing Reform (Years 6-10)

This phase consolidates the reforms, addresses emerging challenges, and builds a sustainable oversight culture.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Comprehensive Declassification** | The independent review authority conducts systematic reviews of Cold War and post-9/11 classified material, ordering declassification where retention is not justified. | Backlog of over-classified material reduced by 50%. Public access to historical intelligence records substantially expanded. |
| **2. AI and Emerging Technology Oversight Framework** | Enact legislation establishing oversight requirements for IC use of artificial intelligence, facial recognition, open-source intelligence collection, and other emerging surveillance technologies. | Framework enacted. IC agencies submit annual compliance reports. |
| **3. Contractor Accountability** | Extend full whistleblower protections to IC contractors and require regular IG audits of contractor-performed intelligence activities. | Contractor whistleblower protections enacted. Annual contractor audit reports issued. |
| **4. Sunset and Reauthorization** | Key surveillance authorities (Section 702, EO 12333 programs) are subject to mandatory reauthorization every 4 years, with public hearings and full committee review. | Reauthorization cycle established. First post-reform reauthorization completed with meaningful debate and amendments. |
| **5. International Oversight Coordination** | Work with Five Eyes and allied partners to establish shared oversight standards for joint intelligence programs. | Bilateral or multilateral oversight agreements concluded. Joint oversight mechanisms operational. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: Create a self-sustaining oversight ecosystem that adapts to new technologies and threats while maintaining the accountability infrastructure built in Phases 1 and 2.

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Indicators

| Metric | Current Baseline | Phase 1 Target | Phase 3 Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| FISA Court application denial/modification rate | <1% | 5% | 10-15% |
| Classification decisions annually | ~16 million | 12 million | 8 million |
| IC whistleblower retaliation complaints resolved favorably | ~10% (est.) | 30% | 50% |
| Public IC budget disclosure | Topline NIP only | NIP + MIP topline + agency breakdowns | Full program-level disclosure for non-sensitive programs |
| Committee staff per $1B of IC budget | ~0.6 | 1.2 | 1.5 |
| Declassification backlog (pages) | 430 million | 350 million | 200 million |

### Qualitative Indicators

- Congressional oversight committees conduct meaningful investigations resulting in policy changes, not just reports.
- IC employees report greater confidence in internal reporting channels (measured by anonymous surveys).
- The FISA Court regularly modifies or rejects government applications, demonstrating genuine adversarial review.
- Major intelligence programs are debated publicly (in appropriate terms) before reauthorization, enabling informed democratic deliberation.
- Classification reform produces a measurable reduction in the volume of classified material without documented damage to national security.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Executive branch resists reforms as encroachments on Article II authority | High | High | Frame reforms as codifying existing norms, not creating new restrictions. Build bipartisan support to veto-proof. |
| Intelligence failure occurs during reform implementation, generating backlash | Medium | Very High | Phase reforms so that operational capabilities are never degraded. Document that stronger oversight improves, not weakens, intelligence effectiveness. |
| IC agencies comply technically but evade the spirit of reforms | High | Medium | Build sunset and review provisions into all reforms. Empower the IC IG and independent review authority to audit compliance. |
| Partisan dynamics prevent bipartisan consensus on reforms | High | High | Begin with reforms that have demonstrated bipartisan appeal (whistleblower protections, audit/waste). Use intelligence failures as catalysts for broader reform. |
| Allied partners reduce intelligence sharing due to transparency concerns | Medium | Medium | Engage Five Eyes partners early in the reform process. Exclude shared programs from automatic declassification without partner consent. |
