# Intelligence Oversight: What Citizens Can Do

## Why Citizen Engagement Matters

Intelligence oversight is often treated as an issue best left to national security professionals, but this attitude is itself part of the problem. The most significant oversight reforms in American history -- the Church Committee, the FISA Court, the USA FREEDOM Act -- all resulted from sustained public pressure following revelations of abuse. Without an informed and engaged public, the structural dynamics of secrecy and executive power will continue to erode accountability mechanisms regardless of which party controls the White House or Congress.

## Individual Actions

### Educate Yourself

- **Read the primary sources**: The Church Committee reports, the 9/11 Commission report, and PCLOB reports on Section 215 and Section 702 are all publicly available and provide essential context for understanding current debates.
- **Follow the reauthorization debates**: Section 702, Executive Order 12333, and other surveillance authorities come up for renewal periodically. Understanding the stakes of these debates is essential.
- **Understand the technology**: Basic knowledge of how digital communications work, what metadata reveals, and how surveillance technologies function will make you a more informed advocate.

### Contact Your Representatives

- **Call or write your Members of Congress**: Specifically urge them to support:
    - Statutory whistleblower protections for IC employees (not just executive orders)
    - A warrant requirement for U.S. person queries of Section 702 data
    - FISA Court reform, including a public advocate
    - Classification reform and declassification mandates
    - Inspector general independence protections
- **Target the right committees**: Members of the Senate and House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Armed Services committees have the most direct influence. If your representative or senator serves on these committees, their office is especially important to contact.
- **Engage during reauthorization windows**: Surveillance authorities face periodic reauthorization. These are the moments of maximum legislative leverage.

### Use FOIA and Public Records

- **File Freedom of Information Act requests**: FOIA is an imperfect tool for intelligence-related records, but it remains one of the few mechanisms for extracting information from the IC. The National Security Archive at George Washington University provides guides for filing effective FOIA requests.
- **Support FOIA litigation**: Organizations like the ACLU, EFF, and the National Security Archive use FOIA lawsuits to compel the release of significant documents. Supporting these organizations supports the litigation.

### Support Whistleblowers

- **Donate to whistleblower defense funds**: Whistleblowers who face prosecution or retaliation incur enormous legal costs. The Government Accountability Project, the Whistleblower and Source Protection Defence Fund, and similar organizations provide legal support.
- **Speak up when whistleblowers are punished**: Public support matters. When an IC whistleblower faces retaliation, public attention and political pressure can influence outcomes.

### Participate in the Political Process

- **Vote on intelligence oversight**: Make intelligence oversight a factor in your voting decisions. Ask candidates where they stand on surveillance reform, whistleblower protections, and classification reform.
- **Support candidates who prioritize oversight**: Candidates who have demonstrated a commitment to civil liberties and government accountability are more likely to push for oversight reform in office.

## Community Actions

### Organize Local Advocacy

- **Host educational events**: Screen documentaries like *Citizenfour* (about Edward Snowden) or invite speakers from organizations like EFF or ACLU to discuss surveillance reform.
- **Form local advocacy groups**: Connect with existing organizations or form new groups focused on intelligence oversight and civil liberties.
- **Engage local media**: Write op-eds and letters to the editor about intelligence oversight issues, particularly during reauthorization debates.

### Engage with Academic Institutions

- **Support academic research**: Universities with national security law programs (Georgetown, Yale, NYU, George Washington) produce research that informs reform debates.
- **Attend public lectures and panels**: Many universities host public events on intelligence policy and civil liberties.

### Participate in Public Comment Periods

- **Executive orders and regulations**: When the executive branch proposes changes to intelligence policies, public comment periods provide an opportunity for input. ODNI, DOJ, and DHS all issue proposed rules related to surveillance and intelligence activities.

| **Section 702 reauthorization** | Next expiration: April 2026 | The most significant recurring legislative opportunity for surveillance reform |
| **FISA Court annual report** | Published annually | Provides data on surveillance activity and approval rates |
| **ODNI annual transparency report** | Published annually | Provides aggregate data on the use of surveillance authorities |
| **IC IG reports** | Ongoing | May reveal compliance violations or systemic issues |
| **Inspector general nominations and removals** | Ongoing | IG independence is a leading indicator of oversight health |
| **Classification reform executive orders** | As issued | Presidential action on classification policy signals reform direction |

## The Citizen's Role in the Oversight Cycle

Intelligence oversight reform follows a predictable cycle:

1. **Abuse occurs in secrecy**
2. **A whistleblower, journalist, or investigation reveals the abuse**
3. **Public outrage creates political pressure for reform**
4. **Congress enacts reforms**
5. **Time passes; secrecy erodes the reforms**
6. **The cycle repeats**

The citizen's role is to shorten this cycle by maintaining pressure between crises, supporting the institutions and individuals that expose abuse, and demanding structural reforms that are harder to erode -- statutory protections rather than executive orders, independent oversight bodies rather than internal reviews, and adversarial processes rather than ex parte proceedings.
