# Alliances and Partnerships: What You Can Do

The debate over the cost and purpose of U.S. alliances is a fundamental part of the broader discussion about America's role in the world. Informed citizens can play a crucial role in shaping this debate.

## 1. Understand the Commitments

- **Know What a Treaty Means**: Understand that a mutual defense treaty like NATO's Article 5 is a solemn commitment to treat an attack on an ally as an attack on the United States. This is the most serious promise a nation can make.
- **Follow the Burden-Sharing Debate**: Look up the latest NATO defense spending figures. Understand the arguments for why allies should spend more and the political constraints they face.
- **Learn the Geography**: Understand why the security of the "Suwalki Gap" between Poland and Lithuania is critical for defending the Baltic states, or why the "First Island Chain" is central to deterring aggression in the Pacific.

## 2. Engage with Your Representatives

Congress authorizes funding for U.S. military activities in support of alliances and ratifies new treaties.

- **Ask About Priorities**: At a town hall, ask your representative or senator: "Do you believe the U.S. should prioritize deterring Russia in Europe or China in Asia, and how should our alliance commitments reflect that choice?"
- **Ask About Burden-Sharing**: "What is your position on NATO burden-sharing? Do you support conditioning the U.S. presence in Europe on allies meeting their 2% spending commitments?"
- **Support Funding for Alliance Initiatives**: Voice your support for funding streams like the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI) and the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI), which are the primary mechanisms for resourcing U.S. commitments in those theaters.

## 3. Support Transatlantic and Transpacific Ties

- **Engage with Allied Cultures**: The strength of alliances is built on a foundation of shared values and mutual understanding. Support for cultural exchange programs, international student programs, and tourism helps strengthen these people-to-people ties.
- **Follow Allied Media**: Read news sources from allied countries (e.g., the BBC, Der Spiegel, The Japan Times) to understand their perspective on global security and the U.S. role in the world.

## 4. Participate in the Strategic Debate

- **Engage with Think Tanks**: Follow the work of organizations that focus on U.S. alliances, from those who advocate for strengthening them (like CNAS or CSIS) to those who argue for retracting them (like the Cato Institute).
- **Advocate for Your Position**: Whether you believe the U.S. should double down on its alliances or pull back from its global commitments, make your voice heard through letters to the editor, engagement on social media, and direct communication with your elected officials.
