# Alliances and Partnerships: Overview

## Overview

The United States' global network of alliances is its most significant asymmetric advantage in an era of renewed great power competition. Unlike rivals such as China and Russia, the U.S. is bound by formal treaties and informal partnerships to dozens of nations, creating a collective security architecture that has underpinned global stability for over 70 years. The 2022 National Defense Strategy identifies strengthening these alliances as a central line of effort, essential for deterring aggression and prevailing in conflict.

However, this system faces profound challenges. Persistent "burden-sharing" debates, particularly within NATO, raise questions about equity and commitment. Alliances forged during the Cold War must adapt to modern threats that transcend geography, such as cyber attacks, space warfare, and technological competition in AI and autonomy. Furthermore, the U.S. and its allies face the strategic dilemma of confronting an acute threat from Russia in Europe while simultaneously preparing for the long-term pacing challenge from China in the Indo-Pacific, straining resources and strategic focus.

## Scope

This analysis examines the primary components of the U.S. alliance system:

- **Transatlantic Alliance**: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and its role in European security and collective defense against Russia.
- **Indo-Pacific Alliances**: The "hub-and-spokes" system of bilateral mutual defense treaties with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand.
- **Minilateral Security Partnerships**: Modern, flexible groupings focused on specific challenges, including AUKUS (technology sharing) and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad).
- **Burden-Sharing**: The debate over equitable contributions to collective defense, centered on NATO's 2% of GDP defense spending guideline.
- **Alliance Modernization**: Efforts to adapt alliances to new domains like cyber and space and new challenges like supply chain security and technological competition.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| NATO Members | 32 | NATO, 2024 |
| NATO Members Meeting 2% GDP Target (2024 est.) | 23 | NATO, 2024 |
| U.S. Troops Stationed in Europe | ~65,000 | DoD, 2025 |
| U.S. Troops Stationed in Japan & South Korea | ~80,000 | DoD, 2025 |
| AUKUS Partnership | U.S., UK, Australia | White House, 2021 |
| AUKUS Pillar 2 Focus | AI, quantum, cyber, hypersonics | DoD, 2023 |
| Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) | U.S., Japan, Australia, India | State Dept. |
| U.S. Share of Total NATO Defense Spending | ~68% | NATO, 2024 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Burden-Sharing vs. U.S. Influence**: Pressuring allies to spend more on defense can increase their capability but may also lead them to demand more say in strategy, potentially constraining U.S. action.
- **Europe vs. Asia Focus**: Allocating U.S. military assets (e.g., naval ships, ISR platforms) to deter Russia in Europe directly reduces their availability to deter China in the Indo-Pacific.
- **Alliance Cohesion vs. Strategic Clarity**: Maintaining consensus among 32 NATO allies can lead to slower decision-making and watered-down strategies compared to more agile, unilateral action.
- **Enlargement vs. Deepening**: Should alliances like NATO focus on adding new members, or on improving the capabilities and interoperability of existing members?
- **Technology Sharing vs. Security**: Sharing advanced technology (like in AUKUS) strengthens allies but increases the risk of leaks and espionage.

## Key Questions

1.  Is the 2% of GDP spending target the right metric for measuring allied contributions, or should the focus be on specific capabilities?
2.  How can the U.S. and its allies deter both Russia and China simultaneously without overstretching their forces?
3.  Are Cold War-era alliance structures, designed for a single threat, adaptable enough for the complex, multi-domain challenges of the 21st century?
4.  How can the U.S. better integrate its European and Indo-Pacific alliance systems to address the global challenge posed by China?

## Vision of Success

A successful alliance strategy would feature a global network of capable, interoperable, and resilient allies who:

- **Take primary responsibility** for their own regional defense, supported by unique U.S. enablers.
- **Actively contribute** to addressing global security challenges, from maritime security to cyber defense.
- **Seamlessly integrate** their military forces and defense industrial bases with the United States.
- **Present a united front** to deter aggression from autocratic rivals.
