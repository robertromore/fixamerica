# Alliances and Partnerships

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of the United States' network of security alliances and partnerships, which form the cornerstone of its national defense strategy.

## Overview

In an era of renewed great power competition, the U.S. considers its global network of alliances its primary asymmetric advantage over rivals like China and Russia. This analysis examines the structure, purpose, and current state of America's most critical security commitments, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the web of bilateral treaties in the Indo-Pacific.

It explores the persistent challenges of burden-sharing, the need to adapt Cold War-era alliances to 21st-century threats like cyber and space warfare, and the strategic tension between focusing on the "acute threat" of Russia in Europe and the "pacing challenge" of China in Asia. The analysis also covers emerging security architectures like AUKUS and the Quad, which are central to the competition in technology and influence.
