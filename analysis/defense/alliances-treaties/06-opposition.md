# Alliances and Partnerships: Opposition to Reform

The U.S. alliance system, while enjoying broad bipartisan support, faces persistent criticism from various ideological perspectives. These arguments challenge the cost, risk, and fundamental purpose of America's global security commitments.

## The "Restraint" or "Non-Interventionist" Opposition

This is the most fundamental opposition, arguing against the very concept of permanent, entangling alliances.

| Argument | Proponents' Claim | Rebuttal / Counterpoint |
|---|---|---|
| **Alliances are Entangling and Risk War** | Formal defense treaties like NATO's Article 5 are a tripwire that could automatically drag the U.S. into a major war over a distant conflict that is not a vital U.S. interest (e.g., a border dispute involving a Baltic state). | Alliances are a tool of deterrence, not entanglement. Their purpose is to prevent war by making the cost of aggression clear to an adversary *before* they act. The risk of being dragged into a war is lower than the risk of a major war erupting in a world without U.S. alliances. |
| **Alliances Enable Free-Riding** | U.S. security guarantees create a moral hazard, allowing wealthy allies in Europe and Asia to underinvest in their own defense and spend the money on social programs, knowing the U.S. will bear the cost of protecting them. | While burden-sharing is a real problem, the benefits of alliances—forward basing, intelligence sharing, diplomatic support, and legitimacy—far outweigh the costs of free-riding. The U.S. underwrites the system because it is in its own interest to do so. |
| **Alliances are Obsolete** | NATO was created to counter the Soviet Union, which no longer exists. Maintaining and expanding it only provokes Russia and is a solution in search of a problem. | The 2022 invasion of Ukraine demonstrated that the threat of Russian aggression is real and that NATO is more relevant than ever. The alliance provides a proven framework for collective defense that would be impossible to replicate from scratch. |

**Key Opposing Stakeholders**:

- **Libertarian-leaning think tanks** (e.g., Cato Institute).
- **Realist academics** who advocate for an "offshore balancing" strategy.
- **"America First" nationalists** who view alliances as a drain on U.S. resources.

## The Progressive Opposition

This opposition is less focused on the existence of alliances and more on their perceived role in promoting U.S. militarism and high defense spending.

| Argument | Proponents' Claim | Rebuttal / Counterpoint |
|---|---|---|
| **Alliances Justify a Bloated Defense Budget** | The need to maintain a global presence and support dozens of allies is used as a primary justification for a defense budget that crowds out domestic priorities like healthcare and climate change. | The U.S. defense budget is driven by the threats the nation faces, not by its alliances. In fact, by pooling resources, alliances allow for a more efficient defense than if the U.S. had to provide for its security alone. |
| **Alliances Provide Cover for U.S. Interventionism** | The U.S. uses alliances like NATO to provide a veneer of multilateral legitimacy for its own unilateral military interventions. | Most major alliance operations (e.g., the Balkans, Afghanistan) have been the result of broad consensus. When the U.S. has acted unilaterally (e.g., Iraq 2003), it has often been in the face of opposition from key allies, demonstrating the limits of U.S. influence. |

**Key Opposing Stakeholders**:

- **Progressive foreign policy groups** and members of Congress.
- **Anti-war and disarmament organizations**.

## Opposition to Specific Alliance Policies

- **Opposition to NATO Enlargement**: Some critics, even those who support NATO's existence, argue that expanding the alliance to include countries like Ukraine or Georgia needlessly provokes Russia and extends U.S. security guarantees too far.
- **Opposition to AUKUS**: Critics in the arms control community argue that sharing nuclear submarine technology with Australia undermines non-proliferation norms. Some foreign policy experts argue it needlessly antagonized France and divided Western allies.
