# Alliances and Partnerships: Stakeholders

The U.S. alliance system is a complex web of stakeholders with overlapping but often distinct interests. Understanding these interests is key to navigating alliance politics.

## Key Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **The United States** | Maintaining a stable, U.S.-led global order; forward defense; preventing the rise of a Eurasian hegemon. | The world's largest military and economy; control of the global reserve currency; leadership of key alliances. |
| **"Frontline" Allies** (e.g., Poland, Baltic States, Taiwan, South Korea) | Deterring direct military aggression from a powerful neighbor (Russia or China). | Geographic location; willingness to spend heavily on defense; providing basing and access for U.S. forces. |
| **Major European Allies** (e.g., Germany, France, UK) | Maintaining European stability; economic prosperity; strategic autonomy. | Significant economic and military power; leadership roles within NATO and the EU. |
| **Key Indo-Pacific Allies** (e.g., Japan, Australia) | Countering Chinese coercion; maintaining freedom of navigation; securing supply chains. | Advanced economies and militaries; strategic geography; deep integration with U.S. forces. |
| **NATO Bureaucracy** (Brussels HQ) | Preserving the relevance and cohesion of the alliance; managing the consensus-based decision-making process. | Control of NATO's institutional machinery; role as a neutral arbiter between member states. |
| **U.S. Combatant Commands** (EUCOM & INDOPACOM) | Ensuring interoperability with allied forces; maintaining access for U.S. troops; executing war plans. | Direct operational control of deployed U.S. forces in their respective theaters. |
| **U.S. and Allied Defense Industries** | Securing contracts for equipment sales, driven by interoperability requirements. | Lobbying their respective governments; control of jobs and technology. |

## Stakeholder Conflicts and Dynamics

### The Burden-Sharing Conflict

- **U.S. vs. Western European Allies**: The U.S. consistently pushes for allies like Germany and Canada to meet the 2% GDP defense spending target.
- **Germany's Position**: Faces domestic political pressure to prioritize social spending and has a post-WWII strategic culture that is hesitant to embrace military power.
- **U.S. Position**: Argues that Germany is a wealthy country that is free-riding on U.S. security guarantees.

### The Threat Perception Conflict

- **U.S./Eastern Europe vs. Western Europe (on China)**: The U.S. and frontline states like Lithuania view China as a systemic threat.
- **Germany/France's Position**: View China primarily as a vital economic partner and are reluctant to take a hard-line security stance that could jeopardize trade.
- **Result**: This conflict makes it difficult for NATO to form a united policy on China.

### The Strategic Autonomy Conflict

- **France vs. U.S./NATO**: France has long championed the idea of "strategic autonomy" for Europe, meaning the ability to act militarily without relying on the United States.
- **U.S. Position**: Often views this as an attempt to weaken NATO and duplicate efforts. The U.S. prefers a model where European defense is built within the NATO framework, led by the U.S.
- **Result**: A persistent tension between efforts to strengthen the EU's defense capabilities and efforts to strengthen NATO.

### The AUKUS Dynamic

- **U.S./UK/Australia vs. France**: The surprise announcement of the AUKUS pact, which led to Australia canceling a major submarine contract with France, caused a major diplomatic rift.
- **Interests**:
    - **U.S./UK**: Wanted to bind Australia into a long-term, high-tech partnership focused on China and share sensitive technology with a highly trusted ally.
    - **Australia**: Wanted the best possible submarine technology to counter China.
    - **France**: Lost a massive defense contract and felt excluded from a key Indo-Pacific security arrangement.
- **Result**: While AUKUS significantly strengthened the U.S. position in the Pacific, it temporarily damaged relations with a key European ally, highlighting the difficulty of managing alliances across different theaters.
