# Alliances and Partnerships: Reform Roadmap

Modernizing the U.S. alliance system requires a phased approach that builds consensus, demonstrates value, and systematically adapts old structures to new challenges.

---

## Phase 1: Building Consensus and Addressing Urgent Gaps (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on securing allied buy-in for a new strategic direction and addressing the most immediate capability shortfalls.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Launch "Responsibility-Sharing" Initiative** | At a NATO summit, the U.S. formally proposes a shift from the 2% GDP target to a capabilities-based "responsibility-sharing" model. | NATO agrees to conduct a new capabilities review and develop a new force generation model. |
| **2. Clear the FMS Backlog** | The President uses executive authority to create an FMS "fast track" for Taiwan and key frontline NATO allies (Poland, Romania, Baltics). | The delivery backlog for key systems (e.g., HIMARS, anti-ship missiles) to frontline allies is reduced by 50%. |
| **3. Establish Atlantic-Pacific Dialogue** | The U.S. hosts the first ministerial-level meeting of the "Atlantic-Pacific Council" with NATO leadership and Indo-Pacific partners. | A joint statement is issued identifying shared challenges and establishing working groups on tech standards and supply chains. |
| **4. Integrate Cyber Defense** | NATO formally agrees that a major cyber attack could trigger Article 5 and conducts its first large-scale exercise simulating this scenario. | Article 5 cyber doctrine is formally adopted. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Secure political agreement for a new alliance framework and plug the most dangerous deterrence gaps in Europe and Asia.

## Phase 2: Implementation and Integration (Years 3-5)

This phase focuses on turning the new strategic concepts into concrete capabilities and integrated operational plans.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Implement NATO Responsibility-Sharing** | The first set of allies formally commit to providing specific capabilities under the new model (e.g., Germany commits to 3 heavy divisions). | At least 5 major allies have their new capability commitments integrated into NATO's operational plans. |
| **2. Expand AUKUS Pillar II** | Japan is formally invited to join and collaborate on specific AUKUS Pillar II projects, such as hypersonics and AI. | A formal U.S.-Japan-Australia joint R&D project on hypersonics is launched. |
| **3. Build a Resilient Supply Chain Network** | The Atlantic-Pacific Council agrees on a framework for coordinating investment and securing supply chains for critical minerals and microchips. | A joint fund is established to invest in new mining and fabrication capacity outside of China. |
| **4. Operationalize Joint Exercises** | The U.S. conducts its first major joint exercise that involves both NATO and Indo-Pacific allies operating together in a single scenario. | Exercise "Global Defender" is successfully completed. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Move from concepts to reality. Allies begin fielding the capabilities they promised, and the transatlantic and Indo-Pacific alliance systems start to operate as an integrated network.

## Phase 3: Maturing the Global Democratic Arsenal (Years 6-10)

This phase focuses on achieving a fully integrated, capable, and resilient network of alliances that can deter and, if necessary, defeat aggression from peer competitors.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Achieve NATO Force Goals** | European allies are providing the bulk of the conventional forces required to defend Europe, with the U.S. primarily in a supporting and enabling role. | European allies provide 80% of the ground forces for NATO's eastern flank defense plan. |
| **2. Field Jointly Developed Technologies** | The first weapon systems developed under AUKUS Pillar II (e.g., an autonomous drone swarm) achieve initial operational capability. | Jointly developed AI-enabled ISR system is deployed on U.S., UK, and Australian platforms. |
| **3. A Fully Networked Alliance** | A secure communications and data-sharing network links NATO and key Indo-Pacific allies, enabling a common operational picture. | A common, secure network is used in a joint exercise involving forces from both theaters. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: The U.S. alliance system has transformed from a set of regional, U.S.-led pacts into a global, integrated network of capable democracies.
