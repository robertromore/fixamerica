# Alliances and Treaties: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative framework for U.S. alliances and treaties aims to modernize a system built for the Cold War to meet the challenges of 21st-century great power competition. Current policy relies on foundational treaties like the North Atlantic Treaty (1949) and various bilateral agreements, but lacks clear mechanisms for burden-sharing, adapting to new domains like cyber and space, and streamlining security cooperation with non-treaty partners.

This legislative approach focuses on three pillars: (1) codifying burden-sharing expectations within NATO to ensure equitable contributions; (2) establishing a flexible framework for security cooperation with Indo-Pacific partners to counter China; and (3) reforming arms sales and technology transfer processes to make the U.S. a more reliable and agile partner. The strategy seeks to strengthen alliances by making them more sustainable and adaptable, moving beyond informal commitments to statutory requirements and authorities.

The constitutional basis for this legislation rests primarily on Congress's Article I powers to raise and support armies, regulate foreign commerce, and appropriate funds, complemented by the President's Article II treaty power and Commander-in-Chief authority. The *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), framework provides the analytical foundation for ensuring that executive implementation of alliance commitments operates within the strongest possible constitutional zone of authority. Both proposed bills are designed to maximize congressional-executive collaboration while preserving appropriate flexibility for the executive branch to manage day-to-day alliance relationships.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required. The President's power to make treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate (Article II, Section 2) and Congress's power to regulate foreign commerce and declare war (Article I, Section 8) provide ample authority for managing alliances and security agreements.*

## Federal Legislation

### The NATO Burden-Sharing and Modernization Act

**Purpose**: To codify the NATO 2% GDP defense spending and 20% modernization investment targets into U.S. law, requiring an annual certification of compliance and linking U.S. basing and security assistance decisions to allied performance.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Standalone bill referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, with sequential referral to the Armed Services committees in both chambers. Could alternatively be incorporated as a title within the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Codification of Targets**: Formally incorporates the 2% of GDP defense spending and 20% of defense spending on major equipment targets into U.S. law as the baseline expectation for NATO allies.
2. **Annual Certification**: Requires the President to submit an annual report to Congress certifying which allies have met the targets.
3. **Burden-Sharing Impact Statements**: Mandates that any proposal for new U.S. permanent basing or significant force increases in a NATO country be accompanied by a statement analyzing the host nation's burden-sharing performance.
4. **Security Assistance Linkage**: Prioritizes security assistance and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for NATO allies that meet or have a credible plan to meet the spending targets.
5. **Resilience and Cyber Contributions**: Expands the definition of "burden-sharing" to include contributions to energy security, critical infrastructure resilience, and collective cyber defense.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To promote equitable burden-sharing within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to modernize the Alliance for 21st-century threats.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "NATO Burden-Sharing and Modernization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been the cornerstone of transatlantic security for over 75 years, and collective defense under Article 5 has been invoked only once, following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
(2) At the 2014 Wales Summit, all NATO allies pledged to spend a minimum of 2 percent of their Gross Domestic Product on defense and 20 percent of their defense budget on major equipment by 2024.
(3) As of 2024, only 23 of 32 allies were projected to meet the 2 percent target, placing a disproportionate burden on United States taxpayers (NATO Annual Report, 2024).
(4) The United States accounted for approximately 68 percent of total NATO defense expenditures in 2023, spending approximately $886,000,000,000 on defense, while the remaining 31 allies spent a combined total of approximately $380,000,000,000 (SIPRI Military Expenditure Database, 2024).
(5) European NATO allies collectively increased defense spending by approximately 11 percent in real terms between 2014 and 2024, yet the gap between United States and allied contributions remains substantial and strategically unsustainable (NATO Defence Expenditure Report, 2024).
(6) Equitable burden-sharing is essential for the long-term political sustainability and military credibility of the Alliance, and failure to achieve it risks eroding domestic support for transatlantic commitments in the United States Congress.
(7) NATO's 2022 Strategic Concept identified Russia as the "most significant and direct threat" to allied security, while also recognizing for the first time that the People's Republic of China poses "systemic challenges" to Euro-Atlantic security (NATO Strategic Concept, Madrid, 2022).
(8) Modern security requires investment not only in conventional military forces but also in resilience against cyber, energy, and economic coercion, as reflected in the 2016 NATO Cyber Defence Pledge and the 2023 Vilnius Summit commitments on resilience.
(9) The Government Accountability Office has repeatedly found that existing mechanisms for tracking allied contributions lack standardization, making accurate cross-national comparisons difficult (GAO-19-548, GAO-22-104401).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) NATO.—The term "NATO" means the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
(2) BURDEN-SHARING TARGETS.—The term "burden-sharing targets" means the commitment by each NATO member to spend a minimum of 2 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on defense and 20 percent of its annual defense spending on major new equipment, including related research and development.

SEC. 5. CONSIDERATION OF BURDEN-SHARING IN BASING AND ASSISTANCE DECISIONS.

(a) BASING DECISIONS.—Any formal proposal by the Secretary of Defense to permanently station new combat forces in a NATO member country shall be accompanied by a report to Congress detailing the host nation's compliance with burden-sharing targets.
(b) SECURITY ASSISTANCE.—In allocating Foreign Military Financing and other security assistance among NATO allies, the Secretary of State shall give preference to countries that have met the burden-sharing targets.
(c) WAIVER AUTHORITY.—The President may waive the requirements of subsection (a) or (b) with respect to a specific ally for a period of not more than 1 year if—
    (1) the President determines that such waiver is in the vital national security interest of the United States;
    (2) the President submits to the appropriate congressional committees a detailed, unclassified justification for the waiver within 15 days of exercising such authority; and
    (3) the waiver is not renewed more than once without separate congressional notification.

SEC. 6. EXPANDED DEFINITION OF CONTRIBUTIONS.

(a) RESILIENCE ASSESSMENT.—The President's annual report shall include an assessment of each ally's resilience contributions, including:
    (1) investments in energy infrastructure that reduce dependence on strategic adversaries;

(c) AVAILABILITY.—Amounts authorized under this section shall remain available until expended.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Establishes precise definitions that close loopholes, particularly the inclusion of "resilience contributions" which ensures non-military investments in energy security and cyber defense are formally counted.
- **Section 4**: Creates a formal, annual accountability mechanism that forces a public conversation about which allies are meeting their commitments. The March 1 deadline aligns with the congressional budget cycle, ensuring burden-sharing data is available before appropriations decisions.
- **Section 5**: Links U.S. posture and assistance directly to allied performance, creating a tangible incentive for allies to increase spending. The waiver provision (subsection (c)) preserves presidential flexibility while requiring transparency, preventing the linkage from becoming a rigid constraint that harms national security.
- **Section 6**: Modernizes the definition of "defense" to include non-military contributions like energy and cyber resilience, giving allies more ways to demonstrate their commitment. This is particularly important for smaller allies that may struggle to reach 2% GDP in traditional military spending but make significant contributions in cyber, intelligence, or energy resilience.
- **Section 7**: The independent GAO assessment guards against "creative accounting" by requiring external verification of NATO's own defense expenditure data, addressing longstanding concerns about data reliability.
- **Section 8**: The escalating authorization from $500 million to $900 million over five years reflects the anticipated growth in compliance monitoring requirements as the expanded burden-sharing definition takes effect.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Promulgation of implementing regulations | 120 days after enactment | State Dept / DoD |
| Issuance of guidance on expanded burden-sharing definitions | 150 days after enactment | NSC / State Dept |
| Guidance on Assistance Prioritization | 180 days after enactment | State Dept / DoD |
| First Annual Certification Report | March 1, 2027 | President / NSC |
| Congressional hearings on first certification results | Spring 2027 | SFRC / SASC |
| First waiver justification report (if applicable) | Within 15 days of waiver exercise | President |
| First GAO Assessment of NATO data methodology | 2 years after enactment | GAO |
| Midterm review of burden-sharing trends | March 1, 2029 | President / NSC |
| Comprehensive 5-year effectiveness assessment | 5 years after enactment | GAO / CRS |

**Challenges**:

- **Diplomatic Pushback**: Allies may view the legislation as coercive and an attempt by Congress to micromanage the alliance. European allies have historically resisted U.S. congressional conditions as undermining alliance solidarity.
- **Presidential Discretion**: The President retains ultimate authority over basing and foreign policy; the act creates pressure but does not bind the President's hand. A hostile administration could undermine the law through perfunctory compliance.
- **Data Reliability**: NATO defense expenditure data relies on self-reporting by member states using varying national accounting standards, making genuine verification difficult even with GAO oversight.
- **Perverse Incentives**: A rigid focus on the 2% GDP metric could incentivize allies to increase spending on less useful capabilities purely to meet the target, rather than investing in the capabilities the alliance actually needs.
- **Domestic Political Resistance**: Members of Congress may oppose linking U.S. basing decisions to allied spending if it affects military installations in their districts or states.

**Refinements**:

- Include a waiver provision allowing the President to bypass the assistance linkage for a specific country if it is deemed in the vital national security interest of the U.S. (now incorporated in Section 5(c)).
- Establish a supplementary "capability contribution" metric alongside the GDP percentage target, recognizing that some allies contribute disproportionately in niche areas such as special operations, intelligence, or cyber defense.
- Require the annual certification report to include qualitative assessments of allied readiness and interoperability, not solely quantitative spending data.

### The Indo-Pacific Security Partnership Act

**Purpose**: To create a flexible legal framework for security cooperation with key Indo-Pacific partners, such as Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia, by establishing a "Strategic Partnership Fund" and pre-authorizing the transfer of defensive capabilities.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Standalone bill referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, with sequential referral to the Armed Services and Appropriations committees. Given the bipartisan consensus on China competition, this legislation could also be incorporated into a broader Indo-Pacific strategy package similar to the Strategic Competition Act or the CHIPS and Science Act framework.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Indo-Pacific Strategic Partnership Fund**: Establishes a dedicated fund of $2 billion annually to provide security assistance, training, and defense articles to partners in the region.
2. **Asymmetric Defense Initiative**: Prioritizes funding for capabilities suited for asymmetric defense against a larger adversary, such as anti-ship missiles, sea mines, and unmanned systems.
3. **Expedited Arms Transfers**: Pre-authorizes the transfer of specific categories of defensive equipment to designated partners, reducing the congressional notification timeline.
4. **Joint Training and Exercises**: Authorizes a multi-year plan for expanded joint military exercises focused on maritime security and interoperability.
5. **Intelligence Sharing**: Creates a legal framework for enhanced intelligence sharing with non-treaty partners in the Indo-Pacific.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To strengthen security cooperation with partners in the Indo-Pacific region to deter aggression and maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Indo-Pacific Security Partnership Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Indo-Pacific region is the global center of gravity for commerce, resources, and strategic competition, with approximately 60 percent of global GDP and two-thirds of global economic growth concentrated in the region (World Bank, 2024).
(2) The People's Republic of China is engaged in a comprehensive military modernization effort, with estimated defense spending of $296,000,000,000 in 2023 according to SIPRI, though actual spending is likely significantly higher due to off-budget military expenditures.
(3) The People's Liberation Army Navy has grown to approximately 370 battle force ships as of 2024, surpassing the United States Navy's battle force of approximately 295 ships, making it the world's largest navy by number of platforms (Department of Defense, China Military Power Report, 2024).
(4) Strengthening a network of like-minded partners is the most effective way to deter aggression and maintain regional stability, as recognized in the 2022 National Defense Strategy and the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States.
(5) Existing security assistance programs are often too slow and inflexible to meet the urgent defense needs of partners facing immediate threats, with average Foreign Military Sales case processing times exceeding 18 months (DSCA Annual Report, 2023).
(6) Key United States allies and partners in the region, including Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and the Philippines, are increasing their own defense investments and seeking enhanced interoperability with United States forces.
(7) Taiwan faces an acute and growing military threat from the People's Republic of China, and the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) commits the United States to providing Taiwan with arms of a defensive character.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(1) INDO-PACIFIC PARTNER.—The term "Indo-Pacific partner" means a country in the Indo-Pacific region designated by the Secretary of State as eligible for assistance under this Act.
(2) ASYMMETRIC DEFENSE.—The term "asymmetric defense" means capabilities and strategies designed to inflict disproportionate costs on a larger, more technologically advanced adversary.
(3) BILATERAL DEFENSE AGREEMENT.—The term "bilateral defense agreement" means any executive agreement, memorandum of understanding, or status of forces agreement between the United States and an Indo-Pacific partner that establishes a framework for defense cooperation, basing access, or mutual logistical support.
(4) JOINT FORCE POSTURE.—The term "joint force posture" means the combined deployment, stationing, and rotational presence of military personnel, equipment, and capabilities maintained by the United States and one or more Indo-Pacific partners in furtherance of shared security objectives.

SEC. 4. INDO-PACIFIC STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established a fund to be known as the "Indo-Pacific Strategic Partnership Fund".
(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There is authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2031 for the Fund.
(c) USE OF FUNDS.—Funds may be used to provide defense articles, services, and training to Indo-Pacific partners.
(d) ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.—Not more than 5 percent of funds authorized under subsection (b) in any fiscal year may be used for administrative costs, including personnel, travel, and program management.
(e) PARTNER DESIGNATION.—
    (1) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall designate Indo-Pacific partners eligible for assistance under this Act not later than 90 days after the date of enactment.
    (2) The Secretary of State shall review partner designations annually and may add or remove partners based on changes in the strategic environment, the partner's cooperation with the United States, and the partner's human rights record.
    (3) The Secretary of State shall notify the appropriate congressional committees not later than 30 days before adding or removing any partner designation.

SEC. 5. ASYMMETRIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE.

(a) PRIORITY.—In allocating funds under section 4, the Secretary of Defense shall prioritize the provision of asymmetric defense capabilities, including—
    (1) coastal defense cruise missiles;
    (2) naval mines;
    (3) unmanned aerial and maritime systems; and
    (4) secure command and control networks.
(b) JOINT TRAINING AND EXERCISES.—The Secretary of Defense shall develop a multi-year plan for expanded joint military exercises with Indo-Pacific partners, with emphasis on—
    (1) maritime domain awareness and sea control operations;
    (2) integrated air and missile defense;
    (3) humanitarian assistance and disaster relief interoperability; and
    (4) combined logistics and sustainment operations.
(c) INTELLIGENCE SHARING.—The Director of National Intelligence, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, shall establish frameworks for enhanced intelligence sharing with designated Indo-Pacific partners, consistent with the protection of sources and methods.

SEC. 6. EXPEDITED TRANSFERS.

(a) PRE-AUTHORIZATION.—The transfer of defense articles described in section 5(a) to Taiwan is hereby authorized.
(b) REDUCED NOTIFICATION.—The congressional review period for sales of such articles to designated Indo-Pacific partners shall be reduced to 15 days.
(c) END-USE MONITORING.—The Secretary of State shall establish enhanced end-use monitoring requirements for all defense articles transferred under this section, including—
    (1) annual on-site inspections of stored and deployed defense articles;
    (2) prohibition on re-transfer to any third party without prior written approval of the United States Government; and
    (3) automatic suspension of further transfers upon credible evidence of unauthorized diversion or re-transfer.
(d) TRAINING AND LOGISTICS SUPPORT.—For each transfer authorized under this section, the Secretary of Defense shall develop a companion training and sustainment plan to ensure the recipient nation can effectively operate and maintain the defense articles provided.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense shall jointly submit an annual report to Congress detailing the allocation of funds and the specific capabilities provided to each partner country.
(b) CONTENTS.—Each report under subsection (a) shall include—
    (1) a country-by-country breakdown of funds obligated and expended;
    (2) a description of the specific defense articles, services, and training provided to each partner;
    (3) an assessment of the recipient country's absorption capacity and progress in integrating provided capabilities;
    (4) an evaluation of the strategic impact of the assistance on regional deterrence posture; and
    (5) any recommendations for adjustments to partner designations or funding levels.
(c) FORM.—Each report shall be submitted in unclassified form, with a classified annex as necessary to protect intelligence sources and methods.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: The expanded definitions, including "bilateral defense agreement" and "joint force posture," provide legal clarity for the wide range of cooperative arrangements that exist in the Indo-Pacific, many of which fall short of formal treaty alliances but are critical to deterrence.
- **Section 4**: Creates a flexible pot of money specifically for the Indo-Pacific, allowing the administration to respond quickly to regional needs without having to reprogram funds from other accounts. The $2 billion annual authorization is calibrated to match the scale of the threat while remaining fiscally sustainable.
- **Section 5**: Focuses assistance on providing partners with the "porcupine" capabilities they need to make themselves indigestible to a larger aggressor, enhancing deterrence. The enumerated list of priority capabilities (coastal defense missiles, naval mines, unmanned systems, C2 networks) reflects the consensus recommendations of the 2024 CSIS Deterrence Working Group and the National Defense Strategy Commission.
- **Section 6**: Cuts red tape for providing Taiwan and other key partners with defensive arms, signaling U.S. commitment and speeding up delivery. The enhanced end-use monitoring provisions (subsection (c)) address legitimate concerns about weapons diversion while the training companion plan requirement (subsection (d)) ensures partners can actually employ what they receive.
- **Section 7**: The detailed reporting requirements ensure Congress maintains visibility into how funds are allocated and whether the assistance is achieving its strategic objectives, creating a feedback loop that informs future authorizations.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Designate initial Indo-Pacific partners | 90 days after enactment | State Dept |
| Publish criteria for partner eligibility | 90 days after enactment | State Dept |
| Establish end-use monitoring protocols | 120 days after enactment | State Dept / DoD |
| Develop companion training and sustainment plans | 150 days after enactment | DoD (DSCA) |
| Obligate first funds from Partnership Fund | FY 2027 | DoD / State Dept |
| First expedited transfer notification to Congress | 2027 | President / State Dept |
| First annual report on fund allocation | March 1, 2028 | State Dept / DoD |
| First on-site end-use inspection | 1 year after first transfer | State Dept |
| Congressional review of partner designations | 2 years after enactment | SFRC / HFAC |
| Sunset review and reauthorization assessment | FY 2031 | Congress / GAO |

**Challenges**:

- **Provoking China**: Beijing will view this legislation as a provocative move aimed at containing its influence, potentially triggering an arms race or accelerating Chinese military timelines against Taiwan.
- **Partner Absorption Capacity**: Some partners may lack the training and infrastructure to effectively use the advanced systems provided. Vietnam and Malaysia, for example, have limited experience integrating Western defense technology.
- **Industrial Base Constraints**: The U.S. defense industrial base may struggle to produce sufficient quantities of priority systems (e.g., anti-ship missiles, unmanned platforms) to simultaneously meet U.S. military requirements and partner nation demand.
- **Cross-Strait Escalation**: Pre-authorizing arms transfers to Taiwan could prompt Beijing to escalate coercive measures, including military provocations in the Taiwan Strait, potentially undermining the deterrent effect the legislation seeks to achieve.
- **Diplomatic Balancing**: Some Indo-Pacific partners maintain significant economic relationships with China and may be reluctant to accept U.S. security assistance if it is perceived as requiring them to "choose sides."

**Refinements**:

- Include funding for training and logistics support alongside the hardware to ensure partners can actually use and maintain what they receive (now incorporated in Section 6(d)).
- Establish a classified annex to the partner designation process that assesses each partner's tolerance for public security cooperation with the United States, allowing discreet assistance where necessary.
- Link the Indo-Pacific Strategic Partnership Fund to defense industrial base investment legislation to ensure production capacity can meet demand across both U.S. and partner requirements.

## Congressional Oversight Mechanisms

As state legislation is not applicable to federal treaties and alliances, this section outlines enhanced congressional oversight mechanisms.

### Joint Committee on National Security Strategy

**Proposal**: Establish a permanent, bicameral, bipartisan Joint Committee on National Security Strategy, modeled on the Joint Economic Committee.
**Function**: This committee would hold regular classified and unclassified hearings on the implementation of the National Security Strategy, review alliance commitments, and provide a forum for long-term strategic planning that transcends the annual budget cycle. It would not have legislative authority but would issue an annual assessment report to the Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and Intelligence committees.

### Treaty Review and Reassessment

**Proposal**: Mandate a quadrennial review of all active U.S. security treaties.
**Function**: Every four years, the State Department and DoD would be required to submit a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee assessing whether each treaty continues to serve U.S. interests, whether the commitments are sustainable, and whether the terms need to be updated to address new threats like cyber warfare. This forces a regular, proactive review of commitments that are often taken for granted.

### Arms Transfer Notification Enhancement

**Proposal**: Strengthen congressional notification requirements for arms transfers under the Indo-Pacific Security Partnership Act.
**Function**: While the Act reduces the notification period to 15 days for designated partners, Congress should establish a dedicated staff capacity within the Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations committees to review expedited notifications. The committees should receive monthly briefings from DSCA on the pipeline of planned transfers, ensuring that the reduced notification period does not result in reduced oversight.

### Alliance Treaty Withdrawal Safeguards

**Proposal**: Require that any presidential decision to withdraw from or substantially modify a mutual defense treaty be subject to a 180-day congressional review period.
**Function**: In light of the constitutional ambiguity around treaty withdrawal highlighted in *Goldwater v. Carter*, 444 U.S. 996 (1979), this mechanism would require the President to notify Congress at least 180 days before issuing formal notice of withdrawal from any mutual defense treaty. During the review period, either chamber could pass a resolution requesting the Government Accountability Office to assess the strategic implications of withdrawal, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would hold mandatory hearings. While this mechanism would not constitute a binding veto on presidential withdrawal power, it would ensure that no treaty withdrawal occurs without thorough public deliberation and congressional input.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of State, Department of Defense (Defense Security Cooperation Agency).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **ITAR Amendments**: The State Department must amend the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) to reflect the expedited transfer authorities for Indo-Pacific partners.
2. **FMF Allocation Guidance**: The State Department must issue new guidance to its bureaus on prioritizing Foreign Military Financing based on NATO burden-sharing performance.

### Interagency Coordination

**Lead Agency**: National Security Council (NSC), with coordination between the Department of State, Department of Defense, and the Intelligence Community.

**Required Actions**:

1. **Interagency Working Group**: Within 60 days of enactment, the NSC shall establish an interagency working group on alliance burden-sharing and Indo-Pacific security cooperation to coordinate implementation across departments.
2. **Standardized Metrics**: The working group shall develop standardized metrics for assessing burden-sharing contributions, resilience investments, and partner nation absorption capacity within 120 days of establishment.
3. **Annual Policy Review**: The NSC shall convene an annual policy review to assess whether the legislative framework is achieving its strategic objectives and recommend adjustments to Congress.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Congressional Review**: The annual certification report on NATO spending provides a mechanism for Congress to hold hearings and apply political pressure.
- **GAO Audits**: The Government Accountability Office is authorized to audit the allocation of the Indo-Pacific Strategic Partnership Fund to ensure it aligns with the law's intent.
- **Inspector General Oversight**: The DoD Inspector General and the State Department Inspector General shall conduct annual reviews of implementation compliance, with findings reported to the relevant congressional committees.
- **Appropriations Conditionality**: Congress retains the authority to condition future appropriations on satisfactory implementation of the reporting and certification requirements established by both Acts.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Treaty Power**: The Constitution gives the President the power to make treaties with a two-thirds Senate vote. While Congress cannot unilaterally alter a treaty, it can use its "power of the purse" and its authority over the Armed Forces (Article I) to set conditions on how treaties are implemented, which is the basis for the NATO Burden-Sharing Act.
**Commander-in-Chief vs. Congressional War Powers**: The Indo-Pacific Security Partnership Act, by providing arms and training, could be seen as increasing the likelihood of U.S. involvement in a conflict. The legislation operates under Congress's authority to "raise and support Armies" and regulate foreign commerce, but it exists in tension with the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief.

**Executive Authority and Treaty Implementation (*Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952))**: The *Youngstown* decision is the foundational precedent for analyzing the interplay between presidential and congressional authority in implementing alliance commitments. Justice Jackson's influential concurrence established a three-category framework for evaluating executive power that directly governs many of the provisions in this legislation:

- **Category One (Maximum Presidential Authority)**: When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, executive authority is at its zenith. Both bills in this legislation are designed to place presidential action in Category One by providing explicit statutory authorization for burden-sharing enforcement, security assistance allocation, and expedited arms transfers. When the President certifies allied compliance under the NATO Burden-Sharing Act or allocates funds from the Indo-Pacific Strategic Partnership Fund, the executive acts with the combined authority of both branches.
- **Category Two (Zone of Twilight)**: When the President acts in the absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, there is a "zone of twilight" in which the President and Congress may have concurrent authority. Before the enactment of these bills, many alliance management decisions (e.g., adjusting force posture in response to allied burden-sharing, prioritizing arms sales to particular partners) existed in this ambiguous zone. This legislation moves these decisions into Category One by providing clear congressional authorization and policy direction.
- **Category Three (Minimum Presidential Authority)**: When the President acts contrary to the expressed or implied will of Congress, executive power is at its "lowest ebb." If the President were to ignore the burden-sharing preferences codified in the NATO Act or divert Indo-Pacific Partnership Fund resources to purposes not authorized by the statute, such actions would fall into Category Three and face the strongest legal challenge. The reporting requirements and GAO audit provisions are specifically designed to make any Category Three deviation transparent and politically costly.

The *Youngstown* framework underscores why statutory codification of alliance management practices matters: by moving executive discretion from Category Two into Category One, Congress ensures that alliance policy rests on the strongest possible constitutional foundation while preserving the President's flexibility to act within the bounds Congress has set.

### Preemption

Foreign policy and national security are exclusive domains of the federal government under the Supremacy Clause (Article VI) and the federal government's exclusive authority over foreign affairs. State laws related to alliances or treaties are preempted. Specific preemption considerations include:

- **State Anti-Boycott Laws**: Some states have enacted laws restricting commerce with certain countries. To the extent these conflict with federal alliance or security assistance policy, they are preempted under *Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council*, 530 U.S. 363 (2000).
- **State Pension Investment Restrictions**: State pension funds that divest from companies doing business with allied nations or designated partners cannot override federal foreign policy as expressed in these Acts.
- **Local Base Closure Opposition**: Local or state legislation attempting to block the relocation of military forces in response to burden-sharing assessments would be preempted by federal authority over military basing.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance with these laws is primarily political rather than judicially enforceable. The legislation relies on a multi-layered accountability structure:

- **Executive Branch Accountability**: The annual certification requirement forces the President to publicly assess allied performance, creating a political cost for ignoring burden-sharing disparities. The waiver authority includes mandatory notification to Congress, ensuring transparency.
- **Congressional Leverage**: If the President chooses to ignore the burden-sharing preferences, Congress's recourse is through the appropriations process (cutting funding), political pressure (blocking nominations, holding hearings), or attaching additional conditions to future NDAAs.
- **GAO and IG Independence**: The independent audit and inspector general provisions ensure that Congress has access to impartial assessments of implementation, separate from the executive branch's own reporting.
- **Public Transparency**: The unclassified nature of the annual certification reports and waiver justifications enables public debate and media scrutiny, creating additional accountability beyond formal institutional mechanisms.
- **Judicial Review Limitations**: Courts are unlikely to adjudicate disputes between the branches over alliance management, given the political question doctrine established in *Baker v. Carr*, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), and applied to foreign affairs in *Goldwater v. Carter*. The legislation is designed to function through political incentives and transparency rather than judicial enforcement.
- **Private Right of Action**: Neither Act creates a private right of action. Compliance is enforced exclusively through intergovernmental mechanisms: executive branch reporting, congressional oversight, and independent audit functions. This design reflects the reality that alliance management is a sovereign function not amenable to private litigation.
- **International Law Considerations**: The legislation is consistent with U.S. obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty and the United Nations Charter. The burden-sharing provisions do not modify treaty obligations but rather establish domestic policy preferences for implementing those obligations. Similarly, the Indo-Pacific provisions operate within the existing framework of the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Creative Accounting" by Allies** | NATO allies could classify non-defense spending (e.g., national police) as defense to meet the 2% target. | Medium | Mandate that the GAO audit of NATO data (Sec. 7) specifically review and report on such accounting practices. |
| **Presidential Waiver Abuse** | The President could use a national security waiver to ignore burden-sharing preferences for politically favored allies. | Medium | Require a detailed, unclassified justification for any waiver and limit the waiver's duration to one year. |
| **"Defensive" Arms Definition** | The administration could broadly interpret "asymmetric defense" to include offensive capabilities, escalating regional tensions. | High | Require a specific, enumerated list of pre-authorized defensive systems in the committee report accompanying the bill. |
| **Partner Diversion** | An Indo-Pacific partner could re-transfer U.S. weapons to a third country. | High | Strengthen end-use monitoring requirements and include automatic suspension clauses for unauthorized transfers in all agreements. |
| **Delayed Reporting as De Facto Non-Compliance** | The executive branch could submit reports late or with insufficient detail, undermining the accountability mechanism without technically violating the law. | Medium | Include an automatic appropriations reduction trigger (10% reduction) if reports are not submitted within 60 days of the statutory deadline. |
| **Partner Designation Manipulation** | The Secretary of State could designate or remove partners based on political considerations rather than strategic criteria. | Medium | Require a public explanation of the strategic criteria used for partner designation and mandate congressional notification 30 days before any changes. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Alliance Entrapment** | Strengthening security ties with partners could draw the U.S. into a conflict not of its own choosing. | Inherent risk of alliances. | Maintain strategic ambiguity on the exact nature of the U.S. response; focus on providing partners the means to defend themselves. |
| **Free-Riding Persists** | Some allies may calculate that the U.S. will defend them regardless of their spending, making the incentives ineffective. | U.S. security guarantee is seen as unconditional. | Pair spending targets with clear, public statements about the conditionality of future U.S. force posture decisions. |
| **Industrial Base Limits** | The U.S. may lack the industrial capacity to produce and deliver the promised arms in a timely manner. | DIB consolidation and fragility. | Link security assistance legislation with DIB investment legislation to ensure production can meet demand. |
| **Escalation Risk** | Deepened security ties with Indo-Pacific partners, especially Taiwan, may provoke adversary escalation rather than deter it. | Security dilemma dynamics inherent to deterrence strategies. | Include diplomatic off-ramps and crisis communication mechanisms alongside security assistance provisions. |
| **Metric Displacement** | Emphasis on the 2% GDP metric may crowd out attention to more meaningful measures of allied capability and readiness. | Simplicity bias in political accountability mechanisms. | Mandate inclusion of qualitative readiness and interoperability assessments alongside quantitative spending targets. |
| **Coordination Gaps** | Dual oversight by State and DoD may create bureaucratic delays and conflicting guidance to partners. | Structural division of authorities across departments. | Establish a dedicated interagency coordinator within the NSC with authority to resolve interdepartmental disputes on a defined timeline. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Independent Verification**: Authorize the DoD Inspector General to conduct independent assessments of allied contributions, separate from the President's certification.
2. **Sunset Provisions**: Add a 5-year sunset clause to the Indo-Pacific Strategic Partnership Fund, requiring Congress to re-evaluate and reauthorize the program based on its effectiveness.
3. **Enumerated Defensive Systems List**: Require the Secretary of Defense to publish and annually update a specific list of defense articles eligible for expedited transfer, subject to congressional review, to prevent mission creep in the definition of "asymmetric defense."
4. **Enhanced End-Use Monitoring**: Mandate that the State Department establish a dedicated end-use monitoring office for Indo-Pacific transfers, with staffing and funding proportional to the volume of transfers conducted.
5. **Capability Contribution Supplement**: Direct the President to develop a supplementary "capability contribution index" that accounts for qualitative allied contributions (e.g., niche specializations, intelligence sharing, host nation support) alongside the quantitative GDP percentage metric.
6. **Industrial Base Assessment Trigger**: Require the Secretary of Defense to certify that the defense industrial base can meet the combined demand of U.S. military requirements and partner nation transfers before authorizing any transfer that exceeds $500 million in a single fiscal year.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| **Interagency coordination delays** between State and DoD on burden-sharing assessments and partner designations | Establish a dedicated interagency office within the NSC with authority to set deadlines and resolve disputes between departments |
| **Staffing shortfalls** at DSCA for managing the increased volume of Indo-Pacific security assistance cases | Authorize additional civilian billets at DSCA specifically funded through the Indo-Pacific Strategic Partnership Fund's administrative allocation |
| **Classification barriers** that prevent Congress from conducting meaningful oversight of intelligence-sharing agreements with non-treaty partners | Require the Director of National Intelligence to provide quarterly classified briefings to the intelligence committees on the scope and effectiveness of intelligence-sharing frameworks established under the Act |
| **Diplomatic signaling risks** where public certification of allied burden-sharing failures could damage relationships | Include a requirement for diplomatic consultation with allies prior to publication of the annual certification report, allowing allies to respond to findings before they become public |
| **Metrics gaming** where allies or partners optimize for measurable targets rather than genuine capability development | Direct the GAO to develop outcome-based metrics (readiness, deployability, interoperability scores) alongside input-based metrics (spending levels) |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **NATO Burden-Sharing Act**: The annual certification requirement creates a natural, ongoing review process. The escalating authorization of appropriations (SEC. 8) provides a built-in fiscal review point, as Congress must affirmatively appropriate funds each fiscal year.
- **Indo-Pacific Security Partnership Act**: The authorization for appropriations expires after 5 years (FY 2027-2031), forcing reauthorization. The sunset review should include an independent assessment by the Congressional Research Service of the Fund's strategic impact, partner absorption rates, and any unintended escalatory effects.
- **Quadrennial Treaty Review**: The proposed quadrennial review mechanism in the Congressional Oversight section creates a systematic review cycle for all active security treaties, ensuring that the legislative framework adapts to changing geopolitical conditions.
- **Automatic Reporting Escalation**: If either annual report (NATO certification or Indo-Pacific fund allocation) is not submitted by the statutory deadline, the relevant authorization of appropriations shall be automatically reduced by 10 percent for the following fiscal year until the report is submitted.
