# Alliances and Treaties: Current State

## NATO Posture and Structure

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has 32 members following the accession of Finland (April 2023) and Sweden (March 2024), both prompted by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The alliance is led militarily by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), a position always held by a U.S. four-star general, currently operating out of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium. Allied Command Transformation (ACT) in Norfolk, Virginia, drives doctrinal and capability development.

Since 2022, NATO has undergone its most significant posture shift since the Cold War. The alliance transitioned from the Enhanced Forward Presence model (four multinational battlegroups in the Baltics and Poland) to a forward defense concept, scaling those units to brigade-strength formations and establishing new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. The 2022 Madrid Summit adopted a new Strategic Concept identifying Russia as the "most significant and direct threat" and, for the first time, acknowledged China as a challenge to NATO's interests. The resulting NATO Force Model commits allies to having 300,000 troops at high readiness within 30 days, replacing the older NATO Response Force.

The United States maintains approximately 65,000 troops in Europe, a figure that rose from roughly 60,000 following the deployment of additional rotational forces to Poland, Romania, and the Baltic states after February 2022.

## Indo-Pacific Bilateral Alliance Architecture

The United States maintains five bilateral mutual defense treaties in the Indo-Pacific, forming the "hub-and-spokes" alliance system.

| Ally | Treaty | Year | U.S. Troop Presence | Key Recent Developments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Japan** | Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security | 1960 | ~54,000 | Japan increased its defense budget target to 2% of GDP by 2027; upgraded U.S. Forces Japan to a joint force command (2024). |
| **South Korea** | Mutual Defense Treaty | 1953 | ~28,500 | Washington Declaration (2023) enhanced nuclear consultation; Combined Forces Command remains active. |
| **Australia** | ANZUS Treaty | 1951 | Rotational | AUKUS submarine deal; increased U.S. bomber and submarine rotations through northern Australia. |
| **Philippines** | Mutual Defense Treaty | 1951 | Rotational | Expanded Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) from 5 to 9 sites (2023), including sites facing Taiwan and the South China Sea. |
| **Thailand** | Manila Pact / Thanat-Rusk Communique | 1954/1962 | Minimal | Oldest U.S. treaty ally in Asia; relationship has cooled; annual Cobra Gold exercise continues. |

Japan's December 2022 National Security Strategy marked a watershed: Tokyo committed to doubling defense spending, acquiring counterstrike capabilities (e.g., U.S. Tomahawk missiles), and deepening command integration with U.S. forces. South Korea, meanwhile, has invested heavily in indigenous defense capabilities, including the KF-21 fighter and Hyunmoo ballistic missiles, while maintaining its core alliance with the United States.

## Minilateral Security Partnerships

Beyond formal treaty alliances, the U.S. has expanded a web of flexible, purpose-built partnerships.

- **AUKUS (2021)**: The trilateral agreement between the U.S., UK, and Australia operates on two tracks. Pillar 1 involves providing Australia with conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines (SSN-AUKUS class), with an interim step of selling three to five U.S. Virginia-class boats starting in the early 2030s. Pillar 2 focuses on joint development of advanced capabilities including AI, quantum computing, cyber, hypersonic weapons, and electronic warfare.
- **Quad (formalized 2021)**: The U.S., Japan, Australia, and India coordinate on maritime domain awareness (the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness), critical and emerging technology standards, vaccine distribution, climate, and supply chain resilience. India's non-aligned tradition means the Quad explicitly avoids formal security commitments.
- **Five Eyes**: The longstanding intelligence-sharing arrangement among the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand remains the core of allied intelligence cooperation.
- **U.S.-Japan-ROK Trilateral**: The August 2023 Camp David Summit produced a commitment to annual leader-level meetings, real-time missile warning data sharing, and trilateral military exercises, a significant diplomatic achievement given historical Japan-Korea tensions.
- **I2U2 (2022)**: The U.S., Israel, India, and the UAE coordinate on water, energy, transportation, space, and food security, reflecting the post-Abraham Accords Middle East alignment.

## Burden-Sharing

NATO's 2% of GDP defense spending guideline, first agreed in 2006 and reaffirmed at the 2014 Wales Summit, has been a persistent source of transatlantic friction.

### NATO Defense Spending as % of GDP (2024 Estimates, Selected Allies)

| Member | % of GDP | Meeting 2% Target |
|---|---|---|
| United States | 3.38% | Yes |
| Poland | 4.12% | Yes |
| Greece | 3.08% | Yes |
| United Kingdom | 2.33% | Yes |
| France | 2.06% | Yes |
| Germany | 2.12% | Yes |
| Canada | 1.37% | No |
| Spain | 1.28% | No |
| Belgium | 1.30% | No |

In 2014, only 3 of 28 NATO members met the 2% target. By 2024, an estimated 23 of 32 members meet or exceed it, driven by the shock of the Ukraine war. However, a growing debate questions whether 2% is sufficient given the current threat environment. Poland spends over 4%, and some analysts and policymakers now advocate for a 3% target across the alliance. The U.S. accounts for roughly 68% of total NATO defense expenditure.

## Alliance Interoperability

Interoperability, the ability of allied forces to operate together effectively, is a persistent challenge despite decades of joint exercises.

- **Major Exercises**: RIMPAC (the world's largest naval exercise, held biennially in the Pacific), Defender Europe (large-scale U.S. Army deployment exercise), and Pacific Pathways test multi-national force integration.
- **Equipment Fragmentation**: European NATO allies operate dozens of different tank, artillery, and aircraft types, compared to the more standardized U.S. force. This complicates logistics, maintenance, and ammunition supply in a coalition fight.
- **Communications and C2**: Secure interoperable communications between allied forces remain a challenge. Different classification systems, national caveats on intelligence sharing, and incompatible radio and data-link systems create friction.
- **Standardization Agreements (STANAGs)**: NATO maintains over 1,300 standardization agreements covering everything from ammunition calibers to map symbols, but compliance and implementation vary widely.

## Emerging Challenges to the Alliance System

- **Cyber and Hybrid Threats**: NATO invoked its cyber defense pledge following Russian attacks on allied infrastructure, but the alliance has yet to establish clear collective defense thresholds for cyber attacks under Article 5.
- **Space**: NATO declared space an operational domain in 2019 and stood up a Space Centre of Excellence, but allied space capabilities remain heavily dependent on U.S. assets.
- **Technology Transfer Friction**: The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) regime frequently impedes technology sharing even with close allies like the UK and Australia, slowing joint development programs. AUKUS requires significant ITAR reform to succeed.
- **Divergent Threat Perceptions**: Eastern European allies prioritize the Russian threat; Indo-Pacific allies focus on China. Achieving a unified global strategy that addresses both theaters remains the central strategic challenge for the alliance system.
- **Alliance Fatigue**: Domestic political movements in multiple allied nations question the cost and value of alliance commitments, creating uncertainty about long-term reliability.
