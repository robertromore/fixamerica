# Alliances and Partnerships: Solutions

To adapt the U.S. alliance system for an era of great power competition, reforms must focus on improving allied contributions, adapting to new threats, and better integrating the transatlantic and Indo-Pacific security architectures.

## 1. Reform Burden-Sharing

**A. Shift from Burden-Sharing to "Responsibility-Sharing"**

- **Description**: The 2% of GDP defense spending target is a blunt and often misleading metric. The focus should shift to a more sophisticated model where allies commit to providing specific, high-end capabilities that the alliance needs, rather than just hitting an arbitrary spending number.
- **Implementation**: NATO should conduct a comprehensive capabilities review to identify critical shortfalls (e.g., air defense, long-range precision fires, logistics). Allies would then publicly commit to filling these gaps as their primary contribution, a model sometimes called "NATO Force Goals 2.0." For example, Germany might commit to providing three heavy armored divisions, while Italy commits to providing a certain number of naval air defense ships.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Aligns allied defense investments with actual strategic needs. Creates more accountability than a simple spending target. Allows allies to specialize in areas where they have a comparative advantage.

**B. Link U.S. Posture to Allied Contributions**

- **Description**: Make the size and nature of the U.S. military presence in a region explicitly conditional on the defense efforts of the allies in that region.
- **Implementation**: In Europe, the U.S. could announce that for every new, fully-equipped heavy brigade that European allies field, the U.S. will match it with a unique enabling capability (e.g., a squadron of F-35s, a strategic ISR platform). This creates a positive incentive for investment, framing the U.S. role as a high-end enabler, not a primary provider.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates a direct, transparent link between allied effort and U.S. commitment, moving beyond threats of withdrawal to a more constructive "matching" dynamic.

## 2. Adapt Alliances for 21st Century Threats

**A. Integrate Cyber and Space as Core Alliance Missions**

- **Description**: Fully integrate the cyber and space domains into alliance planning, exercises, and collective defense commitments.
- **Implementation**:
    - **NATO**: Clarify that a major cyber attack on a member state could trigger an Article 5 collective defense response. Conduct regular, large-scale cyber exercises (like "Cyber Coalition") that involve both military and civilian infrastructure.
    - **AUKUS**: Fully fund and accelerate AUKUS Pillar II, focusing on joint development of AI, quantum, and cyber capabilities. Use this as a model for technology sharing with other trusted allies.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Raises the cost of aggression in non-physical domains. Pools allied resources to compete more effectively with China in emerging technologies.

**B. Build a Network of Allied Resilience**

- **Description**: Expand the focus of alliances beyond traditional military threats to include "hybrid" threats like supply chain disruption, critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, and disinformation.
- **Implementation**: Create a "NATO Resilience Council" or a similar body to coordinate on securing critical supply chains (e.g., for microchips and pharmaceuticals), protecting undersea data cables, and sharing best practices for countering foreign information manipulation.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Makes allied societies less vulnerable to the coercive, non-military tactics favored by Russia and China.

## 3. Integrate Transatlantic and Indo-Pacific Alliances

**A. Create an "Atlantic-Pacific Council"**

- **Description**: Establish a formal dialogue between NATO and key U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific (Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand).
- **Implementation**: The council would meet annually at the foreign minister level to coordinate policy on shared challenges, particularly those posed by China's global activities. This would include coordinating on sanctions, technology export controls, and maritime security.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Breaks down the artificial divide between the European and Asian theaters. Creates a united front of democracies to counter global pressure from autocratic states.

**B. Reform and Streamline Foreign Military Sales (FMS)**

- **Description**: The current FMS process for selling U.S. military equipment to allies is notoriously slow and bureaucratic. Radically streamline this process for trusted allies to get critical capabilities into their hands faster.
- **Implementation**: Create a "Tier 1" list of allies (e.g., UK, Australia, Japan, key NATO members) who are eligible for an expedited FMS process with presumptive approval for most defensive systems. This would be especially critical for arming Taiwan.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Strengthens allied deterrence by reducing the timeline for acquiring key capabilities from a decade to 2-3 years.
