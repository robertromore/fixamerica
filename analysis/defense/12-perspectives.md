# Defense Policy: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

Defense policy is often characterized by a superficial bipartisan consensus on the need for a "strong" military, but this masks deep ideological fissures regarding the purpose of American power, the size of the budget, and the nature of the threat. The shift to great power competition has scrambled traditional alliances: "America First" populists now echo anti-war progressives in skepticism of foreign entanglements, while liberal internationalists find common ground with neoconservatives on supporting allies.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|---|---|---|
| Conservative | Tradition, strength, national sovereignty | High spending, "peace through strength," anti-woke |
| Liberal | Diplomacy, alliances, human rights | Multilateralism, arms control, personnel welfare |
| Progressive | Anti-militarism, social justice, redistribution | Deep budget cuts, end interventions, green transition |
| Libertarian | Non-intervention, fiscal restraint, liberty | Audit the Pentagon, bring troops home, free trade |
| Constitutionalist | Rule of law, separation of powers | Congress declares war, strict statutory limits |
| Populist | Nationalism, anti-elite, domestic focus | "America First," skepticism of allies/Ukraine, border security |
| Centrist | Stability, efficiency, global leadership | Modernization, reform, strong alliances |
| Religious Right | Moral order, support for Israel | Strong defense, traditional values in military |
| Democratic Socialist | Anti-imperialism, solidarity | Dismantle MIC, global demilitarization |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Claim to want fiscal discipline but rarely vote to cut defense spending. |
| Principle consistency | "Peace through strength" is consistent, but "anti-woke" focus distracts from lethality. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable demand for higher topline budgets, though the specific floor (3.5% vs. 5% of GDP) shifts based on political context. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frame defense spending in direct opposition to domestic spending; reject premise that both can be adequately funded simultaneously. |

**Justification:** Conservatives are torn between their fiscal hawk wing (Freedom Caucus) and their defense hawk wing (Establishment). They consistently vote for higher budgets but increasingly condition support on cultural issues.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Heritage Foundation "Blueprint for Defense" calling for 5% GDP spending target.
- GOP platform language on military strength and "peace through strength" doctrine.
- Freedom Caucus members voting against NDAA over topline spending while simultaneously opposing specific program cuts.
- Congressional Republican amendments targeting DEI programs rather than addressing acquisition reform.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree military is "hollowed out" and China is the threat. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Blame "woke" policies and bureaucracy, not industrial consolidation. |

**Source references:**

- American Enterprise Institute (AEI) defense and foreign policy studies.
- Heritage Foundation *Index of U.S. Military Strength* (annual assessment).
- National Defense Strategy Commission reports.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Audit Penalties | 4/10 | Oppose; fears it weakens the military. | Budget cuts. |
| Supply Chain Decoupling | 10/10 | Strong support; anti-China. | National security. |
| Personnel Pay Raise | 9/10 | Support; "support the troops." | Recruitment. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernization Act | 7/10 | Support supply chain parts; wary of audit. | Readiness. |
| Personnel Act | 8/10 | Support pay; oppose "social" programs. | Cost. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Increase defense budget to 5% of GDP.
- Ban DEI initiatives in the military.
- Expand nuclear arsenal.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Centrists (on modernization and great power competition), Populists (on China hawkishness and troop support).
- **Potential bridges:** Religious Right (shared emphasis on strong defense and traditional military values).
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives and Democratic Socialists (fundamental disagreement on defense budget size and military role).

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent focus on alliances and personnel welfare. |
| Principle consistency | Generally support internationalism and soft power. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; consistently prioritize alliances, diplomacy, and modernization over raw budget increases. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; generally willing to engage in trade-offs between legacy systems and new capabilities without framing debates as existential. |

**Justification:** Liberals support a strong defense but emphasize alliances and personnel welfare over raw hardware numbers. They are willing to cut legacy systems to fund modernization and view diplomacy as a force multiplier.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Center for American Progress reports on defense reform and alliance investment.
- Democratic Party platform language emphasizing diplomacy, alliances, and military personnel welfare.
- Consistent liberal support for NATO and multilateral security arrangements across administrations.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree on need for modernization and alliance repair. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree on acquisition dysfunction. |

**Source references:**

- Brookings Institution defense and foreign policy studies.
- Center for American Progress national security program.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |

| Global Alliance Act | 10/10 | Full support. | Diplomacy. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Cut nuclear modernization funding.
- Increase State Department budget.
- Focus on climate security.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Centrists (on alliances and institutional reform), Progressives (on personnel welfare and equity).
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarians (on audit and accountability), Constitutionalists (on oversight mechanisms).
- **Unlikely partners:** Populists (disagree on value of alliances and multilateral institutions).

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine and consistent anti-militarism; view defense spending as inherently in tension with social investment. |
| Principle consistency | Consistently vote against NDAA and military supplemental appropriations regardless of which party controls the White House. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; have maintained the same core demand for deep budget cuts and withdrawal from foreign entanglements for decades. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Explicitly frame defense debates as "guns vs. butter," arguing every defense dollar represents foregone investment in healthcare, education, or climate. |

**Justification:** Progressives view the defense budget as a moral failure and a distraction from domestic needs. They want radical cuts and a retreat from global hegemony. Their consistency is reinforced by a clear ideological framework: every dollar spent on weapons is a dollar not spent on people.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus "People's Budget."
- Win Without War.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Agree system is broken/corrupt; disagree on "threat" level. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Blame Military-Industrial Complex (MIC). |

**Source references:**

- Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft policy briefs on restraint.
- Public Citizen reports on defense contractor lobbying and revolving-door practices.
- Win Without War advocacy and legislative scorecards.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Audit Penalties | 10/10 | Strong support; defund Pentagon. | Demilitarization. |
| Personnel Pay | 8/10 | Support workers; oppose expanding force. | Justice. |
| Alliance Expansion | 2/10 | Oppose; risks war. | Anti-imperialism. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernization Act | 6/10 | Support audit; oppose new weapons. | Militarism. |
| Personnel Act | 9/10 | Support pay raises. | Inequality. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- 10% flat cut to defense budget.
- Close overseas bases.
- End nuclear modernization.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialists (shared anti-militarist framework and desire for deep budget reductions redirected to social programs).
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarians (agree on reducing military footprint and opposing foreign interventions, though for different ideological reasons), Populists (share skepticism of "forever wars" and distrust of military-industrial complex leadership).
- **Unlikely partners:** Centrists and Conservatives, who view progressive defense positions as dangerously naive about the threat environment and U.S. global responsibilities.

---

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent non-interventionism and fiscal restraint. |
| Principle consistency | Oppose both foreign wars and domestic subsidies. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable. |
| Zero-sum behavior | State vs. Liberty. |

**Justification:** Libertarians want a military focused solely on territorial defense of the United States. They oppose alliances, foreign aid, and the "garrison state" as expansions of government power that inevitably erode civil liberties at home. Their non-interventionist stance is rooted in both fiscal conservatism and philosophical opposition to the national security state.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute defense and foreign policy analysis arguing for military restraint and non-intervention.
- Reason Foundation coverage of defense waste, cost overruns, and failed audits.
- Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Thomas Massie voting records against NDAA and foreign military aid.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree on waste and overextension. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Blame interventionist foreign policy. |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute defense and foreign policy studies.
- Reason Foundation fiscal analysis of defense spending.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Audit Penalties | 10/10 | Strong support. | Accountability. |
| Alliance Expansion | 1/10 | Strong opposition. | Entanglement. |
| Personnel Pay | 5/10 | Mixed; support market wages, want smaller force. | Spending. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernization Act | 7/10 | Support audit; oppose industrial policy. | Corporate welfare. |
| Global Alliance Act | 1/10 | Oppose. | Non-intervention. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Withdraw from NATO and other entangling alliances.
- End all foreign military aid, including to Israel.
- Audit the Pentagon with real consequences for failure.
- Reduce active-duty force size and close overseas bases to focus on territorial defense.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Constitutionalists (shared emphasis on limiting executive war-making authority and government overreach).
- **Potential bridges:** Progressives (on military restraint and budget reductions), Democratic Socialists (on opposition to foreign interventions).
- **Unlikely partners:** Neoconservatives and centrist internationalists who support an expansive U.S. military posture.

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | "America First" but support defense jobs. |
| Principle consistency | Want to leave Middle East/Ukraine but hawk on China. |
| Goalpost stability | Shifts based on leader (Trump). |
| Zero-sum behavior | Us vs. Them. |

**Justification:** Populists are skeptical of alliances and "forever wars" but support a strong military to counter China and secure the border. They distrust the "deep state" and military leadership, viewing senior military officers as part of a globalist establishment that prioritizes foreign commitments over American workers and sovereignty. Their positions frequently shift based on the rhetorical priorities of populist political leaders.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- American Compass publications on industrial policy and defense manufacturing.
- Tucker Carlson and populist media rhetoric against "forever wars" and military leadership.
- Polling data showing populist voters favor strong defense but oppose Ukraine aid and NATO commitments.
- Congressional votes by populist-aligned members against Ukraine supplemental funding while supporting border security deployments.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Agree leadership is incompetent and system is rigged. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Blame globalist elites. |

**Source references:**

- American Compass industrial policy and defense publications.
- Polling data on populist attitudes toward defense spending and foreign alliances.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Supply Chain Decoupling | 10/10 | Strong support. | Nationalism. |
| Alliance Expansion | 3/10 | Skeptical; "freeloaders." | Sovereignty. |
| Personnel Pay | 10/10 | Strong support. | Working class. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernization Act | 8/10 | Support supply chain; wary of bureaucracy. | China. |
| Global Alliance Act | 4/10 | Oppose unless allies pay up. | Fairness. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Deploy military to the southern border for immigration enforcement.
- Fire "woke" generals and replace military leadership with officers focused on lethality.
- Impose tariffs on defense imports to protect domestic manufacturing.
- Require NATO allies to meet 2% GDP defense spending targets or face reduced U.S. commitments.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (on China hawkishness and support for military personnel).
- **Potential bridges:** Progressives (on ending "forever wars" and skepticism of military leadership), Libertarians (on questioning alliance commitments).
- **Unlikely partners:** Centrist internationalists and neoconservatives who advocate for expanded U.S. global commitments.

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Focus on stability and efficiency. |
| Principle consistency | Consistent support for U.S. leadership. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low. |

**Justification:** Centrists (the "Blob") believe in American primacy, strong alliances, and technological superiority. They want to fix the system, not break it.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- CNAS and CSIS reports advocating for sustained U.S. global leadership and alliance modernization.
- Bipartisan congressional support for AUKUS, NATO expansion, and Pacific Deterrence Initiative funding.
- Defense establishment consensus reflected in National Defense Strategy documents across administrations.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Agree on need for reform and modernization. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agree on bureaucratic rigidity. |

**Source references:**

- Center for a New American Security (CNAS) defense strategy publications.
- Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) defense modernization studies.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Portfolio Budgeting | 10/10 | Strong support; efficiency. | Agility. |
| Alliance Strengthening | 10/10 | Core priority. | Stability. |
| Audit Penalties | 6/10 | Cautious; don't want to break the department. | Functionality. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernization Act | 9/10 | Support. | Competitiveness. |
| Global Alliance Act | 10/10 | Full support. | Leadership. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Accelerate innovation adoption through the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and expanded partnerships with commercial technology firms.
- Pursue allied co-production of advanced weapons systems to share costs and deepen interoperability with key partners.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberals (on alliances and multilateralism), Moderate Conservatives (on modernization and great power competition).
- **Potential bridges:** Constitutionalists (on governance reform if framed as improving institutional effectiveness).
- **Unlikely partners:** Isolationists on both left and right who reject the premise of U.S. global leadership.

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely focused on restoring Article I war powers and congressional control over military spending; not driven by budget size preferences. |
| Principle consistency | Consistently apply separation-of-powers principles regardless of which party holds the presidency or congressional majority. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; have maintained the same constitutional objections to executive war-making since the post-9/11 AUMF debates. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frame defense disputes primarily as Congress vs. President rather than left vs. right; institutional prerogatives take priority over partisan alignment. |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists care about *who* decides, not necessarily *what* is decided. They oppose executive overreach in war-making and spending, viewing the post-9/11 expansion of presidential war powers as a fundamental violation of the constitutional order. Their positions do not shift based on partisan control of the presidency; they opposed executive war-making under both Obama and Trump.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Federalist Society white papers on war powers and executive authority.
- Bipartisan support for AUMF repeal efforts (e.g., Sen. Tim Kaine and Sen. Todd Young co-sponsoring war powers legislation).
- Constitutional scholars such as Jack Goldsmith and Bruce Ackerman on congressional abdication of war powers.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Concerned about unauthorized wars and the erosion of congressional authority over military operations; less focused on readiness or budget size debates. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Blame congressional abdication of war-making and spending authority; see the real problem as institutional, not budgetary or strategic. |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation legal and constitutional analysis.
- Federalist Society National Security Practice Group publications.
- Congressional Research Service reports on war powers and the AUMF.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Audit Penalties | 9/10 | Support; power of the purse. | Oversight. |
| Portfolio Budgeting | 3/10 | Oppose; cedes power to executive. | Separation of powers. |
| AUMF Repeal | 10/10 | Strong support. | Constitution. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernization Act | 5/10 | Mixed; like audit, hate portfolio flexibility. | Article I. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Require formal declarations of war or explicit congressional authorizations for any military deployment exceeding 60 days.
- Strict line-item appropriations with no transfer authority between accounts without congressional approval.
- Sunset all existing AUMFs and require reauthorization votes every two years.
- Restore the War Powers Resolution with enforcement mechanisms, including automatic funding cutoffs for unauthorized operations.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarians (shared commitment to limiting executive military authority and restoring congressional oversight).
- **Potential bridges:** Progressives (on war powers reform and AUMF repeal), Liberals (on oversight and accountability mechanisms).
- **Unlikely partners:** Executive branch officials of either party who benefit from broad war-making discretion.

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by moral clarity regarding U.S. role in the world and unwavering support for Israel as a theological and strategic priority. |
| Principle consistency | Consistently support high defense spending and a values-driven foreign policy; oppose social liberalization within the military ranks. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on core commitments (Israel, strong defense, traditional values); have recently intensified focus on opposing DEI and transgender policies in the military. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frame defense issues through a Good vs. Evil lens; view military readiness as inseparable from moral readiness and traditional values. |

**Justification:** The Religious Right views the U.S. military as a force for moral good in the world and a key protector of Israel. They consistently support robust defense spending but are increasingly focused on what they see as social engineering in the ranks, including DEI programs, transgender service policies, and restrictions on religious expression by chaplains and service members.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Family Research Council (FRC) reports on military readiness and religious liberty in the armed forces.
- Christians United for Israel (CUFI) advocacy for U.S.-Israel military cooperation.
- Congressional actions by members aligned with the Religious Right to block Pentagon DEI programs and transgender health policies through NDAA amendments.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree on the seriousness of the threat environment; primary concern is that "woke" policies are degrading military readiness and driving out traditional service members. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Blame moral decay and social engineering within the military rather than structural issues like acquisition dysfunction or industrial consolidation. |

**Source references:**

- Family Research Council (FRC) military and veterans affairs publications.
- Heritage Foundation cultural and military readiness analyses.
- Tony Perkins and FRC Action legislative scorecards on defense-related votes.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Personnel Pay | 9/10 | Support; view military families as a core constituency deserving strong compensation and housing support. | Family values and retention of traditional service members. |
| Alliance (Israel) | 10/10 | Strong support for U.S.-Israel military cooperation; view as both a strategic and theological imperative. | Biblical mandate and Middle East stability. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Personnel Act | 8/10 | Support pay and housing provisions; oppose any inclusion of expanded reproductive health or transgender health benefits. | Supporting military families within traditional values framework. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Protect chaplains' right to counsel according to their faith traditions without fear of professional reprisal.
- Ban DoD funding for abortion travel and transgender medical procedures.
- Eliminate all DEI offices and training programs within the Department of Defense.
- Strengthen U.S.-Israel military cooperation, including joint missile defense development and expanded arms sales.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (shared commitment to strong defense and traditional values in the military).
- **Potential bridges:** Populists (on opposition to "woke" military policies and support for rank-and-file service members).
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives and Democratic Socialists (fundamental disagreement on the moral role of the U.S. military and social policy within the ranks).

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistently frame defense spending as a transfer of wealth from working people to corporations; genuine anti-imperialism drives positions. |
| Principle consistency | Consistently oppose military interventions, weapons procurement, and alliance expansion regardless of party in power. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; have maintained the same critique of U.S. militarism for decades without shifting based on electoral dynamics. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frame every defense dollar as a dollar stolen from healthcare, education, or housing; imperialism vs. social justice is the core axis. |

**Justification:** Democratic socialists view the U.S. military as the enforcement arm of global capitalism. They want to dismantle the military-industrial complex, close overseas bases, and redirect defense spending toward social programs and a green industrial transition. Their positions do not shift based on which party holds power.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) National Political Platform, which calls for reducing the military budget by at least 50%.
- *Jacobin* magazine's sustained coverage of defense contractor profiteering and the human costs of U.S. interventions.
- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Squad members voting against NDAA annually.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | Agree system is corrupt; view the entire defense establishment as captured by corporate interests and oriented toward maintaining global hegemony rather than genuine security. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Blame capitalism and the profit motive embedded in the military-industrial complex; argue that defense contractors manufacture threats to sustain revenue. |

**Source references:**

- *Jacobin* magazine defense policy coverage.
- Institute for Policy Studies, "National Priorities Project" budget analysis.
- DSA International Committee publications on U.S. militarism.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Audit Penalties | 10/10 | Strong support; view audit failure as proof of systemic corruption that justifies large budget cuts. | Defunding the military-industrial complex. |
| Alliance Expansion | 1/10 | Strong opposition; view alliances as mechanisms for projecting imperial power and enriching arms manufacturers. | Anti-imperialism and global solidarity. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernization Act | 4/10 | Support audit and accountability provisions but oppose any new weapons procurement or industrial base expansion. | Preventing escalation and preserving peace. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Conversion of defense industry to green energy manufacturing, repurposing shipyards and aerospace plants for wind turbines and electric vehicles.
- 50% reduction in the defense budget over 10 years, redirected to universal healthcare, public housing, and free college.
- Closure of all overseas military bases and withdrawal from NATO and other military alliances.
- Nationalization of major defense contractors to eliminate the profit motive from national security.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives (shared critique of military-industrial complex and desire for deep budget cuts).
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarians (agree on non-intervention and reducing military footprint, though for different reasons), Populists (shared distrust of defense establishment elites).
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservatives, Centrists, and Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on the role and size of the U.S. military).

**Key insights:**

- "Taking care of the troops" is the only universal winner, commanding support from all 9 perspectives at varying levels of enthusiasm.
- Supply chain security unites the establishment and populists around a shared concern about Chinese dependence.
- Audits unite the fringes (left and right) against the center, creating an unusual coalition of Progressives, Libertarians, and Constitutionalists.
- Alliance policy is the most divisive issue, splitting internationalists from restrainers across the ideological spectrum.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: The "People First" Compact

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Populist + Centrist

**Core Agreement:** The all-volunteer force is breaking; we must pay soldiers a living wage.

**Policy Description:**

Passes the **21st Century Military Personnel and Family Support Act** (15% pay raise, 100% housing allowance). It funds this by cutting legacy weapons systems (divest to invest) rather than raising the topline, satisfying fiscal concerns while helping troops.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Supports the troops and addresses recruitment crisis without expanding social programs. |
| Liberal | Advances economic justice for soldiers and their families; reduces inequality within the force. |
| Populist | Directly helps working-class service members and their families who bear the burden of military service. |
| Religious Right | Strengthens military families through better pay and housing, supporting traditional family stability. |
| Centrist | Improves retention and readiness through market-competitive compensation. |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts cuts to legacy weapons systems that support jobs in key congressional districts. |
| Liberal | Accepts continued overall military funding levels rather than seeking a reduced topline. |
| Populist | Accepts that some reform measures involve institutional process changes rather than personnel-focused action. |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 8/9 perspectives.
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 6/8 coalition members rated 4+ consistency.
- **Durability:** High; politically impossible to oppose pay raises.
- **Implementation Path:** NDAA.

### Compromise 2: The "Secure Supply Chain" Deal

**Bridges:** Conservative + Centrist + Populist + Liberal

**Core Agreement:** We cannot rely on China for our weapons.

**Policy Description:**

Passes the supply chain provisions of the **Defense Modernization Act**. Bans Chinese components, funds domestic mining/processing.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Strengthens national security by eliminating dependence on adversary nations for critical defense components. |
| Populist | Counters China and creates domestic manufacturing jobs in critical minerals and defense production. |
| Liberal | Reduces reliance on autocracies and builds a more resilient, values-aligned supply chain. |
| Centrist | Enhances deterrence credibility by ensuring the industrial base can sustain wartime production. |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Accepts "Great Power Competition" framing rather than preferred multilateral cooperation language. |
| Conservative | Accepts government industrial policy and subsidies rather than relying solely on market forces. |
| Libertarian | Accepts targeted government intervention in supply chains despite general opposition to industrial policy. |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives.
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency.
- **Durability:** High; aligns with geopolitical trends.
- **Implementation Path:** NDAA.

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The **"People First" coalition** (Compromise 1) is the strongest, commanding support from 8 of 9 perspectives. It bypasses the "hawks vs. doves" debate by focusing on the welfare of the individual soldier, which is politically unassailable. No elected official wants to be seen as opposing pay raises for troops, making this the most durable coalition anchor.

### Key Obstacles

1. **The Iron Triangle:** Contractors will fight "divest to invest" if it cuts their programs to pay for personnel.
2. **Appropriators:** They hate portfolio budgeting because it reduces their power.
3. **Recruitment Reality:** Even with higher pay, cultural divides may keep recruitment low.

### Low Consistency Partners

**Conservatives** (3/5 consistency) and **Populists** (3/5 consistency) are the wildcards. Both want a strong military but are currently attacking its leadership on cultural grounds. Strategy: Focus messaging on the rank-and-file service member and hardware modernization; avoid engaging on culture war issues that split the coalition. Frame reforms as "strengthening the warfighter" rather than "reforming the institution."

### Recommended Approach

Pursue a **"Soldiers and Supply Chains"** strategy:

1. Lead with **Personnel Pay** to build a massive bipartisan majority.
2. Attach **Supply Chain Security** to ride that momentum.
3. Slip **Acquisition Reform** (portfolio budgeting) into the package as a "technical fix" to pay for the other two.
4. Avoid framing any component in culture-war terms, which would fracture the Conservative-Liberal bridge that makes the coalition viable.
