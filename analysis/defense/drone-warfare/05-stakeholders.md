# Drone Warfare: Stakeholders

## Overview

Drone warfare policy involves a complex web of stakeholders with dramatically different levels of power, visibility, and influence. The people most affected by drone strikes, civilians in strike zones, have the least influence over policy, while the institutions that design and execute strikes, the Pentagon, CIA, and defense industry, have the most. Understanding this power asymmetry is essential to designing reforms that can overcome entrenched institutional interests.

## Who Is Affected

### Civilians in Strike Zones

**Impact: Severe and direct**

Civilians in countries where the U.S. conducts drone strikes bear the greatest burden of drone warfare policy. These populations include:

- **Direct Victims**: Individuals and families killed or injured by drone strikes. Independent monitoring organizations estimate 910 to 2,200+ civilian deaths from U.S. strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia alone. Many more have been wounded.
- **Communities Under Surveillance**: Entire communities in strike zones live under the constant presence of drones, producing documented psychological effects including anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, and fear of open-air gatherings. A 2012 Stanford/NYU report, *Living Under Drones*, documented how the persistent buzz of surveillance drones terrorized communities in Pakistan's tribal areas.
- **Economic Disruption**: Drone strikes disrupt daily life, destroy property, and discourage economic activity in affected areas. Markets, schools, and community gatherings are avoided due to fear of strikes.
- **Displaced Populations**: Some families and communities have been displaced by sustained drone campaigns, adding to broader displacement crises.

| Country | Estimated Civilian Deaths (2001-2024) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Pakistan | 424-969 | Bureau of Investigative Journalism |
| Yemen | 100-200+ | Bureau of Investigative Journalism / Airwars |
| Somalia | 100-300+ | Airwars |
| Afghanistan | Unknown (thousands from airstrikes including drones) | Airwars / UNAMA |
| Iraq / Syria | Unknown (part of broader airstrike campaigns) | Airwars |

### Drone Operators and Military Personnel

**Impact: Significant psychological burden**

- **Remote Pilots**: MQ-9 Reaper and other drone pilots operate from bases in the United States (primarily Creech AFB, Nevada; Holloman AFB, New Mexico; and others) while conducting lethal operations thousands of miles away. Studies have documented rates of PTSD, moral injury, burnout, and substance abuse among drone operators comparable to or exceeding those of deployed combat forces.
- **Sensor Operators**: The sensor operators who identify, track, and designate targets carry the same psychological burden as pilots, often watching the aftermath of strikes in high-definition video.
- **Intelligence Analysts**: Analysts who support targeting decisions, particularly those involved in "pattern of life" analysis, face moral injury from the knowledge that their assessments directly contribute to lethal decisions that may result in civilian deaths.
- **Retention Crisis**: The Air Force has experienced chronic shortages of drone operators due to burnout, high operational tempo, and the stigma associated with "remote" warfare. In 2015, the Air Force acknowledged it needed 300 more drone pilots than it could recruit.

### U.S. Citizens Abroad

**Impact: Due process concerns**

The targeting and killing of U.S. citizens, Anwar al-Awlaki, Samir Khan, and Abdulrahman al-Awlaki (all killed in Yemen in 2011), raised fundamental questions about the government's authority to deprive citizens of life without judicial process. The 2017 killing of al-Awlaki's 8-year-old daughter, Nawar, in a JSOC raid further highlighted the risk to U.S. citizens and their families. Any American abroad could theoretically be placed on a targeting list based on secret executive branch determinations, with no opportunity for judicial review.

### Partner Nations and Their Populations

**Impact: Sovereignty, domestic politics, anti-American sentiment**

- **Pakistan**: The CIA drone campaign in Pakistan's tribal areas was conducted with the secret consent of Pakistan's government while that government publicly condemned the strikes. This dual posture undermined democratic accountability in Pakistan and fueled anti-American sentiment.
- **Yemen**: Drone strikes contributed to instability and anti-American sentiment that strengthened AQAP and the Houthi movement.
- **Somalia**: The Somali government has consented to U.S. strikes but has limited control over its own territory; strikes may undermine fragile state-building efforts.

### Allied and Adversary Nations

**Impact: Norm-setting precedent**

The norms established by U.S. drone warfare policy directly influence how other nations develop and use their own armed drone capabilities:

- **Allies**: NATO partners, Israel, and other allies observe U.S. practices as a baseline for their own drone programs.
- **Adversaries**: China, Russia, and Iran point to U.S. targeted killing practices to justify their own extrajudicial actions and drone exports.
- **Global South**: Countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia are both targets of and customers for armed drone technology, creating complex dynamics around proliferation and norms.

## Who Has Power

### Executive Branch

**Power: Dominant**

| Actor | Role | Influence Level |
|---|---|---|
| President | Ultimate approval authority for strikes outside active hostilities; sets policy through classified memoranda | Maximum |
| National Security Council (NSC) | Coordinates interagency targeting process; manages the "disposition matrix" | Very High |
| Secretary of Defense | Approves military (Title 10) drone operations; leads CHMR-AP implementation | Very High |
| Director of CIA | Manages CIA covert drone operations (Title 50); advises President on intelligence-based targeting | High |
| Commander, JSOC | Executes special operations targeting including drone strikes | High |
| Combatant Commanders (CENTCOM, AFRICOM) | Operational authority within their theater; approve strikes in active hostilities zones | High |

### Pentagon and Military Establishment

**Power: High**

- **U.S. Air Force**: Operates the vast majority of drone platforms (MQ-9 Reaper, RQ-4 Global Hawk); institutional advocate for drone and autonomous systems investment.
- **U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM)**: Leads counterterrorism operations; JSOC conducts the most sensitive drone strikes.
- **U.S. Army**: Operates the MQ-1C Gray Eagle for tactical ground support; developing next-generation UAS.
- **Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)**: Drives autonomous weapons technology development through programs like ACE and other classified initiatives.
- **Joint Staff**: Manages the joint targeting process and rules of engagement that govern drone operations across commands.

### Central Intelligence Agency

**Power: High (declining)**

The CIA played a leading role in drone warfare from 2002 to approximately 2014, operating its own armed drone fleet under covert action authorities. The agency's role has diminished as operations have shifted to the military, but the CIA retains:

- Intelligence collection and analysis capabilities essential to targeting
- Some residual lethal strike authority
- Influence over policy through the Director's advisory role
- Institutional culture resistant to transparency

### Congress

**Power: Moderate (largely unexercised)**

| Actor | Formal Power | Actual Influence |
|---|---|---|
| Senate Armed Services Committee | Authorizes military programs and operations | Moderate; receives briefings but rarely restricts operations |
| Senate Intelligence Committee | Oversees covert action; reviews CIA and IC programs | Moderate; limited by classification and norms of secrecy |
| House Armed Services Committee | Authorizes military programs | Moderate |
| House Intelligence Committee | Oversees intelligence operations | Moderate |
| Appropriations Committees | Control funding for all programs | High (in theory); rarely use to constrain operations |
| Individual Members | Can introduce legislation, hold hearings, make public statements | Low to Moderate |

Congress has the constitutional authority to authorize, restrict, or defund drone operations, but has largely chosen not to exercise this power. The few members who have pushed for reform (Sens. Rand Paul, Tim Kaine, Mike Lee, Chris Murphy; Reps. Barbara Lee, Ro Khanna) have been unable to overcome institutional inertia.

### Defense Industry

**Power: High**

| Company | Drone Products | Estimated Drone Revenue | Political Activity |
|---|---|---|---|
| General Atomics | MQ-9 Reaper, MQ-1C Gray Eagle, MQ-20 Avenger | $3+ billion annually | Major lobbying; PAC contributions to Armed Services Committee members |
| Northrop Grumman | RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4C Triton, X-47B | $2+ billion (drone/autonomous) | Major lobbying; significant congressional influence |
| Lockheed Martin | Various UAS components; AI/autonomy programs | Substantial (integrated) | Largest defense lobby; broad political influence |
| Boeing | MQ-25 Stingray; autonomous systems | $1+ billion | Major lobbying; extensive congressional relationships |
| L3Harris Technologies | Counter-drone systems; ISR payloads | Substantial | Significant lobbying presence |
| Anduril Industries | Counter-drone (Anvil/Sentry); AI-enabled systems | Growing rapidly | New-generation defense tech; lobbying increasing |

These companies employ lobbyists, fund think tanks, sponsor conferences, and contribute to campaigns. They also create jobs in key congressional districts, giving members economic incentives to support drone programs regardless of their policy merits.

### Judiciary

**Power: Minimal (self-imposed)**

The federal courts have been largely absent from the drone warfare debate. Key decisions have avoided ruling on the merits:

- *Al-Aulaqi v. Obama* (2010): Dismissed on standing and political question grounds
- *Al-Aulaqi v. Panetta* (2014): Dismissed on political question and special factors doctrines
- FOIA litigation has produced some declassification but no substantive legal review of targeting decisions

The courts' deference to the political branches on matters of national security and war has left the drone program effectively immune from judicial oversight.

### Civil Society and Advocacy Organizations

**Power: Low to Moderate**

| Organization | Focus | Influence |
|---|---|---|
| ACLU | Legal challenges, FOIA litigation, advocacy | Moderate; has forced some transparency through litigation |
| Reprieve | Legal representation for drone strike victims | Low; limited access to U.S. policy process |
| Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) | Civilian harm mitigation; DoD engagement | Moderate; influenced CHMR-AP development |
| Bureau of Investigative Journalism | Data collection and reporting on strikes | Moderate; provides authoritative data |
| Airwars | Civilian casualty monitoring | Moderate; widely cited by media and policymakers |
| New America Foundation | Data collection and policy analysis | Moderate; provides "World of Drones" database |
| Human Rights Watch | Investigations and advocacy | Moderate; reports influence international debate |
| Amnesty International | Investigations and advocacy | Moderate; international influence |

### International Organizations

**Power: Low**

| Organization | Role | Influence |
|---|---|---|
| United Nations | Human Rights Council reports; CCW autonomous weapons discussions | Low; U.S. does not accept binding authority |
| International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) | Promotes international humanitarian law compliance | Low to Moderate; moral authority but no enforcement |
| International Criminal Court (ICC) | Potential jurisdiction over war crimes | Minimal; U.S. is not a party to the Rome Statute |

### Media

**Power: Moderate (episodic)**

Investigative journalism has been the single most effective force for transparency in the drone program:

- The *New York Times* "Civilian Casualty Files" investigation (2021) revealed systemic failures that prompted the CHMR-AP reform
- The Bureau of Investigative Journalism's ongoing database provides the most comprehensive public record of strikes
- *The Intercept's* "Drone Papers" (2015) published leaked classified documents about the targeting process
- Reporting by the *Washington Post*, *Associated Press*, and others has documented individual incidents of civilian harm

Media attention is episodic, however, and tends to focus on dramatic incidents (the Kabul strike, the Soleimani killing) rather than the routine operation of the program.
