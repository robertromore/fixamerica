# Drone Warfare: Current State

## Current Drone Platforms

The U.S. military and intelligence community operate a fleet of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) spanning tactical, operational, and strategic roles. The major platforms include:

| Platform | Type | Role | Operator | Key Capabilities |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MQ-9 Reaper | Medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) | Strike / ISR | USAF, CIA | Hellfire missiles, GBU-12/38 bombs; 27-hour endurance; 50,000 ft ceiling |
| MQ-1C Gray Eagle | MALE | Strike / ISR | U.S. Army | Hellfire missiles; 25-hour endurance; integrated with ground forces |
| RQ-4 Global Hawk | High-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) | Strategic ISR | USAF | 32-hour endurance; 60,000 ft ceiling; synthetic aperture radar |
| MQ-25 Stingray | Carrier-based | Aerial refueling / ISR | U.S. Navy | First carrier-based unmanned tanker; extends strike range |
| RQ-170 Sentinel | Stealth | ISR (classified) | USAF / CIA | Low observable design; believed used for penetrating contested airspace |
| MQ-20 Avenger | Jet-powered MALE | Strike / ISR (developmental) | USAF | Stealthy design; internal weapons bay; higher speed than MQ-9 |
| Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) | Autonomous wingman | Air combat support | USAF | AI-enabled; designed to operate alongside manned fighters |

### MQ-9 Reaper

The MQ-9 Reaper remains the workhorse of U.S. drone strike operations. As of 2024, the Air Force operates approximately 300 MQ-9s across multiple combatant commands. Each aircraft can carry up to four AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and two 500-pound bombs, with a sensor suite including infrared cameras, laser designators, and synthetic aperture radar. The Reaper has been the primary platform for counterterrorism strikes in Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria, and the Sahel region. The Air Force plans to begin retiring the MQ-9 in the late 2020s in favor of more survivable platforms designed for great power competition.

### MQ-1C Gray Eagle

The Army's Gray Eagle is the primary tactical UAS for ground force support, providing persistent surveillance and precision strike capability to brigade combat teams. The platform has been extensively used in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. The Army is developing the Gray Eagle Extended Range (GE-ER) variant with enhanced payload capacity and longer endurance.

### RQ-4 Global Hawk

The RQ-4 provides strategic-level intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) with its ability to survey wide areas for extended periods. It has been used extensively for monitoring missile threats, maritime surveillance, and supporting counterterrorism operations. The Navy variant (MQ-4C Triton) focuses on maritime patrol.

## Strike Authorities and Legal Framework

### Current Legal Basis

U.S. drone strikes are conducted under multiple overlapping legal authorities:

| Authority | Basis | Scope | Oversight |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2001 AUMF (P.L. 107-40) | Statutory | Force against those responsible for 9/11 and "associated forces" | Minimal; executive interpretation has expanded scope |
| Article II Self-Defense | Constitutional | Imminent threats to U.S. persons | Presidential determination; no congressional pre-approval |
| Title 10 (Military Operations) | Statutory | DoD-conducted operations | Congressional Armed Services and Intelligence Committees |
| Title 50 (Covert Action) | Statutory | CIA-conducted operations | Congressional Intelligence Committees ("Gang of Eight") |
| Host Nation Consent | International Law | Operations with permission of sovereign government | Bilateral agreements, often classified |

### Policy Standards

The Biden administration issued updated guidance in 2022 through a classified Presidential Policy Memorandum (PPM) governing the use of force outside areas of active hostilities. Key elements include:

- **"Near Certainty" Standard**: Strikes outside active hostilities require "near certainty" that the target is present and that non-combatants will not be injured or killed.
- **Presidential Approval**: Strikes outside active hostilities generally require presidential approval, except in cases of imminent threat to U.S. persons.
- **Preference for Capture**: Lethal force should be used only when capture is not feasible.
- **Restrictions Vary by Theater**: Active hostilities zones (Iraq, Syria) have more permissive rules of engagement than "outside active hostilities" theaters (Somalia, Yemen).

The Trump administration (2017-2021) loosened Obama-era constraints through classified policy changes, including:

- Delegating strike authority to lower-level commanders in certain theaters
- Designating parts of Somalia and Yemen as "areas of active hostilities," removing the higher-standard civilian protection requirements
- Expanding the definition of targets eligible for strikes

### Areas of Active Operations (as of 2024)

| Theater | Primary Targets | Legal Authority | Approx. Annual Strikes (2023-2024) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Iraq / Syria | ISIS remnants | 2001 AUMF | 100-200 (primarily in Syria) |
| Somalia | Al-Shabaab | 2001 AUMF + host nation consent | 15-30 |
| Yemen | AQAP | 2001 AUMF (paused for Houthi operations) | 5-10 (CT); separate Houthi strikes under Article II |
| Sahel Region | ISIS/JNIM affiliates | Primarily partner support; limited direct action | Classified |

## Civilian Casualty Data

### Official vs. Independent Estimates

There is a massive gap between official U.S. government civilian casualty figures and those reported by independent monitoring organizations:

| Source | Estimated Civilian Deaths (2001-2024) | Methodology |
|---|---|---|
| U.S. Government (DoD annual reports) | ~1,400 (cumulative acknowledged) | Post-strike assessment; often no ground investigation |
| Bureau of Investigative Journalism | 910-2,200 (Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia only) | Media reports, local sources, legal filings |
| Airwars | 2,000-3,000+ (all theaters) | Cross-referencing multiple open sources |
| New York Times "Civilian Casualty Files" (2021) | Documented systemic undercounting | Obtained classified Pentagon assessments |

### Key Incidents

| Date | Location | Incident | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| September 30, 2011 | Yemen | Killing of Anwar al-Awlaki (U.S. citizen) | No judicial review; OLC memo justified targeting |
| October 14, 2011 | Yemen | Killing of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki (16-year-old U.S. citizen) | DoD claimed unintentional; no accountability |
| January 29, 2017 | Yemen (Yakla) | Raid killing ~25 civilians including children | First Trump-era operation; loosened rules |
| August 29, 2021 | Kabul, Afghanistan | Strike killing 10 civilians (7 children) | Pentagon initially claimed "righteous strike"; no accountability for any personnel |
| January 2023 | Somalia | Multiple strikes with disputed civilian harm | Inadequate post-strike assessment per watchdog groups |

### Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan (CHMR-AP)

In 2022, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin directed the creation of the Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan (CHMR-AP), the most comprehensive DoD effort to address civilian casualties. Key elements include:

- Establishment of a Civilian Protection Center of Excellence
- Improved pre-strike civilian harm assessment procedures
- Enhanced post-strike investigation protocols
- Training programs for operators on civilian harm mitigation
- Integration of civilian harm considerations into targeting processes

Implementation has been uneven. A 2024 Government Accountability Office report found that only 60% of combatant commands had fully implemented CHMR-AP requirements, and that post-strike investigation timelines remained inadequate.

## Autonomous Weapons Development

### Current U.S. Programs

The Department of Defense is investing heavily in autonomous and AI-enabled systems:

| Program | Description | Status | Estimated Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Replicator Initiative | Mass production of small, autonomous drones | First tranche delivered FY2025 | $1 billion+ (FY2024-2025) |
| Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) | AI-enabled autonomous wingman for manned fighters | Development; first flight expected 2026 | $5.8 billion (FY2024-2028) |
| Project Maven | AI for analyzing ISR data and identifying targets | Operational | Classified |
| Autonomous Battle Management System (ABMS) | AI-enabled command and control | Development | Part of JADC2 ($3.1B requested FY2025) |
| DARPA ACE Program | AI for autonomous air combat maneuvering | Testing phase | Classified |
| Small UAS (Group 1-3) | Tactical autonomous drones | Fielded | Various |

### DoD Directive 3000.09

The primary policy governing autonomous weapons is DoD Directive 3000.09, updated in January 2023. Key provisions:

- **Human Control Requirement**: Autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems "shall be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force."
- **Senior Official Review**: Development and fielding of autonomous weapons systems that select and engage targets must be reviewed and approved by senior DoD officials.
- **Testing Requirements**: Systems must undergo rigorous testing to ensure they function as intended in realistic operational environments.

Critics note that the directive uses vague language ("appropriate levels of human judgment") that does not clearly prohibit fully autonomous lethal systems and applies only to the U.S. Department of Defense, not to CIA operations or operations conducted by partner forces using U.S.-provided systems.

## Drone Proliferation

### Global Armed Drone Landscape

Armed drone technology has proliferated rapidly since 2010:

| Category | Examples | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Major Producers** | U.S., Israel, China, Turkey, Iran | Dominate global export market |
| **Chinese Exports** | Wing Loong II, CH-4/CH-5 to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Pakistan, Nigeria, others | China fills demand that U.S. export restrictions created |
| **Turkish Exports** | Bayraktar TB2 to Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Libya, others | Low cost (~$5M); combat-proven in Nagorno-Karabakh and Ukraine |
| **Iranian Proliferation** | Shahed-136 to Russia, Houthis, Hezbollah, Iraqi militias | One-way attack drones; used extensively in Ukraine war |
| **Non-State Actors** | Houthis, Hezbollah, ISIS (commercial drones modified for attacks) | Commercial drones weaponized at minimal cost |

### U.S. Export Policy

The Trump administration loosened drone export restrictions in 2020 by withdrawing from the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Category I presumption of denial for certain UAS. The Biden administration partially reversed this but continued approving major sales to allies. Key tensions include:

- U.S. export restrictions pushed customers (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt) to buy Chinese drones instead
- Allies argue they need armed drones for counterterrorism and self-defense
- Human rights organizations document misuse of exported drones (Saudi strikes in Yemen, Turkish strikes against Kurds)

## Counter-Drone Technology

The proliferation of small, cheap drones has created urgent demand for counter-UAS (C-UAS) systems:

| System | Type | Developer | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Directed Energy / High-Energy Laser | Laser-based shoot-down | Various (Raytheon, Lockheed) | Testing / early fielding |
| Electronic Warfare / Jamming | RF disruption of drone control links | L3Harris, SRC Inc. | Fielded |
| Kinetic Interceptors | Missile/projectile shoot-down | Raytheon (Coyote), various | Fielded |
| Detection / Radar | Sensor systems for drone identification | Various | Fielded |
| Drone-on-Drone | Counter-drone using interceptor drones | Anduril (Anvil), others | Fielding |

The U.S. military spent an estimated $3.6 billion on counter-drone research and procurement from 2020 to 2024, driven by lessons from the Ukraine war and Houthi drone/missile attacks on Red Sea shipping. The challenge of "cost imposition" remains critical: a $2,000 commercial drone can force the defender to expend a $500,000 missile.

## Current Policy Debates

### Key Active Debates

- **AUMF Reform**: Multiple bills to repeal or replace the 2001 AUMF have been introduced in every Congress since 2013 but none have been enacted. The House passed a standalone 2001 AUMF repeal in 2021 but the Senate did not act.
- **Autonomous Weapons Governance**: The UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) Group of Governmental Experts has debated LAWS regulation since 2017 without producing binding obligations. The U.S. has opposed a binding international treaty.
- **Houthi Operations**: U.S. strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen since January 2024, conducted under Article II self-defense authority rather than the AUMF, have reignited the debate over presidential war powers.
- **Ukraine Lessons**: The extensive use of drones in the Russia-Ukraine war has accelerated U.S. investment in autonomous systems and counter-drone technology while raising new questions about the future of unmanned warfare.
- **AI in the Kill Chain**: The Pentagon's increasing reliance on AI for target identification (Project Maven and successors) has generated debate about the role of algorithms in life-and-death decisions.
