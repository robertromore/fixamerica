# Drone Warfare: Overview

## Overview

The United States has been at the forefront of armed drone technology since the first lethal strike by a Predator drone in Afghanistan in October 2001. In the two decades since, remotely piloted aircraft have become the defining weapon of America's counterterrorism campaigns, conducting thousands of strikes across at least seven countries. Drones offer policymakers the ability to project lethal force without risking American lives, but this very advantage has lowered the political threshold for the use of force, enabling a permanent state of low-intensity warfare conducted largely in secret and without meaningful congressional authorization or public debate.

The drone warfare debate now extends beyond counterterrorism strikes to encompass the development of autonomous weapons systems capable of selecting and engaging targets without direct human control. The Department of Defense is investing billions in artificial intelligence and unmanned systems under its Replicator initiative and other programs, while competitors including China, Russia, Turkey, and Iran are rapidly fielding their own armed drones. The proliferation of relatively cheap, lethal drone technology to state and non-state actors is transforming the character of armed conflict worldwide, as demonstrated in the wars in Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh, Libya, and Ethiopia.

At its core, the drone warfare policy debate involves three overlapping challenges: establishing accountability and legal frameworks for the U.S. targeted killing program, governing the development and deployment of increasingly autonomous weapons, and building international norms to manage the global proliferation of armed drone technology. Progress on any one of these requires addressing the structural incentives that have allowed drone warfare to expand with minimal oversight: the low political cost of "riskless" war, executive branch secrecy, congressional abdication of war powers, and the defense industry's financial interest in expanding unmanned systems.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key components of drone warfare policy:

- **Targeted Killing Program**: U.S. drone strikes in counterterrorism operations, including legal authorities, targeting standards, and civilian casualty accountability
- **Autonomous Weapons Development**: The trajectory toward lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) and the debate over meaningful human control
- **Legal Framework**: The constitutional, statutory, and international law frameworks governing drone strikes and autonomous weapons
- **Civilian Casualties**: The scale of civilian harm, investigation failures, and accountability gaps
- **Oversight and Accountability**: Congressional oversight, transparency requirements, and institutional checks on executive authority
- **Drone Proliferation**: The spread of armed drone technology to other nations and non-state actors
- **Counter-Drone Technology**: Defensive systems and strategies for addressing hostile drone threats
- **Future of Unmanned Warfare**: Emerging technologies including drone swarms, AI-enabled targeting, and human-machine teaming

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Force Protection vs. Accountability**: Drones eliminate risk to U.S. personnel but also eliminate the political cost that historically constrained the use of force, enabling open-ended military campaigns with minimal public debate or congressional oversight.
- **Precision vs. Civilian Harm**: Drones are marketed as "precision" weapons, but intelligence failures, targeting errors, and "signature strikes" based on behavioral patterns rather than positive identification have killed hundreds or thousands of civilians.
- **Executive Flexibility vs. Congressional War Powers**: Presidents of both parties have claimed broad authority to conduct drone strikes under the 2001 AUMF and Article II Commander-in-Chief powers, while Congress has largely abdicated its constitutional role in authorizing and overseeing the use of force.
- **Secrecy vs. Democratic Legitimacy**: Much of the drone program, particularly CIA operations, has been conducted under classification regimes that prevent public scrutiny, judicial review, and meaningful congressional oversight.
- **Technological Advantage vs. Proliferation Risk**: The United States pioneered armed drone warfare but cannot prevent other nations and non-state actors from acquiring similar capabilities, creating a world in which the norms the U.S. establishes (or fails to establish) will govern how others use the same technology.
- **Human Control vs. Autonomous Efficiency**: AI-enabled autonomous weapons can process information and engage targets faster than human operators, but removing humans from lethal decisions raises profound legal, ethical, and strategic concerns.

## Key Questions

1. What legal framework should govern the use of lethal force by drones outside of recognized armed conflicts, and how should Congress reclaim its constitutional war powers role?
2. How can the United States establish meaningful accountability for civilian casualties from drone strikes, including independent investigations, public reporting, and compensation for victims?
3. What degree of human control should be required over autonomous weapons systems, and should the U.S. support an international ban or regulation of fully autonomous lethal weapons?
4. How should the United States manage the global proliferation of armed drone technology, including to authoritarian regimes and non-state actors?
5. What institutional reforms are needed to ensure that drone warfare decisions are subject to adequate oversight by Congress, the courts, and the public?
6. How can the United States develop effective counter-drone capabilities to protect military forces and critical infrastructure from hostile drone threats?

## Vision of Success

A successful drone warfare policy framework would:

- **Establish Clear Legal Authority**: All lethal drone operations are conducted under specific, time-limited congressional authorization with defined geographic and target limitations, not under open-ended authorities from 2001.
- **Minimize Civilian Harm**: Robust pre-strike procedures, independent post-strike investigations, transparent public reporting, and meaningful compensation for civilians harmed by U.S. operations.
- **Maintain Human Control**: A binding policy requiring meaningful human control over all lethal targeting decisions, with clear prohibitions on fully autonomous kill decisions.
- **Ensure Congressional Oversight**: Regular, substantive reporting to Congress on all drone operations, with mechanisms for Congress to authorize, limit, or terminate operations.
- **Lead on International Norms**: The United States leads the development of binding international agreements governing armed drones and autonomous weapons, leveraging its experience and credibility.
- **Address Proliferation**: An effective export control regime and diplomatic strategy to prevent the spread of armed drone technology to irresponsible state and non-state actors.
- **Integrate Transparency**: The default is public accountability, with classification limited to genuinely sensitive sources and methods rather than used as a shield against political embarrassment.
