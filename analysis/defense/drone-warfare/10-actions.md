# Drone Warfare: Citizen Actions

## Overview

Drone warfare policy is shaped primarily by executive branch decisions, military bureaucracies, and defense industry lobbying, making it one of the most difficult areas for citizen engagement. However, the bipartisan coalition that has formed around AUMF reform and drone accountability demonstrates that public pressure can move these issues. The key is sustained engagement that connects the abstract policy debate to concrete accountability demands.

## Individual Actions

### Educate Yourself

- **Read the primary sources**: The Bureau of Investigative Journalism's drone strike database, the *New York Times* "Civilian Casualty Files," and the Congressional Research Service reports on drone policy and the AUMF provide the factual foundation for informed engagement.
- **Understand the legal framework**: Learn the basics of the 2001 AUMF, the War Powers Resolution, and the constitutional war powers debate. Just Security (justsecurity.org) and Lawfare (lawfaremedia.org) publish accessible analysis.
- **Follow the technology debate**: The autonomous weapons and AI governance discussion is moving rapidly. The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and CNAS publications are good starting points.
- **Track congressional action**: Monitor war powers votes, NDAA amendments, and committee hearings through Congress.gov and your representatives' websites.

### Contact Your Representatives

- **Demand AUMF reform**: Call or write your senators and representative to support repeal and replacement of the 2001 AUMF with a narrow, time-limited authorization. This is the single most impactful legislative reform.
- **Support drone strike transparency legislation**: Ask your representatives to co-sponsor or support legislation requiring statutory public reporting of drone strikes and civilian casualties.
- **Ask about autonomous weapons**: Inquire about your representatives' position on meaningful human control over lethal autonomous weapons systems.
- **Request accountability for civilian casualties**: Demand that your representatives push for independent investigations of civilian harm and adequate funding for the civilian victim compensation fund.

**Tips for effective contact**:

- Phone calls are more impactful than emails; in-person meetings at district offices are most impactful
- Reference specific legislation by name and bill number when possible
- Share personal connections to the issue (military service, travel to affected regions, moral or religious convictions)
- Follow up after initial contact; sustained engagement matters more than one-time outreach

### Support Investigative Journalism

- Subscribe to outlets conducting drone warfare investigations (*New York Times*, *The Intercept*, *Washington Post*)
- Support the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and Airwars through donations
- Share investigative reporting on drone strikes and civilian casualties with your networks
- Write letters to the editor when major drone warfare stories are published

### Exercise Your Vote

- Make war powers and drone policy part of your candidate evaluation criteria
- Ask candidates at town halls and debates about their positions on AUMF reform, drone transparency, and autonomous weapons
- Support candidates who have demonstrated commitment to war powers reform, regardless of party
- Participate in primary elections, where war powers debates are more likely to surface

## Community Actions

### Organize Local Events

- **Host community screenings**: Documentaries like *Drone* (2014) and *National Bird* (2016) provide accessible entry points for community discussion.
- **Invite speakers**: Veterans who served in drone operations, legal scholars, and representatives from organizations like CIVIC or the ACLU can bring expertise to community forums.
- **Connect with faith communities**: Many religious organizations have engaged on drone warfare issues through their commitment to protecting civilians and promoting peace. Interfaith councils can amplify calls for accountability.
- **Engage veterans' organizations**: Veterans have unique credibility on war powers and drone policy issues. Connect with local chapters of VoteVets, Common Defense, or other veterans' organizations.

### Build Local Coalitions

- **Left-right coalitions**: Drone warfare reform unites progressive anti-war activists with libertarian and constitutionalist conservatives. Build local coalitions that reflect this bipartisan alignment.
- **Academic engagement**: Universities with national security, law, or international relations programs can host seminars, debates, and research projects on drone policy.
- **City council resolutions**: While drone warfare is a federal issue, local resolutions calling for AUMF reform and drone transparency can signal grassroots support and attract media attention.

## Political Actions

### Advocacy Campaign Participation

| Organization | Campaign/Focus | How to Get Involved |
|---|---|---|
| ACLU | AUMF reform; drone transparency; FOIA litigation | Join action alerts; donate; attend events |
| Win Without War | End "forever wars"; AUMF repeal; reduce military spending | Sign petitions; call campaigns; grassroots organizing |
| Demand Progress | War powers reform; congressional oversight | Email campaigns; congressional advocacy |
| VoteVets | Veteran-led advocacy for responsible use of force | Amplify veteran voices; attend events |
| Campaign to Stop Killer Robots | International ban on fully autonomous weapons | Sign the pledge; participate in awareness campaigns |
| Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) | Civilian harm mitigation and accountability | Support research; engage with congressional advocacy |
| R Street Institute | Conservative/libertarian war powers reform | Policy engagement; coalition building |
| Concerned Veterans for America | Restraint-oriented foreign policy reform | Grassroots organizing; congressional engagement |

### Congressional Engagement Strategies

**For AUMF Reform**:

- Support the Kaine-Lee bipartisan framework for AUMF repeal and replacement
- Push for war powers amendments during the annual NDAA process (typically June-September)
- Demand that your senators allow war powers legislation to reach the floor for a vote
- Organize constituent delegations to meet with members during congressional recess

**For Drone Transparency**:

- Support legislation requiring statutory public reporting of drone strikes
- Push for adequate funding and authority for the DoD Inspector General to audit civilian casualty procedures
- Demand declassification of historical drone strike records

**For Autonomous Weapons Governance**:

- Support legislation requiring meaningful human control over lethal autonomous weapons
- Urge U.S. engagement in international negotiations on autonomous weapons regulation
- Connect with technology sector advocates who support responsible AI development

### Electoral Strategy

- **Track war powers votes**: Use congressional vote records to hold representatives accountable. Key votes include AUMF repeal amendments, NDAA war powers provisions, and appropriations restrictions.
- **Primary challenges**: Members who consistently block war powers reform are vulnerable to primary challenges from both the anti-war left and the libertarian right.
- **Ballot initiatives**: In states that allow ballot initiatives, consider measures calling on Congress to reform the AUMF or require drone strike transparency (these are non-binding but create political pressure).

## What Does Not Work

- **Slacktivism**: Signing online petitions without follow-up contact with representatives has minimal impact on war powers debates.
- **Partisan framing**: Drone warfare reform dies when it is framed as a partisan issue. The most effective advocacy emphasizes constitutional principles and accountability rather than party-line arguments.
- **Single-incident outrage**: Media-driven outrage after specific incidents (Kabul strike, Soleimani killing) fades quickly. Sustained engagement on structural reform is more effective than reactive campaigns.
- **Ignoring the technology debate**: Focusing only on current drone strikes while ignoring autonomous weapons development means fighting the last war. The governance challenges of the next decade will be about AI and autonomy, not just Reapers and Hellfires.
