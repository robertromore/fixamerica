# Drone Warfare: Root Causes

## Overview

The accountability gaps, civilian harm, and unchecked expansion of U.S. drone warfare are not accidental. They are the predictable result of structural, institutional, and political economy factors that collectively incentivize the use of lethal force while minimizing oversight and transparency. Understanding these root causes is essential to designing reforms that will survive changes in administration and resist the institutional pressures that have undermined previous reform efforts.

## Structural Causes

### The Low Political Cost of "Riskless" War

The most fundamental driver of drone warfare's expansion is the near-elimination of political risk for decision-makers. Traditional military operations create political costs through American casualties, deployment of ground forces, and visible engagement that triggers public attention and congressional scrutiny. Drone strikes eliminate all three:

- **No American Lives at Risk**: The most powerful constraint on the use of force in a democracy is the prospect of American casualties. Drones remove this constraint entirely, allowing lethal operations to continue indefinitely without triggering the domestic political backlash that historically forced Congress to exercise its war powers.
- **No Deployment Visibility**: There are no deployment orders, no National Guard mobilizations, no returning coffins. The operations are invisible to most Americans.
- **No "War Footing"**: The country does not feel like it is at war, even when the government is conducting lethal operations in multiple countries simultaneously. This removes the political urgency that would otherwise force congressional action.

The result is a form of warfare that can be sustained indefinitely because it imposes almost no costs on the domestic population or political class. As former CIA Director Leon Panetta observed, drones are "the only game in town" precisely because they allow the government to project lethal force without the political constraints that attend conventional military operations.

### Classification and Secrecy

The drone program has been shielded from democratic accountability by multiple layers of classification:

- **Covert Action Under Title 50**: CIA drone operations were classified as "covert action," which meant the government could not officially acknowledge their existence even as hundreds of strikes were reported by journalists and local officials. This classification prevented public debate, judicial review, and meaningful congressional oversight.
- **Classified Legal Memoranda**: The legal justifications for drone strikes, including the OLC memo authorizing the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, were classified for years. The public and Congress could not evaluate the legal basis for the government's actions because the legal reasoning was secret.
- **Classification of Civilian Casualty Data**: The government classified much of its civilian casualty assessment data, preventing independent verification of its claims about the precision and legality of strikes. When the *New York Times* obtained classified Pentagon assessments in 2021, they revealed systematic undercounting and inadequate investigation of civilian deaths.
- **State Secrets Privilege**: The government has invoked the state secrets privilege to prevent judicial review of drone strike decisions, including in *Al-Aulaqi v. Panetta* (2014), effectively placing the targeted killing program beyond the reach of the courts.

The cumulative effect is a program that operates in a legal and political black box, where the executive branch is simultaneously the decision-maker, the executor, the investigator of mistakes, and the judge of its own compliance with the law.

### Executive Authority Expansion

The drone program represents a dramatic expansion of presidential power that has been enabled by three interconnected dynamics:

- **The 2001 AUMF as a Blank Check**: The 60-word 2001 AUMF has been interpreted by successive administrations to authorize force against groups and in countries that did not exist or were not contemplated in September 2001. The "associated forces" doctrine, developed through executive branch legal interpretation rather than legislation, extended the AUMF to cover al-Shabaab, ISIS, AQAP, and other groups with varying degrees of connection to the original al-Qaeda organization.
- **Article II Self-Defense Claims**: Presidents have increasingly asserted inherent Article II authority to conduct drone strikes in "self-defense" of U.S. persons, bypassing the AUMF framework entirely. The Soleimani strike in January 2020 and the Houthi strikes beginning in January 2024 were conducted under Article II, not the AUMF, demonstrating that executive authority for drone strikes does not depend on congressional authorization at all.
- **Unilateral Executive Policy-Making**: The rules governing drone strikes (Obama's PPG, Trump's PSP, Biden's PPM) are all classified executive branch documents that can be changed, weakened, or revoked by any president at any time without congressional input. The Trump administration demonstrated this fragility by revoking Obama's constraints within months of taking office.

### Congressional Abdication

Congress has systematically failed to exercise its constitutional war powers role with respect to drone warfare:

- **No Vote on Drone Strikes**: Congress has never held a vote specifically authorizing or restricting the drone strike program. The 2001 AUMF, passed three days after 9/11, has served as the default authority for over two decades.
- **Political Incentives Against Action**: Members of Congress face asymmetric political risk: voting to restrict drone strikes exposes them to accusations of being "weak on terrorism" if an attack subsequently occurs, while voting to authorize or fund strikes carries no political cost since the operations are invisible to most constituents.
- **Bipartisan Abdication**: Both parties have contributed to congressional inaction. Republicans have generally deferred to presidential war-making authority, while Democrats have been reluctant to challenge presidents of their own party. The result is a structural incentive for Congress to avoid war powers votes entirely.
- **Inadequate Oversight Mechanisms**: The congressional intelligence and armed services committees receive classified briefings on drone operations, but the briefings are often incomplete, the committees lack staff with sufficient security clearances to conduct independent analysis, and individual members are restricted from sharing information with colleagues or the public.

## Institutional Causes

### Bureaucratic Momentum

The drone program has developed its own institutional momentum that is resistant to change:

- **Organizational Investment**: The Air Force, Army, CIA, JSOC, and intelligence community have invested billions in drone infrastructure, training, personnel, and operational processes. These organizations have institutional incentives to maintain and expand the programs that justify their budgets and missions.
- **Targeting Processes as Routine**: What began as extraordinary actions (killing individuals in sovereign countries without their consent or knowledge) has become bureaucratic routine. Targeting lists, strike approval chains, and post-strike assessment procedures have been institutionalized in ways that normalize lethal operations.
- **Risk Aversion in Reverse**: Military and intelligence bureaucracies are risk-averse about *not* striking a potential threat. The institutional consequences of a missed target who later conducts an attack are severe (congressional investigations, media scrutiny, career damage), while the consequences of a strike that kills civilians are comparatively mild (classified investigations, limited accountability).

### Intelligence Community Resistance to Transparency

The intelligence community has a deep institutional bias against transparency that has shielded the drone program from accountability:

- **Sources and Methods Protection**: The IC reflexively invokes "sources and methods" protection to classify information that, in many cases, is already publicly known from media reporting, local accounts, and independent monitoring organizations.
- **Covert Action Culture**: The CIA's covert action culture treats secrecy as a core operational value, not just a legal requirement. This culture resists declassification and public accountability as threats to operational effectiveness, even when the operations in question are widely known.
- **Classification as Institutional Power**: Classification gives agencies control over information, which translates into power over policy debates. An agency that controls the flow of information to Congress and the public can shape perceptions of the program's effectiveness and legality.

### Inadequate Civilian Harm Assessment

The military's institutional processes for assessing and responding to civilian casualties have been structurally inadequate:

- **Self-Investigation**: The same military organizations that conduct strikes are responsible for investigating civilian casualty allegations. This creates an inherent conflict of interest that has produced systematic undercounting.
- **Confirmation Bias in Intelligence**: Pre-strike intelligence assessments tend to confirm the desirability of striking, while post-strike assessments tend to minimize civilian harm. The *New York Times* "Civilian Casualty Files" investigation documented cases where military investigators accepted implausible explanations to avoid acknowledging civilian deaths.
- **Lack of Ground Presence**: "Over-the-horizon" operations conducted without ground forces in the strike area make post-strike damage assessment extremely difficult, relying on overhead surveillance that cannot distinguish combatants from civilians in the aftermath of a strike.
- **Burden of Proof on Victims**: The U.S. system effectively places the burden of proof on civilian victims or their families to prove they were harmed, rather than on the government to demonstrate it met its legal obligations. In many strike locations (rural Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia), victims have no access to formal complaint mechanisms.

## Political Economy Causes

### Defense Industry Incentives

The drone industry creates powerful economic incentives for program expansion:

- **Major Contractors**: General Atomics (manufacturer of the Predator, Reaper, and Avenger), Northrop Grumman (Global Hawk), Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and L3Harris Technologies have billions in drone-related contracts. These companies employ lobbyists, fund think tanks, and contribute to the campaigns of members on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees.
- **Economic Geography**: Drone manufacturing and operations are concentrated in politically important states and congressional districts. General Atomics' operations in San Diego, California, and the drone pilot training pipeline at bases in Nevada, New Mexico, and North Dakota create local economic dependencies.
- **Innovation Narrative**: The defense industry frames drone and autonomous weapons development as essential for maintaining U.S. technological superiority against China and Russia, linking counterterrorism drone programs to the politically popular goal of great power competition.

### Think Tank and Media Ecosystem

The policy debate around drone warfare is shaped by a network of think tanks, many of which receive funding from defense contractors:

- **Hawkish think tanks** (American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation, Foundation for Defense of Democracies) generally support expanded drone operations and resist constraints on executive authority.
- **Centrist national security think tanks** (Center for a New American Security, Brookings) generally support the program's continuation with improved oversight, providing intellectual cover for the "reform not end" approach.
- **Civil liberties and anti-war organizations** (ACLU, Reprieve, Center for Civilians in Conflict) advocate for transparency, accountability, and legal constraints but have less influence on policy outcomes.

### Public Indifference

The American public has generally supported drone strikes when asked in polls, with approval often exceeding 60%. This support is driven by:

- **Distance from Consequences**: Americans do not see the results of drone strikes and are not personally affected by them. The victims are in remote areas of countries most Americans could not locate on a map.
- **"Clean War" Narrative**: Drones are marketed as precision weapons that minimize collateral damage, reinforcing the perception that they are a humane alternative to ground operations.
- **Asymmetric Attention**: A single American casualty generates more media coverage and political response than hundreds of foreign civilian casualties from drone strikes.
- **Terrorism Fear**: Post-9/11 fear of terrorism creates public tolerance for aggressive government action, even when the details of that action are hidden behind classification.

## Root Cause Interaction Map

| Root Cause | Enables | Reinforced By |
|---|---|---|
| Low political cost | Executive expansion, congressional abdication | Secrecy, public indifference |
| Classification/secrecy | Lack of accountability, weak oversight | IC resistance, executive authority claims |
| Executive authority expansion | Unchecked use of force | Congressional abdication, AUMF breadth |
| Congressional abdication | Executive expansion, lack of legal framework | Political incentives, public indifference |
| Defense industry incentives | Program expansion, resistance to cuts | Congressional economic interests, innovation narrative |
| Inadequate civilian harm assessment | Undercounting of civilian deaths, lack of accountability | Self-investigation, classification, lack of ground presence |
| Public indifference | Congressional inaction, continued expansion | "Clean war" narrative, distance from consequences |

## Key Insight

These root causes form a self-reinforcing system. Low political cost enables continued operations, which generates institutional momentum and defense industry investment, which creates constituencies that resist reform, which reinforces congressional inaction, which preserves executive authority to continue operations with minimal oversight. Breaking this cycle requires interventions at multiple points simultaneously: legal constraints on executive authority, mandatory transparency, independent oversight mechanisms, and institutional reforms that change the incentive structures within the military, intelligence community, and Congress.
