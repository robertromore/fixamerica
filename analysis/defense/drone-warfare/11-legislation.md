# Drone Warfare: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative framework for drone warfare reform requires two complementary federal bills addressing the two most urgent governance gaps: the lack of transparency and accountability for existing drone strike operations, and the absence of statutory governance for increasingly autonomous weapons systems.

- **The Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act** establishes mandatory public reporting of all lethal drone operations, requires independent civilian casualty investigations, creates a permanent victim compensation mechanism, and codifies targeting standards that apply across all government agencies.
- **The Autonomous Weapons Governance Act** establishes a statutory requirement for meaningful human control over all lethal autonomous weapons systems, prohibits fully autonomous kill decisions against human targets, and creates a certification and oversight framework for autonomous weapons development and deployment.

Together, these bills address the current accountability deficit and the emerging governance challenge of autonomous weapons. The first bill looks backward and present, establishing accountability for what the U.S. has done and is doing. The second looks forward, establishing governance for what the U.S. is building.

**Key principles guiding this legislation**:

- Transparency must be statutory, not dependent on executive orders that can be revoked
- Independent investigation of civilian harm requires structural separation from the chain of command
- Targeting standards must apply uniformly across all agencies (DoD, CIA, JSOC) to prevent circumvention
- Meaningful human control over lethal decisions must be defined in law, not left to executive directives
- International norm-building requires a credible domestic framework as its foundation
- Victims of U.S. operations must have access to formal compensation mechanisms
- Congressional oversight must be mandatory, timely, and enforceable through appropriations

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for this legislation. The existing constitutional framework provides sufficient authority:

- **Article I, Section 8** grants Congress the power "To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water" and "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces."
- **Article II, Section 2** designates the President as "Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States."
- **The Fifth Amendment** provides that no person shall "be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."

The proposed legislation operates within these existing authorities. Congress's power to "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" provides explicit textual authority to establish targeting standards, reporting requirements, and autonomous weapons governance for the military. The Supreme Court in *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), affirmed that Congress has broad authority to regulate the conduct of military operations. Legislation restricting targeting methods and requiring transparency falls squarely within this power.

## Federal Legislation

### The Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To require annual public reporting of all lethal drone operations, mandate independent civilian casualty investigations, establish a victim compensation fund, and codify targeting standards applicable to all U.S. government agencies.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Annual Public Reporting**: Requires the President to publish an annual unclassified report on all lethal drone operations, including strike numbers, countries of operation, and civilian casualty assessments.
2. **Independent Civilian Casualty Investigation**: Establishes an independent Civilian Harm Review Board within the DoD Inspector General to investigate all credible allegations of civilian casualties.
3. **Victim Compensation Fund**: Creates a permanent fund for compensating civilians harmed by U.S. drone strikes, with simplified claims procedures.
4. **Targeting Standards Codification**: Codifies the "near certainty" standard for strikes outside active hostilities and prohibits signature strikes.
5. **Agency-Wide Application**: Requires that all provisions apply to operations conducted by any U.S. government agency, including the CIA, preventing circumvention through Title 50 covert action authorities.
6. **Declassification**: Mandates a review and public disclosure of historical drone strike records older than five years.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To establish transparency, accountability, and targeting standards for the use
of lethal unmanned aerial systems by the United States Government.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Since 2001, the United States has conducted thousands of lethal
drone strikes in at least seven countries, resulting in significant
civilian casualties that have been systematically undercounted by
official assessments.
(2) The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has documented between 910
and 2,200 civilian deaths from United States drone strikes in Pakistan,
Yemen, and Somalia between 2004 and 2024.
(3) A 2021 investigation by the New York Times revealed systemic
failures in the Department of Defense civilian casualty assessment
process, including cases in which no investigation was conducted despite
credible evidence of civilian harm.
(4) The August 29, 2021, drone strike in Kabul that killed 10
civilians including 7 children demonstrated catastrophic failures in
intelligence analysis and targeting procedures, and no military
personnel were held accountable.
(5) Executive Order 13732, which required annual public reporting of
civilian casualties, was revoked in 2019, demonstrating the fragility
of executive-order-based transparency requirements.
(6) The absence of statutory transparency and accountability
requirements has enabled the expansion of lethal drone operations with
insufficient public oversight, congressional scrutiny, or judicial
review.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) LETHAL DRONE OPERATION.--The term "lethal drone operation" means
any operation in which an unmanned aerial system is used to deliver
lethal force against an individual or group, whether conducted by the
Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, or any other
department or agency of the United States Government.
(2) CIVILIAN CASUALTY.--The term "civilian casualty" means the death
or injury of any person who is not a lawful military target under the
law of armed conflict. For purposes of this Act, any person whose
status is unknown or disputed at the time of a strike shall be
presumed to be a civilian unless the investigating authority determines
otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.
(3) AREA OF ACTIVE HOSTILITIES.--The term "area of active hostilities"
means a geographic area in which the Armed Forces of the United States
are engaged in sustained combat operations against an organized armed
group. A designation of an area of active hostilities shall be made by
the Secretary of Defense and reported to the congressional defense
committees within 48 hours. Such designation shall expire after 1 year
unless renewed.
(4) SIGNATURE STRIKE.--The term "signature strike" means a strike
authorized against an individual or group based on behavioral patterns,
geographic location, or association rather than positive identification
of a specific, named individual.
(5) CREDIBLE ALLEGATION.--The term "credible allegation" means a
report of civilian harm from any source, including but not limited to
media reports, nongovernmental organizations, partner governments,
international organizations, or self-reporting by military units, that
provides sufficient factual detail to warrant investigation.

SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORTING REQUIREMENT.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Not later than March 1 of each year, the President
shall submit to Congress and make publicly available an unclassified
annual report on all lethal drone operations conducted during the
preceding calendar year.
(b) CONTENTS.--Each report under subsection (a) shall include--
    (1) the total number of lethal drone operations conducted,
    disaggregated by country and legal authority;
    (2) the total number of combatant deaths resulting from such
    operations, disaggregated by country;
    (3) the total number of civilian casualties (deaths and injuries)
    resulting from such operations, disaggregated by country;
    (4) a description of the legal authority under which each
    category of operations was conducted, including citations to
    statutory authorization, Article II authority, or host nation
    consent;
    (5) the methodology used to assess civilian casualties, including
    sources consulted and standards of evidence applied;
    (6) a summary of investigations conducted under section 5 and
    their outcomes; and
    (7) a summary of compensation payments made under section 6.
(c) CLASSIFIED SUPPLEMENT.--A classified supplement may accompany
the report under subsection (a) if the President determines that
certain operational details would compromise intelligence sources and
methods. The classified supplement shall be made available to the
congressional intelligence committees and the congressional defense
committees.
(d) PROHIBITION ON OMISSION.--No lethal drone operation may be
excluded from the report required under subsection (a) on the basis
that it was conducted under covert action authorities or by an agency
other than the Department of Defense.

SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT CIVILIAN CASUALTY INVESTIGATION.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established within the Office of the
Inspector General of the Department of Defense an independent Civilian
Harm Review Board (in this section referred to as the "Board").
(b) COMPOSITION.--The Board shall consist of--
    (1) a chairperson appointed by the Inspector General of the
    Department of Defense;
    (2) not fewer than 5 additional members, including at least 2

    with experience in civilian harm assessment methodology; and
    (3) investigative staff with appropriate security clearances.
(c) MANDATORY INVESTIGATION.--The Board shall conduct an independent
investigation of any lethal drone operation that is the subject of a
credible allegation of civilian casualties.
(d) ACCESS.--The Board shall have access to all records, strike
footage, intelligence assessments, targeting packages, and post-strike
assessments related to any operation under investigation, regardless
of the agency that conducted the operation.
(e) FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.--Upon completing an investigation,
the Board shall--
    (1) publish an unclassified summary of its findings;
    (2) submit a classified report to the congressional intelligence
    and defense committees;
    (3) recommend corrective actions, including disciplinary measures,
    policy changes, and compensation for victims; and
    (4) refer matters to the Attorney General if the investigation
    reveals evidence of criminal conduct.
(f) ANNUAL AUDIT.--The Board shall conduct an annual audit of the
Department of Defense civilian casualty assessment process and
publish its findings.

SEC. 6. CIVILIAN VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established within the Department of
Defense the "Civilian Victims of United States Drone Operations Fund"
(in this section referred to as the "Fund").
(b) PAYMENTS.--The Secretary of Defense shall make payments from the

drone operation may be conducted outside an area of active hostilities
unless--
    (1) the target has been positively identified as an individual
    who poses a continuing, imminent threat to United States persons;
    (2) capture of the individual is not feasible; and
    (3) there is near certainty that the target is present and that
    civilians will not be injured or killed.
(b) PROHIBITION ON SIGNATURE STRIKES.--No lethal drone operation may
be authorized based on behavioral patterns, geographic location, or
association rather than the positive identification of a specific,
named individual. Signature strikes are prohibited.
(c) APPLICATION.--The standards in this section apply to all lethal
drone operations conducted by or at the direction of any department
or agency of the United States Government, regardless of the statutory
title under which the operation is authorized.

SEC. 8. DECLASSIFICATION REVIEW.

(a) REVIEW.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of
this Act, the Director of National Intelligence shall complete a
declassification review of all records relating to lethal drone
operations conducted by the United States between September 11, 2001,

remain available until expended.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Provides statutory precision to key terms. The presumption that persons of unknown status are civilians closes the "military-age male" loophole used by previous administrations to minimize reported civilian deaths. The definition of "area of active hostilities" requires a formal designation with congressional notification, preventing presidents from unilaterally expanding permissive targeting zones.
- **Section 4 (Reporting)**: Creates a permanent statutory reporting requirement that cannot be revoked by executive action. The prohibition on omitting CIA operations closes the Title 50 loophole that has allowed covert strikes to avoid public accounting.
- **Section 5 (Investigation)**: Establishes an independent investigation body structurally separate from the operational chain of command, addressing the self-investigation problem that has produced systematic undercounting.
- **Section 6 (Compensation)**: Creates a permanent, adequately funded mechanism replacing the ad hoc system that has left most civilian victims without recourse.
- **Section 7 (Targeting Standards)**: Codifies the "near certainty" standard in statute, preventing any president from unilaterally lowering the threshold. The signature strike prohibition addresses one of the most criticized aspects of the drone program.
- **Section 8 (Declassification)**: Enables historical accountability by requiring disclosure of the scope of two decades of operations.

**Legislative Vehicle**: NDAA amendment or standalone bill through the Senate Armed Services or Intelligence Committees.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|---|---|---|
| Establish Civilian Harm Review Board | 90 days after enactment | DoD Inspector General |
| Establish Victim Compensation Fund | 90 days after enactment | Secretary of Defense |
| Publish civilian casualty assessment methodology | 120 days after enactment | DoD IG |
| First Annual Report | March 1, 2028 | President |
| Complete declassification review | 1 year after enactment | DNI |

**Challenges**:

- **Executive Branch Resistance**: Presidents will resist mandatory reporting and independent investigation as encroachments on Commander-in-Chief authority.
- **Classification Barriers**: Intelligence agencies will argue that any disclosure compromises sources and methods.
- **CIA Opposition**: The CIA will resist provisions applying targeting standards and reporting to covert operations.

**Refinements**:

- Include a provision allowing the DNI to defer declassification of specific records for 2 years upon written certification, with mandatory re-review
- Add a "fast-track" procedure for emergency investigations when credible allegations indicate mass casualty events
- Include an interoperability provision allowing the Civilian Harm Review Board to coordinate with allied nations' civilian harm investigation mechanisms

### The Autonomous Weapons Governance Act

**Purpose**: To require meaningful human control over all lethal autonomous weapons systems, prohibit fully autonomous kill decisions against human targets, and establish a certification and oversight framework for autonomous weapons development and deployment.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Meaningful Human Control Requirement**: Requires that a human operator authorize each specific lethal engagement, with sufficient information and time to exercise independent judgment.
2. **Prohibition on Fully Autonomous Kill Decisions**: Prohibits deployment of weapons systems that can select and engage human targets without explicit human authorization for each engagement.
3. **Certification Framework**: Establishes a testing and certification process for autonomous weapons systems.
4. **Congressional Notification**: Requires notification to Congress before deployment of new autonomous weapons systems.
5. **Defensive Systems Exception**: Exempts systems designed to counter incoming missiles, rockets, and munitions where reaction time precludes human authorization.
6. **International Engagement**: Directs the State Department to pursue international agreements on autonomous weapons governance.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To require meaningful human control over lethal autonomous weapons
systems and to prohibit fully autonomous lethal engagements against
human targets.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Autonomous Weapons Governance Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Department of Defense is investing billions of dollars in
autonomous and artificial intelligence-enabled weapons systems,
including the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program, the Replicator
Initiative, and Project Maven.
(2) DoD Directive 3000.09, which governs autonomous weapons
development, uses vague language regarding human control requirements
and can be modified or revoked by the Secretary of Defense without
congressional input.
(3) Lethal autonomous weapons systems that can select and engage
targets without meaningful human control raise profound legal,
ethical, and strategic concerns, including questions of accountability
under international humanitarian law.
(4) The principle of distinction under the Geneva Conventions
requires that parties to a conflict distinguish between combatants
and civilians at all times. Current artificial intelligence technology
cannot reliably make this distinction in complex operational
environments.
(5) The United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
Group of Governmental Experts has been discussing regulation of lethal
autonomous weapons systems since 2017 without producing binding
obligations.
(6) Rapid global proliferation of autonomous weapons technology,
including by China, Russia, Turkey, and Iran, creates urgent need
for governance frameworks.
(7) The norms the United States establishes for its own autonomous
weapons will significantly influence global standards and practices.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS SYSTEM.--The term "autonomous weapons system"
means a weapons system that, once activated, can select and engage
targets without further human input.
(2) SEMI-AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS SYSTEM.--The term "semi-autonomous
weapons system" means a weapons system that employs autonomy for
engagement-related functions, including target acquisition, tracking,
or engagement recommendations, but requires a human operator to
authorize each specific engagement.
(3) MEANINGFUL HUMAN CONTROL.--The term "meaningful human control"
means that a human operator--
    (A) authorizes each specific lethal engagement against a human
    target;
    (B) has access to sufficient contextual information to make an
    informed judgment about the legality and appropriateness of the
    engagement;
    (C) has sufficient time to exercise independent judgment,
    including the ability to abort the engagement;
    (D) is trained and competent to evaluate the information
    provided by the autonomous system; and
    (E) bears legal and moral responsibility for the engagement
    decision.
(4) LETHAL ENGAGEMENT.--The term "lethal engagement" means the use
of force by a weapons system that is intended to cause, or may
reasonably be expected to cause, death or serious bodily harm to a
human being.
(5) DEFENSIVE SYSTEM.--The term "defensive system" means a weapons
system designed to counter incoming missiles, rockets, artillery,
mortars, or unmanned aerial systems in situations where the speed of
the incoming threat precludes meaningful human authorization of each
individual engagement.

SEC. 4. MEANINGFUL HUMAN CONTROL REQUIREMENT.

(a) REQUIREMENT.--No department or agency of the United States
Government may develop, procure, or deploy an autonomous weapons
system for use against human targets unless such system maintains
meaningful human control as defined in section 3(3).
(b) PROHIBITION.--No autonomous weapons system may conduct a lethal
engagement against a human target without the explicit authorization
of a human operator for that specific engagement.
(c) PROHIBITION ON DELEGATION.--The requirement for human
authorization under subsection (b) may not be delegated to an
automated or algorithmic process, regardless of the sophistication
of such process.

SEC. 5. DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS EXCEPTION.

(a) EXCEPTION.--The requirements of section 4(b) do not apply to
defensive systems as defined in section 3(5), provided that--
    (1) the system is designed and tested to engage only non-human
    targets (incoming munitions, missiles, rockets, or unmanned
    systems);
    (2) the system includes safeguards to prevent engagement of
    manned aircraft, civilian vehicles, or other objects that are
    not incoming threats; and
    (3) a human operator retains the authority to activate,
    deactivate, and override the system at all times.
(b) REPORTING.--The Secretary of Defense shall include in the annual
report required under section 8 a list of all defensive systems
deployed under this exception and any incidents involving unintended
engagements.

SEC. 6. CERTIFICATION AND TESTING.

(a) CERTIFICATION REQUIRED.--No autonomous or semi-autonomous
weapons system may be deployed for operational use until it has
been certified by the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and
Engineering as complying with the requirements of this Act.
(b) TESTING REQUIREMENTS.--Certification under subsection (a)
shall require--
    (1) testing in realistic operational environments, including
    environments with civilian populations;
    (2) evaluation of the system's ability to distinguish between
    combatants and civilians in accordance with international
    humanitarian law;
    (3) evaluation of the system's reliability, including failure
    modes and the consequences of system malfunction;
    (4) assessment of the human-machine interface, including whether
    operators can meaningfully exercise independent judgment; and
    (5) independent review by a panel including civilian experts
    in artificial intelligence, international humanitarian law, and
    ethics.
(c) RECERTIFICATION.--Any significant modification to a certified
system, including software updates that affect targeting or
engagement algorithms, shall require recertification under this
section.

SEC. 7. CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION.

(a) NOTIFICATION REQUIRED.--Not later than 30 days before the
operational deployment of any autonomous or semi-autonomous weapons
system, the Secretary of Defense shall notify the congressional
defense committees and the congressional intelligence committees.
(b) CONTENTS.--The notification under subsection (a) shall include--
    (1) a description of the system and its capabilities;
    (2) the certification under section 6;
    (3) the concept of operations for the system, including the
    role of human operators;
    (4) the rules of engagement governing the system's use; and
    (5) an assessment of the system's compliance with international
    humanitarian law.

SEC. 8. ANNUAL REPORTING.

Not later than March 1 of each year, the Secretary of Defense shall
submit to Congress and make publicly available an unclassified report
on autonomous weapons systems, including--
    (1) a list of all autonomous and semi-autonomous weapons systems
    in development, testing, or deployment;
    (2) the certification status of each system;
    (3) any incidents involving autonomous weapons systems during
    the preceding year, including any unintended engagements;
    (4) an assessment of the global autonomous weapons landscape,
    including adversary capabilities; and
    (5) progress in international negotiations on autonomous weapons
    governance.

SEC. 9. INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT.

(a) POLICY.--It is the policy of the United States to pursue binding
international agreements establishing meaningful human control over
lethal autonomous weapons systems.
(b) NEGOTIATION.--The Secretary of State, in coordination with the
Secretary of Defense, shall--
    (1) pursue negotiations toward a legally binding protocol under
    the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons governing lethal
    autonomous weapons systems;
    (2) engage bilaterally with allies and partners to develop
    common standards for autonomous weapons governance; and
    (3) report to the congressional foreign affairs and armed
    services committees annually on the progress of such
    negotiations.

SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

    (3) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.
(b) AVAILABILITY.--Amounts authorized under subsection (a) shall
remain available until expended.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Provides the most critical element of the bill: a precise statutory definition of "meaningful human control." The five-part definition requires not just a human "in the loop" but a human who is genuinely informed, empowered, and responsible. This prevents "rubber stamp" compliance where a human technically approves engagements without meaningful review.
- **Section 4 (Requirement)**: Establishes the binding requirement and explicitly prohibits delegating the authorization decision to an algorithm, closing a potential loophole where a system could be classified as "human-controlled" because a human activated it even though the system subsequently made targeting decisions autonomously.
- **Section 5 (Exception)**: The defensive systems exception is narrowly tailored to address the legitimate operational need for automated defenses against incoming munitions. The exception does not apply to offensive engagements against human targets.
- **Section 6 (Certification)**: Creates a rigorous pre-deployment testing process that includes independent civilian review, addressing concerns that military testing alone may not adequately evaluate legal and ethical compliance.
- **Section 9 (International Engagement)**: Directs the executive branch to pursue international agreements, establishing a statutory basis for U.S. leadership on autonomous weapons governance.

**Legislative Vehicle**: NDAA amendment or standalone bill through the Senate Armed Services Committee.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|---|---|---|
| Publish interim certification guidance | 90 days after enactment | USD R&E |
| Establish certification review panel | 120 days after enactment | USD R&E |
| Complete review of existing systems | 1 year after enactment | USD R&E |
| First annual report | March 1, 2028 | Secretary of Defense |
| Begin international negotiations | 6 months after enactment | Secretary of State |

**Challenges**:

- **Military Resistance**: The DoD will argue that meaningful human control requirements slow decision-making and create operational disadvantages against adversaries who face no such constraints.
- **Technology Outpacing Law**: Autonomous weapons technology is advancing rapidly; legislation must be technology-neutral to remain relevant.
- **International Competition**: China and Russia are unlikely to accept binding autonomous weapons restrictions, raising questions about whether unilateral U.S. constraints create strategic disadvantage.

**Refinements**:

- Include a waiver provision allowing the Secretary of Defense to request a temporary exception for specific systems in a declared national emergency, subject to 30-day congressional review
- Add a provision requiring that AI systems used in targeting recommendations be subject to algorithmic auditing requirements
- Include a research exemption for testing autonomous systems in controlled environments without operational deployment

---

## State Model Legislation

State-level legislation has limited applicability to drone warfare, which is an exclusively federal domain. However, two areas offer potential for state action:

### State National Guard Drone Operations

States can establish oversight and transparency requirements for state National Guard unmanned aerial system operations, including:

- Restrictions on the use of state National Guard drones for domestic surveillance without warrants
- Reporting requirements for any National Guard drone operations within state boundaries
- Prohibitions on arming state-controlled unmanned systems for domestic use

### State Investment and Procurement

States with public pension funds or procurement authority can:

- Establish ethical investment policies restricting state pension fund investment in companies producing fully autonomous lethal weapons
- Require state agencies to consider autonomous weapons governance policies when awarding technology contracts

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Defense (Office of the Under Secretary for Policy; Office of the Under Secretary for Research and Engineering; Inspector General).

**Supporting Agencies**: Director of National Intelligence (declassification); Central Intelligence Agency (compliance with targeting standards and reporting); Department of State (international engagement and export controls).

**Timeline for Rulemaking**: All regulations required under these Acts shall be promulgated in proposed form within 120 days of enactment and in final form within 240 days, following notice-and-comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). Interim guidance shall be issued within 30 days of enactment.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Civilian Harm Review Board Procedures**: Charter, investigative authority, evidentiary standards, and reporting templates.
2. **Victim Compensation Fund Regulations**: Claims procedures, evidentiary standards, payment schedules, and appeals processes.
3. **Annual Reporting Format**: Standardized format for the annual public report on drone operations, ensuring consistency across administrations.
4. **Autonomous Weapons Certification Procedures**: Testing protocols, review panel composition, certification standards, and recertification triggers.
5. **Meaningful Human Control Technical Standards**: Detailed technical requirements for human-machine interfaces, operator decision authority, and abort procedures.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Inspector General Investigations**: DoD IG reviews of compliance with reporting requirements, targeting standards, and certification procedures.
- **Appropriations Restrictions**: Congress can restrict funding for specific programs or operations that fail to comply with statutory requirements.
- **GAO Audits**: Biennial audits of civilian casualty data, compensation fund operations, and autonomous weapons certification.
- **Congressional Reporting Triggers**: Failure to submit required reports on time triggers mandatory classified briefings within 14 days.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Article II War Powers**: The executive branch will argue that targeting standards and reporting requirements unconstitutionally constrain the Commander-in-Chief's tactical military judgments. However, Congress's Article I power to "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" provides explicit constitutional authority for these regulations. The *Youngstown* framework supports congressional authority: when Congress legislates targeting standards, presidential action contrary to those standards falls into Justice Jackson's third category, where executive power is at its "lowest ebb."

**Due Process for U.S. Citizens**: The Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall "be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." The targeting of U.S. citizens by drone strikes raises unresolved constitutional questions. In *Hamdi v. Rumsfeld*, 542 U.S. 507 (2004), the Supreme Court held that even in wartime, a U.S. citizen detained as an enemy combatant is entitled to "notice of the factual basis for his classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut." If the lesser deprivation of detention requires process, the greater deprivation of killing arguably requires at least comparable safeguards. The Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act's targeting standards provide some process but do not fully resolve this constitutional question.

**International Humanitarian Law**: The Geneva Conventions require that parties to a conflict distinguish between combatants and civilians (principle of distinction) and that attacks be proportionate to the military advantage sought (principle of proportionality). The Autonomous Weapons Governance Act's meaningful human control requirement is designed to ensure compliance with these principles, which current AI technology may not reliably achieve without human judgment.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Congressional Enforcement**: Congress enforces these provisions through the power of the purse. Appropriations riders can restrict funding for operations that fail to comply with reporting, targeting, or certification requirements. Fast-track procedures for joint resolutions of disapproval can address specific autonomous weapons deployments.

**Inspector General System**: The DoD IG and IC IG provide independent oversight, with authority to investigate non-compliance and refer matters to the Attorney General.

**Judicial Review**: While the political question doctrine has historically shielded targeting decisions from judicial review, the statutory creation of specific standards and rights (victim compensation, reporting requirements) may create justiciable claims. Administrative Procedure Act review of regulatory compliance is available for the autonomous weapons certification process.

### Preemption

Federal war powers are exclusive under the Constitution. State and local governments have no authority over military operations or foreign affairs. The limited state model legislation addresses areas (National Guard operations, state procurement) where state authority is concurrent with federal authority.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **"Active Hostilities" Designation Manipulation** | President designates entire countries as "areas of active hostilities" to evade the stricter targeting standards that apply outside such areas | High |
| **Partner Force Circumvention** | U.S. provides intelligence and targeting data to partner forces who conduct strikes, achieving the same result without triggering U.S. reporting or targeting standards | High |
| **Defensive System Creep** | DoD expands the definition of "defensive system" to cover offensive autonomous weapons by characterizing engagements as preemptive defense | Medium |
| **Software Update Evasion** | Incremental software updates to autonomous systems avoid recertification thresholds by being individually classified as non-significant | Medium |
| **Covert Action Classification** | CIA characterizes drone-related activities as "intelligence collection" or "support to partner forces" rather than "lethal drone operations" to avoid reporting | High |
| **Algorithmic Delegation** | System presents a human operator with a recommendation generated by AI with such speed and confidence that the human becomes a rubber stamp rather than an independent decision-maker | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| **No retroactive accountability** | Past civilian casualties remain unaddressed; victims from 2001-2026 have no formal mechanism | Political cost of investigating historical operations |
| **Victim fund may be underfunded** | $25 million annual authorization may be insufficient given the scale of civilian harm across multiple countries | Political difficulty of appropriating larger sums for foreign civilian compensation |
| **No judicial review of targeting** | Individual targeting decisions remain shielded from judicial review by political question doctrine | Constitutional separation of powers; courts reluctant to review military targeting |
| **International enforcement gap** | No mechanism to enforce compliance by adversaries or non-signatories to potential autonomous weapons agreement | Sovereignty of other nations; limits of international law enforcement |
| **Technology outpaces legislation** | Autonomous weapons technology evolves faster than legislative cycles | Inherent lag between technological development and governance |
| **Over-the-horizon intelligence gaps** | Post-strike civilian casualty assessment is inherently difficult without ground presence | Withdrawal from forward operating positions |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Active Hostilities Guardrails**: Require Senate Armed Services Committee approval (not just notification) for new "active hostilities" designations, with annual renewal requirement. Include statutory criteria for designation.
2. **Partner Force Coverage**: Define "lethal drone operation" to include operations "directed, facilitated, or materially supported" by U.S. personnel or intelligence, ensuring partner force strikes enabled by U.S. support are covered by targeting standards and reporting.
3. **Defensive System Boundaries**: Establish a statutory review process requiring recertification of any defensive system used in a context other than its certified defensive function.
4. **Software Update Tracking**: Require that the certification authority maintain a cumulative log of all software updates and assess whether cumulative changes warrant recertification, even if individual updates are incremental.
5. **Covert Action Closure**: Include a statutory definition of "lethal drone operation" broad enough to cover any activity by any agency that results in the death of a targeted individual through the use of an unmanned system.
6. **Automation Bias Mitigation**: Require that autonomous weapons certification include evaluation of the human-machine interface for automation bias, including testing whether operators meaningfully exercise independent judgment or merely confirm algorithmic recommendations.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|---|---|
| Executive branch may interpret definitions narrowly | Include statutory rules of construction; require all interpretive guidance to be shared with intelligence committees |
| Classification system used to prevent accountability | Establish presumption of declassification for data older than 5 years; require written justification for continued classification |
| Autonomous weapons technology evolves faster than legislation | Build technology-neutral principles into statute; require periodic GAO reviews and legislative updates |
| Victim compensation fund inaccessible to remote populations | Partner with local NGOs and international organizations for outreach; provide funding for claimant assistance |
| Military resistance to independent investigation | House the Civilian Harm Review Board within the IG structure, which has established independence and legal protections |
