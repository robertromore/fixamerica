# Drone Warfare: Political Perspectives Analysis

---

## Overview

Drone warfare policy sits at the intersection of several of the most divisive fault lines in American politics: presidential war powers vs. congressional authority, national security vs. civil liberties, technological superiority vs. ethical constraints, and American leadership vs. global norms. Unlike many defense issues that break cleanly along partisan lines, drone policy produces unusual cross-cutting coalitions. Libertarians and progressives find common ground in opposing unchecked executive authority. Conservatives and centrists agree on maintaining counterterrorism capabilities but diverge on oversight. The emerging autonomous weapons debate adds a new dimension, as technology-optimist hawks clash with governance advocates across the political spectrum.

The two proposed bills, the Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act and the Autonomous Weapons Governance Act, address different aspects of the drone warfare challenge and therefore attract different coalitions of support and opposition.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|---|---|---|
| Conservative | Security, executive authority, military strength | Maintain broad strike authority; invest in autonomous weapons; resist constraints |
| Liberal | Rule of law, human rights, international norms | Reform targeting standards; increase transparency; support international governance |
| Progressive | Anti-war, anti-imperialism, civilian protection | End targeted killing program; ban autonomous weapons; reparations for victims |
| Libertarian | Non-intervention, due process, limited government | End drone wars; require congressional authorization; oppose autonomous weapons |
| Constitutionalist | Congressional war powers, separation of powers | Congress must authorize all uses of force; due process for citizens |
| Populist | America First, decisive action, anti-establishment | Kill terrorists but end nation-building; skeptical of AI governance |
| Centrist | Stability, pragmatism, legal durability | Codify existing rules; invest in precision technology; international engagement |
| Religious Right | Protection of innocents, civilizational defense | Support strikes against Islamic extremists; concerned about civilian casualties |
| Democratic Socialist | Anti-imperialism, solidarity, demilitarization | End all drone warfare; dismantle military-industrial complex; international justice |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent prioritization of national security and military effectiveness |
| Principle consistency | Strong support for executive authority in war; consistent skepticism of transparency mandates |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; positions do not shift significantly across administrations |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frames debate as security vs. constraints; treats oversight as weakening the military |

**Justification:** Conservatives maintain a consistent position rooted in three principles: the President needs maximum flexibility to protect the nation, the military should not be micromanaged by Congress, and American technological superiority must be preserved. These principles produce predictable opposition to most reform proposals, with limited openness to codification of rules that formalize existing practices.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Heritage Foundation opposition to AUMF sunset clauses and mandatory reporting
- AEI advocacy for expanded drone strike authority and autonomous weapons investment
- Congressional conservative opposition to war powers amendments in successive NDAAs
- Support for Trump-era loosening of targeting rules and revocation of reporting requirements

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agree on threat persistence but view drone program as largely successful rather than problematic |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Reject framing of accountability gaps; view "root cause" as terrorist ideology, not U.S. policy failures |
| Solutions Alignment | 3/10 | Oppose most proposed reforms as constraints on military effectiveness |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation, "The AUMF: Why Congressional Reauthorization Matters" (2023)
- American Enterprise Institute, Mackenzie Eaglen, defense budget and capabilities analysis
- National Review editorials on drone policy and autonomous weapons

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory Public Reporting | 3/10 | Oppose; compromises operational security | Fear of political exploitation of civilian casualty data |
| Independent Civilian Harm Investigation | 2/10 | Oppose; undermines chain of command | Military should investigate its own operations |
| Victim Compensation Fund | 3/10 | Skeptical; incentivizes false claims | Fiscal cost; precedent for liability |
| Meaningful Human Control Requirement | 4/10 | Cautious; could limit technological advantage | Concern that adversaries will not accept similar constraints |
| AUMF Reform with Sunset | 2/10 | Oppose sunset; signals weakness | Loss of operational continuity |
| International Autonomous Weapons Agreement | 2/10 | Oppose; unilateral constraint on U.S. capabilities | Strategic disadvantage against China/Russia |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act | 3/10 | Oppose most provisions; may accept limited reporting | Operational security; executive authority |
| Autonomous Weapons Governance Act | 3/10 | Oppose human control mandate as overly restrictive | Technological competitiveness with China |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Invest heavily in autonomous weapons and AI for great power competition without new constraints
- Expand drone strike authorities to address emerging threats (Iran-backed militias, Chinese gray zone operations)
- Maintain current executive flexibility with voluntary (not statutory) transparency improvements
- Strengthen counter-drone capabilities rather than constraining U.S. drone use

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Religious Right (shared hawkishness), Populists (on aggressive counterterrorism)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrists (on codifying existing rules that formalize current practice)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives, Democratic Socialists, Libertarians (on structural constraints)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to rule of law and human rights, tempered by security pragmatism |
| Principle consistency | Consistent advocacy for transparency and accountability; occasional deference to Democratic presidents |
| Goalpost stability | Generally stable; some flexibility on specific mechanisms |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; seeks to balance security with rights |

**Justification:** Liberals consistently advocate for legal frameworks, transparency, and accountability in drone warfare. The one area of reduced consistency is when Democratic presidents are conducting the operations; some liberal voices muted their criticism of the Obama drone program while strongly opposing the same practices under Trump. However, major liberal organizations (ACLU, Human Rights First) have maintained consistent positions across administrations.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Center for American Progress advocacy for AUMF reform and civilian harm mitigation
- Human Rights First reports on civilian casualties under both Obama and Trump
- Liberal senators (Kaine, Durbin, Murphy) co-sponsoring AUMF reform legislation
- Support for Biden-era CHMR-AP while advocating for stronger statutory requirements

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree that transparency and accountability are severely lacking; recognize program effectiveness is overstated |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree on executive overreach and congressional abdication; may give more weight to operational necessity |
| Solutions Alignment | 8/10 | Support most proposed reforms; prefer incremental statutory approach to sweeping changes |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress, "A New Framework for Counterterrorism" (2023)
- Human Rights First, "Civilian Protection and the Use of Force" (2024)
- Lawfare Blog, Benjamin Wittes and various contributors on targeted killing law
- Senator Tim Kaine, AUMF reform advocacy and floor statements

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory Public Reporting | 9/10 | Strong support; essential for accountability | Democratic legitimacy requires transparency |
| Independent Civilian Harm Investigation | 9/10 | Strong support; military should not investigate itself | Credibility of U.S. human rights commitments |
| Victim Compensation Fund | 8/10 | Support; moral obligation to victims | Cost and implementation challenges |
| Meaningful Human Control Requirement | 8/10 | Support; consistent with IHL principles | Balance with operational effectiveness |
| AUMF Reform with Sunset | 8/10 | Support; prefer 5-year sunset over 3-year | Concern about political dysfunction preventing renewal |
| International Autonomous Weapons Agreement | 8/10 | Support; U.S. should lead international norms | Realistic about difficulty of multilateral negotiations |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act | 9/10 | Strong support for all major provisions | Rule of law; human rights; democratic accountability |
| Autonomous Weapons Governance Act | 8/10 | Support; may want stronger international engagement provisions | Ensuring U.S. leads by example |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Close Guantanamo Bay detention facility as part of comprehensive CT reform
- Join the International Criminal Court to demonstrate commitment to accountability
- Establish a drone strike "truth commission" to investigate past operations
- Create a permanent bipartisan national security oversight commission

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives (on transparency and accountability), Centrists (on codification of rules)
- **Potential bridges:** Constitutionalists (on congressional war powers), Libertarians (on AUMF reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservatives (on mandatory constraints), Religious Right (on international engagement)

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent anti-war and anti-imperialism drives all positions |
| Principle consistency | Unwavering opposition to drone warfare across administrations |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; no shift based on which party holds the White House |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frames as war vs. peace, imperialism vs. justice |

**Justification:** Progressives are the most consistent perspective on drone warfare. They opposed Obama's drone program, opposed Trump's expansion, and opposed Biden's continuation. Their position is rooted in a principled opposition to extrajudicial killing and U.S. military intervention. They view the proposed legislation as welcome but insufficient steps toward ending the targeted killing program entirely.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Rep. Barbara Lee's lone vote against the 2001 AUMF and subsequent decades of advocacy
- Code Pink and Win Without War consistent advocacy across administrations
- Congressional Progressive Caucus support for AUMF repeal
- Jacobin and The Intercept critical coverage of drone warfare under all presidents

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | Full agreement that the drone program is deeply problematic |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Agree on all structural causes; add imperialism and military-industrial complex critique |
| Solutions Alignment | 8/10 | Support proposed reforms but view them as insufficient; want outright ban on targeted killing |

**Source references:**

- Win Without War policy positions on drone strikes and AUMF repeal
- Code Pink advocacy on ending drone warfare
- The Intercept, "The Drone Papers" (2015) and subsequent reporting
- Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Barbara Lee statements and legislation

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory Public Reporting | 9/10 | Support; transparency is a step toward ending the program | Full accounting of civilian harm |
| Independent Civilian Harm Investigation | 9/10 | Support; but prefer international investigation (ICC) | Accountability for war crimes |
| Victim Compensation Fund | 10/10 | Strong support; prefer larger fund and reparations framework | Justice for victims |
| Meaningful Human Control Requirement | 8/10 | Support as minimum; prefer ban on all autonomous weapons | Prevent "robot wars" |
| AUMF Reform with Sunset | 10/10 | Strong support; prefer outright repeal without replacement | End the "forever war" legal framework |
| International Autonomous Weapons Agreement | 10/10 | Strong support; binding ban preferred | Global disarmament |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act | 9/10 | Strong support; would strengthen further | Step toward ending targeted killing entirely |
| Autonomous Weapons Governance Act | 8/10 | Support; prefer outright ban on autonomous weapons | Human control is minimum; ban is goal |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Ban all targeted killing outside active war zones declared by Congress
- Establish reparations fund for all civilian victims of the War on Terror ($50 billion+)
- Pursue International Criminal Court investigation of U.S. drone program
- Redirect drone warfare budget to diplomacy, development, and root cause programs

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialists (shared anti-war and anti-imperialism)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarians (on AUMF repeal and civil liberties), Liberals (on transparency and accountability)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservatives, Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on use of force)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Non-intervention and constitutional fidelity drive all positions |
| Principle consistency | Consistent opposition to undeclared wars and executive overreach across administrations |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; no partisan variation |
| Zero-sum behavior | State power vs. individual liberty |

**Justification:** Libertarians have been among the most consistent critics of drone warfare, opposing it under Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden. Their opposition is rooted in constitutional principle (Congress must declare war), individual rights (due process before lethal force), and non-interventionism (the U.S. should not be conducting military operations in countries that pose no direct threat). Senator Rand Paul's 2013 filibuster over drone targeting of U.S. citizens remains a landmark moment in the debate.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Sen. Rand Paul's 2013 filibuster on domestic drone targeting
- Cato Institute research on war powers, targeted killing, and surveillance
- Consistent libertarian support for AUMF repeal across legislative cycles
- Reason magazine critical coverage of drone warfare under all administrations

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Agree on massive executive overreach and constitutional violation |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agree on congressional abdication and executive expansion; emphasize structural incentives |
| Solutions Alignment | 9/10 | Strong support for AUMF reform, transparency, and human control requirements |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute, John Glaser, "The Case Against Targeted Killing" (2015)
- Sen. Rand Paul, floor speeches on drone policy and war powers
- Reason Foundation analysis of drone warfare and civil liberties
- Defending Rights and Dissent coalition advocacy

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory Public Reporting | 9/10 | Strong support; government transparency is a core value | Citizens must know what government does in their name |
| Independent Civilian Harm Investigation | 8/10 | Support; prefer civilian rather than IG-based model | Government accountability |
| Victim Compensation Fund | 7/10 | Support concept; concern about bureaucratic expansion | Fiscal responsibility |
| Meaningful Human Control Requirement | 8/10 | Support; skeptical of autonomous government killing power | State should not have unchecked lethal authority |
| AUMF Reform with Sunset | 10/10 | Strong support; 3-year sunset is excellent | Constitutional war powers |
| International Autonomous Weapons Agreement | 5/10 | Mixed; support concept but skeptical of international institutions | Sovereignty concerns; treaty effectiveness |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act | 9/10 | Strong support | Constitutional accountability; due process |
| Autonomous Weapons Governance Act | 7/10 | Support human control requirement; skeptical of international engagement mandate | Prefer domestic constraints to international treaties |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Repeal the 2001 AUMF with no replacement; require formal declarations of war for any military operations
- Require judicial warrant (FISA-model) before targeting any individual, including non-citizens
- Defund CIA covert lethal operations entirely
- Apply strict Fourth Amendment protections to drone surveillance

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Constitutionalists (shared war powers focus), Progressives (on AUMF repeal)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservatives (on fiscal discipline and limited government), Populists (on ending forever wars)
- **Unlikely partners:** Hawkish establishment of either party

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Article I war powers and separation of powers drive all positions |
| Principle consistency | Consistent focus on constitutional text and original design across administrations |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; constitutional principles do not shift |
| Zero-sum behavior | Congress vs. President on war powers |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists care primarily about *who decides*, not *what is decided*. Their objection to the drone program is structural: the executive branch is conducting lethal military operations without meaningful congressional authorization. They support reforms that restore Congress's constitutional role, regardless of whether the result is more or fewer drone strikes.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Sen. Mike Lee's advocacy for AUMF repeal and war powers reform
- Federalist Society debates on Article I vs. Article II war powers
- Cross-partisan support for the Kaine-Lee AUMF reform framework
- Constitutional law scholarship on the original understanding of war powers

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Agree that the current legal framework is constitutionally deficient |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strongly agree on congressional abdication as a root cause |
| Solutions Alignment | 9/10 | Support AUMF reform, congressional notification, and statutory targeting standards |

**Source references:**

- Sen. Mike Lee, statements and legislation on war powers and AUMF reform
- Federalist Society, "Article I and the War Power" (various panels)
- Jack Goldsmith, *The Terror Presidency* (2007)
- John Yoo vs. Bruce Ackerman debate on war powers (various publications)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory Public Reporting | 8/10 | Support; Congress needs information to exercise oversight | Informed congressional oversight |
| Independent Civilian Harm Investigation | 7/10 | Support; but Congress should conduct its own oversight too | Separation of powers |
| Victim Compensation Fund | 6/10 | Mixed; acceptable but not a constitutional priority | Focus on structural reform first |
| Meaningful Human Control Requirement | 7/10 | Support; autonomous weapons raise delegation-of-war-power issues | Congress must authorize the *type* of warfare |
| AUMF Reform with Sunset | 10/10 | Strong support; the core constitutional reform needed | Article I war powers |
| International Autonomous Weapons Agreement | 5/10 | Mixed; treaty must not bypass congressional authority | Treaty Clause and Senate prerogatives |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act | 8/10 | Support; strengthens congressional oversight | Constitutional balance of power |
| Autonomous Weapons Governance Act | 7/10 | Support human control and congressional notification provisions | Congressional authority over new forms of warfare |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Require formal congressional authorization for any sustained drone campaign (30+ days)
- Establish a War Powers Consultation Committee with advance notice of all strikes
- Require Senate confirmation for the positions that approve targeting decisions
- Declare that all drone strikes constitute "hostilities" under the War Powers Resolution

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarians (shared constitutional focus)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberals (on congressional authority), Progressives (on ending executive overreach)
- **Unlikely partners:** Executive supremacists of any party

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | "Kill terrorists but come home" creates internal tension |
| Principle consistency | Anti-forever war rhetoric coexists with support for aggressive strikes against specific enemies |
| Goalpost stability | Shifts based on which enemies are highlighted and which president is acting |
| Zero-sum behavior | Us vs. Them; anti-establishment but pro-military |

**Justification:** Populists hold contradictory positions on drone warfare. They oppose "forever wars" and "nation building" but support aggressive military action against specific enemies (ISIS, Iranian proxies). They distrust the national security establishment but support a strong military. This produces unpredictable positions that depend on framing: AUMF repeal framed as "ending forever wars" gets populist support, but drone oversight framed as "handcuffing the military" loses it. The Soleimani strike illustrates the tension: populists supported the killing of an enemy leader while opposing the broader Middle East military commitment.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Trump's simultaneous withdrawal from Syria and assassination of Soleimani
- Populist support for "bombing the hell out of ISIS" combined with opposition to nation-building
- J.D. Vance's advocacy for military restraint combined with hawkishness on specific threats
- Tucker Carlson's anti-war commentary combined with support for aggressive homeland defense

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agree on "forever war" problem; disagree on civilian casualty focus as "soft" |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agree on congressional abdication; disagree on analysis of military-industrial complex |
| Solutions Alignment | 4/10 | Support AUMF reform; oppose drone oversight and autonomous weapons restrictions |

**Source references:**

- American Compass, Oren Cass, foreign policy restraint analysis
- J.D. Vance, Senate floor statements on war powers
- Populist media commentary on drone strikes and military operations
- American Conservative magazine analysis of drone warfare

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory Public Reporting | 4/10 | Mixed; transparency for Congress, not necessarily public | Operational security; media distortion |
| Independent Civilian Harm Investigation | 2/10 | Oppose; trust the military, not bureaucrats | Anti-establishment but pro-military |
| Victim Compensation Fund | 2/10 | Oppose; U.S. taxpayer money should not go to foreign civilians | "America First" fiscal priorities |
| Meaningful Human Control Requirement | 4/10 | Mixed; support concept but oppose constraints on military | Want U.S. to maintain technological edge |
| AUMF Reform with Sunset | 7/10 | Support repeal of "forever war" authority | End nation-building; bring troops home |
| International Autonomous Weapons Agreement | 2/10 | Oppose; sovereignty and military advantage | Distrust international institutions |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act | 3/10 | Oppose civilian harm focus; may support limited reporting | Anti-bureaucracy; pro-military |
| Autonomous Weapons Governance Act | 3/10 | Oppose restrictions on U.S. military technology | America First; technological dominance |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Repeal AUMF and bring all troops home; use drones only for homeland defense
- No restrictions on how military fights, but strict limits on where and why
- Ban foreign aid to countries where drone strikes are conducted
- Use overwhelming force to defeat specific enemies quickly, then withdraw completely

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (on military strength), Libertarians (on ending forever wars)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressives (on AUMF repeal; unlikely on other issues)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberals (on human rights framework), Centrists (on institutional governance)

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Pragmatic risk management and institutional durability drive positions |
| Principle consistency | Consistent support for codified rules and bipartisan process |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; not influenced by partisan dynamics |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; seeks to balance competing interests |

**Justification:** Centrists view drone warfare through a governance lens: the problem is not drone strikes per se but the lack of durable, statutory rules. They support codifying existing best practices (the "near certainty" standard, reporting requirements) into law to prevent policy whiplash between administrations. They are skeptical of sweeping reforms (AUMF repeal without replacement, autonomous weapons bans) but supportive of incremental improvements to transparency, accountability, and oversight.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Brookings Institution analysis of drone policy and legal frameworks
- Center for a New American Security (CNAS) advocacy for codified targeting standards
- Lawfare Blog legal analysis emphasizing statutory durability over executive orders
- Bipartisan policy center recommendations on war powers modernization

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree that the legal framework is outdated and fragile; emphasize need for codification |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree on structural causes; view them as governance failures rather than systemic injustice |
| Solutions Alignment | 7/10 | Support most reforms with moderate ambition; prefer incremental approach |

**Source references:**

- Brookings, Daniel Byman, counterterrorism and drone policy analysis
- Center for a New American Security, Paul Scharre, autonomous weapons research
- Lawfare Blog, Benjamin Wittes and contributors on targeting law
- Bipartisan Policy Center, war powers modernization recommendations

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory Public Reporting | 8/10 | Support; essential for legal durability | Preventing policy whiplash across administrations |
| Independent Civilian Harm Investigation | 7/10 | Support IG-based model; concern about creating new bureaucracy | Institutional feasibility |
| Victim Compensation Fund | 7/10 | Support; part of CHMR-AP implementation | Adequate funding and efficient administration |
| Meaningful Human Control Requirement | 7/10 | Support; but must be technologically realistic | Maintaining operational effectiveness |
| AUMF Reform with Sunset | 5/10 | Support replacement; wary of sunset if Congress fails to act | Operational continuity |
| International Autonomous Weapons Agreement | 6/10 | Support engagement; skeptical of binding treaty without China/Russia | Realistic multilateral expectations |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act | 8/10 | Support; codifies best practices into durable law | Legal stability across administrations |
| Autonomous Weapons Governance Act | 7/10 | Support with possible modifications to certification process | Balancing governance with innovation |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Codify existing PPM targeting standards into statute for durability
- Establish permanent bipartisan drone warfare oversight commission
- Create unified targeting standard across Title 10 and Title 50 operations
- Invest in precision technology to reduce civilian harm rather than constraining use

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberals (on codification and accountability)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservatives (on codifying existing practices rather than imposing new constraints), Constitutionalists (on congressional oversight)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populists (on institutional governance), Democratic Socialists (on fundamental approach)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Civilian protection concern is genuine but secondary to security against Islamist threats |
| Principle consistency | Pro-life ethic creates tension with support for aggressive military strikes |
| Goalpost stability | Shifts depending on framing: "protecting innocents" vs. "protecting the nation" |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frames as civilizational defense; Judeo-Christian values vs. Islamist extremism |

**Justification:** The Religious Right holds internally contradictory positions on drone warfare. Their pro-life ethic demands concern for civilian casualties, but their hawkishness on Islamist terrorism demands aggressive military action. The resolution of this tension varies: when civilian casualties are highlighted, they express concern; when the threat narrative dominates, they support unrestricted strikes. Additionally, concern for persecuted Christians in the Middle East creates a genuine humanitarian dimension that distinguishes them from purely security-focused hawks.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Family Research Council statements supporting military rules of engagement while also expressing concern about civilian harm
- Christians United for Israel (CUFI) advocacy for aggressive counterterrorism combined with humanitarian concern
- Evangelical voices on both sides of the drone debate
- Just War tradition literature from religious conservatives

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Concerned about threats to Christians abroad; view drone program as generally necessary |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Root cause is radical Islamic ideology, not U.S. policy or institutional failures |
| Solutions Alignment | 4/10 | Support some transparency; oppose constraints that weaken military response to Islamist threats |

**Source references:**

- American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), national security analysis
- Christians United for Israel (CUFI), Middle East security policy
- National Association of Evangelicals, "For the Health of the Nation" policy framework
- Just War tradition commentary from evangelical scholars

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory Public Reporting | 5/10 | Mixed; support transparency but not if it weakens operations | Balance between accountability and security |
| Independent Civilian Harm Investigation | 5/10 | Support investigating civilian harm; oppose if used to block operations | Pro-life concern for innocents |
| Victim Compensation Fund | 6/10 | Support in principle; concern about scope and cost | Humanitarian impulse from faith tradition |
| Meaningful Human Control Requirement | 6/10 | Support; moral agency requires human decision-making | Just War tradition: moral responsibility for killing |
| AUMF Reform with Sunset | 3/10 | Oppose sunset; continuous threat requires continuous authority | Security against persistent Islamist threats |
| International Autonomous Weapons Agreement | 3/10 | Oppose; U.S. must not constrain itself relative to adversaries | Military strength serves divine purpose of protecting the innocent |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act | 5/10 | Mixed; support civilian harm provisions, oppose operational constraints | Pro-life concern tempered by security hawkishness |
| Autonomous Weapons Governance Act | 5/10 | Support human control on moral grounds; oppose international engagement | Just War moral agency; sovereignty |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Establish a military chaplain review process for targeting decisions to ensure moral deliberation
- Prioritize drone operations that protect persecuted religious minorities
- Invest in precision technology to minimize civilian casualties without constraining operations
- Designate additional Islamist organizations as terrorist targets

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (on security hawkishness)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberals (on civilian protection), Centrists (on precision technology)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives, Democratic Socialists (fundamental disagreement on threat assessment and use of force)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Anti-imperialism and international solidarity drive all positions |
| Principle consistency | Unwavering opposition to all drone warfare across administrations |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; no partisan flexibility |
| Zero-sum behavior | Imperialism vs. justice; militarism vs. human needs |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists are the most categorically opposed to drone warfare. They view the entire program as an instrument of American imperialism that has killed thousands of civilians, destabilized regions, enriched defense contractors, and diverted resources from human needs. They support the proposed legislation as steps in the right direction but ultimately advocate for ending all drone warfare, dismantling the military-industrial complex, and redirecting defense spending to social programs.

**Evidence for assessment:**

|---|---|---|---|
| **Public Reporting** | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc | RelR | Con, Pop |
| **Civilian Harm Investigation** | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc | RelR | Con, Pop |

| **Human Control Requirement** | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc | RelR | Con, Pop |
| **AUMF Reform + Sunset** | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Pop, DemSoc | Cent | Con, RelR |
| **International Agreement** | Lib, Prog, DemSoc | Libt, Const, Cent | Con, Pop, RelR |

**Key insight:** A six-perspective coalition (Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist) supports the core transparency and accountability reforms. AUMF reform with sunset draws even broader support, adding Populists. The most significant opposition comes from Conservatives and Populists on operational constraints, and from Conservatives and the Religious Right on structural limitations to executive authority.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: The "Statutory Codification" Act

**Bridges:** Centrist + Liberal + Constitutionalist + Conservative (partial)

**Core Agreement:** Drone strike rules should be codified in law to prevent policy whiplash between administrations.

**Policy Description:**

Codifies the existing "near certainty" targeting standard, annual public reporting, and congressional notification requirements into statute. Does *not* include AUMF reform, sunset clauses, or autonomous weapons provisions. Focuses narrowly on making existing best practices permanent and statutory.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|---|---|
| Centrist | Creates durable, bipartisan legal framework that survives administration changes |
| Liberal | Establishes statutory floor for civilian protection that cannot be revoked by executive order |
| Constitutionalist | Strengthens congressional oversight through mandatory reporting and notification |
| Conservative (partial) | Codifies existing practice rather than imposing new constraints; preserves executive flexibility |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|---|---|
| Liberal | Does not address AUMF reform or autonomous weapons governance |
| Constitutionalist | Does not address the fundamental AUMF question |
| Conservative | Accepts statutory constraints on targeting standards (even if matching current practice) |
| Progressive (excluded) | Legislation does not end the drone program or address reparations |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 3-4 of 9 perspectives (with partial Conservative buy-in)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/3 core coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High; statutory codification is difficult to undo
- **Implementation Path:** NDAA amendment; strongest chance of bipartisan passage

### Compromise 2: The "Constitutional War Powers and Transparency" Act

**Bridges:** Constitutionalist + Libertarian + Progressive + Liberal + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Congress must authorize the use of force, and the public must know how force is being used.

**Policy Description:**

Combines AUMF repeal and replacement (with 3-year sunset) with the full Drone Strike Transparency and Accountability Act. Does not include autonomous weapons provisions (separating the more achievable war powers reform from the more contentious technology governance debate).

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|---|---|
| Constitutionalist | Restores Article I war powers; Congress votes on war every 3 years |
| Libertarian | Ends open-ended executive war-making; transparency for all operations |
| Progressive | Ends the "forever war" legal framework; accountability for civilian harm |
| Liberal | Rule of law; civilian protection; independent investigation |
| Democratic Socialist | Major step toward ending the War on Terror; accountability framework |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|---|---|
| Progressive | Accepts continued authorization against named groups for 3 years |
| Democratic Socialist | Accepts continued military operations rather than immediate end |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts some delegation to executive within the 3-year window |
| Libertarian | Accepts replacement AUMF rather than clean repeal |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5 of 9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High; structural reform with built-in renewal mechanism
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone legislation or NDAA amendment; has passed the House in parts before

### Compromise 3: The "Responsible Innovation" Autonomous Weapons Framework

**Bridges:** Centrist + Liberal + Constitutionalist + Religious Right (partial)

**Core Agreement:** Autonomous weapons need governance, but governance should enable responsible innovation rather than ban development.

**Policy Description:**

Enacts the core of the Autonomous Weapons Governance Act (meaningful human control, certification, congressional notification) while explicitly permitting continued development and testing of autonomous systems. Includes a five-year review period rather than a permanent ban, and directs international engagement without mandating specific treaty outcomes.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|---|---|
| Centrist | Codifies governance without blocking innovation; pragmatic and durable |
| Liberal | Establishes meaningful human control and international engagement |
| Constitutionalist | Congressional notification and oversight of new weapons systems |
| Religious Right (partial) | Human moral agency preserved in lethal decisions; consistent with Just War tradition |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|---|---|
| Liberal | Does not pursue binding international ban |
| Constitutionalist | Does not require congressional authorization for each new system |
| Religious Right | Accepts some constraints on military technology |
| Progressive (excluded) | No outright ban on autonomous weapons |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 3-4 of 9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/3 core coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Medium; five-year review creates update mechanism
- **Implementation Path:** NDAA amendment through Senate Armed Services Committee

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The **"Constitutional War Powers and Transparency" coalition** (Compromise 2) offers the strongest combination of breadth, consistency, and durability. It unites five perspectives rated 4+ on engagement consistency, meaning their support is based on genuine principles rather than tactical positioning. The core argument, that Congress must vote on war and the public must know how force is used, is constitutionally grounded and difficult to oppose in principle. This coalition has already demonstrated viability: the House passed a standalone 2001 AUMF repeal in 2021, and bipartisan AUMF reform frameworks (Kaine-Lee) have attracted Senate co-sponsors.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Executive Branch Opposition**: The White House (regardless of party) will resist AUMF reform with sunset and mandatory reporting. The veto threat is the primary obstacle.
2. **Senate Filibuster**: War powers legislation typically requires 60 Senate votes, and opponents can use the filibuster to prevent a floor vote. Attaching provisions to the must-pass NDAA circumvents this but risks conference committee stripping.
3. **Fear of Inaction**: The argument that Congress might fail to renew a sunset AUMF, leaving the military without authorization during active operations, is a powerful status quo argument. Fast-track renewal procedures mitigate but do not eliminate this concern.
4. **Autonomous Weapons Complexity**: The technology governance debate is still immature. Many members of Congress do not understand the technology well enough to legislate effectively, creating reliance on DoD and industry input that skews toward minimal constraint.

### Low Consistency Partners

**Populists** (3/5 consistency) and the **Religious Right** (3/5 consistency) are the most unpredictable actors. Populists can be recruited for AUMF repeal if framed as ending "forever wars" but will oppose drone oversight framed as "handcuffing the military." The Religious Right can be recruited for civilian protection provisions on Just War grounds but will oppose constraints on counterterrorism operations against Islamist groups. Both perspectives require careful framing to maintain coalition support.

### Recommended Approach

Pursue a **two-track strategy**:

1. **Track 1: War Powers and Transparency** (Compromise 2)
    - Lead with the constitutional argument to secure the Constitutionalist-Libertarian right
    - Frame the sunset clause as democratic accountability, not weakness
    - Accept a narrow replacement AUMF to give centrists and moderates cover
    - Package transparency and civilian harm provisions to appeal to liberals and progressives

2. **Track 2: Responsible Autonomous Weapons Governance** (Compromise 3)
    - Pursue as a separate legislative effort through the NDAA
    - Frame as "responsible innovation" rather than "ban"
    - Build coalition around bipartisan concern for human control over lethal AI
    - Use the less controversial nature of certification and oversight to build momentum

The two-track approach avoids overloading a single bill with both backward-looking accountability reforms and forward-looking technology governance, which would multiply opposition.
