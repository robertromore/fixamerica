# Drone Warfare: History

## Overview

The history of U.S. drone warfare spans from early Cold War-era unmanned reconnaissance to the post-9/11 era of armed strikes that have killed thousands across multiple continents. What began as an experimental surveillance technology became the centerpiece of American counterterrorism strategy, fundamentally changing how the United States projects military force. Each presidential administration since 2001 has expanded, contracted, or reformed the drone program in response to evolving threats, political pressures, and public revelations about civilian casualties.

## Timeline

### Early Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Development (1960s-1990s)

- **1960s**: The U.S. military deployed the Ryan Model 147 "Lightning Bug" reconnaissance drones over China, North Vietnam, and Cuba during the Cold War, flying over 34,000 missions. These were purely surveillance platforms with no weapons capability.
- **1980s**: Israel pioneered modern drone technology with the IAI Scout and Pioneer systems, used in the 1982 Lebanon War. The U.S. acquired Israeli-designed Pioneer drones for Navy use.
- **1994**: General Atomics developed the Predator (originally the GNAT-750) for the CIA under a contract for surveillance over the Balkans. The Predator was initially unarmed.
- **1995-1999**: The Predator was deployed over Bosnia and Kosovo for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). During operations over Kosovo, operators observed Serbian forces committing atrocities but could not act because the Predator carried no weapons.
- **1999-2000**: The CIA conducted surveillance flights over Afghanistan with the Predator, spotting Osama bin Laden's compound at Tarnak Farms multiple times. Frustration at the inability to strike led to a crash program to arm the Predator with Hellfire missiles.
- **February 2001**: The first successful test firing of a Hellfire missile from a Predator drone occurred at a Nevada test range. The armed Predator was ready for deployment by September 2001.

### The Birth of Armed Drone Warfare (2001-2004)

- **October 7, 2001**: The first armed Predator strikes in Afghanistan targeted Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders during the opening days of Operation Enduring Freedom. A strike aimed at Taliban leader Mullah Omar on October 7 reportedly hit his compound but failed to kill him due to delayed approval.
- **November 2001**: A Predator strike killed al-Qaeda military commander Mohammed Atef near Kabul, the first confirmed high-value target killed by a drone.
- **November 2002**: The CIA conducted its first drone strike outside Afghanistan, killing al-Qaeda leader Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi and five associates in Yemen. The strike was initially controversial; Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh called it "summary execution." A U.S. citizen, Kamal Derwish, was among those killed.
- **2002-2004**: Drone operations in Afghanistan expanded steadily. The CIA began drone surveillance and occasional strikes in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Strikes were rare during this period, averaging fewer than one per year in Pakistan.

### The CIA's Pakistan Campaign (2004-2012)

- **June 2004**: The CIA's sustained drone campaign in Pakistan began with the killing of Nek Muhammad, a Pakistani Taliban commander, in South Waziristan. Pakistan publicly condemned the strike but privately consented under a secret agreement with the United States.
- **2004-2007**: Strikes in Pakistan remained infrequent (approximately 9 total strikes from 2004 to 2007) and focused narrowly on senior al-Qaeda leaders believed to be hiding in Pakistan's tribal areas.
- **2008**: President George W. Bush dramatically escalated the Pakistan drone campaign, authorizing 36 strikes in 2008 alone, up from 5 in 2007. This escalation came after Pakistan's government proved unable or unwilling to act against militant safe havens in FATA.
- **2009-2012**: President Obama further escalated the Pakistan campaign, with strikes peaking at 128 in 2010. The program expanded from targeting senior al-Qaeda leaders to "signature strikes" based on patterns of behavior rather than individual identification. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates that between 416 and 959 civilians were killed in Pakistan from 2004 to 2018, including 172 to 207 children.

### Obama-Era Expansion and Institutionalization (2009-2017)

- **2009**: Obama authorized an expanded drone campaign across multiple theaters. CIA strikes in Pakistan surged. JSOC began conducting drone strikes in Yemen against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).
- **2010**: The peak year for drone strikes globally. Approximately 128 strikes in Pakistan, along with strikes in Yemen and Somalia. Obama administration officials later acknowledged the president personally approved targets through "Terror Tuesday" meetings and a classified "disposition matrix" (kill list).
- **September 30, 2011**: A CIA drone strike in Yemen killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen and senior AQAP propagandist/operative. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) had issued a secret memo authorizing the killing. The ACLU and al-Awlaki's father had previously filed a lawsuit challenging the targeting (*Al-Aulaqi v. Obama*), which was dismissed on standing and political question grounds.
- **October 14, 2011**: A separate drone strike in Yemen killed Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, Anwar's 16-year-old son and a U.S. citizen. The Obama administration stated he was not the intended target. No investigation or accountability followed.
- **May 2013**: President Obama delivered a major speech at the National Defense University, publicly acknowledging the drone program for the first time in detail and announcing a new framework: the Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG). The PPG established the "near certainty" standard for strikes outside active hostilities and stated a preference for capture over killing.
- **2013**: A drone strike in Yemen killed hostages Warren Weinstein (American) and Giovanni Lo Porto (Italian), both held by al-Qaeda. The deaths were not publicly acknowledged until April 2015.
- **July 2016**: The Obama administration issued Executive Order 13732 requiring annual public reporting of civilian casualties from drone strikes. The first report, covering 2009-2015, claimed 64 to 116 civilian deaths across all theaters outside active hostilities, a figure that independent groups estimated at 200 to 900.

### Trump Administration Changes (2017-2021)

- **March 2017**: President Trump designated parts of Somalia as an "area of active hostilities," removing the higher-standard civilian protection requirements that had applied under Obama's PPG.
- **September 2017**: The Trump administration revoked Obama's PPG and replaced it with classified Principles, Standards, and Procedures (PSP) that granted commanders greater authority to approve strikes and relaxed the "near certainty" civilian harm standard in certain theaters.
- **March 2019**: Trump revoked Executive Order 13732, ending the annual public reporting requirement for civilian casualties from drone strikes outside active hostilities.
- **2017-2020**: Drone strikes surged in Somalia (from approximately 14 in 2016 to 63 in 2019) and continued at high levels in Yemen. The Airwars monitoring group documented a significant increase in reported civilian casualties during this period. In Afghanistan, airstrikes (including drones) reached their highest levels since the U.S. invasion, with 7,423 munitions released in 2019 alone.
- **January 3, 2020**: A U.S. drone strike at Baghdad International Airport killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, along with Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The strike was authorized under Article II self-defense authority rather than the 2001 AUMF. It brought the U.S. and Iran to the brink of war and sparked intense debate over presidential authority to use lethal force against a senior foreign government official without congressional authorization.

### Biden Administration and Beyond (2021-Present)

- **January 2021**: Biden paused drone strikes outside active hostilities pending a policy review, except for strikes in self-defense of U.S. forces.
- **August 29, 2021**: During the chaotic withdrawal from Kabul, a U.S. drone strike killed Zemari Ahmadi, an aid worker, and nine members of his family, including seven children. The Pentagon initially called it a "righteous strike" against an ISIS-K operative. Subsequent investigation by the *New York Times* and the Pentagon's own review revealed the strike was a catastrophic error based on flawed intelligence. No military personnel were disciplined.
- **October 2022**: The Biden administration issued a new Presidential Policy Memorandum (PPM) governing lethal force outside active hostilities, reportedly restoring the "near certainty" standard but with some modifications from the Obama-era PPG. The full text remains classified.
- **2022-2023**: Secretary of Defense Austin directed the Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan (CHMR-AP), the most comprehensive DoD reform effort to address civilian casualties.
- **January 2024**: The U.S. began conducting strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen under Article II self-defense authority (not the AUMF), after Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. These operations primarily used Navy and Air Force assets including drones.
- **2024**: The Replicator Initiative began delivering the first tranche of small autonomous drones, shifting the conversation from counterterrorism strikes toward great power competition and autonomous warfare.

## Evolution of Legal Authorities

### Statutory Framework

- **2001 AUMF (P.L. 107-40)**: Authorized force against those who "planned, authorized, committed, or aided" the 9/11 attacks. Has been stretched to cover operations against groups that did not exist in 2001 (ISIS, al-Shabaab, AQAP).
- **2002 AUMF (P.L. 107-243)**: Authorized force against Iraq. Remained on the books until repealed by Congress in 2023 (P.L. 118-31, Section 1012).
- **War Powers Resolution (1973)**: Requires congressional notification within 48 hours of introducing forces into hostilities and withdrawal within 60 days without congressional authorization. Presidents have routinely circumvented this by characterizing drone strikes as not constituting "hostilities."

### Executive Branch Interpretations

Each administration has stretched legal authorities through classified legal memoranda:

- **Bush Administration**: OLC memoranda asserted broad Article II authority for the Commander-in-Chief to order strikes against terrorists globally. The CIA operated under a classified "Memorandum of Notification" signed by President Bush authorizing lethal covert action against al-Qaeda.
- **Obama Administration**: The 2010 OLC memorandum justifying the killing of al-Awlaki adopted a "broader concept of imminence" that did not require evidence of a specific imminent plot. The "associated forces" doctrine expanded the 2001 AUMF to cover groups with loose connections to al-Qaeda.
- **Trump Administration**: Classified changes to targeting standards and the designation of new "areas of active hostilities" expanded executive authority while reducing transparency.
- **Biden Administration**: The classified PPM restored some constraints but continued to assert executive authority for strikes in self-defense under Article II.

## Institutional Evolution

### CIA Drone Program

The CIA's drone program, sometimes called the "covert" drone war, operated with minimal transparency from 2002 to the mid-2010s. The agency ran its own fleet of armed Predator and Reaper drones, conducted its own targeting analysis, and operated under Title 50 covert action authorities that shielded it from most public oversight. The CIA's role has diminished since its peak in 2010-2012 but the agency retains some lethal strike capabilities as of 2024.

### Military Drone Operations

The U.S. Air Force and JSOC have increasingly taken the lead in drone operations, particularly since the Obama-era policy shift toward Title 10 military operations. The Air Force operates the vast majority of MQ-9 Reaper missions, while JSOC conducts targeted raids and strikes in counterterrorism theaters. The establishment of Task Force 99 in 2023 signaled the Air Force's focus on integrating AI and autonomous systems into future drone operations.

### Congressional Oversight

Congressional oversight of drone warfare has been sporadic and often ineffective. Key moments include:

- Senator Rand Paul's 2013 filibuster demanding answers on whether the President could target U.S. citizens on U.S. soil
- The Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation of CIA detention and interrogation (released 2014), which touched on drone targeting
- Multiple unsuccessful attempts to repeal or replace the 2001 AUMF (2013, 2017, 2019, 2021)
- The House's passage of a standalone 2001 AUMF repeal in 2021 (no Senate action)
