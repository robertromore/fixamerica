# Drone Warfare: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming U.S. drone warfare policy requires addressing multiple interconnected challenges simultaneously: establishing legal frameworks for the use of lethal force, creating accountability for civilian harm, governing autonomous weapons development, strengthening congressional oversight, and building international norms. No single reform is sufficient; the self-reinforcing system of low political cost, secrecy, executive authority, and congressional abdication must be disrupted at multiple points. The solutions below are organized by category and prioritized by feasibility and impact.

## Transparency Reforms

### Mandatory Public Reporting of Drone Strikes

**Description**: Require the executive branch to publish annual unclassified reports on all lethal drone operations, including the number of strikes, countries of operation, targets, and civilian casualty assessments.

**Rationale**: The Trump administration's 2019 revocation of Obama's Executive Order 13732 demonstrated that executive-order-based transparency requirements are fragile. Statutory requirements are needed.

**Key Elements**:

- Annual unclassified report listing all countries where strikes occurred, aggregate strike numbers, and total combatant and civilian casualties
- Classified supplement for operationally sensitive details, available to the full intelligence and armed services committees
- Disaggregation by theater, platform, and authority (AUMF, Article II, host nation consent)
- Methodology disclosure: how civilian casualties are assessed, what sources are consulted

**Precedent**: The FISA Court's annual transparency reports, which disclose aggregate surveillance statistics without compromising sources and methods.

**Challenges**: Executive branch resistance to revealing strike data; potential damage to partner nation relationships where consent is secret.

### Declassification Review of Historical Operations

**Description**: Mandate a comprehensive declassification review of all U.S. drone strike operations from 2001 to present, with a presumption of disclosure for operational data older than five years.

**Rationale**: Two decades of drone warfare have been conducted largely in secret. Public accountability requires a factual record of what was done, where, and at what cost to civilians.

**Key Elements**:

- Five-year presumptive declassification for strike data (dates, locations, targets, outcomes)
- Written justification required for continued classification beyond five years
- Independent review board (not controlled by originating agencies) to adjudicate classification disputes
- Phased release beginning with the oldest operations

**Challenges**: Intelligence community resistance; potential diplomatic complications with partner nations.

## Civilian Casualty Investigation Improvements

### Independent Civilian Harm Investigation Body

**Description**: Establish an independent entity outside the military chain of command to investigate allegations of civilian harm from drone strikes and other military operations.

**Rationale**: The current system, in which the same military organizations that conduct strikes investigate allegations of civilian harm, produces systematic undercounting and insufficient accountability. The *New York Times* "Civilian Casualty Files" investigation documented hundreds of cases where investigations were never conducted or reached conclusions contradicted by available evidence.

**Key Elements**:

- Independent investigative body staffed by civilians with national security experience, similar to a permanent inspector general function
- Authority to conduct investigations in all theaters, including access to classified targeting data, strike footage, and post-strike assessments
- Mandatory investigation of all credible allegations from any source (media, NGOs, partner governments, self-reporting)
- Public reporting of investigation findings, with classified annexes where necessary
- Authority to recommend disciplinary action, policy changes, and compensation

**Precedent**: The DoD Inspector General system; the Israeli Military Advocate General's investigation process (which, while imperfect, provides an independent review function).

### Civilian Victim Compensation Fund

**Description**: Establish a permanent, adequately funded mechanism for compensating civilians harmed by U.S. drone strikes and other military operations.

**Rationale**: The current *ex gratia* payment system is ad hoc, underfunded, and virtually inaccessible to victims in remote strike zones. The Kabul strike of August 2021 demonstrated the problem: despite a public commitment to compensate the Ahmadi family, the process took months and required extensive media pressure.

**Key Elements**:

- Permanent fund with annual appropriation of at least $25 million
- Simplified claims procedures accessible to foreign nationals, including through U.S. embassies and consulates
- Independent legal assistance for claimants
- Payment standards: minimum $100,000 per death, $50,000 per serious injury, plus property damage
- Coordination with local civil society organizations for outreach and claims assistance
- Annual public reporting on claims received, processed, and paid

## Congressional Authorization Requirements

### AUMF Reform

**Description**: Repeal the 2001 AUMF and replace it with a narrow, time-limited authorization that names specific groups and countries, with a mandatory sunset clause.

**Rationale**: The 2001 AUMF has been stretched to authorize force against groups and in countries that did not exist in September 2001. It provides a blank check for executive war-making that undermines Congress's constitutional role.

**Key Elements**:

- Repeal of the 2001 AUMF (the 2002 Iraq AUMF was repealed in 2023)
- Replacement authorization naming specific groups (al-Qaeda, ISIS) and associated forces meeting a statutory co-belligerency standard
- Geographic limitations with a process for expansion subject to congressional approval
- Three-year sunset clause requiring an affirmative vote for renewal
- Quarterly reporting on operations conducted under the new authority
- Fast-track procedures for renewal votes to prevent accidental lapse

**Relationship to Drone Warfare**: While AUMF reform is broader than drone policy, it directly addresses the legal foundation for most drone strikes. Without a valid AUMF, the executive branch would need to rely solely on Article II self-defense authority, which is constitutionally constrained to imminent threats.

### Mandatory Congressional Notification for Drone Strikes

**Description**: Require the executive branch to notify designated congressional committees within 48 hours of any drone strike, regardless of the legal authority under which it is conducted.

**Rationale**: Current notification practices are inconsistent. Strikes under Title 10 military authority may be reported to armed services committees; strikes under Title 50 covert action may be reported only to the "Gang of Eight." Some strikes may not be reported at all.

**Key Elements**:

- Notification within 48 hours to the chairs and ranking members of the intelligence and armed services committees of both chambers
- Notification must include the legal authority, target identification, location, outcome, and any civilian casualty assessment
- Failure to notify triggers automatic classified briefing requirement within 7 days
- Applies to strikes under all authorities: AUMF, Article II, covert action, and partner support

## Autonomous Weapons Governance

### Meaningful Human Control Requirement

**Description**: Enact legislation requiring that all U.S. lethal autonomous weapons systems maintain "meaningful human control" over targeting and engagement decisions, with a prohibition on fully autonomous kill decisions.

**Rationale**: DoD Directive 3000.09 uses vague language ("appropriate levels of human judgment") and can be modified by any Secretary of Defense without congressional input. Statutory requirements are needed as autonomous weapons technology advances.

**Key Elements**:

- Statutory definition of "meaningful human control": a human operator must authorize each specific lethal engagement, with sufficient situational awareness and time to exercise independent judgment
- Prohibition on weapons systems that select and engage human targets without explicit human authorization for each engagement
- Testing and certification requirements for autonomous weapons systems
- Senior-level review and congressional notification before deployment of new autonomous weapons systems
- Annual reporting to Congress on autonomous weapons development and deployment

**Exceptions**: Systems designed for defense against incoming missiles, rockets, and munitions (e.g., Phalanx CIWS, Iron Dome) where reaction time precludes human authorization for each engagement.

### International Autonomous Weapons Agreement

**Description**: Support the development of a binding international agreement governing lethal autonomous weapons systems, building on the UN CCW Group of Governmental Experts process.

**Rationale**: The United States cannot govern autonomous weapons unilaterally. Without international norms, adversaries and irresponsible states will develop and deploy fully autonomous lethal systems without constraints.

**Key Elements**:

- Binding prohibition on fully autonomous weapons that target humans without meaningful human control
- Common standards for testing, certification, and accountability
- Verification mechanisms appropriate to the technology
- Export controls on autonomous weapons technology
- Confidence-building measures including transparency about autonomous weapons development programs

**Challenges**: China and Russia have resisted binding restrictions. The U.S. defense establishment opposes international constraints that could limit technological advantage. Finding a framework that constrains irresponsible use while preserving legitimate defensive applications is technically and diplomatically complex.

## International Norms Development

### Drone Export Control Regime

**Description**: Establish a multilateral framework for controlling the export of armed drones, building on and strengthening the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).

**Rationale**: The rapid proliferation of armed drones to authoritarian regimes and non-state actors is a direct consequence of inadequate export controls. Chinese and Turkish manufacturers have filled the demand created by U.S. export restrictions, but a multilateral framework could establish common standards.

**Key Elements**:

- Reinstate and strengthen MTCR Category I presumption of denial for armed UAS
- Engage China, Turkey, and other major exporters in multilateral negotiations
- End-use monitoring requirements for all exported armed drones
- Human rights conditions on drone exports
- Technology sharing arrangements with allied democracies to reduce incentive to buy from China

### Norms of Use

**Description**: Develop and promote international norms for the use of armed drones in counterterrorism and armed conflict, including civilian protection standards and transparency requirements.

**Rationale**: As the pioneer of armed drone warfare, the United States has both the greatest responsibility and the greatest influence in establishing norms. Current U.S. practices, including signature strikes, secret operations, and minimal accountability, set a dangerous precedent that other nations will follow.

**Key Elements**:

- Positive identification requirement for all strikes (prohibition on "signature strikes")
- "Near certainty" civilian harm standard for strikes outside active hostilities
- Post-strike investigation and public reporting requirements
- Compensation mechanisms for civilian victims
- Promotion of these norms through bilateral security agreements and multilateral fora

## AUMF Reform Related to Drone Strikes

### War Powers Resolution Modernization

**Description**: Update the War Powers Resolution of 1973 to account for modern forms of conflict, including drone warfare, cyber operations, and partner force support.

**Rationale**: The War Powers Resolution was designed for conventional military deployments. Presidents have routinely characterized drone strikes as not constituting "hostilities" under the Resolution, rendering it ineffective as a check on the use of force.

**Key Elements**:

- Expand the definition of "hostilities" to explicitly include drone strikes, cyber attacks causing physical destruction, and direct support to partner forces conducting military operations
- Require congressional authorization for sustained drone campaigns (defined as more than 30 days of operations in a single theater)
- Establish expedited procedures for congressional action on war powers questions
- Provide for judicial review of war powers disputes (overcoming the political question doctrine through an explicit statutory grant of jurisdiction)

## Cross-Cutting Requirements

All drone warfare reforms share certain common requirements for success:

- **Statutory Basis**: Reforms must be enacted into law, not left to executive orders or directives that can be revoked by any president.
- **Bipartisan Design**: The most viable reforms appeal to both the anti-war left and the constitutionalist/libertarian right. The shared principle is congressional authority over war.
- **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Reforms must include consequences for non-compliance, including funding restrictions, reporting requirements tied to appropriations, and inspector general oversight.
- **Classification Reform**: Meaningful transparency requires limiting the use of classification to genuinely sensitive sources and methods, not to political embarrassments or policy failures.
- **International Engagement**: Domestic reforms must be paired with international norm-building to prevent a "race to the bottom" as drone technology proliferates.
