# Space Defense: Solutions

Securing the space domain requires a multi-layered strategy that builds resilient architectures, improves awareness, mitigates debris, establishes international norms, and integrates commercial capabilities into a coherent national defense posture.

---

## 1. Build Resilient Satellite Architectures

**A. Accelerate Proliferated LEO Constellations**

- **Description**: Shift from small numbers of large, expensive, irreplaceable satellites in high orbits to large numbers of smaller, cheaper satellites in low Earth orbit. A distributed architecture ensures that the loss of any individual satellite does not degrade the overall capability, rendering an adversary's ASAT investment futile.
- **Implementation**: Fully fund and accelerate the Space Development Agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). Expand the concept to communications and ISR missions beyond missile tracking and data transport.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Fundamentally changes the adversary's cost calculus. Instead of needing to destroy 3-5 satellites to blind a constellation, an adversary would need to destroy hundreds -- an operationally impractical proposition.

**B. Invest in On-Orbit Maneuver and Hardening**

- **Description**: Equip high-value satellites with greater maneuvering capability to evade threats, and harden them against electronic warfare, laser dazzle, and cyber intrusion.
- **Implementation**: Require that all new national security satellite programs include anti-jam communications links, radiation-hardened components, autonomous threat-avoidance maneuver capability, and cybersecurity-by-design.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Increases the difficulty and cost of attacking any individual satellite, complementing the resilience provided by proliferated architectures.

**C. Develop Rapid Reconstitution Capability**

- **Description**: Pre-position replacement satellite components and develop the launch infrastructure to rapidly replace destroyed or degraded satellites.
- **Implementation**: Invest in responsive launch programs (the Space Force's "Victus Nox" demonstrated a satellite launch within 27 hours of call-up). Pre-position satellite buses and payloads at launch sites. Contract with commercial launch providers for emergency launch capacity.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Ensures that even if an adversary successfully degrades a constellation, the U.S. can rapidly restore capability, denying the adversary any lasting advantage.

## 2. Enhance Space Situational Awareness

**A. Modernize the Space Surveillance Network**

- **Description**: Upgrade the ground-based and space-based sensors that track objects in orbit to handle the rapidly growing number of objects and detect threats at greater range and sensitivity.
- **Implementation**: Deploy the Space Fence (a powerful S-band radar on Kwajalein Atoll, now operational) and invest in next-generation optical and radar sensors. Expand partnerships with allied SSA networks and commercial providers like LeoLabs and ExoAnalytic.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Improves the ability to detect threats (co-orbital ASAT approaches, debris conjunctions) earlier, providing more time for avoidance maneuvers and informed decision-making.

**B. Develop Space Domain Awareness Satellites**

- **Description**: Deploy dedicated satellites in GEO and cislunar space that can observe activities in orbit, providing persistent, all-weather surveillance of the space domain.
- **Implementation**: Expand the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) and develop new sensors for cislunar awareness as activities extend to the Moon and beyond.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Provides the ability to characterize objects in orbit, detect hostile intent, and attribute actions -- essential for deterrence and response.

**C. Share SSA Data Internationally**

- **Description**: Expand the sharing of space situational awareness data with allies, partners, and commercial operators to create a comprehensive, global picture of the space environment.
- **Implementation**: Accelerate the transition of basic space traffic management to the Department of Commerce. Expand SSA sharing agreements with CSpO partners and additional nations. Support commercial SSA providers who can serve as intermediaries for data the U.S. cannot share directly.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Increases the number of sensors and perspectives tracking the space environment. Creates a "neighborhood watch" effect where irresponsible behavior is more likely to be detected and attributed.

## 3. Mitigate the Debris Threat

**A. Enforce and Strengthen Debris Mitigation Standards**

- **Description**: Require all U.S.-licensed satellite operators to comply with updated debris mitigation guidelines, including the FCC's 5-year post-mission disposal rule, and work to internationalize these standards.
- **Implementation**: Codify debris mitigation requirements in federal law (not just agency rules). Support the development of binding international guidelines through UN COPUOS. Require debris mitigation plans as a condition of all government satellite contracts.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Reduces the rate of debris accumulation and establishes clear expectations for responsible behavior.

**B. Invest in Active Debris Removal (ADR)**

- **Description**: Fund the development and demonstration of technologies to remove existing debris from orbit -- particularly large, dangerous objects in congested orbital bands.
- **Implementation**: Provide government funding for ADR technology demonstration missions. Establish a priority list of debris objects for removal (based on collision probability and orbital location). Develop an international cost-sharing framework for ADR.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Addresses the existing debris population, not just future debris generation. Could reduce the risk of Kessler syndrome in critical orbital bands.

**C. Pursue an International ASAT Testing Moratorium**

- **Description**: Build on the 2022 U.S. commitment and the 2023 UN General Assembly resolution to establish a broad, international moratorium on destructive direct-ascent ASAT missile tests.
- **Implementation**: Continue diplomatic efforts to recruit additional nations to the moratorium. Explore whether a moratorium can be formalized in a UN Security Council resolution or multilateral agreement. Develop verification mechanisms using national technical means and commercial SSA data.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Prevents the single most destructive category of debris-generating events. Establishes a critical norm against the most destabilizing form of space weapons testing.

## 4. Establish International Space Security Norms

**A. Lead the Development of "Rules of the Road"**

- **Description**: Work with allies and partners to develop and promote a set of norms for responsible behavior in space, focusing on the most destabilizing activities.
- **Implementation**: Proposed norms should include:
    - No destructive ASAT testing that generates long-lived debris.
    - No dangerous proximity operations against other nations' spacecraft without prior notification and consent.
    - No interference with nuclear early warning satellites (given the escalation risk).
    - Transparency measures: pre-launch notification of orbital parameters, notification of planned proximity operations, and data sharing on space debris.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates a framework for judging state behavior in space, enabling collective diplomatic and economic responses to norm violations.

**B. Strengthen the Outer Space Treaty Framework**

- **Description**: While a new comprehensive space treaty is unlikely in the near term, work to strengthen the existing framework through additional protocols, transparency mechanisms, and interpretive guidelines.
- **Implementation**: Pursue a protocol to the Outer Space Treaty specifically addressing debris-generating activities. Develop confidence-building measures (pre-launch notifications, orbital parameter transparency) bilaterally with China and Russia.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Incrementally builds the legal and normative framework without requiring the politically impossible task of negotiating a comprehensive new treaty.

## 5. Integrate Commercial Space Capabilities

**A. Establish a Commercial Space Integration Framework**

- **Description**: Develop clear legal, contractual, and operational frameworks for integrating commercial satellite services into national defense.
- **Implementation**: Establish standard contracts for commercial SATCOM, ISR, and SSA services that address wartime obligations, indemnification, replacement, and security requirements. Create a "Commercial Space Reserve" program (analogous to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet) where commercial operators agree to provide priority capacity during crises in exchange for peacetime contracts.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Provides legal clarity for commercial providers, ensures military access to commercial capabilities during conflict, and creates incentives for commercial operators to invest in resilience.

**B. Diversify the Launch and Satellite Industrial Base**

- **Description**: Reduce the concentration risk created by dependence on a small number of commercial providers.
- **Implementation**: Maintain at least two National Security Space Launch (NSSL) providers. Support new entrants (Rocket Lab, Relativity Space, Blue Origin) through government contracts. Invest in domestic production of critical satellite components to reduce supply chain vulnerabilities.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Reduces single points of failure in the space industrial base and ensures competition in the launch market.
