# Space Defense: What You Can Do

Space defense may seem like the exclusive province of the military and intelligence community, but citizens, professionals, and organizations all have meaningful roles to play in shaping U.S. space policy, supporting sustainability, and building the workforce the nation needs.

## 1. For Individuals: Educate and Advocate

- **Learn the Basics**: Space security affects everyone -- GPS navigation, weather forecasting, financial transactions, and national defense all depend on satellites. Understanding the basics of space threats, debris, and policy enables informed advocacy.
- **Contact Your Representatives**: Ask your senators and representatives to support legislation codifying the ASAT testing moratorium, funding debris mitigation, and investing in resilient satellite architectures. Space policy is bipartisan -- emphasize that space security protects both military capabilities and the civilian economy.
- **Support Space Sustainability**: Advocate for policies that protect the orbital environment as a shared resource. Support the development and enforcement of debris mitigation standards.
- **Follow the Debate**: Track space policy developments through resources like SpaceNews, The Space Review, and reports from CSIS and the Secure World Foundation. Informed citizens can influence policy.

## 2. For Professionals and Students: Build the Space Workforce

- **Pursue STEM Education**: The Space Force and the broader space industry face critical workforce shortages in engineering, physics, data science, and cybersecurity. Educational pathways from community colleges to graduate programs can lead to space careers.
- **Join the Space Force or Reserves**: The Space Force is the smallest military branch and actively recruiting. Civilian professionals with relevant skills can also serve through reserve or National Guard programs.
- **Work in Commercial Space**: The commercial space industry is growing rapidly and offers career opportunities in satellite engineering, launch operations, mission planning, data analytics, and policy.
- **Engage in Research**: Academic researchers can contribute to critical areas including orbital mechanics, debris modeling, space situational awareness, remote sensing, and space law.

## 3. For Businesses: Contribute to Space Security

- **Comply with Debris Mitigation Standards**: Satellite operators should comply with or exceed FCC and international debris mitigation guidelines, including the 5-year post-mission disposal rule.
- **Share SSA Data**: Commercial satellite operators should participate in data sharing programs with the Department of Commerce and the Space Force to improve the collective picture of the orbital environment.
- **Invest in Resilience**: Companies that depend on space services (GPS, SATCOM, satellite imagery) should assess their vulnerabilities and develop contingency plans for degraded or denied space environments.
- **Support Workforce Development**: Space companies can partner with universities, community colleges, and trade schools to build the talent pipeline the industry needs.

## 4. Engage in the Policy Debate

- **Support the ASAT Testing Moratorium**: The 2022 U.S. commitment not to conduct destructive ASAT tests was a major step. Urge other nations and your own representatives to formalize and expand this norm.
- **Advocate for Space Sustainability Funding**: Active debris removal technology and improved space surveillance need sustained public investment. Support appropriations for NASA's Orbital Debris Program, the Space Force's SSA networks, and the Department of Commerce's space traffic management role.
- **Participate in Public Comment**: Federal agencies (FCC, Department of Commerce, DoD) routinely seek public comment on space policy rules and regulations. Informed public engagement improves policy outcomes.
