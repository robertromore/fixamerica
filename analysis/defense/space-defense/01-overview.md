# Space Defense: Overview

## Overview

Space has become a critical warfighting domain, underpinning virtually every modern military capability -- from precision-guided munitions and real-time intelligence to nuclear early warning and global communications. The United States depends on space-based systems more than any other nation, and that dependence is both a strategic advantage and an acute vulnerability. The creation of the U.S. Space Force in 2019 acknowledged this reality, establishing the first new military branch in over seven decades to organize, train, and equip forces for space operations.

Yet the space domain faces growing threats. China and Russia have developed and tested anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons capable of destroying or degrading the satellite constellations on which American military operations and civilian life depend. The 2007 Chinese kinetic ASAT test and the 2021 Russian direct-ascent ASAT test both generated thousands of debris fragments, worsening an already dangerous orbital environment where approximately 36,000 tracked objects and millions of smaller fragments threaten every spacecraft. The proliferation of space debris raises the specter of Kessler syndrome -- a cascading chain reaction of collisions that could render critical orbits unusable for generations.

At the same time, the commercial space sector has transformed the landscape. Companies like SpaceX are deploying proliferated low-Earth orbit (LEO) constellations numbering in the thousands, blurring the line between military and commercial space infrastructure. This creates both opportunities for resilience through distributed architecture and challenges for governance, regulation, and the protection of dual-use assets.

The foundational legal framework -- the 1967 Outer Space Treaty -- prohibits weapons of mass destruction in space but does not address conventional weapons, kinetic interceptors, or directed-energy systems. This legal gap, combined with the absence of verification mechanisms, leaves the door open for a destabilizing arms race in orbit. The central challenge for U.S. policy is to deter attacks on space assets, build resilient architectures that can survive and operate through conflict, mitigate the growing debris threat, and lead international efforts to establish responsible behavior norms -- all without triggering an unconstrained militarization of space.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of U.S. space defense policy:

- **Space Force Organization**: The mission, structure, and budget of the U.S. Space Force and its relationship to U.S. Space Command.
- **Satellite Constellations**: The critical national security satellite systems -- GPS navigation, SBIRS/Next-Gen OPIR missile warning, SATCOM communications, and ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) -- and their vulnerabilities.
- **Space Situational Awareness (SSA)**: The networks and systems used to track objects in orbit and detect threats to U.S. spacecraft.
- **Anti-Satellite Weapons (ASAT)**: The capabilities and doctrines of adversary ASAT programs, including kinetic kill vehicles, co-orbital weapons, directed-energy systems, and electronic warfare.
- **Space Debris**: The growing orbital debris environment, the risk of Kessler syndrome, and debris mitigation strategies.
- **Outer Space Treaty and International Governance**: The existing legal framework for space activities and the challenges of arms control in orbit.
- **Commercial Space Integration**: The role of commercial companies in national security space, including proliferated LEO architectures and launch services.

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Deterrence vs. Debris**: Developing kinetic ASAT weapons to deter adversaries creates the very debris that threatens all spacefaring nations, including the United States. Testing or using such weapons damages the shared orbital environment.
- **Resilience vs. Cost**: Building resilient, distributed satellite architectures (proliferated LEO) is more survivable but enormously expensive and complex compared to maintaining a small number of exquisite, high-capability satellites.
- **Arms Control vs. Verification**: International agreements to limit space weapons are desirable for stability, but verification is extremely difficult -- dual-use technologies (robotic servicing spacecraft, proximity operations) cannot easily be distinguished from weapons.
- **Commercial Integration vs. Security**: Leveraging commercial satellite services (SpaceX Starlink, Amazon Kuiper) provides resilience and cost savings, but raises questions about protecting commercial assets during conflict and the risk of adversary targeting dual-use systems.
- **Transparency vs. Secrecy**: Sharing space situational awareness data internationally improves safety for all, but the U.S. must protect classified intelligence about its own satellites' orbits, capabilities, and vulnerabilities.

## Key Questions

1. How can the United States deter attacks on its space systems without triggering a destabilizing arms race in orbit?
2. What is the right mix of exquisite national security satellites and proliferated commercial constellations to ensure resilience?
3. Can meaningful arms control agreements be achieved in space given the dual-use nature of most space technologies?
4. How should the U.S. govern the integration of commercial space assets into national defense architectures?
5. What international frameworks can prevent the catastrophic generation of space debris from ASAT testing or conflict?

## Vision of Success

A successful U.S. space defense policy would:

- **Maintain Space Superiority**: The U.S. retains the ability to use space freely for military and civilian purposes while denying adversaries the ability to exploit space to threaten American interests.
- **Achieve Resilient Architecture**: U.S. space systems are distributed, redundant, and capable of operating through and recovering from attack, rendering an adversary's ASAT investment strategically futile.
- **Protect the Orbital Environment**: The U.S. leads international efforts to mitigate debris, enforce norms against debris-generating ASAT tests, and develop active debris removal technologies.
- **Establish International Norms**: A critical mass of spacefaring nations adheres to agreed-upon rules of responsible behavior in orbit, reducing the risk of miscalculation and conflict.
- **Integrate Commercial Innovation**: The Space Force seamlessly leverages commercial space capabilities while maintaining appropriate security, reducing costs and accelerating modernization.
