# Space Defense: Stakeholders

Space defense involves a complex network of military organizations, intelligence agencies, commercial companies, allied nations, and adversary programs, each with distinct interests and sources of influence.

## U.S. Government Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Role in Space Defense |
|---|---|---|
| **U.S. Space Force (USSF)** | **Organizing and equipping space forces.** Developing the doctrine, training, and capabilities to fight and win in the space domain. | **Force Provider.** Recruits, trains, and equips Guardians. Operates Space Operations Command, Space Systems Command, and Space Training and Readiness Command. |
| **U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM)** | **Conducting space operations.** Employing space forces in operations to deter conflict, and if deterrence fails, to defeat adversary space capabilities. | **Warfighter.** The unified combatant command that directs space operations. Responsible for space domain awareness, satellite operations, missile warning, and defensive and offensive space control. |
| **National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)** | **Intelligence collection from space.** Operating the nation's classified reconnaissance satellite fleet to provide imagery and signals intelligence. | **Intelligence Provider.** Designs, builds, and operates the satellite systems that provide the intelligence community and military with critical overhead reconnaissance. Increasingly partners with commercial imagery providers. |
| **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)** | **Civil space exploration and science.** Maintaining U.S. leadership in human spaceflight, planetary science, and Earth observation. | **Technology Developer.** NASA's research in orbital mechanics, propulsion, materials science, and space situational awareness has direct applications to national security space. NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office is the leading U.S. authority on debris modeling. |
| **Space Development Agency (SDA)** | **Rapid acquisition of proliferated space systems.** Building the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) of hundreds of small satellites in LEO. | **Acquisition Innovator.** Established in 2019 to bypass traditional acquisition timelines. Focuses on missile tracking, data transport, and custody layers using commercial-derived satellite buses. |
| **Department of Commerce (Office of Space Commerce)** | **Civilian SSA coordination.** Managing the transition of space traffic management and non-military space situational awareness to a civilian agency. | **Regulator and Data Broker.** Responsible for coordinating commercial space activities, space traffic coordination, and the Open Architecture Data Repository for SSA data sharing. |
| **Congress (Armed Services, Intelligence, Commerce Committees)** | **Oversight, authorization, and appropriation.** Ensuring taxpayer funds are spent effectively and that space programs serve national interests. | **Funder and Overseer.** Authorizes and appropriates the Space Force budget, oversees NRO programs through the intelligence committees, and shapes space policy through legislation. |

**Internal Conflicts:**

- **Space Force vs. Space Command**: Tension between the force-provider role (Space Force organizes and equips) and the operational role (Space Command employs forces) over priorities, resource allocation, and doctrine. Some argue the dual structure creates unnecessary bureaucracy.
- **NRO vs. Space Force**: The NRO (intelligence community) and Space Force (DoD) have historically different cultures, acquisition timelines, and classification practices. Integrating their satellite architectures and operations remains a challenge.
- **SDA vs. Traditional Acquisition**: The Space Development Agency's emphasis on rapid acquisition of "good enough" commercial-derived satellites clashes with the traditional defense space culture of building small numbers of exquisite, gold-plated systems over decades-long timelines.

## Commercial Space Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **SpaceX** | **Launch dominance and Starlink expansion.** Building a vertically integrated space company that provides launch services (Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, Starship), satellite operations (Starlink), and human spaceflight (Crew Dragon). | **Market Share.** SpaceX conducts the majority of U.S. and global launches. Starlink's ~6,000+ satellites make it the largest constellation ever deployed. SpaceX's low-cost, high-cadence launch capability is a national security asset with no equivalent competitor. |
| **United Launch Alliance (ULA)** | **Assured access to space for national security.** ULA (Boeing/Lockheed Martin joint venture) provides the Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle for the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. | **Legacy Incumbency.** ULA has a long track record of 100% mission success and deep relationships with the national security community. The NSSL contract ensures a second launch provider for redundancy. |
| **Northrop Grumman** | **Satellite manufacturing and space systems.** Major prime contractor for missile warning satellites (Next-Gen OPIR), satellite servicing (Mission Extension Vehicle), and solid rocket motors. | **Prime Contractor Power.** Builds critical national security satellites and has demonstrated on-orbit servicing capability, a dual-use technology. |
| **L3Harris Technologies** | **Space sensors and ground systems.** Major provider of space-based infrared sensors, SSA sensors, and satellite ground control systems. | **Technology Specialization.** Produces the sensors and ground systems that enable missile warning, ISR, and space domain awareness. |
| **Planet Labs, Maxar, BlackSky** | **Commercial Earth observation.** Providing satellite imagery and analytics to government and commercial customers. | **Data Supply.** These companies supplement NRO imagery with commercial-grade products available on faster timelines and at lower classification levels, enabling broader sharing with allies. |

## Allied Space Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **Combined Space Operations (CSpO) Initiative** | Allied space cooperation. A multinational partnership including the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and New Zealand for shared space domain awareness and combined operations. | Coalition legitimacy and shared SSA data. |
| **United Kingdom (Royal Air Force Space Command)** | Protecting UK space assets and contributing to allied space security. | Operates the Skynet military satellite communications system; hosts U.S. space surveillance sensors. |
| **France (Commandement de l'espace)** | Developing autonomous French/European space defense capability while cooperating with allies. | Active space surveillance capability; developing "active defense" for its military satellites. |
| **Australia (Defence Space Command)** | Hosting and supporting allied space operations in the southern hemisphere. | Strategic geography providing ground station access; hosts C-band radar contributing to U.S. space surveillance. |
| **Japan (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency / Space Operations Group)** | Developing SSA capabilities and protecting its growing satellite infrastructure. | Growing SSA capability; strategic geography for Indo-Pacific space operations. |

## Adversary Space Programs

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **China (PLA Strategic Support Force)** | **Achieving space dominance in the Indo-Pacific.** Developing the full spectrum of space and counterspace capabilities to enable the PLA to project power and, in a conflict, deny the U.S. the use of space. | **Rapid Capability Growth.** China's space program has grown explosively, conducting more orbital launches than any other nation in 2023. It has a multi-layered ASAT program, its own navigation system (BeiDou), and an independent space station (Tiangong). |
| **Russia (Russian Aerospace Forces / Roscosmos)** | **Maintaining strategic deterrence and counterspace capability.** Sustaining a mature ASAT arsenal and space surveillance network to threaten U.S. assets and protect Russia's nuclear deterrent. | **Legacy Capability.** Russia inherits the Soviet Union's extensive military space infrastructure and ASAT expertise. It has demonstrated both kinetic and co-orbital ASAT capabilities. |

## Civil Society and International Organizations
