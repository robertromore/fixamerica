# Space Defense: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Space defense legislation operates at the intersection of national security, international law, and commercial regulation. The United States possesses the world's most capable space forces but lacks a comprehensive legislative framework that addresses the full spectrum of space security challenges: debris sustainability, ASAT restraint, commercial-military integration, and resilient architectures.

Current law is fragmented. The Space Force was established by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2020, but its acquisition authorities remain constrained by legacy Air Force processes. The FCC regulates commercial satellite operators' debris mitigation through administrative rules, but there is no federal statute codifying debris standards. The 2022 U.S. ASAT testing moratorium was a unilateral executive commitment, not a statutory requirement. And the integration of commercial space into national defense relies on ad hoc contracts rather than a structured legal framework.

The legislative framework proposed here aims to address these gaps through two complementary bills:

1. **The Space Security and Sustainability Act** addresses the sustainability and norms gap: codifying the U.S. ASAT testing moratorium into law, establishing federal debris mitigation standards, mandating space situational awareness data sharing, and creating an allied space cooperation framework.
2. **The Space Force Modernization and Resilience Act** addresses the capability and integration gap: mandating a shift to proliferated satellite architectures, establishing authorities for commercial space integration, requiring space cyber defense standards, and reforming Space Force acquisition processes.

Together, these bills implement the recommendations of the 2020 Defense Space Strategy and address the findings of the CSIS Space Threat Assessment that the U.S. must urgently modernize its space architecture and lead the development of international norms.

Key existing authorities that this legislation builds upon include:

- **National Defense Authorization Act for FY2020**: Established the U.S. Space Force as an independent branch.
- **FCC Debris Mitigation Rules (2022)**: Reduced the post-mission disposal timeline from 25 years to 5 years for new satellite licenses.
- **VP Harris ASAT Moratorium (April 2022)**: Unilateral U.S. commitment not to conduct destructive direct-ascent ASAT missile tests.
- **10 U.S.C. ch. 908 (Space Force)**: Establishes the Space Force's organizational structure and authorities.
- **51 U.S.C. (National and Commercial Space Programs)**: Governs civilian and commercial space activities.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for the legislative framework proposed in this file. Congress possesses sufficient authority under existing constitutional provisions:

- **War Powers and Armed Forces Clauses** (Article I, Section 8, Clauses 11-14): Provide authority to organize and equip the Space Force, authorize space operations, and regulate military activities in space.
- **Commerce Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3): Provides authority to regulate commercial satellite operators, debris mitigation standards, and SSA data sharing requirements for entities engaged in interstate and international commerce.
- **Treaty Power** (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2): The President, with Senate advice and consent, may enter into international agreements on space security norms and ASAT restraint.
- **Necessary and Proper Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18): Supports the creation of new frameworks (Commercial Space Reserve, allied cooperation authorities) as means of carrying out enumerated defense and commerce powers.

AN ACT

To promote the security and long-term sustainability of outer space activities
of the United States, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Space Security and Sustainability Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States depends on space-based systems for national security,
economic prosperity, and the daily functioning of modern society.
(2) The orbital debris environment poses a growing threat to all
space activities, with approximately 36,000 tracked objects and millions
of smaller fragments in orbit.
(3) Destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile tests are the
single most significant source of long-lived orbital debris and pose an
unacceptable risk to the space environment.
(4) The 2007 Chinese ASAT test and the 2021 Russian ASAT test together
generated over 5,000 trackable debris fragments in heavily used orbits.
(5) The United States committed in April 2022 not to conduct destructive
direct-ascent ASAT missile tests, but this commitment has not been
codified in law.
(6) Effective space situational awareness requires data sharing among
government agencies, commercial operators, and international partners.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (ASAT Moratorium)**: Converts a unilateral executive commitment into a durable statutory prohibition with a carefully constructed waiver process that preserves presidential flexibility for genuine national security emergencies while raising the political cost of resuming testing. The 30-day notification requirement ensures Congressional oversight.
- **Section 5 (Debris Mitigation)**: Creates the first comprehensive federal statutory framework for debris mitigation, harmonizing the patchwork of agency-specific rules (FCC, FAA, NOAA) into a unified standard. The 5-year disposal requirement codifies the FCC's 2022 rule and extends it to all U.S. operators.
- **Section 6 (SSA Data Sharing)**: Addresses the critical gap where some commercial operators do not share orbital data with the government, creating blind spots in the SSA picture. Proprietary protections ensure operators' competitive interests are safeguarded.
- **Section 7 (Active Debris Removal)**: Authorizes and funds the development of ADR technology, moving beyond mitigation (preventing new debris) to remediation (removing existing debris).

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue implementing guidance for ASAT moratorium | 90 days after enactment | DoD |
| Publish proposed debris mitigation standards | 9 months after enactment | NASA/Commerce |
| SSA data sharing portal operational | 1 year after enactment | Commerce |
| Issue final debris mitigation standards | 1 year after enactment | NASA/Commerce |
| First ADR technology demonstration contract award | 18 months after enactment | NASA/Space Force |
| First allied cooperation agreements under Sec. 8 | 1 year after enactment | DoD |
| First annual reports to Congress | 1 year after enactment | State, DoD |

**Challenges**:

- **Industry Resistance to Debris Standards**: Commercial satellite operators may argue that federal debris standards impose costs that put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage against foreign operators not subject to the same rules. The requirement for collision avoidance capability adds weight, power, and cost to satellite designs.
- **ASAT Moratorium Critics**: Defense hawks will argue that codifying the moratorium constrains U.S. options while adversaries are free to develop and test ASAT weapons. The waiver provision is designed to address this concern but may be seen as insufficient.
- **Classification Barriers to SSA Sharing**: The most precise and comprehensive SSA data is military and classified. Sharing it with commercial operators and allied nations requires declassification or the development of derivative, unclassified products, which takes time and resources.

**Refinements**:

- Include a "competitiveness review" provision requiring the Secretary of Commerce to assess whether U.S. debris standards create a competitive disadvantage and recommend harmonization with international standards.
- Develop a tiered SSA data sharing framework with different levels of fidelity for different partners (full resolution for Five Eyes allies, degraded but useful data for commercial operators).
- Include a provision encouraging the President to raise ASAT testing restraint in bilateral summits with Chinese and Russian leaders.

### The Space Force Modernization and Resilience Act

**Purpose**: To mandate a shift to proliferated, resilient satellite architectures, establish commercial space integration authorities, require space cyber defense standards, and reform Space Force acquisition processes.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Proliferated Architecture Mandate**: Requires the Secretary of Defense to transition critical space missions (missile warning, communications, ISR) to proliferated, distributed architectures that can sustain operations after the loss of any individual satellite or group of satellites.
2. **Commercial Space Integration Authorities**: Establishes a "Commercial Space Reserve" program and authorizes the Space Force to enter into long-term service agreements with commercial satellite operators for national security purposes.
3. **Space Cyber Defense Requirements**: Mandates cybersecurity standards for all national security satellite systems and ground stations, including encrypted command links, intrusion detection, and cyber resilience testing.
4. **Acquisition Reform**: Grants the Space Force streamlined acquisition authorities to procure space systems on commercial timelines, including authority to use commercial satellite buses, other transaction authority (OTA) for space programs, and a rapid prototyping pipeline.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To modernize the United States Space Force, mandate resilient satellite
architectures, integrate commercial space capabilities, and strengthen
cyber defenses of space systems.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Space Force Modernization and Resilience
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The current national security space architecture relies on a small
number of large, expensive satellites in predictable orbits, creating
high-value targets that adversaries can disable with relatively low-cost
anti-satellite weapons.
(2) A proliferated, distributed satellite architecture of hundreds
of smaller satellites would be far more resilient, as the loss of any
individual satellite would not degrade overall mission capability.
(3) The commercial space sector offers capabilities in launch, satellite
manufacturing, and data services that can be leveraged to strengthen
national security at reduced cost and accelerated timelines.
(4) Space systems face growing cyber threats to satellite command
links, ground stations, and data networks, requiring mandatory
cybersecurity standards.
(5) Current defense acquisition processes are poorly suited to the
pace of innovation in the space domain, resulting in programs that
take decades and cost billions more than initially planned.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) PROLIFERATED ARCHITECTURE.--The term "proliferated architecture"
means a satellite constellation design that distributes mission
capability across a sufficient number of satellites such that the loss
of any 10 percent of the constellation does not degrade any critical
mission below operational thresholds.
(2) COMMERCIAL SPACE RESERVE.--The term "Commercial Space Reserve"
means the program established under section 5 for the provision of
commercial space services to the Department of Defense during
contingencies and conflicts.
(3) CRITICAL SPACE MISSION.--The term "critical space mission" means
missile warning, position-navigation-timing, satellite communications,
intelligence-surveillance-reconnaissance, space domain awareness, and
such other missions as the Secretary of Defense may designate.

SEC. 4. PROLIFERATED SATELLITE ARCHITECTURE MANDATE.

(a) REQUIREMENT.--Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment
of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall transition each critical
space mission to a proliferated architecture.
(b) TRANSITION PLAN.--Not later than 1 year after enactment, the
Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense
committees a transition plan that includes--
(1) a mission-by-mission timeline for transitioning to proliferated
architectures;
(2) an assessment of the number of satellites required for each
mission to meet the 10 percent loss threshold;
(3) a cost estimate for the transition; and
(4) an assessment of the industrial base capacity to support the
transition.
(c) INTERIM RESILIENCE.--Pending full transition, the Secretary shall
implement interim resilience measures for existing satellite systems,
including enhanced maneuver capability, hardening against electronic
attack, and redundant command-and-control links.
(d) WAIVERS.--The Secretary may waive the requirement in subsection (a)
for a specific mission if the Secretary certifies to the congressional
defense committees that--
(1) a proliferated architecture is not technically feasible for that
mission; and
(2) alternative resilience measures provide equivalent survivability.

SEC. 5. COMMERCIAL SPACE RESERVE.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--The Secretary of Defense shall establish a Commercial
Space Reserve program under which commercial satellite operators agree
to provide priority access to their services during national security
contingencies.
(b) ENROLLMENT.--Commercial operators may enroll in the Commercial
Space Reserve by entering into agreements with the Secretary that
specify--
(1) the services to be provided (communications, imagery, launch,
data transport);
(2) the capacity to be reserved for government use during
contingencies;
(3) the activation procedures and notification timelines;
(4) security requirements for handling classified or sensitive data;
and
(5) compensation terms, including peacetime retainer payments and
activation surge pricing.
(c) INCENTIVES.--Operators enrolled in the Commercial Space Reserve
shall receive--
(1) priority consideration for peacetime government contracts;
(2) liability indemnification for losses incurred during government-
directed operations; and
(3) expedited security clearance processing for designated personnel.
(d) CIVIL RESERVE AIR FLEET MODEL.--The Commercial Space Reserve shall
be modeled on the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) program established
under 10 U.S.C. 9511a, adapted for the unique characteristics of
space operations.

SEC. 6. SPACE CYBER DEFENSE REQUIREMENTS.

(a) STANDARDS.--Not later than 1 year after enactment, the Chief of
Space Operations shall issue mandatory cybersecurity standards for all
national security space systems, including--
(1) encrypted and authenticated command-and-control links for all
satellites;
(2) intrusion detection and response capabilities for satellite
ground stations;
(3) supply chain security requirements for satellite components,
including hardware and software assurance;
(4) regular penetration testing and cyber resilience exercises; and
(5) incident reporting requirements for cyber intrusions affecting
space systems.
(b) COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS.--The standards under subsection (a) shall apply
to commercial satellite systems used for national security purposes
under contracts or agreements with the Department of Defense.

to the congressional defense committees that all national security
space systems are in compliance with the standards issued under this
section.

SEC. 7. ACQUISITION REFORM.

(a) OTHER TRANSACTION AUTHORITY.--The Chief of Space Operations is
authorized to use other transaction authority under 10 U.S.C. 4022
for the acquisition of space systems, subsystems, and services,
including satellite buses, payloads, ground systems, and launch
services.
(b) COMMERCIAL-FIRST REQUIREMENT.--For each new space acquisition
program, the Space Force shall conduct a commercial solutions analysis
to determine whether commercially available systems can meet mission
requirements before initiating a traditional government-designed
program.
(c) RAPID PROTOTYPING.--The Chief of Space Operations shall establish
a rapid prototyping pipeline that can move a space capability from
concept to on-orbit demonstration within 3 years.
(d) MILESTONE DECISION AUTHORITY.--For space programs with a total
acquisition cost below $1,000,000,000, milestone decision authority
shall reside with the Chief of Space Operations rather than the Under
Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment.

SEC. 8. RESPONSIVE LAUNCH PROGRAM.

(a) REQUIREMENT.--The Secretary of the Air Force shall maintain a
responsive launch capability that can place a replacement satellite
in orbit within 24 hours of a launch order.
(b) EXERCISES.--The Space Force shall conduct not fewer than 2

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Proliferated Architecture)**: The central provision, mandating a fundamental shift in how the U.S. builds its space infrastructure. The 10 percent loss threshold creates a measurable, testable standard for resilience. The waiver provision acknowledges that some missions (e.g., certain SIGINT collections) may require exquisite individual satellites.
- **Section 5 (Commercial Space Reserve)**: Models a structured military-commercial relationship on the proven CRAF program, which has successfully mobilized commercial airlift capacity for military operations since 1952. The incentives (priority contracts, liability protection) address the commercial sector's key concerns.
- **Section 6 (Space Cyber Defense)**: Addresses an increasingly critical vulnerability. The 2022 Viasat hack demonstrated that cyberattacks on satellite ground stations can be as effective as kinetic ASAT weapons. Mandatory standards close this gap.
- **Section 7 (Acquisition Reform)**: The Space Development Agency has demonstrated that space systems can be acquired on 2-3 year timelines instead of the traditional 10-15 years. This section makes SDA's approach the default for the entire Space Force.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Submit proliferated architecture transition plan | 1 year after enactment | SecDef |
| Issue space cyber defense standards | 1 year after enactment | CSO |
| Establish Commercial Space Reserve framework | 180 days after enactment | SecDef |
| First commercial solutions analysis | For next new program start | Space Force |
| Responsive launch exercise | Within 1 year of enactment | Space Force |
| First annual report to Congress | 1 year after enactment | CSO |
| Full proliferated architecture transition | 10 years after enactment | DoD |

**Challenges**:

- **Cost**: Transitioning to proliferated architectures is expensive in the near term, even though it is more cost-effective over the long term. The transition requires building new constellations while maintaining legacy systems, creating a "double-pay" period.
- **Industrial Base Capacity**: The current space industrial base may lack the manufacturing capacity to produce hundreds of satellites per year at the scale required for proliferated architectures. Investment in manufacturing capacity is needed.
- **Acquisition Culture**: Changing the Space Force's acquisition culture from "build the perfect satellite" to "build many good-enough satellites quickly" requires overcoming decades of institutional inertia and risk aversion.

**Refinements**:

- Include manufacturing capacity development funding as a separate line item to address industrial base constraints.
- Phase the proliferated architecture mandate by mission priority (missile warning first, then SATCOM, then ISR).
- Establish an independent advisory board of commercial space executives to advise the Space Force on acquisition reform implementation.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Space Industry Development Act

**Purpose**: To promote the development of the commercial space industry within the state and support the national space defense workforce pipeline.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Space Industry Development Act".

SECTION 2. SPACE INDUSTRY TAX INCENTIVES.
(a) Any company engaged in the design, manufacture, launch, or
operation of space systems within the State shall be eligible for a
corporate income tax credit equal to 10 percent of qualified space
research and development expenditures.
(b) Satellite manufacturing facilities established within the State
shall be eligible for property tax abatement for a period of 10 years.

SECTION 3. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.
(a) The State Department of Education, in coordination with the State
university system, shall establish a Space Workforce Development
Program that includes:
(1) scholarships for students pursuing degrees in aerospace
engineering, astrophysics, and related fields;
(2) apprenticeship programs with commercial space companies
operating in the State; and
(3) STEM education programs focused on space science for K-12
students.

SECTION 4. SPACEPORT DEVELOPMENT.
(a) The State shall designate a State Space Commerce Authority to
coordinate spaceport development, licensing, and environmental
permitting.
(b) The Authority shall develop a master plan for spaceport
infrastructure within the State.
```

**Explanation**: State-level legislation complements federal space defense policy by building the industrial base and workforce pipeline. States with existing space infrastructure (Florida, California, Texas, Colorado, Virginia, Alabama) have a natural interest in attracting space industry investment and developing the workforce.

**Adaptations**: States can customize tax incentive levels, workforce program focus areas, and spaceport provisions based on their existing industrial base and educational institutions.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agencies**: Department of Defense (Space Force, Space Command), Department of Commerce (Office of Space Commerce), NASA, FCC.

**Supporting Agencies**: Department of State (diplomatic norms), FAA (launch licensing), NOAA (remote sensing licensing), Intelligence Community (NRO, NGA).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Debris Mitigation Standards**: Interagency rulemaking (NASA, Commerce, FCC, FAA) to establish unified federal debris mitigation standards, harmonizing existing agency-specific rules.
2. **SSA Data Sharing Procedures**: Commerce Department rulemaking establishing data formats, submission frequencies, and proprietary information protections for commercial operator SSA data sharing.
3. **Commercial Space Reserve Regulations**: DoD rulemaking establishing enrollment criteria, activation procedures, compensation structures, and security requirements for the Commercial Space Reserve.
4. **Space Cyber Defense Standards**: Space Force issuance of mandatory cybersecurity standards for national security space systems, including classified annexes for specific system requirements.
5. **Acquisition Reform Guidance**: Space Force issuance of updated acquisition procedures implementing commercial-first analysis, rapid prototyping pipeline, and delegated milestone decision authority.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Debris Standard Violations**: Civil penalties up to $100,000 per day, administered through licensing agencies (FCC, FAA, NOAA). License revocation for persistent non-compliance.
- **SSA Data Non-Compliance**: License conditions tied to data sharing; failure to provide orbital data may result in license non-renewal.
- **Space Cyber Defense Non-Compliance**: Chief of Space Operations annual certification to Congress creates accountability; non-compliant systems may be restricted from operational use.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

#### Article II: Commander in Chief and Space Operations

The President, as Commander in Chief under Article II, Section 2, has broad authority to direct military space operations, including the use of defensive and offensive space control capabilities. The Space Security and Sustainability Act's ASAT moratorium provision operates as a statutory policy, not a restriction on the Commander in Chief's inherent authority. The waiver provision (Section 4(b)) explicitly preserves presidential authority to authorize ASAT tests when national security requires, subject to Congressional notification.

This design follows the *Youngstown* framework: by codifying the moratorium while preserving a waiver, Congress establishes a Category One scenario (President acting with Congressional authorization) when the moratorium is followed, and a structured off-ramp (notification and certification requirements) when it is not. This avoids the constitutional confrontation that would arise from an absolute prohibition without a waiver.

#### Commerce Clause and Debris Regulation

Congress's authority to regulate commercial satellite operators' debris mitigation practices rests on the Commerce Clause. Commercial satellite operations are inherently interstate and international in nature -- satellites orbit the Earth, provide services across state and national boundaries, and are launched from facilities that affect interstate commerce. Under *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), Congress may regulate activities that, in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce. A single satellite's debris can threaten the entire orbital environment and disrupt billions of dollars in commercial activity, clearly satisfying the substantial effects test.

#### Treaty Power and International Norms

The ASAT moratorium and allied cooperation provisions interact with the Treaty Power under Article II, Section 2. The legislation does not itself constitute a treaty; rather, it provides domestic legal authority for the President to pursue international agreements through executive agreements or, for more comprehensive arrangements, formal treaties submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. The allied space cooperation framework (Section 8) authorizes executive agreements that do not require Senate ratification, consistent with longstanding practice for military cooperation agreements.

### Outer Space Treaty Obligations

The United States is a state party to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which imposes several obligations relevant to this legislation:

- **Article I**: Space shall be free for exploration and use by all States. The proliferated architecture mandate and debris mitigation standards are consistent with this provision, as they aim to ensure the continued usability of space.
- **Article II**: Space is not subject to national appropriation. Neither bill raises appropriation concerns.
- **Article III**: Activities shall be carried out in accordance with international law. The debris mitigation standards and ASAT moratorium strengthen U.S. compliance.
- **Article IV**: Prohibits WMD in orbit; requires the Moon and celestial bodies be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. Neither bill addresses WMD. Conventional military activities in orbit are not prohibited by Article IV.
- **Article VI**: States are responsible for national activities in space, including by non-governmental entities. This supports federal regulation of commercial satellite operators.
- **Article VII**: Launching state is liable for damage caused by space objects. This reinforces the rationale for debris mitigation standards.
- **Article IX**: Requires consultation before conducting activities that could cause harmful contamination. ASAT tests that generate debris arguably implicate this provision, strengthening the case for the moratorium.

### Space as Global Commons

Space is often described as a "global commons" -- a domain that no nation owns but all nations use. This concept has legal and policy implications:

- The orbital environment is a shared resource vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons. Without regulation, individual actors (states and companies) have an incentive to externalize debris costs onto the shared environment.
- Federal debris mitigation standards address this market failure by requiring U.S. operators to internalize the costs of responsible behavior.
- International norms and the ASAT moratorium extend this logic to the state level, establishing expectations for responsible behavior that preserve the commons for all users.

### Enforcement and Judicial Review

Entities subject to civil penalties under the debris mitigation provisions may seek judicial review in the appropriate United States Court of Appeals. Review shall be on the administrative record under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 706. National security determinations (ASAT waiver, classified cyber defense standards) are subject to limited judicial review consistent with the political question doctrine and the state secrets privilege.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Space Security and Sustainability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Foreign-Flagged Operators** | The debris mitigation standards apply only to U.S.-licensed operators. Operators who obtain licenses from nations with weaker standards can avoid compliance while still operating in the same orbital environment. | High |
| **Moratorium Scope** | The ASAT moratorium covers only "destructive direct-ascent" tests. Co-orbital ASAT systems, directed-energy weapons, electronic warfare, and cyberattacks on satellites are not covered, leaving major categories of ASAT capability unrestricted. | High |
| **SSA Data Quality** | The legislation requires operators to share orbital data but does not specify accuracy or precision requirements. Operators could comply by providing low-quality data that is insufficient for conjunction analysis. | Medium |
| **ADR Dual-Use Concern** | Active debris removal technology (robotic arms, nets, harpoons, proximity operations) is inherently dual-use -- the same capability used to de-orbit debris can be used to disable an adversary's satellite. | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Non-Binding on Adversaries** | U.S. law cannot compel China, Russia, or other nations to comply with debris standards or ASAT moratoria. | Sovereignty; limits of domestic legislation. |
| **Debris Already in Orbit** | Standards prevent future debris but do not address the ~36,000 existing tracked objects. ADR funding is authorized but actual removal is years away. | Technical immaturity; cost. |
| **FCC/FAA/NOAA Fragmentation** | Debris standards must be harmonized across multiple licensing agencies with different mandates, timelines, and regulatory cultures. | Historical bureaucratic fragmentation. |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Foreign Operator Problem**: Pursue international harmonization of debris standards through UN COPUOS and bilateral agreements. Include provisions conditioning U.S. launch services and ground station access on compliance with equivalent debris standards.
2. **Moratorium Scope Expansion**: Commission a follow-up study on extending norms to co-orbital ASAT tests, directed-energy use against satellites, and interference with nuclear early warning systems. Pursue these as additional diplomatic initiatives.
3. **SSA Data Quality**: Issue implementing regulations specifying minimum accuracy and update frequency requirements for SSA data submissions. Tie data quality standards to licensing conditions.
4. **ADR Dual-Use**: Develop transparency measures for ADR operations (pre-notification to all spacefaring nations, real-time tracking data sharing) and pursue international guidelines distinguishing ADR from hostile proximity operations.

### Space Force Modernization and Resilience Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Waiver Abuse** | The waiver provision for the proliferated architecture mandate could be used broadly to exempt missions from the resilience requirement, preserving the status quo of exquisite single-point-of-failure systems. | High |
| **Commercial-First Bypass** | The commercial solutions analysis could become a pro-forma exercise that always concludes commercial systems are inadequate, preserving traditional acquisition. | Medium |
| **Cyber Standard Scope** | Cyber defense standards apply to "national security space systems" but may not cover commercial systems used informally (not under contract) for intelligence or operational purposes. | Medium |
| **Responsive Launch Definition** | "24 hours from launch order" could be interpreted as 24 hours from a pre-staged, fully integrated satellite, not from a cold start, limiting the practical utility of the requirement. | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Industrial Base Capacity** | The space industrial base may not have the manufacturing capacity to produce hundreds of satellites per year for proliferated architectures. | Decades of building small numbers of expensive satellites. |
| **Transition Cost** | Maintaining legacy systems while deploying new proliferated constellations creates a costly overlap period. | Physics of orbital mechanics; cannot instantly replace constellations. |
| **Workforce** | The Space Force is the smallest military branch and may lack sufficient personnel to operate vastly expanded constellations. | Recruiting challenges; competition with commercial sector. |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Waiver Abuse**: Require the Secretary to provide detailed written justification for each waiver, subject to GAO review. Require annual Congressional reporting on the number and rationale for waivers.
2. **Commercial-First Bypass**: Require the commercial solutions analysis to be reviewed by an independent body (e.g., the Aerospace Corporation) before a traditional acquisition program can be initiated.
3. **Industrial Base**: Include a separate manufacturing capacity development program with dedicated funding to expand the satellite production base.
4. **Workforce**: Authorize the Space Force to increase end strength by 25% over 5 years, with targeted recruitment incentives for satellite operations, cyber defense, and acquisition professionals.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| **Interagency Coordination** | The legislation distributes authorities across DoD, Commerce, NASA, FCC, FAA, and State. Designate the National Space Council as the coordinating body with authority to resolve interagency disputes. |
| **Classification Barriers** | Over-classification of space programs impedes Congressional oversight, allied cooperation, and commercial integration. Direct the DNI to conduct a classification review of space programs with a presumption of declassification for non-sensitive information. |
| **International Harmonization** | U.S. debris standards are only effective if other major spacefaring nations adopt equivalent standards. Tie U.S. launch services, ground station access, and data sharing to compliance with equivalent standards. |
| **Technology Pace** | Space technology evolves faster than legislative cycles. Delegate technical standard-setting to agencies with expedited rulemaking authority, with Congressional review of major rules. |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **ASAT Moratorium**: Permanent statutory provision with presidential waiver authority. Annual State Department report on multilateral adoption provides ongoing oversight.
- **Debris Mitigation Standards**: Subject to 5-year review and update cycle. NASA shall convene an interagency review and propose updated standards based on evolving technology and the debris environment.
- **Commercial Space Reserve**: The program shall undergo a comprehensive review at the 5-year mark, with a GAO assessment of enrollment, activation exercises, and cost-effectiveness.
- **Proliferated Architecture Mandate**: The 10-year transition timeline includes interim milestones at years 3, 5, and 7 with Congressional reporting requirements. If milestones are not met, the Secretary must testify before the Armed Services Committees on the reasons and revised plan.
- **Acquisition Reform**: Space Force acquisition authorities shall sunset after 7 years unless reauthorized. GAO shall conduct an independent assessment of acquisition reform effectiveness at the 5-year mark.
- **Space Cyber Defense Standards**: Subject to annual review by the Chief of Space Operations and biennial independent assessment by the NSA Cybersecurity Directorate.
