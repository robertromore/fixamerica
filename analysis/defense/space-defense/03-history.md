# Space Defense: History

## Historical Development

The militarization of space began alongside the space age itself. From the earliest satellite launches, nations recognized space as the ultimate high ground -- a domain that could provide decisive intelligence, communications, and strategic advantages. The history of space defense traces a path from Cold War competition to today's multi-domain, multi-actor contest.

### The Space Race and Early Military Programs (1957-1967)

- **Sputnik (October 4, 1957)**: The Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, shocking the United States and igniting the space race. Sputnik demonstrated that the Soviets possessed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) technology capable of reaching any point on Earth, transforming national security calculations overnight.
- **Explorer 1 (January 1958)**: The first U.S. satellite, launched in direct response to Sputnik. The U.S. simultaneously created NASA for civilian space activities and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) for military space research.
- **CORONA Reconnaissance Satellites (1959-1972)**: The CIA and Air Force operated the CORONA program, the first photographic reconnaissance satellite system. CORONA replaced the U-2 spy plane program (compromised when Francis Gary Powers was shot down in 1960) and provided critical intelligence on Soviet ICBM deployments, military installations, and nuclear weapons facilities.
- **Early ASAT Programs (1959-1975)**: Both superpowers pursued anti-satellite weapons from the dawn of the space age.
    - **U.S. Programs**: The U.S. tested nuclear weapons in space (Starfish Prime, 1962) and developed the Program 437 ASAT system using Thor missiles based on Johnston Atoll. The U.S. also experimented with co-orbital ASAT interceptors before cancelling most programs by the mid-1970s.
    - **Soviet Programs**: The Soviet Union developed and tested the Istrebitel Sputnikov ("Satellite Fighter") co-orbital ASAT system from 1963 through 1982, conducting approximately 20 intercept tests.
- **Outer Space Treaty (1967)**: The Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space was signed by the U.S., Soviet Union, and United Kingdom. Key provisions:
    - Prohibits placing nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies.
    - Establishes that space shall be used for peaceful purposes and is the "province of all mankind."
    - Prohibits national appropriation of celestial bodies.
    - Does *not* prohibit conventional weapons in orbit, ground-based ASAT systems, or military use of space for reconnaissance and communications.

### Detente and Early Arms Control (1967-1983)

- **ABM Treaty (1972)**: The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the U.S. and Soviet Union limited missile defense systems. While focused on ground-based missile defense, the treaty's restrictions had indirect implications for space-based interceptors and ASAT weapons, constraining certain development paths.
- **SALT and Space**: Strategic Arms Limitation Talks focused on nuclear weapons but included provisions that implicitly protected the "national technical means" (satellites) used to verify treaty compliance, establishing an important norm against interfering with reconnaissance satellites.
- **Soviet ASAT Moratorium (1983)**: The Soviet Union declared a unilateral moratorium on ASAT testing in 1983, though it maintained its existing co-orbital ASAT capability.

### Star Wars and the Weaponization Debate (1983-2001)

| Year | Event | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| 1983 | **Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI/"Star Wars")** | President Reagan announced SDI, proposing a comprehensive missile defense system that included space-based lasers, kinetic interceptors, and other exotic technologies. While the full vision was never realized, SDI accelerated space technology development and put enormous pressure on the Soviet Union. |
| 1985 | **U.S. ASM-135 ASAT Test** | The Air Force successfully tested the ASM-135 ASAT missile, launched from an F-15 fighter jet, destroying the Solwind P78-1 satellite at 555 km altitude. Congress subsequently imposed a moratorium on further kinetic ASAT tests. |
| 1991 | **Gulf War: "First Space War"** | Operation Desert Storm was the first conflict where space capabilities were fully integrated into military operations. GPS-guided munitions, satellite communications, and space-based reconnaissance proved decisive, demonstrating to the world -- including adversaries -- the critical importance of space to U.S. military power. |
| 1996 | **GPS Full Operational Capability** | The GPS constellation achieved full operational capability with 24 satellites, providing global coverage. GPS would become the backbone of precision warfare and an essential utility for the global economy. |
| 2000 | **Rumsfeld Space Commission** | The Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization, chaired by Donald Rumsfeld, warned of a "Space Pearl Harbor" and recommended creating a separate military space service -- a recommendation that would not be acted upon for nearly two decades. |

### The Modern Era: Contested Space (2001-Present)

| Year | Event | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| 2007 | **Chinese ASAT Test** | China destroyed the FY-1C weather satellite at ~865 km altitude using a direct-ascent kinetic kill vehicle, generating over 3,500 trackable debris fragments. This was the most destructive debris-generating event in history and served as a wake-up call that space was no longer a sanctuary. |
| 2008 | **Operation Burnt Frost** | The U.S. destroyed a malfunctioning NRO satellite (USA-193) using a modified SM-3 missile fired from a Navy cruiser. The stated purpose was to prevent the satellite's toxic hydrazine fuel tank from surviving reentry, though many interpreted the operation as a demonstration of U.S. ASAT capability. |
| 2010 | **National Space Policy** | The Obama administration's National Space Policy emphasized sustainability, international cooperation, and responsible behavior in space while maintaining that the U.S. would defend its space assets. |
| 2015 | **Joint Force Space Component Command** | The U.S. military formally designated a Joint Force Space Component Command, reflecting the growing operational importance of space to joint warfighting. |
| 2018 | **National Space Strategy** | The Trump administration issued a new National Space Strategy emphasizing space as a warfighting domain, American dominance, and deterrence. |
| 2019 | **U.S. Space Force Created** | The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2020 established the United States Space Force as an independent branch of the Armed Forces under the Department of the Air Force -- the first new military branch since the Air Force separated from the Army in 1947. |
| 2019 | **U.S. Space Command Re-established** | USSPACECOM was re-established as a unified combatant command (it had previously existed from 1985-2002 before being merged into USSTRATCOM after 9/11). |
| 2019 | **India ASAT Test (Mission Shakti)** | India conducted a kinetic ASAT test, destroying a satellite at ~300 km altitude. The low altitude meant debris re-entered quickly, but India became the fourth nation to demonstrate kinetic ASAT capability. |
| 2021 | **Russian ASAT Test** | Russia destroyed the defunct Cosmos 1408 satellite using a Nudol direct-ascent missile, generating over 1,500 trackable debris fragments. The debris cloud threatened the International Space Station and drew international condemnation. |
| 2022 | **U.S. ASAT Testing Moratorium** | Vice President Harris announced that the United States would not conduct destructive direct-ascent ASAT missile tests, calling on other nations to follow suit. This was the first self-imposed kinetic ASAT restraint by a major space power. |
| 2022 | **Starlink in Ukraine** | SpaceX's Starlink constellation provided critical communications and intelligence support to Ukrainian forces after Russia's invasion, demonstrating the military utility of commercial satellite constellations and the vulnerability of such systems to electronic warfare and cyberattack. |
| 2023 | **UN ASAT Test Resolution** | The UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling on all states to refrain from destructive direct-ascent ASAT tests. While non-binding, it established an emerging international norm. |

This history reveals a clear trajectory: space has evolved from a domain primarily used for strategic intelligence and nuclear early warning to a fully integrated warfighting domain where great powers compete, commercial actors play essential roles, and the physical environment itself is under threat from the consequences of that competition.
