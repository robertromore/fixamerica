# Space Defense: Current State

## U.S. Space Force Structure and Organization

### U.S. Space Force (USSF)

- **Mission**: To organize, train, and equip space forces in order to protect U.S. and allied interests in space and to provide space capabilities to the joint force.
- **Structure**: The Space Force is the sixth branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, organized under the Department of the Air Force. Its members are known as "Guardians."
- **Personnel**: Approximately 16,000 active-duty Guardians, making it the smallest U.S. military branch.
- **Budget**: The FY2025 budget request for the Space Force was approximately $29.4 billion, reflecting the growing priority placed on space capabilities. This represents a significant increase from $15.4 billion in FY2021.
- **Field Commands**:
    - **Space Operations Command (SpOC)**: Conducts space operations, including satellite operations, missile warning, space domain awareness, and electromagnetic warfare.
    - **Space Systems Command (SSC)**: Responsible for developing, acquiring, and sustaining space systems. Manages launch operations and satellite procurement.
    - **Space Training and Readiness Command (STARCOM)**: Responsible for training Guardians and developing space doctrine.

### U.S. Space Command (USSPACECOM)

- **Mission**: A unified combatant command responsible for conducting operations in, from, and to the space domain. While the Space Force organizes and equips forces, Space Command employs them in operations.
- **Relationship to Space Force**: Analogous to the relationship between the U.S. Army (organizes and trains) and U.S. Central Command (conducts operations). Space Command draws forces from all services but primarily from the Space Force.
- **Commander**: A four-star general officer.

## Critical Satellite Constellations

The U.S. military and civilian economy depend on several key satellite constellations. The loss or degradation of any of these would have immediate and severe consequences.

### Navigation: GPS

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Constellation Size | 31 operational satellites |
| Orbit | Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), ~20,200 km altitude |
| Modernization | GPS III and IIIF (improved accuracy, anti-jamming, M-code for military) |
| Dependence | Precision-guided munitions, logistics, civilian aviation, financial transactions, emergency services |

- **Vulnerability**: GPS signals are extremely weak by the time they reach Earth's surface, making them susceptible to jamming and spoofing. Russia and China have both demonstrated GPS jamming capabilities in operational theaters.

### Missile Warning: SBIRS and Next-Gen OPIR

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Current System | Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) -- 6 satellites in GEO and HEO |
| Replacement | Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) |
| Orbit | Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), ~35,786 km altitude |
| Mission | Detect ballistic missile launches within seconds using infrared sensors |
| Dependence | Nuclear deterrence, theater missile defense, battlespace awareness |

- **Vulnerability**: As high-value, low-density assets in predictable GEO orbits, these satellites are prime targets for ASAT weapons and directed-energy attacks.

### Communications: SATCOM

| System | Orbit | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) | GEO | Nuclear command and control, strategic communications |
| Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) | GEO | High-bandwidth tactical communications |
| Protected Tactical SATCOM (PTS) | Various | Anti-jam, secure tactical communications |
| Commercial SATCOM | Various | Supplemental bandwidth (up to 80% of DoD SATCOM bandwidth is commercial) |

- **Vulnerability**: Heavy reliance on commercial SATCOM creates supply chain and targeting risks. The 2022 Russian cyberattack on Viasat's KA-SAT network at the start of the Ukraine invasion demonstrated the vulnerability of commercial SATCOM to state-level attack.

### Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR)

- **National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)**: Operates classified electro-optical, radar, and signals intelligence satellites.
- **Modernization**: The NRO has been expanding its constellation by contracting with commercial providers for supplemental imagery and signals collection.
- **Vulnerability**: ISR satellites in LEO must pass predictably over targets and are trackable, making them vulnerable to both kinetic and non-kinetic ASAT threats.

## Adversary ASAT Capabilities

### China (People's Republic of China)

China is the most capable and active peer competitor in space. The PLA Strategic Support Force (PLASSF) integrates space, cyber, and electronic warfare capabilities.

| Capability | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct-Ascent ASAT** | Ground-launched kinetic kill vehicle that physically destroys a satellite. China tested this capability in 2007, destroying the FY-1C weather satellite at ~865 km altitude, generating over 3,500 trackable debris fragments. | Operational |
| **Co-Orbital ASAT** | Satellites capable of maneuvering close to a target satellite and destroying or disabling it. The SJ-17 and SJ-21 spacecraft have demonstrated advanced proximity operations and satellite grappling. | Tested and developing |
| **Ground-Based Laser** | Directed-energy weapons capable of dazzling or blinding satellite optical sensors from the ground. | Developing |
| **Electronic Warfare** | GPS jamming and satellite communications jamming capabilities demonstrated in exercises and near Taiwan. | Operational |
| **Cyber ASAT** | Capability to hack satellite ground stations and command-and-control links. | Assessed operational |

### Russia

Russia maintains a diverse and mature ASAT portfolio inherited from and expanded beyond Soviet-era programs.

| Capability | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct-Ascent ASAT (Nudol/PL-19)** | Ground-launched kinetic kill vehicle. Russia tested the system in November 2021, destroying the defunct Cosmos 1408 satellite, generating over 1,500 trackable debris fragments and forcing ISS astronauts to shelter. | Operational |
| **Co-Orbital ASAT (Cosmos 2542/2543)** | Russia has launched satellites that maneuver close to U.S. national security satellites, conducting surveillance and demonstrating the ability to threaten them. | Operational |
| **Electronic Warfare** | Extensive GPS jamming capability; demonstrated in Ukraine, Syria, and the Baltic region. The Peresvet laser system is deployed to dazzle satellite sensors. | Operational |
| **Nuclear Space Weapon (Reported)** | In 2024, reports emerged that Russia was developing a space-based nuclear weapon or nuclear-powered electronic warfare device intended to disable satellite constellations. | Under development |

### Other Actors

- **India**: Conducted a kinetic ASAT test in March 2019 (Mission Shakti), destroying a satellite at ~300 km altitude. The low altitude meant most debris re-entered the atmosphere within months, but the test demonstrated India's capability.
- **Iran and North Korea**: Both possess ballistic missile technology that could theoretically be adapted for ASAT purposes, but neither has demonstrated a dedicated ASAT capability.

## Space Debris Environment

The orbital debris environment is a growing threat to all space operations.

### Current Status

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Tracked Objects (10 cm+) | ~36,000 | U.S. Space Surveillance Network, 2024 |
| Estimated Objects (1-10 cm) | ~1,000,000 | ESA Space Debris Office |
| Estimated Objects (1 mm - 1 cm) | ~130,000,000 | ESA Space Debris Office |
| Average Collision Speed (LEO) | ~10 km/s (22,000 mph) | NASA Orbital Debris Program |
| ISS Debris Avoidance Maneuvers (annual avg) | ~3-5 per year | NASA |

- **Kessler Syndrome Risk**: At current debris growth rates, certain orbital altitudes -- particularly around 800-1,000 km -- may approach a tipping point where cascading collisions generate debris faster than natural orbital decay removes it, potentially rendering those orbits unusable.
- **Major Debris-Generating Events**:
    - 2007 Chinese ASAT test: ~3,500+ tracked fragments
    - 2009 Iridium 33/Cosmos 2251 collision: ~2,300+ tracked fragments
    - 2021 Russian ASAT test: ~1,500+ tracked fragments

## Space Situational Awareness (SSA)

### U.S. Space Surveillance Network

- **18th Space Defense Squadron**: Operates the Space Surveillance Network, a global network of ground-based radars and optical telescopes that tracks objects in orbit.
- **Combined Space Operations Center (CSpOC)**: Located at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The primary hub for space situational awareness and space battle management.
- **Commercial SSA**: Companies like LeoLabs and ExoAnalytic Solutions provide commercial space tracking services that supplement government capabilities.

### Limitations

- The current network struggles to track objects smaller than 10 cm, which can still be lethal to spacecraft.
- The rapidly growing number of objects (driven by mega-constellations like Starlink) is straining tracking capacity.
- Data sharing with allies and commercial operators is improving but remains hampered by classification concerns.

## Commercial Space Integration

The commercial space sector has fundamentally transformed the national security space landscape.

### Key Developments

- **SpaceX Dominance**: SpaceX provides the majority of U.S. national security launch services and operates the Starlink constellation (~6,000+ satellites), which has demonstrated military utility in the Ukraine conflict.
- **Proliferated LEO Architecture**: The Space Development Agency (SDA) is building the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA), a mesh network of hundreds of small satellites in LEO for missile tracking and data transport. This represents a shift from small numbers of large, expensive satellites to large numbers of smaller, cheaper ones.
- **Commercial ISR**: Companies like Maxar, Planet, and BlackSky provide commercial satellite imagery that supplements NRO capabilities.
- **United Launch Alliance (ULA)**: Provides Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle for national security missions.

### Challenges

- **Protecting Commercial Assets**: If commercial satellites used by the military are targeted during conflict, does the government have obligations to defend or replace them? What are the escalation implications of attacking a commercial constellation?
- **Supply Chain Security**: Dependence on a small number of commercial providers creates single points of failure. SpaceX's dominance in launch raises concentration risk concerns.
- **Dual-Use Ambiguity**: Commercial satellites that serve both military and civilian purposes complicate targeting decisions for adversaries and legal determinations about legitimate military targets.
