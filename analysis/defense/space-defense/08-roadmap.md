# Space Defense: Reform Roadmap

Securing the space domain requires a phased approach that prioritizes building resilient architectures and establishing norms in the near term, scaling capabilities and deepening alliances in the medium term, and achieving sustainable space security over the long term.

---

## Phase 1: Foundations and Quick Wins (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on immediate legislative, executive, and diplomatic actions that establish the policy framework and begin the most urgent capability improvements.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Codify ASAT Testing Moratorium** | Congress passes legislation codifying the U.S. commitment not to conduct destructive direct-ascent ASAT missile tests. | Law is enacted. Diplomatic campaign recruits at least 10 additional nations to the moratorium within 12 months. |
| **2. Accelerate Proliferated LEO** | Fully fund and accelerate the Space Development Agency's PWSA Tranche 2 and Tranche 3 satellite procurements. | PWSA Tranche 2 achieves initial operational capability on schedule. Tranche 3 contracts are awarded. |
| **3. Strengthen Debris Mitigation** | Pass the Space Sustainability Act codifying debris mitigation standards and FCC's 5-year disposal rule into federal law. | Law is enacted. All new U.S.-licensed satellite operators comply with updated standards. |
| **4. Expand SSA Sharing** | Expand space situational awareness data sharing agreements with all CSpO partners and at least 10 additional allied nations. | New SSA sharing agreements are signed. Department of Commerce Open Architecture Data Repository is operational. |
| **5. Pass Space Force Modernization Act** | Congress passes legislation authorizing commercial space integration frameworks, space cyber defense requirements, and acquisition reform for the Space Force. | Law is enacted. Space Force issues implementing guidance within 180 days. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Establish the legal and policy foundations for sustainable space security. Demonstrate U.S. leadership on norms. Begin the architectural shift from exquisite to resilient constellations.

## Phase 2: Scaling Capability and Alliances (Years 3-5)

This phase focuses on delivering new capabilities, deepening allied cooperation, and building the institutional infrastructure for long-term space security.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Achieve PWSA IOC** | The Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture reaches initial operational capability for missile tracking and data transport. | PWSA provides persistent global missile tracking coverage. Data transport layer operational with latency targets met. |
| **2. Demonstrate Active Debris Removal** | Fund and execute the first U.S. government-supported active debris removal demonstration mission, targeting a high-priority debris object. | ADR demonstration mission successfully captures or de-orbits a tracked debris object. Technology readiness validated. |
| **3. Establish Commercial Space Reserve** | Establish a "Commercial Space Reserve" program where commercial operators agree to provide priority capacity during national emergencies. | Framework established. At least 5 major commercial operators enrolled. First tabletop exercise conducted. |
| **4. Formalize Allied Space Operations** | Expand the Combined Space Operations (CSpO) initiative to include formal combined space operations plans, shared doctrine, and interoperable systems. | Combined space operations plan published. First combined live exercise conducted. At least 2 additional nations join CSpO. |
| **5. Pursue UN Norms Resolution** | Lead diplomatic effort to adopt a UN General Assembly resolution establishing binding norms against debris-generating ASAT tests and dangerous proximity operations. | Resolution passes with support from at least 100 nations. |
| **6. Develop Responsive Launch** | Achieve responsive launch capability: the ability to launch a replacement satellite within 24 hours of call-up. | Space Force conducts at least 2 responsive launch exercises per year, demonstrating 24-hour launch readiness. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Deliver resilient satellite constellations, demonstrate debris cleanup, formalize allied space cooperation, and advance international norms from non-binding commitments toward enforceable standards.

## Phase 3: Sustainable Space Security (Years 6-10)

This phase focuses on achieving the long-term vision of a stable, sustainable, and secure space domain.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Resilient Architecture Achieved** | The U.S. national security space architecture is sufficiently distributed and redundant that the loss of any 10% of satellites does not degrade any critical mission below operational thresholds. | Wargames and exercises demonstrate that adversary ASAT attacks cannot achieve strategically meaningful degradation of U.S. space capabilities. |
| **2. Operational ADR Capability** | Active debris removal moves from demonstration to operational capability, with regular missions removing high-priority debris objects from congested orbital bands. | ADR program removes at least 10 high-priority debris objects per year. Debris population in the 700-1,000 km band begins to decline. |
| **3. International Norms Enforced** | The international community has established and begun enforcing consequences for violations of space security norms. | At least one case of collective diplomatic or economic response to a norm violation (e.g., sanctions for an ASAT test). |
| **4. Cislunar Domain Awareness** | U.S. and allied space surveillance extends to cislunar space, providing awareness of activities between GEO and the Moon. | Cislunar surveillance network operational with persistent tracking of objects beyond GEO. |
| **5. Next-Generation Space Force** | The Space Force has fully matured as an independent service with its own culture, doctrine, and acquisition processes optimized for the space domain. | Space Force personnel retention rates meet or exceed other services. Acquisition timelines for new satellite programs reduced by 50% compared to 2020 baseline. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: The United States has achieved a sustainable competitive advantage in space through resilient architectures, allied partnerships, and international norms, while the orbital debris environment is stabilized and beginning to improve.
