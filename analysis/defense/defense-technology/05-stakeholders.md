# Defense Technology: Stakeholders

The defense innovation ecosystem involves a clash between entrenched incumbents and disruptive newcomers, mediated by a massive government bureaucracy.

## Government Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Under Secretary of Defense for Research & Engineering (OUSD(R&E))** | Advancing technology; maintaining technical superiority. | Chief Technology Officer of the DoD; oversees DARPA, DIU, and labs. |
| **Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition & Sustainment (OUSD(A&S))** | Buying and maintaining systems; industrial base health. | The primary buyer; manages major programs and the acquisition workforce. |
| **Defense Innovation Unit (DIU)** | Accelerating commercial tech adoption. | The bridge between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon; uses flexible contracting (OTAs). |
| **DARPA** | High-risk, high-reward breakthrough research. | Funds "moonshot" projects that create new paradigms (e.g., the Internet, stealth). |
| **Chief Digital & AI Office (CDAO)** | Scaling AI and data analytics across the DoD. | Central hub for AI strategy, data infrastructure, and JADC2. |
| **Service Labs** (AFRL, NRL, ARL) | Service-specific research and development. | Conduct basic and applied research tailored to Army, Navy, and Air Force needs. |
| **Congress** (Armed Services & Appropriations) | Oversight, funding, and jobs in districts. | Controls the budget; often protects legacy programs that provide jobs. |

## Industry Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Prime Contractors** ("The Primes") | Stable, long-term contracts; shareholder value. | Build major platforms (F-35, carriers); act as systems integrators. |
| **Non-Traditional Defense Companies** (e.g., Anduril, Palantir, Shield AI) | Disruption; winning programs of record; speed. | VC-backed startups trying to break into the defense market with software/AI-first approaches. |
| **Commercial Tech Giants** (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Oracle) | Cloud contracts (JWCC); enterprise software sales. | Provide the digital backbone (cloud, office suites) for the DoD. |
| **Venture Capitalists (VCs)** | Return on investment; exits (IPO or acquisition). | Fund the startups; increasingly investing in "defense tech" (e.g., a16z, Founders Fund). |

## Stakeholder Conflicts

### Primes vs. Non-Traditionals

- **Conflict**: Primes want to maintain their monopoly on major programs and act as the "integrator" for new tech. Non-traditionals want to sell directly to the government and displace legacy systems.
- **Dynamic**: Primes often lobby for requirements that favor their capabilities or try to acquire successful startups to neutralize competition.

### R&E vs. A&S (Innovators vs. Buyers)

- **Conflict**: R&E wants to push the envelope with new tech. A&S wants stable, producible, maintainable systems.
- **Dynamic**: This creates the "Valley of Death." R&E funds the prototype, but A&S (and the Services) must budget for the production, which they are often slow to do.

### Congress vs. DoD Reformers

- **Conflict**: DoD leaders may want to "divest to invest"—retiring old planes to fund new drones. Congress often blocks these retirements to protect jobs at the factories or bases in their districts.

### Tech Workers vs. Tech Leadership

- **Conflict**: Employees at big tech firms (like Google) have protested defense contracts on ethical grounds (e.g., Project Maven). Leadership wants the lucrative government revenue.
- **Result**: Some companies have pulled back from certain defense work or created ethical AI boards to navigate the tension.
