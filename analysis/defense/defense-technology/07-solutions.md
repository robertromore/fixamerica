# Defense Technology: Solutions

Accelerating defense innovation requires a holistic approach that addresses funding, culture, and infrastructure.

## 1. Bridge the "Valley of Death"

**A. Establish a "Transition Fund"**

- **Proposal**: Create a dedicated, flexible appropriation (e.g., $1 billion/year) specifically for transitioning successful prototypes to production.
- **Mechanism**: Managed by OUSD(R&E) or DIU, this fund would bridge the 2-year gap between a successful pilot and the start of a Program of Record budget line.
- **Impact**: Prevents startup bankruptcy; signals reliability to private investors.

**B. "Bridge" Contracts**

- **Proposal**: Standardize the use of "bridge contracts" or IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity) vehicles that allow for immediate follow-on production orders upon successful prototyping.

## 2. Reform Acquisition and Budgeting

**A. Portfolio Budgeting**

- **Proposal**: Move from line-item budgeting (funding specific widgets) to portfolio budgeting (funding capabilities like "Unmanned Systems").
- **Mechanism**: Program Executive Officers (PEOs) would have authority to shift funds within their portfolio to the best-performing technologies without needing Congressional approval for every move.
- **Impact**: Increases agility; allows DoD to cut losers and double down on winners quickly.

**B. Software Color of Money**

- **Proposal**: Create a single appropriation category for software (BA-8) that covers development, procurement, and sustainment.
- **Impact**: Enables modern DevSecOps practices where software is continuously updated, rather than bought once and maintained separately.

## 3. Strengthen the Innovation Ecosystem

**A. Empower the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU)**

- **Proposal**: Elevate DIU to report directly to the Secretary of Defense (already in progress) and significantly increase its budget authority.
- **Impact**: Gives the "commercial-first" advocates a seat at the big table alongside the traditional acquisition bureaucracy.

**B. Hedge Portfolio**

- **Proposal**: Explicitly allocate a percentage of the budget (e.g., 1-5%) to "non-traditional" vendors and low-cost, attritable systems (Replicator model).
- **Impact**: Creates a guaranteed market for new entrants, fostering competition and innovation.

## 4. Workforce and Culture

**A. Digital Workforce Service**

- **Proposal**: Expand the use of "tour of duty" models where private sector tech talent can serve in the DoD for 1-2 years without a career commitment.
- **Impact**: Injects modern tech skills and culture into the Pentagon.

**B. Lateral Entry**

- **Proposal**: Allow cyber and tech experts to commission into the military at mid-career ranks (e.g., Major/Colonel) commensurate with their civilian experience.

## 5. Infrastructure and Data

**A. Joint Simulation Environment (JSE)**

- **Proposal**: Invest heavily in digital twins and synthetic training environments.
- **Impact**: Allows for rapid testing of AI and new concepts without expensive physical exercises.

**B. Data Decree**

- **Proposal**: Mandate open APIs and data interoperability for all new defense contracts. No more "vendor lock-in" where the contractor owns the government's data.
