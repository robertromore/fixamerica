# Technology and Innovation: Current State

## Research and Development Funding

The Department of Defense's budget for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) is at a historic high, reflecting the priority placed on technological competition.

### DoD RDT&E Budget by Category (FY2025 Request)

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Basic Research (6.1) | $3.0 billion | University-led fundamental scientific study. |
| Applied Research (6.2) | $7.8 billion | Translating basic science into useful applications. |
| Advanced Technology Development (6.3) | $17.5 billion | Developing and demonstrating new technologies (DARPA's primary budget). |
| Advanced Component Development & Prototypes (6.4) | $38.9 billion | Building and testing prototypes (e.g., B-21, NGAD). |
| System Development & Demonstration (6.5) | $22.8 billion | Engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase. |
| Operational System Development (6.7) | $53.2 billion | Upgrading and improving existing fielded systems. |
| **Total RDT&E** | **$143.2 billion** | |

## Key Technology Areas

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomy
- **Spending**: The DoD requested approximately **$3.5 billion** for AI-specific projects in its unclassified FY2025 budget. The true figure is likely much higher when including classified programs.
- **Key Initiative: Replicator**: Announced in 2023, this initiative aims to field thousands of "small, smart, cheap" autonomous systems across multiple domains within 18-24 months to counter China's mass advantage.
- **Key Organization: Chief Digital and AI Office (CDAO)**: Established in 2022 to synchronize and accelerate the adoption of data, analytics, and AI across the department.
- **Key Programs**:
    - **Project Maven**: AI to process ISR data from drones and satellites.
    - **Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA)**: Autonomous drone wingmen to accompany manned fighter jets.
    - **Autonomous Ships**: Development of large unmanned surface vessels (LUSVs) and extra-large unmanned undersea vehicles (XLUUVs).

### Cyber Warfare
- **Budget**: The DoD requested **$14.5 billion** for cyberspace activities in FY2025.
- **Force Structure: Cyber Mission Force (CMF)**: Comprised of 133 teams and approximately 6,200 personnel. The CMF is organized into teams for offensive cyber, defensive cyber, and supporting national missions.
- **Strategic Concept: Defend Forward**: U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) aims to counter adversary cyber operations at their source, before they reach U.S. networks.
- **Challenge**: A persistent shortage of trained cyber personnel, with high competition from the private sector.

### Hypersonics
- **Definition**: Weapons that travel at speeds greater than Mach 5 and are highly maneuverable.
- **U.S. Programs**:
    - **Army**: Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) "Dark Eagle"
    - **Navy**: Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS)
    - **Air Force**: Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM)
- **Status**: The U.S. has faced multiple test failures and delays, and is widely seen as having fallen behind both China and Russia in fielding operational hypersonic weapons. China has reportedly deployed the DF-17, a hypersonic glide vehicle.

### Space
- **Organization**: The U.S. Space Force, established in 2019, is responsible for organizing, training, and equipping forces for the space domain. U.S. Space Command is the operational combatant command.
- **Key Challenge**: The increasing vulnerability of U.S. satellite constellations (GPS, communications, ISR) to adversary anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, including ground-based missiles, co-orbital threats, and electronic warfare.
- **U.S. Response**: Shifting to a more resilient architecture of smaller, more numerous satellites in proliferated low-Earth orbit (pLEO).

## The Defense Innovation Ecosystem

The DoD relies on a network of organizations to bridge the gap between the military and the tech sector.

| Organization | Mission | Budget (FY2025 Req.) | Key Characteristic |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DARPA** | Prevent and create strategic surprise. Focus on high-risk, high-reward "breakthrough" technologies. | ~$4.0 billion | Long-term, revolutionary research. |
| **Defense Innovation Unit (DIU)** | Accelerate the adoption of commercial technology into the military. | ~$900 million | Focuses on speed, using rapid prototyping and contracting to deliver solutions in 12-24 months. |
| **Service Research Labs** (AFRL, NRL, ARL) | Conduct service-specific scientific research and advanced development. | Varies | Deep technical expertise aligned with service needs. |
| **Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO)** | Re-imagines existing systems for new, unexpected missions. | ~$1.5 billion | Focuses on creative and rapid integration of proven technologies. |

## Adversary Capabilities

The strategic pivot is driven by rapid technological advances by competitors.

### China
- **Strategy**: A state-directed "Military-Civil Fusion" strategy that erases the barriers between commercial and defense sectors to harness all national resources for technological competition.
- **Key Strengths**:
    - **AI**: Massive government investment, vast data availability, and leading commercial companies (e.g., Baidu, Tencent).
    - **Hypersonics**: Has fielded operational systems, likely ahead of the U.S.
    - **Quantum**: Significant state investment in quantum computing and communications.
    - **Shipbuilding/Drones**: World's largest producer of commercial drones and ships, giving it a massive industrial base to scale military production.

### Russia
- **Key Strengths**:
    - **Hypersonics**: Has used hypersonic missiles (e.g., Kinzhal) in combat in Ukraine.
    - **Cyber**: Sophisticated and aggressive cyber warfare capabilities, used for espionage, disruption, and information operations.
    - **Electronic Warfare**: Advanced capabilities to jam GPS, communications, and drone signals.
- **Weakness**: Its conventional technology and industrial base have been significantly degraded by the war in Ukraine.
