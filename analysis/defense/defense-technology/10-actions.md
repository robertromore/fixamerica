# Defense Technology: What You Can Do

Engaging with defense technology policy isn't just for generals and CEOs. Citizens, students, and tech workers play a vital role.

## For Tech Workers and Engineers

- **Serve a "Tour of Duty"**: Consider applying for the **Defense Digital Service**, **Presidential Innovation Fellows**, or **US Digital Corps**. Bring your skills to the government for 1-2 years.
- **Engage with DIU**: If you work at a startup, explore opportunities with the **Defense Innovation Unit**. They are the front door for commercial tech.
- **Ethical Engagement**: Don't just boycott defense work. Engage in the conversation about *how* technology should be used ethically. Help shape the guidelines for responsible AI.

## For Students and Researchers

- **STEM Education**: Pursue degrees in AI, robotics, quantum, and engineering. The nation needs a deep talent pool.
- **SMART Scholarship**: Apply for the DoD's **SMART Scholarship-for-Service** program (tuition + stipend in exchange for civilian service).
- **University Research**: Participate in university-affiliated research centers (UARCs) working on dual-use technologies.

## For Citizens and Voters

- **Demand Reform**: Ask representatives why the Pentagon buys software like it buys aircraft carriers. Support acquisition reform legislation.
- **Support Reshoring**: Advocate for policies that bring critical supply chains (chips, minerals) back to the U.S. or friendly nations.
- **Understand the Stakes**: Educate yourself on the technological competition with China. It is not just a military issue; it affects economic competitiveness and privacy.

## For Policymakers

- **Visit DIU and Startups**: Don't just meet with the big primes. Visit the commercial tech hubs to understand the pace of innovation.
- **Protect R&D Budgets**: Resist the temptation to cut "science projects" to pay for legacy platforms or short-term readiness.
- **Fix the "Color of Money"**: Champion budget reform legislation that allows for flexible software funding.

## Key Advocacy Groups

- **Silicon Valley Defense Group**: Connects the tech and defense communities.
- **Alliance for Commercial Technology in Government**: Advocates for procurement reform to help startups.
