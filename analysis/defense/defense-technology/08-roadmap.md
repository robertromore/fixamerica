# Defense Technology: Reform Roadmap

Implementing these solutions requires a phased approach, moving from immediate fixes to structural transformation.

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Years 1-2)

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Bridge Fund** | Congress appropriates $500M-$1B for a pilot "Technology Transition Fund." | Fund is established; first 10-20 projects bridged. |
| **2. Replicator Execution** | DoD delivers on the "Replicator" initiative, fielding thousands of autonomous systems. | Systems delivered to INDOPACOM; operational concepts validated. |
| **3. Software Reform** | Expand the "Software Acquisition Pathway" and BA-8 pilot programs. | 20% increase in programs using agile software authorities. |
| **4. Data Rights** | DoD issues policy mandating open APIs/data rights in all new major contracts. | New RFPs include mandatory interoperability clauses. |

**Goal**: Prove that the DoD can move fast on specific priorities and stop the bleeding of startups dying in the Valley of Death.

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. PPBE Reform** | Congress passes legislation implementing Portfolio Budgeting recommendations from the PPBE Commission. | 50% of acquisition budget managed via portfolios. |
| **2. Workforce Overhaul** | Implement lateral entry and digital career tracks across all services. | 1,000+ mid-career tech experts hired/commissioned. |
| **3. Infrastructure** | Complete the Joint Simulation Environment (JSE) for all domains. | All major programs tested in JSE before production decisions. |
| **4. Allied Integration** | Establish "AUKUS Pillar 2" tech sharing as the norm, removing ITAR barriers for key allies. | Seamless tech transfer with UK/Australia; expanded to Japan. |

**Goal**: Change the underlying rules of the game (budgeting and personnel) to make innovation the norm, not the exception.

## Phase 3: Transformation (Years 6-10)

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. AI-Native Force** | AI and autonomy are fully integrated into doctrine and force structure. | Majority of air/sea assets are unmanned/autonomous. |
| **2. Diverse Industrial Base** | The "Big 5" primes are joined by 2-3 new major "tech primes." | Non-traditional companies capture >20% of prime contract dollars. |
| **3. Dynamic Acquisition** | Acquisition cycle times match commercial tech cycles (18-24 months). | Average time to field new capability drops from 10 years to 2 years. |

**Goal**: A transformed DIB and military force structure capable of overmatching any peer competitor through superior technology and adaptability.
