# Defense Technology: Legislation

## Overview

Legislative reform is essential to break the "industrial age" shackles on the Department of Defense (DoD). The current acquisition system, designed during the Cold War to buy aircraft carriers and tanks over decades, is fundamentally ill-suited for the digital age where software evolves in weeks. This mismatch creates the "Valley of Death," where innovative commercial technologies fail to transition to military use due to budget rigidity and bureaucratic delay.

The following legislative framework focuses on agility, funding flexibility, and bridging the gap between commercial innovation and military adoption. It proposes two major federal bills: one to restructure acquisition authorities and funding mechanisms, and another to establish safety and assurance standards for artificial intelligence. It also includes model state legislation to foster local defense innovation ecosystems.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for defense technology reform. Congress possesses extensive authority under Article I, Section 8 to "raise and support Armies," "provide and maintain a Navy," and "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." The proposals below exercise these enumerated powers to restructure administrative processes and funding mechanisms.*

## Federal Legislation

### The Defense Innovation and Agility Act

**Purpose**: To modernize the defense acquisition system for the digital age, enabling the rapid adoption of software and commercial technologies.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Establishment of "Bridge Fund"**: Authorizes $1 billion annually for a "Technology Transition Fund" managed by OUSD(R&E) to bridge the gap between successful prototypes and Program of Record funding.
2. **Software Appropriation (BA-8)**: Codifies a new "Software and Digital Technology" budget activity that allows funds to be used interchangeably for R&D, procurement, and O&M of software systems.
3. **Portfolio Budgeting Pilot**: Authorizes a 5-year pilot program for three major mission areas (e.g., Unmanned Systems, JADC2) to use portfolio-based budgeting, granting PEOs transfer authority of up to 20% within the portfolio.
4. **DIU Codification**: Statutorily authorizes the Defense Innovation Unit, reporting directly to the Secretary of Defense, with independent hiring and contracting authorities.
5. **Open Architecture Mandate**: Requires all Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) to utilize modular open systems approaches (MOSA) and deliver government-purpose data rights for key interfaces.

AN ACT

To modernize the defense acquisition system, accelerate the fielding of emerging technologies, and bridge the valley of death for innovative commercial solutions.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Defense Innovation and Agility Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The current Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process requires 2 to 3 years to allocate funding for new programs, creating a "valley of death" that bankrupts innovative startups before they can secure a contract (PPBE Reform Commission, 2024).
(2) Software is a continuous capability, yet current appropriation categories force artificial separation between development, procurement, and maintenance, hindering modern DevSecOps practices (Defense Innovation Board, "Software is Never Done," 2019).
(3) The Department of Defense awards less than 1 percent of its prime contract dollars to venture-backed companies, despite the commercial sector leading global R&D in critical technologies like AI and autonomy (Govini, 2023).
(4) Vendor lock-in due to proprietary data standards costs the Department billions of dollars annually and prevents the rapid integration of best-in-class upgrades.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) NON-TRADITIONAL DEFENSE CONTRACTOR.—The term has the meaning given in section 3014 of title 10, United States Code.
(2) VALLEY OF DEATH.—The term "valley of death" means the period between the end of a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Other Transaction Authority (OTA) prototype contract and the commencement of a Program of Record production contract.
(3) SOFTWARE BUDGET ACTIVITY.—The term "Software Budget Activity" means a single appropriation category that authorizes funds for the research, development, test, evaluation, procurement, and operation and maintenance of software.

SEC. 101. TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION FUND.

(a) There is established in the Treasury a fund to be known as the "Defense Technology Transition Fund".
(b) The Fund shall be used to provide bridge funding for technologies that have successfully completed a prototype phase under Other Transaction Authority but await inclusion in the future years defense program.
(c) ELIGIBILITY.—To be eligible for funding, a project must:
    (1) Be developed by a non-traditional defense contractor or small business;
    (2) Have a validated military user or requirement; and
    (3) Have a transition plan signed by a Program Executive Officer.

SEC. 201. SOFTWARE BUDGET ACTIVITY.

(a) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a budget activity for "Software and Digital Technology" within the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation accounts.
(b) Funds in this activity shall be available for the entire lifecycle of software, including development, procurement, modification, and maintenance.
(c) PILOT PROGRAMS.—The Secretary shall designate not fewer than 10 major software programs to utilize this budget activity in fiscal year 2027.

SEC. 301. PORTFOLIO BUDGETING PILOT.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish a pilot program for portfolio-based budgeting in three mission areas:
    (1) Unmanned Systems and Autonomy;
    (2) Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2); and
    (3) Defensive Cyber Operations.
(b) TRANSFER AUTHORITY.—Program Executive Officers managing these portfolios may transfer up to 20 percent of the total portfolio budget between programs within the portfolio without prior congressional approval, subject to quarterly reporting.

SEC. 401. DEFENSE INNOVATION UNIT.

(a) CODIFICATION.—Chapter 4 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding a new section authorizing the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU).
(b) REPORTING.—The Director of the DIU shall report directly to the Secretary of Defense.
(c) AUTHORITIES.—The DIU is authorized to use flexible hiring authorities to recruit technical talent and to use Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs) for all contracting activities.

SEC. 501. OPEN ARCHITECTURE AND DATA RIGHTS.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—All Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) initiated after the date of enactment shall utilize a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA).
(b) DATA RIGHTS.—The Secretary shall require the delivery of government purpose rights for all key interfaces and data standards necessary to ensure interoperability and competitive upgrades.

SEC. 601. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Secretary shall submit an annual report to the congressional defense committees on:
    (1) The number of technologies transitioned using the Fund;
    (2) The amount of funds transferred under portfolio budgeting authorities; and
    (3) The status of open architecture implementation in MDAPs.

SEC. 701. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $1,200,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $1,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $1,800,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 801. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 101**: Directly addresses the "Valley of Death" by providing immediate capital to keep successful startups alive while the slow budget process catches up. The eligibility requirement for a PEO-signed transition plan ensures the fund is not a general-purpose slush fund but a targeted bridge for technologies with validated military requirements.
- **Section 201**: Solves the "color of money" problem where software cannot be updated because O&M funds cannot be used for development. This enables continuous delivery (DevSecOps) and eliminates the perverse incentive to delay upgrades until the next procurement cycle.
- **Section 301**: Moves away from funding specific "widgets" to funding capabilities, allowing managers to kill failing projects and double down on winners quickly. The 20% transfer cap balances agility with congressional oversight.
- **Section 401**: Codifies the Defense Innovation Unit as a statutory entity with independent hiring and contracting authorities, insulating it from bureaucratic attempts to subsume it into traditional acquisition structures.
- **Section 501**: Mandates modular open systems and government data rights to break vendor lock-in. This is the structural reform that enables long-term competition and affordability by ensuring the government is never captive to a single contractor for upgrades.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Establish Transition Fund | 90 days after enactment | OUSD(R&E) |
| Publish Fund eligibility criteria and application process | 120 days after enactment | OUSD(R&E) |
| Designate Software Pilot Programs | 180 days after enactment | OUSD(A&S) |
| Issue Portfolio Budgeting Guidance | 180 days after enactment | DoD Comptroller |
| DFARS amendment (open architecture, data rights) | 1 year after enactment | OUSD(A&S) |
| DIU statutory authorities operational | 1 year after enactment | DIU Director |
| First Annual Report | 1 year after enactment | Secretary of Defense |
| Portfolio Budgeting Pilot mid-term review | 30 months after enactment | GAO |

**Challenges**:

- **Congressional Oversight**: Appropriators may resist portfolio budgeting as it reduces their line-item control. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have historically resisted executive transfer authorities, and the 20% cap may be seen as too generous by members who view line-item control as essential to the constitutional appropriations power.
- **Cultural Resistance**: Traditional program managers may resist open architecture requirements that upset relationships with prime contractors. Decades of sole-source contracting have created institutional dependencies that cannot be undone by statute alone.
- **IP and Data Rights Enforcement**: Prime contractors will resist data rights mandates through lobbying, litigation, or technical workarounds such as delivering data in technically compliant but practically unusable formats. Enforcement requires technical expertise the current acquisition workforce lacks, and contractors may price-in the loss of proprietary advantage through higher bids.
- **Small Business Sustainability**: The Transition Fund addresses the valley of death but not the broader problem that small companies cannot sustain themselves on DoD revenue alone during the 1-2 year contracting cycle. Many promising startups will be acquired by primes or exit the defense market before reaching scale.

**Refinements**:

- Include a "congressional veto" mechanism for large portfolio transfers (above 10% of portfolio value) to assuage oversight concerns while preserving agility for smaller reallocations.
- Require GAO to assess whether the 20% portfolio transfer cap is correctly calibrated after the first 2 years, with authority for the Secretary to recommend cap adjustments based on demonstrated program performance.
- Mandate that the DIU establish a "reverse industry day" program where DoD operators brief commercial tech companies on unclassified operational challenges, reducing the barrier to entry for non-traditional contractors who lack the institutional knowledge to identify requirements.

### The AI Assurance and Safety Act

**Purpose**: To ensure the safe, ethical, and effective deployment of Artificial Intelligence in defense systems.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **TEVV Standards**: Mandates the establishment of rigorous Testing, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation (TEVV) standards for all military AI models, tailored to risk levels.
2. **Red Teaming**: Requires continuous "red teaming" of AI systems to identify vulnerabilities, bias, and failure modes before and during deployment.
3. **Digital Infrastructure**: Funds the creation of a "Joint AI Data Foundry" to provide curated, secure training data for AI development across the services.
4. **Ethical Guidelines**: Codifies the DoD's AI Ethical Principles into law and requires an "AI Ethics Impact Assessment" for all lethal autonomous systems.
5. **Workforce Training**: Mandates AI literacy training for all senior leaders (General/Flag officers and SES).

**Draft Text**:

```text
[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To establish standards for the testing, evaluation, and ethical use of artificial intelligence in the Department of Defense.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "AI Assurance and Safety Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be a decisive factor in future conflicts, but its deployment carries significant risks of unintended behavior, bias, and escalation.
(2) The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) recommended that the Department of Defense prioritize TEVV to build trust in AI systems.
(3) Current testing infrastructure is insufficient to validate complex, non-deterministic AI models in realistic combat environments.
(4) Maintaining the moral high ground requires strict adherence to ethical principles in the design and use of autonomous weapons.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) TEVV.—The term "TEVV" means Testing, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation.
(2) RED TEAMING.—The term "red teaming" means the practice of rigorously challenging plans, policies, systems, and assumptions by adopting an adversarial approach.
(3) LETHAL AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEM.—The term "lethal autonomous weapon system" means a weapon system that, once activated, can select and engage targets without further intervention by a human operator.

SEC. 4. TEVV STANDARDS AND RED TEAMING.

(a) STANDARDS.—The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer (CDAO), in coordination with the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), shall establish TEVV standards for all AI systems acquired or developed by the Department.
(b) RISK TIERS.—Standards shall be tiered based on the risk profile of the system, with the highest standards applied to lethal systems and safety-critical applications.
(c) RED TEAMING.—The Secretary shall establish a permanent AI Red Team to continuously assess AI systems for vulnerabilities, adversarial attacks, and unintended behaviors.

SEC. 5. JOINT AI DATA FOUNDRY.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish a Joint AI Data Foundry to serve as a centralized repository for curated, labeled, and secure training data.
(b) ACCESS.—The Foundry shall be accessible to all military departments and, where appropriate, to industry and academic partners.

SEC. 6. ETHICAL GUIDELINES AND ASSESSMENTS.

(a) CODIFICATION.—The Department of Defense AI Ethical Principles (adopted February 2020) are hereby codified as the statutory baseline for AI development.
(b) IMPACT ASSESSMENT.—Prior to the fielding of any lethal autonomous weapon system, the Secretary shall conduct an AI Ethics Impact Assessment to ensure compliance with the Law of War and the principles codified in subsection (a).

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The CDAO shall submit an annual report to Congress on the status of AI adoption, TEVV capabilities, and red team findings, including—
    (1) the number of AI systems that have completed TEVV certification, disaggregated by risk tier;
    (2) a summary of red team findings and remediation actions taken;
    (3) the status of the Joint AI Data Foundry, including data sets curated and access requests processed;
    (4) the number and nature of AI Ethics Impact Assessments conducted; and
    (5) recommendations for legislative or regulatory changes.
(b) SAFETY INCIDENTS.—The Secretary shall report any significant safety incidents involving AI systems to the congressional defense committees within 72 hours.
(c) GAO REVIEW.—Not later than 3 years after enactment, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the TEVV standards and Red Team in improving the safety and reliability of military AI systems.

SEC. 8. AI WORKFORCE TRAINING.

(a) SENIOR LEADER TRAINING.—Not later than 1 year after enactment, the Secretary shall establish a mandatory AI literacy program for all general and flag officers and Senior Executive Service personnel. The program shall cover—
    (1) the capabilities and limitations of current AI systems;
    (2) the ethical and legal framework for military AI use;
    (3) adversary AI capabilities and strategies; and
    (4) the implications of AI for force structure, doctrine, and acquisition.
(b) ACQUISITION WORKFORCE.—The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment shall establish an AI and software acquisition certification track within the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) framework, requiring all program managers for AI-enabled systems to complete specialized training.
(c) TECHNICAL WORKFORCE.—The Secretary shall expand the use of direct hire authority under 10 U.S.C. § 9905 for AI and machine learning positions, with a target of hiring not fewer than 500 AI specialists across the Department within 3 years of enactment.
(d) RETENTION.—The Secretary may offer retention bonuses of up to 25 percent of base pay for civilian AI specialists who commit to 3-year service agreements in critical billets identified by the CDAO.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
(1) $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
(2) $550,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
(3) $600,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
(4) $650,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
(5) $700,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: Ensures that AI systems actually work as intended before they are deployed, preventing "snake oil" sales and dangerous failures. Risk tiering prevents a one-size-fits-all approach that would slow low-risk administrative AI.
- **Section 5**: Data is the fuel for AI. A centralized foundry prevents data silos where the Navy has data the Army needs but can't access. Open access to cleared industry and academia accelerates development.
- **Section 6**: Provides a legal framework for the ethical use of AI, addressing public and international concerns about "killer robots." Codifying existing DoD principles gives them legal force without creating new bureaucratic hurdles.
- **Section 8**: Addresses the human capital side of AI adoption. Senior leaders who don't understand AI cannot make sound acquisition or operational decisions. The DAWIA certification track ensures program managers can evaluate AI vendor claims. Direct hire authority and retention bonuses compete with private sector compensation.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish TEVV Standards (proposed rule) | 180 days after enactment | CDAO / DOT&E |
| Publish TEVV Standards (final rule) | 1 year after enactment | CDAO / DOT&E |
| Stand up AI Red Team | 1 year after enactment | CDAO |
| Launch Senior Leader AI Literacy Program | 1 year after enactment | CDAO |
| Joint AI Data Foundry IOC | 18 months after enactment | CDAO |
| DAWIA AI Certification Track operational | 18 months after enactment | OUSD(A&S) |
| First annual report to Congress | 1 year after enactment | CDAO |
| GAO independent assessment | 3 years after enactment | GAO |

**Challenges**:

- **Talent**: Finding enough qualified experts to staff the Red Team and TEVV offices. The same talent pool is in high demand across the private sector, intelligence community, and allied nations.
- **Pace vs. Safety**: Standards must not become so rigid that they slow down innovation. The TEVV process risks becoming the new "Valley of Death" if certification timelines are measured in years rather than months.
- **Senior Leader Buy-In**: Many senior officers view AI literacy training as a distraction from operational priorities. Without command emphasis, the training mandate risks becoming a check-the-box exercise.

**Refinements**:

- Allow for "reciprocity" of testing with trusted allies (e.g., UK, Australia under AUKUS Pillar 2) to speed up fielding and reduce duplicative TEVV costs.
- Create a "fast track" TEVV pathway for AI systems that have already been validated in allied military operations or by accredited commercial testing organizations.
- Establish a CDAO advisory board with private sector AI leaders to ensure standards reflect the state of the art and do not inadvertently exclude cutting-edge approaches.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Defense Innovation Zone Act

**Purpose**: To encourage states to create clusters of defense-tech innovation, leveraging local universities and bases to attract startups and federal funding.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Innovation Zones**: Designates zones near military bases or research universities as "Defense Innovation Zones."
2. **Tax Incentives**: Provides tax credits for startups in these zones that win SBIR/STTR grants (matching federal funds).
3. **Workforce Grants**: Funds state university programs to develop curriculum for defense-relevant technologies (hypersonics, cyber, AI).
4. **Accelerator Support**: Provides funding for local incubators/accelerators that assist companies in navigating DoD regulations.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Defense Innovation Zone Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.
(a) "Defense Innovation Zone" means a geographic area designated by the Department of Commerce.
(b) "Qualified Defense Startup" means a company with fewer than 500 employees that has received a federal SBIR/STTR award.

SECTION 3. DESIGNATION OF ZONES.
(a) The Department of Commerce shall designate zones based on proximity to military installations, research universities, and availability of high-speed broadband.

SECTION 4. TAX INCENTIVES.
(a) A Qualified Defense Startup located in a Zone shall be eligible for a state tax credit equal to 20 percent of any federal SBIR/STTR grant received, up to $100,000 per year.

SECTION 5. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.
(a) There is established a Defense Tech Workforce Grant program to fund curriculum development at state universities in fields including AI, hypersonics, and cybersecurity.

SECTION 6. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: Zone designation targets areas where military installations and research universities already create natural innovation clusters. Proximity to end-users (warfighters) and researchers accelerates technology transition.
- **Section 4**: The 20% state match for federal SBIR/STTR awards provides meaningful additional capital to startups at the critical seed stage without creating a new federal grant bureaucracy.
- **Section 5**: Defense-relevant curriculum development addresses the long-term workforce pipeline problem. Universities in designated zones become feeders for both local defense companies and nearby military installations.

**Challenges**:

- **Interstate Competition**: States may engage in a "race to the bottom" on tax incentives, subsidizing companies that would have located near military bases regardless.
- **Federal Coordination**: State zones must align with federal priorities, but no mechanism ensures DoD input into state designation decisions.

**Refinements**:

- Require state consultation with the nearest military installation commander before designating a zone to ensure alignment with actual defense needs.
- Add a clawback provision for companies that accept tax incentives but fail to maintain defense-sector employment for at least 5 years.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Zone designation criteria published | 90 days after enactment | State Dept. of Commerce |
| First zones designated | 180 days after enactment | State Dept. of Commerce |
| Tax credit program operational | 1 year after enactment | State Revenue Dept. |
| First workforce grants awarded | 1 year after enactment | State Higher Ed. Board |
| Program effectiveness review | 3 years after enactment | State Auditor |

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Defense (OUSD(R&E), OUSD(A&S), CDAO).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **DFARS Update**: Revise the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement to implement the new software budget activity and data rights requirements. Deadline: 1 year. Must include specific provisions defining "machine-readable" and "native format" for data deliverables.
2. **TEVV Protocols**: CDAO must publish detailed technical protocols for AI testing, tiered by risk level, with expedited pathways for low-risk administrative AI and rigorous multi-phase testing for lethal autonomous systems.
3. **Portfolio Management**: DoD Comptroller must issue financial management regulations for the new portfolio budgeting pilot, including transfer request procedures, approval thresholds, and quarterly reporting templates.
4. **Workforce Certification**: OUSD(A&S) must establish DAWIA AI certification requirements, including curriculum, testing standards, and grandfathering provisions for existing program managers.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Funding Withholds**: The Secretary can withhold funds from programs that fail to adopt open architecture standards by the applicable deadline.
- **Certification Denials**: AI systems that fail TEVV or Red Teaming cannot be fielded. The CDAO has effective veto authority over unsafe AI deployments.
- **Congressional Oversight**: Quarterly reports on portfolio transfers ensure funds aren't misused. Transfers above 10% of portfolio value require 30-day advance notification to congressional defense committees.
- **Inspector General Audits**: Biennial IG audits of data rights compliance, with findings reported to Congress and published in unclassified summary form.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

#### Article I vs. Article II: Power of the Purse and Portfolio Budgeting

The portfolio budgeting provision is the most constitutionally significant element of the Innovation Act. Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 provides that "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." Congress has historically exercised this power through detailed line-item appropriations that specify exactly how defense funds may be spent. Portfolio budgeting grants the executive branch transfer authority within congressionally defined mission areas, raising the question of whether this unconstitutionally delegates the appropriations power.

#### Youngstown Framework Application

Justice Jackson's concurrence in *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), provides the governing framework:

- **Category One (Maximum Authority)**: When the President acts pursuant to an express authorization of Congress, executive power is at its zenith. The portfolio budgeting pilot falls here because Congress explicitly authorizes the transfer authority, defines the mission areas, caps transfers at 20%, and requires quarterly reporting. This is a statutory delegation, not an executive seizure.
- **Category Two (Twilight Zone)**: If Congress had been silent on portfolio budgeting and the Secretary simply began transferring funds between programs, this would fall in the zone of concurrent authority with uncertain legitimacy.
- **Category Three (Lowest Ebb)**: If Congress had prohibited portfolio transfers and the executive conducted them anyway, this would face the highest judicial scrutiny. The explicit statutory authorization avoids this category entirely.

The 20% transfer cap and quarterly reporting requirements are critical constitutional guardrails. Without them, portfolio budgeting would more closely resemble an impermissible delegation of the appropriations power.

#### Fourth Amendment: *Carpenter* and AI Surveillance

The Supreme Court's decision in *Carpenter v. United States*, 585 U.S. ___ (2018), has direct implications for the AI Assurance Act. *Carpenter* held that government acquisition of historical cell-site location information constitutes a Fourth Amendment search. The Court recognized that pervasive digital surveillance reveals the "privacies of life" even when individual data points seem innocuous.

The Joint AI Data Foundry and TEVV testing infrastructure will inevitably process data that includes personally identifiable information, communication patterns, and behavioral signatures. The AI Assurance Act addresses this by:

- Limiting the Foundry to curated training data with privacy scrubbing protocols;
- Requiring AI Ethics Impact Assessments before fielding systems that process data about U.S. persons; and
- Prohibiting the use of military AI systems for domestic law enforcement surveillance absent a warrant.

#### Non-Delegation Doctrine

The delegation of TEVV standard-setting to the CDAO raises non-delegation concerns. Under *Gundy v. United States*, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), Congress must provide an "intelligible principle" to guide executive discretion. The AI Assurance Act satisfies this requirement by specifying risk-tiered standards, requiring alignment with existing DoD AI Ethical Principles, and mandating congressional reporting. However, the rapid evolution of AI technology means that the CDAO will exercise substantial discretion in defining what constitutes adequate testing -- a delegation that courts would likely uphold given the technical expertise required, but that Congress should monitor through robust oversight.

#### Appropriations Law

The "Software Appropriation" (BA-8) challenges traditional appropriations law principles of "time, purpose, and amount." The "bona fide needs" rule (31 U.S.C. SS 1502) typically restricts how funds can be used across fiscal years. The Software Budget Activity requires specific statutory language to create an exception, allowing funds to cover the entire software lifecycle without the artificial separation between R&D, procurement, and O&M appropriations. Precedent exists in the National Reconnaissance Office's consolidated budget structure, though that operates under classified authorities.

### Preemption

Federal acquisition regulations generally preempt state laws regarding government contracting under the doctrine of federal field preemption. The State Model Legislation focuses on tax incentives, zoning, and workforce development, which are within state police powers and do not conflict with federal supremacy. To the extent state "Defense Innovation Zones" offer tax incentives to companies that also hold federal contracts, the Anti-Deficiency Act and FAR cost accounting standards may require careful structuring to avoid conflicts.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is primarily enforced through the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) process and the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) reviews. If a program fails to meet the new statutory requirements (e.g., MOSA, TEVV certification), the MDA can halt the program at any milestone gate. The CDAO's certification authority for AI systems creates an additional enforcement checkpoint: no AI system may be fielded without TEVV certification, giving the CDAO effective veto power over unsafe deployments. Judicial review of CISA enforcement actions is available in federal district court under the Administrative Procedure Act.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Legacy" Exemptions** | Programs claim "legacy" status to avoid open architecture rules. | High | Strict sunset on exemptions; require waiver from SecDef. |
| **Portfolio Slush Fund** | PEOs use transfer authority to hide cost overruns on bad programs. | Medium | Cap transfers at 20%; require quarterly reporting. |
| **Data Rights Evasion** | Contractors deliver "data" in proprietary, unusable formats (e.g., PDFs). | High | Mandate "machine-readable" and "native format" delivery. |
| **AI Rebranding** | Programs rebrand traditional software as "AI" to access new funds. | Low | Strict definition of AI in Section 3. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Workforce Skills** | Current acquisition staff lack skills to manage software/AI. | Hiring/Training lag. | Digital workforce training (Section 401). |
| **Cultural Inertia** | Bureaucracy resists new authorities. | Risk aversion. | Leadership emphasis; fire obstructionists. |
| **Infrastructure** | Lack of cloud/compute at the tactical edge. | Hardware limits. | Invest in edge compute (separate legislation). |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Annual Review**: GAO review of the Portfolio Budgeting pilot after 2 years to assess abuse, including analysis of whether transfer authority was used to sustain failing programs rather than accelerate successful ones.
2. **Tech Refresh**: Mandate update of "Emerging Technology" definitions every 2 years to keep pace with innovation, with input from the Defense Science Board and the National Academies.
3. **TEVV Calibration**: Require the CDAO to conduct an annual review of TEVV standards to ensure they reflect the current state of AI capabilities without creating unnecessary barriers to fielding. Findings shall be reported to the congressional defense committees.
4. **Data Rights Audit**: Require the DoD Inspector General to conduct biennial audits of compliance with the open architecture and data rights mandates, identifying programs that have obtained waivers and assessing whether those waivers remain justified.

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Interagency Coordination**: The Innovation Act distributes authorities across OUSD(R&E), OUSD(A&S), the DoD Comptroller, and DIU. The AI Assurance Act adds the CDAO, DOT&E, and the Defense Science Board. Without a clear coordination mechanism, these offices may issue conflicting guidance or create duplicative processes. The Deputy Secretary of Defense should serve as the integration authority.
- **Classification vs. Innovation**: Many of the AI applications with the greatest military value involve classified data, but the best AI talent and tools are in the unclassified commercial sector. The legislation must be paired with aggressive classification reform to ensure that the Joint AI Data Foundry can provide useful training data to cleared commercial partners without over-classifying routine operational data.
- **Acquisition Workforce Capacity**: The existing acquisition workforce is trained in hardware procurement, not software development or AI evaluation. Even with the DAWIA certification track, the cultural and skill transformation required will take years. In the interim, the Department risks applying old-paradigm oversight to new-paradigm technologies.
- **International Dimensions**: Allied nations are developing parallel AI safety frameworks (the EU AI Act, UK AI Safety Institute). Failure to harmonize U.S. military AI standards with allied frameworks will impede interoperability and co-development under AUKUS Pillar 2 and NATO's AI strategy.
- **Ethical Framework Durability**: Codifying the 2020 DoD AI Ethical Principles into statute creates rigidity. If the international consensus on AI ethics evolves (as it likely will as the technology matures), amending a statute is far slower than updating a policy directive. The 3-year review provision partially mitigates this but may not be sufficient.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Portfolio Budgeting Pilot**: Sunsets after 5 years unless reauthorized by Congress. The GAO mid-term review at 30 months provides the evidentiary basis for a reauthorization decision. If the pilot demonstrates improved technology fielding speed without misuse of transfer authority, Congress should expand it to additional mission areas.
- **Technology Transition Fund**: Authorized indefinitely but subject to annual appropriations. The fund's effectiveness should be measured by the number of technologies transitioned to Programs of Record, not merely by dollars obligated.
- **TEVV Standards**: The CDAO must update TEVV standards annually to reflect the pace of AI development. Failure to update within 18 months triggers automatic congressional notification and a mandatory briefing.
- **AI Ethics Framework**: Review of codified ethical guidelines every 3 years, with input from the National Academies, allied partners, and civil society organizations. If the review identifies material divergence between codified principles and evolving international norms, the CDAO shall submit recommended statutory amendments.
- **DIU Authorities**: Congress should conduct oversight hearings on DIU effectiveness every 2 years to assess whether independent hiring and contracting authorities are producing measurable improvements in commercial technology adoption.
