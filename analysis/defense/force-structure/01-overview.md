# Force Structure: Overview

## Overview

Force structure -- the size, composition, and organization of the U.S. military -- is the most consequential decision in defense policy. It determines what missions the nation can credibly undertake, what risks it can manage, and what it will spend on national defense for decades. The United States currently maintains approximately 1.3 million active-duty service members, 800,000 reserve component personnel, and a civilian workforce of over 750,000, organized across six armed services and eleven combatant commands. This force is the product of strategic choices made over decades, from the post-Cold War drawdown to the post-9/11 expansion, and it is now being re-evaluated in the context of great power competition with China and Russia.

The central challenge is a persistent mismatch between strategy and resources. The 2022 National Defense Strategy identifies China as the "pacing challenge" and Russia as an "acute threat," while simultaneously requiring the military to address terrorism, maintain freedom of navigation, reassure allies, and respond to humanitarian crises. The current force is widely assessed as too small for its stated strategy. The bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission warned in 2018 that the U.S. military "might struggle to win, or perhaps lose" a war against China or Russia, and that a simultaneous conflict with both would pose "grave risks." Yet increasing the force is constrained by recruiting shortfalls, fiscal limits, and the political difficulty of cutting legacy programs to fund new capabilities.

Force structure reform requires confronting difficult tradeoffs: between quantity and quality, between active and reserve forces, between forward presence and surge capacity, between legacy platforms and emerging technologies, and between the services' institutional preferences and joint warfighting requirements.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of U.S. military force structure:

- **Force Sizing**: How large the military should be and what strategic framework should drive sizing decisions (one-war, two-war, great power competition models).
- **Active-Reserve-Guard Balance**: The Total Force Policy and the allocation of roles between active duty, Reserve, and National Guard components.
- **Service-Level Force Structure**: Army brigade combat teams, Navy fleet size, Air Force squadrons, Marine Corps force design, and Space Force organization.
- **Readiness**: The relationship between force size and readiness, including training, equipment maintenance, and deployment tempo.
- **Recruiting and Retention**: The sustainability of the All-Volunteer Force in a competitive labor market.
- **Basing and Posture**: The global distribution of forces and the domestic base structure.
- **Technology and Force Design**: How emerging technologies (autonomous systems, AI, precision weapons) should reshape force structure.

| Army Brigade Combat Teams | ~31 (active) | Army, 2024 |
| Annual Defense Budget (FY2024) | ~$886 billion | DoD, 2024 |
| Recruiting Shortfall (FY2023) | ~41,000 across all services | DoD IG, 2024 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Strategy vs. Resources**: The National Defense Strategy requires the military to deter China, deter Russia, counter terrorism, and maintain global presence simultaneously. The current force is not sized for this strategy, and the budget is insufficient to close the gap without major tradeoffs.
- **Quantity vs. Quality**: Fewer but more capable platforms (e.g., F-35s replacing F-16s) can be more effective per unit but create a smaller force that cannot be in as many places at once and is less resilient to attrition.
- **Active vs. Reserve**: Active forces are more ready but more expensive. Reserve and Guard forces are cheaper to maintain but take longer to deploy. The balance between them determines how quickly the nation can respond to a crisis versus how much it spends in peacetime.
- **Legacy vs. Future**: Each dollar spent sustaining Cold War-era platforms (M1 tanks, carrier-based aviation) is a dollar not invested in emerging capabilities (autonomous systems, long-range precision fires, space-based sensors). But legacy platforms have proven combat utility, while future capabilities are unproven.
- **End Strength vs. Readiness**: A larger force that is poorly trained and under-equipped may be less effective than a smaller, fully ready force. The services have historically chosen end strength over readiness during budget squeezes, leading to hollow force problems.
- **Service Equities vs. Joint Requirements**: Each service has institutional incentives to protect its traditional force structure (the Army wants brigades, the Navy wants carriers, the Air Force wants fighters). These may not align with what joint commanders actually need for combined operations.

## Key Questions

1. Should the U.S. military be sized for a single great power conflict, simultaneous conflicts, or a broader range of contingencies?
2. Can the All-Volunteer Force sustain the end strength the strategy demands, or are structural reforms (or a return to selective service) necessary?
3. How should autonomous systems, AI, and unmanned platforms change the force mix, and how quickly can the services adapt?
4. Is the current balance between active and reserve components optimal, and should more missions be shifted to the reserve component?
5. What is the right size of the Navy fleet to maintain global presence while preparing for a potential conflict in the Western Pacific?
6. How should the BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure) process be reformed to eliminate excess infrastructure and free resources for modernization?

## Vision of Success

A successful force structure policy would:

- **Match Strategy to Resources**: The size and composition of the military are explicitly linked to the National Defense Strategy through a rigorous, transparent force-sizing framework that Congress can oversee and the public can understand.
- **Sustain a Ready Force**: Every unit in the force is trained, equipped, and manned to deploy on its required timeline, with no "hollow" units that exist on paper but cannot fight.
- **Optimize the Total Force**: Active duty, Reserve, and National Guard forces are allocated missions based on strategic requirements and cost-effectiveness, not bureaucratic inertia or political convenience.
- **Adapt to Technology**: The force structure evolves to incorporate autonomous systems, AI-enabled decision-making, and distributed operations, reducing dependence on expensive manned platforms where appropriate.
- **Recruit and Retain Talent**: The military attracts and retains the talent it needs through competitive compensation, quality of life, and a compelling sense of purpose, without resorting to lowered standards.
- **Maintain Political Sustainability**: Force structure decisions reflect a durable bipartisan consensus on defense priorities, insulated from the annual appropriations cycle and short-term political pressures.
