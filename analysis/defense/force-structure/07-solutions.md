# Force Structure: Solutions

Reforming U.S. military force structure requires addressing the fundamental mismatch between strategy, resources, and force design. The solutions below are organized around six pillars: strategic force sizing, Total Force optimization, recruiting and retention reform, technology-enabled force design, base realignment, and institutional reform.

---

## 1. Establish a Rigorous Force-Sizing Framework

**A. Link Force Structure to Strategy Through a Quadrennial Force Structure Review**

- **Description**: Require the Secretary of Defense to conduct a Quadrennial Force Structure Review (QFSR) that explicitly sizes the force to the National Defense Strategy. The review would model required force structure against specific warfighting scenarios, identify gaps, and present Congress with options and associated costs.
- **Implementation**: Mandate the QFSR by statute, with CBO and GAO independent cost estimates required. The review would be submitted to Congress alongside the President's Budget Request, creating a direct link between strategy, force structure, and funding.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Ends the practice of sizing the force to the budget rather than the strategy. Creates transparency and accountability by forcing explicit acknowledgment of the risks accepted when the budget does not fully fund the recommended force.

**B. Adopt a "1+2" Force-Sizing Construct**

- **Description**: Replace the vague and contested force-sizing constructs of recent decades with a clear "1+2" framework: the force must be able to fight and win one major conflict (e.g., against China in the Western Pacific) while simultaneously deterring a second adversary (e.g., Russia in Europe) and maintaining essential counterterrorism and presence operations globally.
- **Implementation**: Use the QFSR to define the specific force requirements for each scenario, including pre-positioned equipment, forward-deployed forces, and surge timelines. Publish unclassified summaries so that Congress and the public can evaluate the adequacy of the force.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Provides a transparent, defensible basis for force-sizing decisions. Prevents the services from inflating requirements for budget purposes while also preventing unrealistic assumptions about what a smaller force can accomplish.

## 2. Optimize the Total Force: Active-Reserve Rebalancing

**A. Reform the Total Force Policy**

- **Description**: Update the Total Force Policy to reflect post-9/11 realities. The Guard and Reserve should not be a "strategic reserve" held back for major war or an "operational reserve" deployed routinely, but a "tiered readiness reserve" with units at specified readiness levels matched to strategic timelines.
- **Implementation**: Establish three tiers: Tier 1 (enhanced readiness -- deployable within 30 days, at near-active readiness); Tier 2 (standard readiness -- deployable within 90 days, requiring limited post-mobilization training); Tier 3 (strategic reserve -- deployable within 180+ days, maintained at lower readiness for surge capacity).
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates predictability for Guard and Reserve members and their employers. Reduces the cost of maintaining forces at high readiness when they are not needed for near-term contingencies. Ensures that the most critical reserve units receive adequate funding and training.

**B. Shift Appropriate Missions to the Reserve Component**

- **Description**: Identify missions that do not require permanent active-duty presence and transfer them to the Guard or Reserve. Candidates include: cyber operations, civil affairs, military police, medical units, logistics, and certain air sovereignty missions.
- **Implementation**: Conduct a comprehensive "mission-suitability analysis" that evaluates each mission against criteria including response timeline, training intensity, equipment requirements, and deployment frequency. Transfer missions where reserve component execution is feasible and cost-effective.
- **Anticipated Impact**: CBO estimates that transferring units from the active component to the reserve component saves approximately 40-60% of personnel costs per unit. Shifting appropriate missions frees active-duty end strength for roles that require full-time readiness while leveraging the reserve component's cost advantage.

## 3. Recruiting and Retention Reform

**A. Military Compensation Modernization**

- **Description**: Overhaul military compensation to be competitive with private-sector alternatives for the demographics the military needs to recruit.
- **Implementation**:
    - Increase basic pay for junior enlisted (E-1 through E-4) by 15-20% to close the gap with civilian entry-level wages.
    - Expand targeted bonuses for critical specialties (cyber, intelligence, maintenance, medical) using real-time labor market data.
    - Reform the housing allowance (BAH) to reflect actual local housing costs, particularly in high-cost areas.
    - Create a "GI Bill Plus" that provides enhanced education benefits (including debt-free college during service) as a recruiting incentive.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Addresses the most frequently cited barrier to enlistment (compensation) without fundamental changes to the AVF model.

**B. Expand the Eligible Population**

- **Description**: Reduce the barriers that currently exclude 77% of 17-24-year-olds from military service.
- **Implementation**:
    - Establish a "Future Soldier Preparatory Course" (the Army's pilot program) across all services, providing candidates who fail initial fitness or academic standards with a pathway to qualification.
    - Modernize medical and moral waiver standards to reflect current science (e.g., many disqualifying conditions like mild asthma or childhood ADHD are no longer medically relevant to military service).
    - Expand ROTC and Junior ROTC presence in underrepresented communities, particularly urban areas and regions with low military propensity.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Expands the recruiting pool without lowering standards for service. The Army's Future Soldier Preparatory Course has already demonstrated success, qualifying approximately 95% of participants who enter the program.

**C. Improve Quality of Life**

- **Description**: Address the non-monetary factors that drive attrition and reduce propensity to serve.
- **Implementation**:
    - Invest $10 billion over 5 years in military housing, childcare, and spouse employment programs.
    - Implement deployment predictability reforms, including hard caps on deployment length and guaranteed dwell time.
    - Expand mental health resources and reduce stigma through command climate reforms.
    - Modernize assignment processes to give service members more control over their career trajectories.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Improves retention rates (which are more cost-effective than recruiting), enhances family readiness, and makes military service more attractive to potential recruits.

## 4. Technology-Enabled Force Design

**A. Accelerate Autonomous Systems Integration**

- **Description**: Aggressively integrate unmanned and autonomous systems into the force structure to multiply the effectiveness of human forces.
- **Implementation**:
    - The Navy's plan for unmanned surface and subsurface vessels should be funded and accelerated, with a goal of 150+ unmanned vessels by 2035.
    - The Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program should be fielded in operational squadrons by 2028, pairing autonomous wingmen with manned fighters.
    - The Army should field autonomous logistics vehicles and unmanned reconnaissance systems at the brigade level.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Unmanned systems can perform high-risk missions (mine clearance, ISR, forward resupply) without risking human lives. They also reduce the personnel demand of the force, partially offsetting recruiting shortfalls.

**B. Invest in Distributed Operations**

- **Description**: Redesign force structure for distributed, survivable operations rather than concentrated formations that are vulnerable to precision strike.
- **Implementation**: Fund the Marine Corps' Force Design 2030 vision, the Army's Multi-Domain Task Forces, and the Air Force's Agile Combat Employment concept. These require smaller, more mobile units that can operate independently, disperse to avoid detection, and mass effects through networked fires.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Improves survivability against peer competitors with precision strike capabilities. Reduces dependence on large, expensive, and vulnerable platforms (e.g., aircraft carriers in contested waters).

## 5. Base Realignment

**A. Authorize a New BRAC Round**

- **Description**: Congress should authorize a new Base Realignment and Closure round to eliminate the estimated 20-25% excess infrastructure capacity.
- **Implementation**: Pass BRAC authorization legislation with enhanced community transition assistance (job retraining, economic development grants, environmental remediation). Ensure the BRAC Commission uses transparent, strategy-driven criteria.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Previous BRAC rounds save approximately $12 billion annually. A new round could save an additional $2-5 billion per year, funding that can be redirected to readiness and modernization.

**B. Consolidate Overseas Basing**

- **Description**: Rationalize the overseas base network to focus on theaters of strategic priority (Indo-Pacific, Europe) while reducing legacy presence elsewhere.
- **Implementation**: Negotiate expanded access agreements in the Western Pacific (Philippines, Japan, Australia, Palau) while reducing permanent garrisons in locations that no longer align with strategic priorities. Shift from large permanent bases to smaller, distributed access points.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Improves posture for great power competition while reducing the cost and political complications of large permanent overseas garrisons.

## 6. Institutional Reform

**A. Strengthen Joint Force Requirements**

- **Description**: Give combatant commanders greater influence over force structure decisions to counterbalance service parochialism.
- **Implementation**: Require the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to submit an annual "Joint Force Requirements Assessment" to Congress, independently evaluating whether the services' force structure plans meet combatant commander needs. Give the CJCS budget certification authority for joint priority programs.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates a counterweight to service-centric planning. Ensures that force structure decisions are driven by operational requirements rather than institutional preferences.

**B. Reform the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) System**

- **Description**: The PPBE system, designed in the 1960s, is too slow and rigid for modern force design. Reform it to enable more rapid reallocation of resources.
- **Implementation**: Implement recommendations from the bipartisan PPBE Commission, including streamlining budget categories, increasing reprogramming flexibility, and creating "innovation accounts" that bypass traditional programming timelines.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Enables faster adaptation to changing threats and opportunities. Reduces the 2-3 year lag between identifying a force structure need and funding it.
