# Force Structure: Legislation

## Overview

Force structure legislation operates at the intersection of strategic planning, military organization, and fiscal policy. The current legislative framework -- anchored by Title 10 of the U.S. Code, the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 -- provides the legal architecture for organizing, training, equipping, and sizing the military. However, this framework has significant gaps: there is no statutory requirement to link force structure to strategy, no mechanism to compel force-sizing discipline, no modern framework for managing the active-reserve balance, and inadequate tools for addressing the recruiting crisis that threatens the sustainability of the All-Volunteer Force.

The legislative framework proposed here aims to address these gaps through two complementary federal bills:

1. **The Force Structure Modernization Act** establishes the Quadrennial Force Structure Review, codifies a strategy-driven force-sizing construct, provides authorities for active-reserve rebalancing, and authorizes recruiting and compensation reforms.
2. **The Military Readiness and Accountability Act** creates statutory readiness reporting requirements, imposes deployment tempo limits, establishes unit readiness standards, and creates accountability mechanisms for force readiness.

Together, these bills address the persistent disconnect between strategy and force structure, the hollowness risks created by budget-driven force sizing, and the readiness shortfalls that undermine the combat effectiveness of the force.

Key existing authorities that this legislation builds upon include:

- **Goldwater-Nichols Act (1986)**: Established joint requirements, combatant command authorities, and the Total Force Policy. This legislation strengthens joint force-sizing mechanisms that Goldwater-Nichols enabled but did not mandate.
- **Title 10, U.S.C.**: The statutory basis for military organization, including service responsibilities to "organize, train, and equip." This legislation adds strategic force-sizing requirements on top of existing Title 10 service authorities.
- **National Defense Authorization Act (annual)**: The primary vehicle for setting authorized end strength and military policy. This legislation creates a permanent analytical framework to inform annual NDAA force structure decisions.
- **Base Closure and Realignment Act (1990)**: Established the BRAC process. This legislation does not address BRAC directly but creates the analytical foundation for infrastructure decisions.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for the legislative framework proposed in this file. Congress possesses sufficient authority under existing constitutional provisions:

- **Armies Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 12): "To raise and support Armies." Provides direct authority to establish force-sizing requirements and authorize end-strength levels.
- **Naval Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 13): "To provide and maintain a Navy." Provides authority for fleet-sizing requirements.
- **Rules Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 14): "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." Provides authority for readiness standards, deployment tempo limits, and reporting requirements.
- **Necessary and Proper Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18): Supports creation of the QFSR process, the Force Structure Review Board, and the Joint Readiness Oversight Council as means of carrying out enumerated military powers.
- **Spending Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1): Supports appropriations for recruiting reform, compensation modernization, and reserve component readiness investment.

## Federal Legislation

### The Force Structure Modernization Act

**Purpose**: To require a Quadrennial Force Structure Review linked to the National Defense Strategy, establish a force-sizing construct, authorize active-reserve rebalancing, and reform military recruiting.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Quadrennial Force Structure Review (QFSR)**: Mandates that the Secretary of Defense conduct a comprehensive force structure review every four years, linked to and following the National Defense Strategy. The QFSR must explicitly size the force to the strategy and identify the risk associated with any shortfalls.
2. **Force-Sizing Construct**: Codifies a "1+2" force-sizing standard: the force must be capable of prevailing in one major conflict while deterring a second adversary and maintaining essential global operations.
3. **Active-Reserve Rebalancing Authority**: Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer missions between active and reserve components based on QFSR findings, with Congressional notification and a 120-day review period.
4. **Tiered Readiness Model**: Establishes a three-tier reserve readiness model (Tier 1: 30-day deployable; Tier 2: 90-day deployable; Tier 3: 180+ day deployable) with differentiated funding and training requirements.
5. **Recruiting Reform**: Authorizes a 15% pay increase for E-1 through E-4 grades, expands the Future Soldier Preparatory Course to all services, modernizes medical and moral waiver standards, and establishes a "GI Bill Plus" with enhanced education benefits.
6. **Force Structure Review Board**: Creates a bipartisan, independent board to assess QFSR methodology, validate assumptions, and report to Congress on the adequacy of the recommended force.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To establish a Quadrennial Force Structure Review, reform military force
sizing, authorize active-reserve rebalancing, and modernize military
recruiting for the All-Volunteer Force.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Force Structure Modernization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The National Defense Strategy Commission (2018) warned that United
States military superiority has eroded to a dangerous degree and that the
military might struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against a major
power.
(2) There is no statutory requirement linking military force structure
to the National Defense Strategy, resulting in a persistent mismatch
between strategic commitments and military capacity.
(3) The All-Volunteer Force faces its most significant recruiting
crisis since 1973, with the services collectively missing recruiting
targets by approximately 41,000 in fiscal year 2023.
(4) The reserve component provides approximately 39 percent of total
military capability at approximately 15 percent of the per-capita cost
of active forces, yet there is no modern statutory framework for
optimizing the active-reserve balance.
(5) Only 23 percent of Americans aged 17 to 24 are eligible for
military service without a waiver, creating a structural constraint on
the sustainability of the All-Volunteer Force.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

Structure Review" means the comprehensive review of United States
military force structure required under section 4 of this Act.
(2) FORCE-SIZING CONSTRUCT.--The term "force-sizing construct" means
the strategic framework that defines the military operations the Armed
Forces must be capable of conducting simultaneously.
(3) TIERED READINESS MODEL.--The term "tiered readiness model" means
the three-tier system for categorizing reserve component units by
deployment readiness timelines as established under section 6.
(4) FORCE STRUCTURE REVIEW BOARD.--The term "Force Structure Review
Board" means the independent board established under section 8.

SEC. 4. QUADRENNIAL FORCE STRUCTURE REVIEW.

(a) REQUIREMENT.--The Secretary of Defense shall, every four years,
conduct a comprehensive review of the force structure of the Armed Forces.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--The Secretary of Defense shall establish a tiered
readiness model for reserve component units as follows:
(1) TIER 1 (ENHANCED READINESS).--Units designated as Tier 1 shall
be resourced, trained, and equipped to deploy within 30 days of
mobilization. Tier 1 units shall receive funding at not less than
85 percent of the per-capita rate of comparable active component units.
(2) TIER 2 (STANDARD READINESS).--Units designated as Tier 2 shall
be resourced, trained, and equipped to deploy within 90 days of
mobilization.
(3) TIER 3 (STRATEGIC RESERVE).--Units designated as Tier 3 shall
be maintained as a strategic surge capability, deployable within
180 days of mobilization.
(b) DESIGNATION.--The Secretary of each military department, in
coordination with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, shall designate
reserve component units to tiers based on the Quadrennial Force Structure
Review.

may be a current employee of the Department of Defense or a defense
contractor.
(d) DUTIES.--The Board shall--
(1) review the methodology and assumptions of each Quadrennial Force
Structure Review;
(2) assess whether the recommended force structure is adequate for
the National Defense Strategy;
(3) evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the
recommended force; and
(4) submit a report to Congress within 90 days of each QFSR
submission.

SEC. 9. RECRUITING AND COMPENSATION REFORM.

(a) PAY INCREASE.--Effective October 1 following enactment, the rates
of basic pay for members of the uniformed services in pay grades E-1
through E-4 shall be increased by 15 percent above the rates otherwise
applicable.
(b) FUTURE SOLDIER PREPARATORY COURSE.--Each Secretary of a military
department shall establish a preparatory course program for applicants

(5) $3,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (QFSR)**: This is the centerpiece of the legislation. By requiring a formal, strategy-linked force structure review with independent cost estimates, it ends the practice of sizing the force to the budget rather than the strategy. The CBO cost validation ensures honest accounting.
- **Section 5 (Force-Sizing Construct)**: The "1+2" standard provides a clear, defensible benchmark for Congressional oversight. The annual certification requirement ensures that force-strategy mismatches are formally acknowledged rather than swept under the rug.
- **Section 6 (Tiered Readiness)**: Creates predictability for Guard and Reserve members and their employers while ensuring that the highest-priority reserve units receive adequate funding. The 85% funding floor for Tier 1 units addresses the chronic underfunding that has made many reserve units unable to meet their stated response timelines.
- **Section 9 (Recruiting Reform)**: The 15% junior enlisted pay increase is the single most impactful recruiting tool available. The preparatory course expansion addresses the shrinking eligible population. The GI Bill Plus makes military service a genuine pathway to debt-free education.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Junior enlisted 15% pay increase effective | October 1 following enactment | DoD/Services |
| Medical/moral waiver standards updated | 180 days after enactment | OSD Personnel & Readiness |
| Future Soldier Preparatory Course expanded | 1 year after enactment | Each service |
| Force Structure Review Board constituted | 180 days after enactment | Congressional leadership |
| Tiered readiness model designations complete | 1 year after enactment | Service Secretaries with NGB |
| First QFSR completed and submitted | 12 months after next NDS | Secretary of Defense |
| GI Bill Plus program operational | 18 months after enactment | DoD/VA |
| FSRB report on first QFSR | 90 days after QFSR submission | Force Structure Review Board |

**Challenges**:

- **Service Resistance**: The services will resist external force-sizing requirements that constrain their institutional flexibility. The QFSR's strategy-driven approach may produce force recommendations that conflict with service budget priorities.
- **Cost of Pay Increase**: The 15% junior enlisted pay increase will cost approximately $3-5 billion annually. This must be funded through either additional appropriations or internal offsets, which will create budget competition with other priorities.
- **Reserve Component Politics**: The tiered readiness model will create political friction when some Guard and Reserve units are designated Tier 3, which may be perceived as a downgrade. Governors and state adjutants general will resist any changes perceived as diminishing their Guard forces.

**Refinements**:

- Phase the junior enlisted pay increase over two years (10% in Year 1, 5% in Year 2) to manage budget impact while demonstrating commitment.
- Provide transition assistance for Guard and Reserve units redesignated to lower tiers, including opportunities for individual service members to transfer to higher-tier units.
- Require the QFSR to include an unclassified summary suitable for public release, ensuring democratic accountability for force-sizing decisions.

### The Military Readiness and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To establish statutory readiness reporting requirements, impose deployment tempo limits, create unit readiness standards, and ensure accountability for force readiness.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Readiness Reporting**: Requires the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to submit a quarterly readiness report to Congress, including unit readiness ratings, equipment status, training completion, and personnel fill rates.
2. **Deployment Tempo Limits**: Establishes statutory limits on deployment length and dwell-to-deploy ratios for both active and reserve forces.
3. **Unit Readiness Standards**: Codifies minimum readiness standards for deployable units, including requirements for training, equipment, and personnel.
4. **Joint Readiness Oversight Council**: Establishes a council chaired by the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to monitor readiness across the joint force and recommend resource reallocations.
5. **Readiness Recovery Fund**: Creates a dedicated fund for addressing critical readiness shortfalls identified by the Joint Readiness Oversight Council.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To improve military readiness through reporting requirements, deployment
tempo limits, unit standards, and accountability mechanisms.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Military Readiness and Accountability
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Government Accountability Office has identified military
readiness as a persistent high-risk area for the Department of Defense.
(2) The fatal collisions of the USS Fitzgerald and USS John S. McCain
in 2017 were directly linked to readiness shortfalls caused by
inadequate training, maintenance, and manning.
(3) Sequestration-era budget cuts reduced readiness across all services,
and recovery has been uneven.
(4) Current readiness reporting to Congress is inconsistent, often
classified, and frequently delayed, limiting Congressional oversight.
(5) Extended and unpredictable deployment cycles degrade unit
readiness, harm retention, and impose unsustainable burdens on military
families.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) DEPLOYMENT.--The term "deployment" means the assignment of military
personnel to a location outside the United States, or to a combat zone
or contingency operation within the United States, for a period exceeding
30 consecutive days.
(2) DWELL TIME.--The term "dwell time" means the period between the
end of one deployment and the beginning of the next deployment for a
military unit or individual.
(3) MISSION CAPABLE RATE.--The term "mission capable rate" means the
percentage of time a weapon system or platform is able to perform at
least one of its assigned missions.
(4) JOINT READINESS OVERSIGHT COUNCIL.--The term "Joint Readiness
Oversight Council" means the council established under section 7.

SEC. 4. QUARTERLY READINESS REPORTING.

(a) REQUIREMENT.--The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall submit
to the congressional defense committees a quarterly report on the
readiness of the Armed Forces.
(b) CONTENT.--Each report shall include--
(1) the readiness rating (C-1 through C-4) of each deployable unit
above battalion level, aggregated by service and component;
(2) mission capable rates for each major weapon system, including
aircraft, ships, and ground combat vehicles;
(3) training completion rates against required training events;
(4) personnel fill rates against authorized strength;
(5) equipment on-hand rates against required equipment;
(6) maintenance backlog measured in depot-level maintenance days; and
(7) a comparison of current readiness to the prior quarter and the
same quarter in the prior fiscal year.
(c) FORM.--The report shall be submitted in unclassified form with a
classified annex as necessary.
(d) PUBLIC SUMMARY.--The Chairman shall publish an unclassified summary
of readiness trends not later than 30 days after each quarterly
submission.

SEC. 5. DEPLOYMENT TEMPO LIMITS.

(a) ACTIVE COMPONENT.--
(1) No active component unit shall be deployed for more than
12 consecutive months, except as authorized by the Secretary of
Defense in writing to Congress for extraordinary circumstances.
(2) The minimum dwell-to-deploy ratio for active component units
shall be 1 to 2 (one period of deployment for every two periods at
home station).
(b) RESERVE COMPONENT.--
(1) No reserve component unit shall be involuntarily mobilized for
more than 12 consecutive months in any 5-year period.
(2) The minimum dwell-to-deploy ratio for reserve component units
shall be 1 to 4.
(c) INDIVIDUAL LIMITS.--No individual service member shall be deployed
for more than 24 cumulative months in any 5-year period unless the
member volunteers for additional deployment.
(d) WAIVER AUTHORITY.--The Secretary of Defense may waive the
requirements of this section during a period of national emergency
declared by the President under the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C.
1601 et seq.), with notification to the congressional defense committees
within 48 hours.

SEC. 6. UNIT READINESS STANDARDS.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--The Secretary of Defense shall establish minimum
readiness standards for all deployable units, including--
(1) personnel fill rates of not less than 90 percent of authorized
strength;
(2) completion of all required individual and collective training
events within the 12 months preceding the unit's availability date;
(3) equipment on-hand rates of not less than 90 percent of required
equipment; and
(4) mission capable rates for assigned weapon systems of not less
than 75 percent.
(b) DEPLOYMENT PROHIBITION.--No unit that fails to meet the standards
established under subsection (a) shall be deployed to a combat zone
or contingency operation unless the Secretary of Defense certifies to
Congress that deployment is necessary due to urgent operational
requirements and that the risks of deploying an unready unit have been
assessed and accepted.
(c) READINESS RECOVERY PLANS.--Any unit that falls below the standards
in subsection (a) for two consecutive quarters shall have a readiness
recovery plan approved by its service chief within 60 days.

SEC. 7. JOINT READINESS OVERSIGHT COUNCIL.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established a Joint Readiness Oversight
Council.
(b) CHAIR.--The Council shall be chaired by the Vice Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
(c) MEMBERSHIP.--The Council shall include the Vice Chiefs of each
military service, the Director of the Joint Staff, and a representative
of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and
Readiness.
(d) DUTIES.--The Council shall--
(1) monitor readiness across the joint force using the quarterly
reports required under section 4;
(2) identify critical readiness shortfalls that require immediate
resource reallocation;
(3) recommend to the Secretary of Defense the allocation of
Readiness Recovery Fund resources under section 8; and
(4) submit an annual readiness assessment to Congress.

SEC. 8. READINESS RECOVERY FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established in the Treasury a fund to be
known as the "Readiness Recovery Fund."
(b) PURPOSE.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available for obligation
by the Secretary of Defense, on the recommendation of the Joint
Readiness Oversight Council, to address critical readiness shortfalls
including maintenance backlogs, spare parts procurement, training
facility upgrades, and recruiting and retention incentives.
(c) AUTHORIZATION.--There are authorized to be appropriated to the
Fund--
(1) $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;

(5) $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.
(d) REPROGRAMMING.--Amounts in the Fund may be reprogrammed among
accounts within the Department of Defense with notification to the
congressional defense committees, notwithstanding any other provision
of law regarding reprogramming thresholds.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Quarterly Readiness Reporting)**: Fills a critical oversight gap. Current readiness reporting to Congress is inconsistent and often obscured by classification. Quarterly reports with public summaries create democratic accountability and enable Congress to identify problems before they become crises.
- **Section 5 (Deployment Tempo Limits)**: Addresses the unsustainable deployment cycles that degrade readiness, harm retention, and burden families. The statutory limits create a binding constraint that forces the services to match commitments to capacity rather than stretching a too-small force.
- **Section 6 (Unit Readiness Standards)**: The deployment prohibition for units below minimum standards prevents the repeat of the conditions that led to the 2017 Navy collisions. It forces the services to either resource units properly or acknowledge publicly that they are accepting risk.
- **Section 8 (Readiness Recovery Fund)**: Provides a dedicated, flexible funding mechanism for addressing readiness shortfalls outside the rigid annual appropriations process.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Joint Readiness Oversight Council established | 90 days after enactment | Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs |
| Unit readiness standards promulgated | 180 days after enactment | Secretary of Defense |
| First quarterly readiness report submitted | First full quarter after enactment | Chairman, Joint Chiefs |
| First public readiness summary published | 30 days after first quarterly report | Chairman, Joint Chiefs |
| Deployment tempo limits effective | January 1, 2027 | All services |
| Readiness Recovery Fund operational | October 1, 2027 | OSD Comptroller |
| First annual JROC readiness assessment | 1 year after enactment | Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs |

**Challenges**:

- **Operational Flexibility**: Deployment tempo limits may constrain military flexibility during crises. The waiver authority addresses this but could become routine, undermining the limits.
- **Classification Tensions**: The services will argue that detailed readiness data is too sensitive for unclassified reporting. The legislation addresses this through classified annexes, but there is a genuine tension between transparency and security.
- **Readiness Fund Oversight**: A flexible fund without strong guardrails could be used for purposes beyond readiness. The JROC recommendation requirement provides a check, but Congressional appropriators may resist a fund that bypasses their normal control.

**Refinements**:

- Add a "readiness tax" provision requiring that any new operational commitment (deployment, exercise, or mission) include a readiness impact assessment before approval.
- Establish independent readiness audits by the DoD Inspector General to validate service self-reporting, which has historically been unreliable.
- Create a "readiness dashboard" publicly accessible online, updated quarterly, showing trends in mission capable rates, personnel fill, and training completion.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State National Guard Readiness Act

**Purpose**: To ensure that state National Guard forces are adequately resourced and ready to perform both their federal and state missions, including domestic emergency response.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] National Guard Readiness Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.
The Legislature finds:
(a) The [State] National Guard serves a dual mission: federal military
readiness and state emergency response.
(b) Federal force structure decisions, including tiered readiness
designations, may affect the Guard's ability to respond to state
emergencies.
(c) The State has a compelling interest in ensuring that its Guard
forces are trained, equipped, and available for domestic emergencies.

SECTION 3. STATE READINESS SUPPLEMENT.
(a) The Adjutant General shall assess the readiness of [State] National
Guard units for state emergency response missions annually.
(b) The Governor may authorize state funding supplements to ensure
that Guard units designated as Tier 2 or Tier 3 under federal law
maintain sufficient readiness for state emergency response missions.
(c) State readiness supplements shall be used for:
(1) Emergency response training above federal minimums;
(2) Equipment maintenance for state mission-essential items;
(3) Communication interoperability with state and local first
responders; and
(4) Recruitment and retention incentives for critical specialties.

SECTION 4. EMPLOYER SUPPORT.
(a) [State] employers with 50 or more employees shall provide not
less than 15 days of paid military leave per year for employees who
are members of the National Guard or Reserves, in addition to leave
required under USERRA.
(b) Employers who provide additional military leave beyond the
requirement of subsection (a) shall receive a state tax credit
equal to 50 percent of the wages paid during such additional leave.

SECTION 5. ANNUAL REPORT.
The Adjutant General shall submit an annual report to the Governor
and Legislature on the readiness status of the [State] National
Guard, including federal readiness ratings, state supplement
utilization, recruiting and retention trends, and domestic response
capability assessments.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3** ensures that federal tiered readiness designations do not leave Guard units unable to perform state emergency response missions. States have a direct interest in maintaining Guard readiness for hurricanes, wildfires, civil unrest, and other domestic emergencies.
- **Section 4** addresses a key recruiting and retention barrier: employer resistance to military leave. The paid leave mandate with a tax credit incentive balances employer costs with the state's need for a ready Guard force.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), with execution through the military departments and the Joint Staff.

**Supporting Agencies**: Congressional Budget Office (QFSR cost estimates), Government Accountability Office (readiness audits), DoD Inspector General (compliance), National Guard Bureau (reserve component coordination), Office of Personnel Management (civilian workforce implications).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **QFSR Methodology**: OSD Policy shall issue a directive establishing the methodology, timeline, and deliverables for the Quadrennial Force Structure Review, including scenario development, force modeling, and independent cost estimation procedures.
2. **Tiered Readiness Standards**: OSD Personnel & Readiness shall issue a directive defining the specific training, equipment, personnel, and funding standards for each readiness tier, in coordination with the National Guard Bureau.
3. **Unit Readiness Standards**: The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs shall issue a CJCS instruction codifying minimum readiness standards for deployable units, including the criteria for deployment prohibition certification.
4. **Deployment Tempo Tracking**: OSD shall establish a unified deployment tracking system to monitor compliance with tempo limits across all services and components.
5. **Readiness Recovery Fund Procedures**: OSD Comptroller shall issue procedures for Readiness Recovery Fund allocation, obligation, and reporting, including JROC recommendation processes.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **QFSR Compliance**: If the Secretary of Defense fails to submit the QFSR within the statutory timeline, 10% of OSD operations and maintenance funding shall be withheld until submission.
- **Readiness Reporting**: Failure to submit quarterly readiness reports triggers a mandatory hearing before the relevant Armed Services Committee, with the service chief(s) responsible for the delayed report required to testify.
- **Deployment Prohibition**: Any deployment of a unit below minimum readiness standards without the required SecDef certification is subject to DoD Inspector General investigation and Congressional notification.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

#### Congress's Authority Over Military Organization

Congress's authority to legislate force structure requirements is firmly grounded in Article I, Section 8, which grants Congress the power to "raise and support Armies," "provide and maintain a Navy," and "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." The Supreme Court has consistently recognized Congress's broad authority in this domain. In *Rostker v. Goldberg*, 453 U.S. 57 (1981), the Court deferred to Congress's judgment on military personnel policy, noting that "the Constitution itself requires such deference to congressional choice."

The QFSR requirement represents a valid exercise of Congress's military governance power. While the President, as Commander in Chief (Article II, Section 2), has authority over operational decisions, Congress has plenary power over the organization, size, and funding of the military. The QFSR does not direct military operations; it requires a planning process that informs Congressional budget decisions -- a function squarely within Congress's appropriations and oversight authority.

#### Deployment Tempo Limits and Commander in Chief Authority

The deployment tempo limits in the Military Readiness and Accountability Act may raise questions about encroachment on the President's Commander in Chief authority. However:

- **Precedent**: Congress has historically imposed constraints on military personnel policy, including deployment limits. The Weinberger-Nichols provisions limiting Reserve mobilization to 270 days (later extended to 365 days by the National Defense Authorization Act) were upheld as valid exercises of Congressional authority.
- **Waiver Authority**: The waiver provision for national emergencies preserves the President's ability to respond to genuine crises, addressing the constitutional concern about operational flexibility.
- **Raising vs. Employing**: The deployment limits regulate the conditions under which forces are *raised and maintained* (Article I power), not how they are *employed* in specific operations (Article II power). This distinction, recognized in *Ex parte Milligan*, 71 U.S. 2 (1866), and subsequent cases, supports Congressional authority.

#### Due Process for Force Structure Changes

Active-reserve rebalancing and tiered readiness designations affect the careers and expectations of service members and Guard/Reserve units. Due process concerns are addressed through:

- The 120-day Congressional notification period for mission transfers;
- The requirement for detailed justification including impact assessments;
- The 5% annual cap on Selected Reserve end-strength reductions;
- Individual service members' existing rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) and military administrative regulations.

### Preemption

The state model legislation on National Guard readiness supplements operates in a domain of shared federal-state authority. The National Guard's dual-status (state militia under governor's authority in peacetime, federal force when mobilized) creates a complex preemption landscape:

- **Federal Supremacy Over Military Readiness**: When Guard units are performing federal missions or training under federal funding, federal readiness standards preempt conflicting state requirements. The state readiness supplement operates only in the state-mission space.
- **USERRA Floor**: The federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act establishes a floor for employer obligations to service members. State legislation may exceed but not reduce USERRA protections. The model legislation's 15-day paid leave mandate exceeds USERRA's requirement (unpaid leave) and is permissible under existing preemption principles.

### Enforcement and Judicial Review

The Force Structure Review Board's assessments and the QFSR itself are advisory to Congress and do not create judicially enforceable rights. However:

- Service members affected by force structure changes (involuntary separation, unit deactivation) retain access to administrative remedies through the Board for Correction of Military Records and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.
- Deployment tempo violations may be raised through the military justice system or the DoD Inspector General.
- Readiness Recovery Fund expenditures are subject to standard appropriations law oversight and GAO audit.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **QFSR Scenario Gaming** | The services could manipulate QFSR warfighting scenarios to produce force requirements that match their institutional preferences rather than genuine strategic needs. | High |
| **Readiness Rating Inflation** | Commanders have historically inflated unit readiness ratings (C-ratings) to avoid scrutiny. Self-reported readiness data may not reflect actual capability. | High |
| **Deployment Tempo Definitional Evasion** | The definition of "deployment" (30+ days outside the U.S.) could be evaded through rotational deployments of 29 days, temporary duty assignments, or reclassification of deployments as "training exercises." | Medium |
| **Tier Designation Shopping** | Guard and Reserve units with political connections may lobby for higher-tier designations (and associated funding) than their strategic priority warrants. | Medium |
| **Waiver Abuse** | The deployment tempo waiver authority for "national emergencies" could be invoked routinely, undermining the statutory limits -- as has occurred with other emergency authorities. | High |
| **Readiness Fund Diversion** | The Readiness Recovery Fund's flexible reprogramming authority could be used to fund priorities unrelated to readiness, particularly if the JROC recommendation process is weakened. | Medium |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Industrial Base Constraints** | The legislation cannot solve shipyard and manufacturing capacity limits that prevent building the recommended force within realistic timelines. | Decades of underinvestment in defense industrial infrastructure and workforce; consolidation of the defense industrial base to a small number of prime contractors. |
| **Recruiting Structural Limits** | Compensation and policy reforms may be insufficient if the eligible population continues to shrink due to obesity, substance use, and educational deficiency trends. | Broader public health and education challenges beyond the scope of defense legislation. |
| **Political Sustainability** | Force structure reforms requiring sustained investment over decades are vulnerable to changing political priorities, continuing resolutions, and sequestration-type budget constraints. | The annual appropriations cycle and the absence of multi-year defense budgeting authority for personnel and readiness accounts. |
| **Service Culture Change** | Legislation cannot directly change the service cultures that drive parochialism and resistance to joint force optimization. | Institutional identities built over decades; officer promotion systems that reward service loyalty over joint thinking. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **QFSR Scenario Validation**: Require the Force Structure Review Board to independently validate QFSR scenarios using red-team analysis and external wargaming. Require CBO to produce an independent alternative force-sizing analysis as a comparison point.
2. **Independent Readiness Audits**: Direct the DoD Inspector General to conduct annual unannounced readiness audits of a random sample of units across all services, comparing reported C-ratings to actual capability. Publish audit findings in unclassified form.
3. **Deployment Tracking Reform**: Define "deployment" broadly to include any assignment to a theater of operations, contingency operation, or combat zone regardless of duration. Track cumulative time away from home station rather than individual deployment length.
4. **Tier Designation Appeals**: Establish a formal appeals process for tier redesignation, with decisions made by the QFSR process rather than individual political interventions. Require the National Guard Bureau to certify that designations are based on strategic criteria.
5. **Waiver Accountability**: Require that any deployment tempo waiver be accompanied by a written risk assessment from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, submitted to Congress and published in unclassified summary form. Limit waiver duration to 180 days with mandatory Congressional reauthorization.
6. **Readiness Fund Audit**: Require quarterly GAO audits of Readiness Recovery Fund expenditures to ensure alignment with JROC recommendations and readiness purposes. Establish a clawback provision for funds used for non-readiness purposes.

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Interagency Coordination**: The QFSR requires coordination across OSD Policy, OSD Comptroller, the Joint Staff, the service staffs, the National Guard Bureau, and CBO. Without strong leadership from the Secretary of Defense, the process risks becoming a bureaucratic exercise that ratifies the status quo.
- **Classification Barriers**: Genuine readiness data is often classified, creating tension with the transparency goals of the legislation. The classified-annex-with-public-summary approach is a reasonable compromise but requires active management to prevent the classified annex from swallowing the unclassified report.
- **Speed of Implementation**: The QFSR's four-year cycle may be too slow for a rapidly changing threat environment. The legislation should be supplemented with authorities for mid-cycle updates when significant strategic changes occur.
- **Workforce Implications**: Active-reserve rebalancing may require involuntary separations, transfers, or reclassifications that affect career expectations. Robust transition assistance and career counseling must accompany structural changes.
- **Coalition Fragility**: The political coalition required to pass these bills -- defense hawks who want a larger force, fiscal hawks who want efficiency, and reformers who want accountability -- is inherently unstable. Each group will support different provisions and resist others.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **QFSR**: Permanent requirement; no sunset. Subject to reauthorization review every 8 years (two QFSR cycles) with GAO assessment of effectiveness.
- **Force Structure Review Board**: The Board's authorization shall be reviewed after three QFSR cycles (12 years) to assess whether the independent review function remains necessary.
- **Deployment Tempo Limits**: Permanent, but the specific ratio thresholds shall be reviewed every 4 years as part of the QFSR to ensure they reflect operational realities.
- **Readiness Recovery Fund**: Subject to 5-year reauthorization. SecDef shall submit a reauthorization justification to Congress including fund utilization data, readiness impact assessment, and comparison with alternative funding mechanisms.
- **Recruiting Reforms**: The 15% pay increase is permanent (incorporated into pay tables). The Future Soldier Preparatory Course and GI Bill Plus are authorized for 5 years with reauthorization contingent on effectiveness metrics (accession quality, completion rates, retention impact).
