# Force Structure: What You Can Do

Force structure decisions may seem like the exclusive domain of Pentagon planners and Congressional committees, but they are ultimately political decisions made by elected officials responsive to public pressure. Citizens have a meaningful role in shaping these outcomes through informed engagement, advocacy, and community action.

## 1. For Individuals: Educate Yourself and Engage

Understanding force structure requires engaging with defense policy beyond headlines. Individual citizens can make a difference by becoming informed advocates.

- **Follow the Defense Budget**: The annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and defense appropriations bills are where force structure decisions are made. Track key provisions related to end strength, weapons programs, and base closures through CBO and CRS reports (available free online).
- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call or write your Senators and Representative about defense priorities. Specific, informed constituent communications on defense topics carry significant weight because they are rare. Ask about:
    - Whether they support a new BRAC round to reduce excess base infrastructure.
    - Their position on military recruiting reform and compensation increases.
    - Whether they support the Quadrennial Force Structure Review concept.
- **Attend Town Halls**: Ask your elected officials specific questions about defense priorities. Many members serve on Armed Services or Appropriations committees and will respond to informed constituent questions.
- **Vote on Defense Policy**: Evaluate candidates' defense positions during elections. Look for specifics (not just "strong defense" rhetoric) about how they would size and resource the military.

## 2. For Communities: Support the Military-Civilian Connection

The growing disconnect between the military and civilian society weakens democratic accountability for defense decisions.

- **Support Local Veterans and Military Families**: Volunteer with organizations that assist military families, especially in communities near bases. Strong community support improves retention and reduces the human cost of military service.
- **Engage with Local Guard and Reserve Units**: The National Guard and Reserve are embedded in communities across the country. Attend their community events, learn about their missions, and support employers who accommodate service members' military obligations.
- **Support Military Spouse Employment**: Military spouses face significant employment challenges due to frequent moves. Support legislation and local programs that improve professional license portability and create remote work opportunities for military spouses.
- **If Your Community Hosts a Base**: Engage constructively with BRAC discussions. Support realistic transition planning rather than reflexive opposition to any change. Communities that plan proactively for base realignment tend to recover faster and can turn former military installations into economic assets.

## 3. For Political Engagement: Advocate for Reform

- **Support BRAC Reform**: Advocate for a new BRAC round with robust community transition assistance. The current 20-25% excess base capacity wastes billions annually that could fund readiness and modernization.
- **Push for Total Force Reform**: Advocate for a rational active-reserve balance based on strategic requirements rather than bureaucratic inertia. The reserve component provides essential capability at lower cost.
- **Demand Strategy-Budget Alignment**: Ask elected officials whether the defense budget actually funds the National Defense Strategy. If it does not, demand either more resources or a revised strategy -- not the current practice of accepting unacknowledged risk.
- **Support Recruiting Reform Without Lowering Standards**: Advocate for competitive military pay, expanded preparatory programs, and quality-of-life improvements as alternatives to lowering enlistment standards or considering conscription.
