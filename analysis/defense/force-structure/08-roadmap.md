# Force Structure: Reform Roadmap

Reforming U.S. military force structure is a generational undertaking. The services, Congress, and industry must be aligned through a phased approach that builds political support in the short term, implements structural changes in the medium term, and achieves a fully adapted force in the long term.

---

## Phase 1: Foundations and Quick Wins (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on legislative authorization, analytical groundwork, and reforms that can be implemented within existing authorities.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Pass Force Structure Modernization Act** | Enact legislation mandating the Quadrennial Force Structure Review and establishing the "1+2" force-sizing construct. | Legislation signed into law; DoD begins QFSR planning within 90 days. |
| **2. Launch Recruiting Reform** | Expand Future Soldier Preparatory Course to all services. Implement 15% junior enlisted pay raise. Modernize medical/moral waiver standards. | 10% increase in qualified applicants within 12 months; all services within 5% of authorized end strength. |
| **3. Submit BRAC Request** | SecDef submits formal BRAC authorization request to Congress with updated excess capacity analysis. | Request submitted; Congressional hearings scheduled. |
| **4. Begin Total Force Review** | SecDef commissions comprehensive active-reserve mission suitability analysis across all services. | Review charter signed; initial findings within 12 months. |
| **5. Accelerate Autonomous Systems** | Issue rapid acquisition directives for CCA, unmanned surface vessels, and autonomous logistics vehicles. | First CCA squadron declared operational; two unmanned vessel prototypes in fleet exercises. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Establish the legislative and analytical framework for reform while implementing quick wins in recruiting and compensation that demonstrate commitment.

---

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

This phase implements the major force structure changes identified in Phase 1 analysis, including active-reserve rebalancing, BRAC execution, and force design transformation.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Execute Active-Reserve Rebalance** | Implement tiered readiness model. Transfer identified missions to reserve component. Increase funding for Tier 1 reserve units. | 3-5 mission transfers completed; Tier 1 units meeting readiness benchmarks within 24 months. |
| **2. Conduct BRAC Round** | BRAC Commission completes review and submits recommendations. Congress approves or rejects (no amendments). | Commission recommendations approved; closure/realignment implementation begins. |
| **3. Field New Force Design Concepts** | Marine Littoral Regiments at full operational capability. Army MDTFs expanded to five. Air Force ACE exercises become routine. | All three MLRs operational; two additional MDTFs stood up; ACE demonstrated at wing level. |
| **4. Grow the Fleet** | Increase shipbuilding rate toward 12 ships per year. Invest in shipyard infrastructure (workforce, dry docks, digital tools). | Shipbuilding rate at 10+ per year; submarine build rate at 2.0/year. |
| **5. Implement PPBE Reform** | Replace legacy PPBE system with modernized process per Commission recommendations. | Reprogramming timelines reduced by 50%; innovation accounts operational. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Execute the structural changes that produce a more efficiently sized and distributed force optimized for great power competition.

## Phase 3: Adapted Force (Years 6-10)

This phase realizes the long-term vision of a force that is right-sized, technologically advanced, and strategically aligned.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Achieve Strategy-Resource Balance** | QFSR validates that force structure meets the "1+2" construct at acceptable risk levels. Budget fully funds the recommended force. | QFSR certifies strategy-force alignment; no "significant risk" categories in Chairman's Risk Assessment. |
| **2. Fleet of 350+ Ships** | Navy reaches 350+ battle force ships, including 60+ unmanned vessels. | Fleet count at 350+; unmanned vessels completing independent operations. |
| **3. Human-Machine Teaming at Scale** | Autonomous systems integrated into every combat formation. CCA squadrons operational across the Air Force. | 50+ CCA aircraft operational; every Army BCT has organic unmanned ISR and logistics systems. |
| **4. Sustainable AVF** | All services meeting authorized end strength. Retention rates at target levels. Recruiting pool expanded through preparatory programs and diversified pipelines. | Zero recruiting shortfall for 3 consecutive years; first-term retention above 55%. |
| **5. BRAC Savings Realized** | Closed bases remediated and repurposed. Annual savings from BRAC reinvested in readiness and modernization. | $3-5 billion annual savings validated by GAO; 80% of closed base communities show economic recovery. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: The U.S. military is sized to its strategy, organized for distributed operations, technologically advanced, and sustainable within its budget.

## Success Metrics Summary

| Metric | Current Baseline | Phase 1 Target | Phase 3 Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recruiting Shortfall | ~20,000/year | <10,000/year | Zero |
| Battle Force Ships | ~296 | ~310 | 350+ |
| Active BCT Readiness (C-1/C-2) | ~65% | ~70% | >85% |
| Excess Base Capacity | ~20-25% | BRAC authorized | <5% |
| QFSR Strategy-Force Alignment | N/A (no formal review) | First QFSR completed | Certified alignment |
| Unmanned Systems in Fleet | ~20 prototypes | 50+ in service | 200+ operational |
| Annual BRAC Savings | $0 (no new round) | $0 (implementation) | $3-5 billion/year |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Congressional refusal to authorize BRAC | High | Medium | Build bipartisan support through community transition assistance provisions; link BRAC to readiness funding. |
| Recruiting crisis deepens despite reforms | Medium | High | Develop contingency plans including expanded preparatory programs, lateral entry, and selective service modernization study. |
| Shipyard capacity insufficient for fleet growth | High | High | Begin shipyard investment immediately (Phase 1); explore allied shipyard partnerships (Japan, South Korea). |
| Service resistance to mission transfers | High | Medium | Tie transfers to QFSR findings; ensure receiving reserve units are adequately funded. |
| Autonomous systems technology not mature | Medium | Medium | Maintain parallel development of manned alternatives; pursue incremental deployment rather than revolutionary transformation. |
