# Force Structure: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

Force structure debates are not the result of any single policy failure. They persist because of deep structural tensions built into the American defense establishment -- tensions between strategy and resources, between the services and the joint force, between political incentives and military requirements, and between the demands of current operations and the need to prepare for future wars.

## 1. The Strategy-Resource Mismatch

The most fundamental cause of force structure dysfunction is the persistent gap between the strategy the military is asked to execute and the resources it is given.

- **Strategy Exceeds Capacity**: Every National Defense Strategy since the end of the Cold War has assigned the military more missions than it can simultaneously execute with the force it has. The 2022 NDS requires deterring China, deterring Russia, countering terrorism, maintaining global presence, and assuring allies. The force is not sized for all of these simultaneously.
- **Sizing Construct Dysfunction**: The "two-major-theater-war" construct that anchored force sizing from 1993 to 2017 was never a realistic planning tool -- it was a political compromise to justify a force that was large enough to satisfy the services but small enough to deliver a "peace dividend." The shift to "one-plus" or "one major war with the ability to deter" under recent NDSs has not resolved the fundamental mismatch.
- **Budget-Strategy Disconnect**: The defense budget is set through the political process (annual appropriations, continuing resolutions, sequestration) rather than through a rigorous analysis of what the strategy requires. The result is that the force is sized to the budget rather than the budget being sized to the force.

## 2. Service Parochialism

Each military service has powerful institutional incentives to protect its traditional force structure, even when doing so conflicts with joint requirements or the national strategy.

- **Institutional Identity**: Each service defines itself by its core platforms and formations -- the Army by its divisions and brigades, the Navy by its carriers and submarines, the Air Force by its fighter wings, the Marines by their expeditionary forces. Proposals to reduce these core elements are resisted as existential threats.
- **Budget Competition**: The services compete for shares of the defense budget. Protecting end strength and platform counts is the primary mechanism for justifying budget share. An Army that shrinks from 31 to 24 BCTs will receive a proportionally smaller share of the top line.
- **Congressional Alliances**: Each service cultivates Congressional champions who protect their programs. The "Iron Triangle" of service headquarters, defense industry, and Congressional committees creates a self-reinforcing system that resists structural change.
- **Joint vs. Service Culture**: Despite Goldwater-Nichols, the services retain dominant influence over force structure decisions because they "organize, train, and equip" the force (Title 10 responsibility). Combatant commanders, who actually employ the force in operations, have limited influence over how it is structured.

## 3. Political Constraints on Base Closures and Force Reductions

Force structure decisions have enormous political implications for communities, states, and Congressional districts.

- **BRAC Paralysis**: Congress has not authorized a BRAC round since 2005, despite DoD estimates of 20-25% excess infrastructure capacity. Members of Congress resist BRAC because base closures devastate local economies -- a single base can be the largest employer in a district. Every proposed BRAC round generates bipartisan opposition from affected delegations.
- **Geographic Distribution of Defense Spending**: Military bases, defense industry facilities, and R&D centers are distributed across all 50 states by deliberate political design. This distribution makes every force structure decision a political decision: reducing a weapons program or closing a base affects jobs and votes in specific districts.
- **The "Tyranny of Legacy"**: Existing programs and bases develop political constituencies that outlive their strategic rationale. The M1 Abrams tank production line in Lima, Ohio continues to produce tanks the Army has not requested, because the Congressional delegation protects the jobs. The A-10 Warthog has survived multiple Air Force retirement attempts because its Congressional supporters block the cuts.

## 4. Recruiting Challenges in a Tight Labor Market

The All-Volunteer Force model depends on the military's ability to attract sufficient numbers of qualified volunteers. This assumption is under severe strain.

- **Demographic Headwinds**: The military-eligible population is shrinking due to rising obesity rates (42% of adults, per CDC), substance use, mental health conditions, and declining educational attainment. Only 23% of 17-24-year-olds meet military eligibility requirements without a waiver.
- **Economic Competition**: In a low-unemployment economy, the military competes directly with private employers who can offer higher pay, flexible work arrangements, and no risk of combat deployment. Military starting pay (approximately $24,000/year for an E-1) is below the federal minimum wage in several states when calculated hourly.
- **Cultural Disconnect**: The declining share of Americans with personal or familial connection to military service means fewer young people consider the military as a career option. The geographic concentration of military families in a shrinking number of states and communities reinforces this disconnect.
- **Propensity to Serve**: Survey data consistently show declining interest in military service among young Americans. Factors include negative perceptions of military quality of life, concerns about political use of the military, and competing career opportunities in the tech and services sectors.

## 5. Technology vs. Manpower Tradeoffs

The relationship between technology and force size is a persistent source of debate.

- **The "Quality Over Quantity" Argument**: Proponents argue that advanced technology (precision weapons, autonomous systems, AI-enabled command and control) can offset numerical disadvantage. A smaller force with better technology may be more effective than a larger force with legacy equipment. The Gulf War seemed to validate this thesis.
- **The Attrition Problem**: Critics counter that technology cannot eliminate the need for mass. In a prolonged great power conflict, attrition will consume platforms and people faster than they can be replaced. A "perfect but small" force that cannot absorb losses will fail. Historical analysis of peer conflicts (including the Russia-Ukraine war) shows that mass still matters.
- **The Adaptation Gap**: The services are slow to adopt new technologies due to lengthy acquisition timelines (15-20 years from concept to fielding for major systems), risk-averse testing cultures, and the institutional resistance of communities whose platforms are being replaced.
- **Human-Machine Teaming**: The emerging concept of human-machine teaming -- where autonomous systems augment rather than replace human forces -- could in theory allow a smaller human force multiplied by unmanned systems. But the technology, doctrine, and organizational structures for this are immature.

## 6. Operational Tempo and Force Management

The way the military manages its force creates its own structural problems.

- **Demand Signal**: Combatant commanders consistently request more forces than the military can provide. The "global force management" process that allocates forces to commands is perpetually oversubscribed, creating a gap between demand and supply that drives overextension.
- **Readiness-Modernization Tradeoff**: In constrained budgets, the services face a zero-sum choice between spending on current readiness (training, maintenance, spare parts) and investing in future capabilities (R&D, new platforms). The historical pattern is to sacrifice modernization for near-term readiness, creating a future force structure crisis.
- **Deployment Burden Distribution**: A disproportionate share of deployment burden falls on specific communities -- submariners, special operations forces, intelligence analysts, cyber operators, and maintenance personnel -- creating burnout and retention crises in the most in-demand specialties.

## Causal Chain of Force Structure Dysfunction

    v
Services protect institutional equities, resist restructuring

    v
Budget is sized politically, not strategically

    v
Result: A force that is simultaneously too small for its strategy,
        too expensive for its budget, and too slow to adapt
