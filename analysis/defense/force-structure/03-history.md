# Force Structure: History

## Historical Development

The size and shape of the U.S. military has been determined by an evolving interaction between strategic imperatives, technological change, fiscal constraints, and domestic politics. The history of force structure is a story of rapid mobilization for war followed by demobilization, with persistent debates about how large a standing military a democracy should maintain in peacetime.

### Post-World War II Demobilization (1945-1950)

- **Rapid Drawdown**: The U.S. military shrank from 12.2 million personnel in 1945 to 1.5 million by 1947, the fastest demobilization in American history. Public pressure to "bring the boys home" overwhelmed strategic planners who warned about the emerging Soviet threat.
- **Unification Debate**: The National Security Act of 1947 created the Department of Defense, the National Security Council, the CIA, and the Air Force as a separate service. Fierce inter-service rivalries over roles, missions, and budgets -- particularly between the Navy and the newly independent Air Force -- set the pattern for force structure debates that persist to this day.
- **The "Revolt of the Admirals" (1949)**: Navy leaders publicly opposed the cancellation of a supercarrier in favor of the Air Force's B-36 bomber program. The episode illustrated how force structure decisions are never purely strategic but always involve institutional survival.

### The Cold War Buildup (1950-1968)

- **Korean War Expansion**: The North Korean invasion in 1950 exposed the hollow force created by post-WWII demobilization. The Army scrambled to deploy under-strength, poorly equipped divisions to Korea. Active duty end strength surged from 1.5 million to 3.6 million by 1952.
- **Eisenhower's "New Look"**: President Eisenhower, concerned about the economic costs of maintaining massive conventional forces, adopted the "New Look" strategy in 1953. This relied on nuclear weapons ("massive retaliation") as the primary deterrent, allowing conventional force reductions. Active duty strength was cut to approximately 2.5 million.
- **Flexible Response**: President Kennedy replaced "massive retaliation" with "flexible response," which required a range of conventional and nuclear options. This drove a buildup of conventional forces, particularly Army divisions and Special Forces.
- **Vietnam-Era Expansion**: The Vietnam War drove active-duty end strength to 3.5 million by 1968. The draft provided the manpower, but the war's unpopularity and the inequitable draft system created a domestic political crisis that would permanently reshape the force.

### The All-Volunteer Force and the Post-Vietnam Drawdown (1969-1990)

- **The Gates Commission (1970)**: President Nixon appointed the Gates Commission to study the feasibility of an all-volunteer force. The Commission concluded that a professional military was both feasible and desirable, and recommended ending the draft.
- **End of Conscription (1973)**: The draft ended on July 1, 1973, and the All-Volunteer Force (AVF) was born. Initial years were difficult: recruiting fell short, quality declined, drug use was rampant, and racial tensions were high. Many observers predicted the AVF would fail.
- **The "Hollow Army" (Late 1970s)**: Chief of Staff General Edward "Shy" Meyer publicly warned in 1980 that the Army was a "hollow army" -- units existed on paper but lacked the personnel, equipment, and training to fight effectively. This galvanized the Reagan-era buildup.
- **Reagan-Era Buildup (1981-1989)**: President Reagan oversaw the largest peacetime military expansion in American history. Active duty end strength grew to 2.17 million. The defense budget nearly doubled in real terms between 1980 and 1985. The Army grew to 18 active divisions, the Navy pursued a "600-ship Navy," and the Air Force expanded its tactical fighter wings.
- **Goldwater-Nichols Act (1986)**: The most significant defense reorganization since 1947. The Act strengthened the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, empowered combatant commanders over the services, and established the Total Force Policy as law. It shifted the balance from service-centric to joint-centric planning.

### Post-Cold War Drawdown (1990-2001)

| Year | Active Duty End Strength | Key Event |
|---|---|---|
| 1989 | 2,130,000 | Fall of the Berlin Wall |
| 1991 | 2,043,000 | Gulf War; Soviet Union collapses |
| 1993 | 1,705,000 | Bottom-Up Review: two-major-theater-war standard |
| 1997 | 1,439,000 | Quadrennial Defense Review |
| 2001 | 1,385,000 | September 11 attacks |

- **The "Peace Dividend"**: With the Soviet Union gone, the U.S. cut its military by approximately 35% over a decade. The Army went from 18 to 10 active divisions. The Navy from 546 to 316 ships. The Air Force retired hundreds of aircraft and closed bases.
- **Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)**: Congress authorized five BRAC rounds (1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, 2005) to reduce excess base infrastructure. The rounds closed or realigned over 350 installations and are estimated to save $12 billion annually, but the political pain was severe -- particularly for communities that lost their economic anchors.
- **The Two-Major-Theater-War (2MTW) Standard**: The 1993 Bottom-Up Review established the requirement that the U.S. military be able to fight and win two nearly simultaneous major theater wars (e.g., Korea and the Persian Gulf). This standard anchored force structure planning through the 1990s but was widely criticized as both too ambitious (the force could not actually do it) and too narrow (it did not account for the full range of operations the military was actually conducting).
- **The "Revolution in Military Affairs" (RMA)**: The Gulf War's stunning demonstration of precision-guided munitions, stealth, and network-centric warfare convinced many that technology could substitute for mass. This became the intellectual justification for continued force reductions.

### The Post-9/11 Expansion (2001-2012)

- **Rapid Growth**: The September 11 attacks launched two decades of war that dramatically increased force demands. Army end strength grew from 480,000 to a peak of 570,000. The Marine Corps grew from 172,000 to 202,000. Total active duty peaked at approximately 1.45 million.
- **The "Surge" (2007)**: President Bush ordered a temporary increase of 30,000 troops to Iraq, pushing the Army and Marines beyond their sustainable deployment rates and requiring extensive use of National Guard and Reserve forces. At the peak, over 200,000 Guard and Reserve members were mobilized simultaneously.
- **Stop-Loss**: The services used "stop-loss" orders to prevent soldiers from leaving the military during their deployments, effectively a backdoor draft that kept approximately 185,000 soldiers in service involuntarily between 2002 and 2009.
- **Reserve Component Transformation**: The Iraq and Afghanistan wars transformed the Guard and Reserve from a "strategic reserve" (held back for major war) to an "operational reserve" (routinely deployed alongside active forces). Guard combat brigades deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan on 12-month rotations, fundamentally changing the compact between citizen-soldiers and the nation.

### Sequestration and the Readiness Crisis (2011-2017)

- **Budget Control Act (2011)**: The BCA imposed spending caps that triggered automatic across-the-board cuts ("sequestration") when Congress failed to reach a bipartisan budget deal. Defense spending was cut by approximately $500 billion over a decade relative to planned levels.
- **The Return of the Hollow Force**: Sequestration forced the services to cut training, defer maintenance, and reduce flying hours. The Navy experienced a series of fatal collisions (USS Fitzgerald, USS John S. McCain in 2017) linked to readiness shortfalls. The Air Force reported its lowest fighter readiness rates in decades.
- **Army Downsizing**: The Army shrank from 570,000 to 475,000 active duty, eliminating approximately 13 brigade combat teams. The Army Chief of Staff warned that the Army was too small for its assigned missions.
- **Navy Fleet Decline**: The fleet shrank to 271 ships, the smallest since 1916. Maintenance backlogs grew as ships deployed without completing scheduled maintenance.

### Great Power Competition and the Current Debate (2017-Present)

- **2018 National Defense Strategy**: Formally declared the return of "great power competition" with China and Russia as the primary focus of U.S. defense strategy, shifting away from two decades of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency as the organizing framework.
- **National Defense Strategy Commission (2018)**: The bipartisan Commission found that "America's military superiority has eroded to a dangerous degree" and warned of the risk of losing a war against China or Russia. It recommended 3-5% real annual growth in defense spending.
- **Force Design Debates**: The services are pursuing different approaches to force design for great power competition:
    - **Army**: Multi-Domain Operations doctrine and Multi-Domain Task Forces.
    - **Navy**: Debate between large surface combatants (DDG(X)) and distributed maritime operations using smaller, unmanned vessels.
    - **Air Force**: Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program and Collaborative Combat Aircraft (autonomous wingmen).
    - **Marine Corps**: Force Design 2030 -- the most radical service-level transformation, divesting armor and artillery to invest in anti-ship missiles and distributed operations in the Pacific.
- **The Recruiting Crisis (2022-Present)**: The services collectively missed their recruiting goals by approximately 41,000 in FY2023, raising fundamental questions about whether the All-Volunteer Force can sustain the end strength the strategy demands.
