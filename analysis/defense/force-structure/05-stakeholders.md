# Force Structure: Stakeholders

Force structure decisions affect -- and are influenced by -- a broad array of government, military, industry, and community stakeholders. Unlike many policy areas where the public is largely disengaged, force structure decisions directly impact millions of service members, their families, defense workers, and the communities that host military installations.

## Military Service Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Role in Force Structure |
|---|---|---|
| **Department of the Army** | Maintaining end strength, BCT count, and modernization funding for Multi-Domain Operations. | Largest service by personnel. Advocates for ground force primacy and increased end strength. |
| **Department of the Navy** | Growing the fleet toward 355+ ships, maintaining 11 carrier strike groups, and sustaining the submarine industrial base. | Controls the largest share of capital investment (shipbuilding). Advocates for maritime primacy. |
| **Department of the Air Force** | Recapitalizing aging aircraft fleets, fielding the B-21 and NGAD, and growing the Space Force. | Manages the most technologically complex and capital-intensive force structure. |
| **U.S. Marine Corps** | Executing Force Design 2030 transformation while maintaining amphibious capability and end strength. | Unique as a naval expeditionary force; currently undergoing the most radical service-level restructuring. |
| **U.S. Space Force** | Establishing organizational identity, growing personnel, and securing independent budget authority. | Newest service, competing for resources and institutional legitimacy within the Air Force budget. |
| **National Guard Bureau** | Protecting Guard end strength, dual-mission (federal/state) authorities, and domestic response capabilities. | The Guard's unique federal-state status gives it powerful political protections through governors and state adjutants general. |

**Internal Conflicts:**

- **Army vs. Navy/Air Force**: The Army advocates for larger ground forces and argues that great power competition will require sustained ground campaigns. The Navy and Air Force argue that the Indo-Pacific theater is primarily a maritime and air domain, and that ground forces are less relevant.
- **Active vs. Guard/Reserve**: Active component leaders prefer a larger active force for speed and readiness. Guard and Reserve advocates argue that reserve forces provide equivalent capability at lower cost and that the Total Force Policy requires meaningful reserve component roles.
- **USMC Institutional Debate**: Force Design 2030 is deeply controversial within the Marine Corps. Retired Marine generals have publicly opposed the divestiture of tanks, arguing it narrows the Corps' utility and makes it a single-scenario force optimized only for the Pacific.

## Combatant Commander Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Force Structure Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM)** | Deterring China; maintaining presence and alliance credibility in the Western Pacific. | The largest consumer of naval and air forces. Drives demand for more ships, submarines, long-range bombers, and forward-deployed forces. |
| **U.S. European Command (EUCOM)** | Deterring Russia; supporting NATO defense of Eastern Europe. | Post-Ukraine invasion, increased demand for Army rotational forces, air defense, and pre-positioned equipment. |
| **U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM)** | Counterterrorism; regional stability in the Middle East. | Reduced footprint from peak Iraq/Afghanistan era but still requires significant ISR, SOF, and maritime presence. |
| **U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM)** | Homeland defense; support to civil authorities (disaster response). | Depends heavily on National Guard for domestic response missions. |

**Key Tension**: Combatant commanders submit requirements that collectively exceed the available force. The Global Force Management process allocates forces but consistently leaves commands short of their stated needs, forcing strategic risk acceptance at the SecDef level.

## Congressional Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Influence |
|---|---|---|
| **House Armed Services Committee (HASC)** | Authorization of defense programs, force levels, and military policy. | Writes the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the primary legislative vehicle for force structure decisions. |
| **Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC)** | Authorization and confirmation of senior defense officials. | Shapes force structure through NDAA provisions and influence over senior military appointments. |
| **Defense Appropriations Subcommittees** | Funding for authorized programs. | Controls the money; can fund programs below authorized levels or add unrequested items. |
| **State Delegations** | Protecting bases, installations, and defense industry jobs in their states and districts. | Form bipartisan coalitions to block BRAC rounds and protect local defense spending. |

**Key Dynamic**: Congress has a structural tendency to add forces and programs (particularly those that create jobs in members' districts) while resisting force reductions, base closures, and program cancellations. This results in a force that is broader but shallower than strategic planners would prefer.

## Defense Industry Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **Prime Contractors** (Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics) | Sustaining and expanding production lines for major platforms (F-35, Virginia-class submarines, DDG-51, B-21). | Concentrated market power; employ hundreds of thousands of workers in politically important states. |
| **Shipbuilding Industry** (Huntington Ingalls, General Dynamics/Bath Iron Works) | Maintaining shipbuilding rate and workforce. | Only two companies can build nuclear-powered warships. The industrial base is a strategic asset and a political constituency. |
| **Small/Mid-Tier Suppliers** | Maintaining subcontract work from prime contractors. | Distributed across hundreds of Congressional districts, creating broad political support for defense programs. |

**Key Dynamic**: The defense industrial base has consolidated from 51 major prime contractors in the 1990s to 5 today. This oligopolistic structure means that force structure decisions directly affect a small number of politically powerful companies. Canceling a major program can eliminate thousands of jobs in a single community and potentially cause a supplier to exit the defense market entirely, reducing future competition.

## Military Families and Personnel

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Influence |
|---|---|---|
| **Active-Duty Service Members** | Quality of life, deployment tempo, career stability, compensation. | Indirect influence through retention decisions; cannot lobby directly due to military regulations. |
| **Military Families** | Housing quality, spouse employment, child education, healthcare (TRICARE), deployment predictability. | Advocacy organizations (NMFA, Blue Star Families) and Congressional testimony. |
| **Recruiters and Recruiting Command** | Meeting accession goals with qualified applicants. | Provide ground-truth data on the feasibility of end-strength targets. |

## Veterans Organizations

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Influence |
|---|---|---|
| **Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW)** | Maintaining strong military, adequate VA funding. | 1.5 million members; Congressional testimony and grassroots lobbying. |
| **American Legion** | National defense, veteran benefits. | 1.6 million members; historically influential with Congress. |
| **Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA)** | Post-9/11 veteran issues, including deployment tempo impacts. | Advocacy and media presence focused on younger veterans. |

## Communities Near Military Bases

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Influence |
|---|---|---|
| **Base-Adjacent Communities** | Economic viability tied to base spending (jobs, housing demand, retail). | Organize through chambers of commerce, defense community coalitions, and their Congressional delegations. |
| **State Governors** | National Guard force structure, domestic emergency response capability, state economic impact of defense spending. | Constitutional role as commanders-in-chief of state National Guard forces; political influence on Congressional delegations. |
| **Defense Community Infrastructure Program (DCIP) Recipients** | Federal funding for infrastructure supporting military installations. | Apply political pressure to maintain base viability and prevent BRAC selections. |
