# Military Bases: Overview

## Overview

The United States maintains the largest network of military installations in the world, with approximately 4,800 domestic sites and roughly 750 facilities in about 80 countries and territories. This sprawling infrastructure is the physical foundation of American military power, providing the staging areas, training grounds, logistics hubs, and command centers that enable the U.S. to project force globally. Collectively, these installations represent hundreds of billions of dollars in real property and employ millions of military personnel, civilian workers, and contractors.

Yet this vast basing network is widely recognized as misaligned with current strategic needs. The Department of Defense has repeatedly estimated that it carries 20 percent or more excess domestic infrastructure capacity, a legacy of Cold War-era expansion that Congress has refused to address since the last Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round in 2005. Overseas, the basing posture is undergoing a gradual shift from Cold War positions in Europe toward the Indo-Pacific, but this realignment is constrained by alliance politics, host nation agreements, and bureaucratic inertia. Meanwhile, decades of military activity have left a massive environmental remediation backlog, with thousands of sites contaminated by toxic chemicals, unexploded ordnance, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

The politics of military bases are uniquely difficult. Every installation represents jobs, economic activity, and community identity for its surrounding area, making base closures among the most politically toxic decisions in American governance. The BRAC process was designed to insulate these decisions from parochial politics, but even that mechanism has been blocked by Congress for nearly two decades. The result is a basing structure that serves political geography more than strategic geography, draining resources that could be better spent on readiness, modernization, and force structure.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key dimensions of U.S. military basing policy:

- **Domestic Installations**: The approximately 4,800 military sites within the United States, including major bases, depots, arsenals, test ranges, training areas, and reserve centers.
- **Overseas Presence**: The roughly 750 installations in approximately 80 countries and territories, ranging from major enduring bases to small cooperative security locations.
- **BRAC History and Process**: The five completed rounds of Base Realignment and Closure (1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, 2005), the mechanics of the BRAC commission, and the political barriers to future rounds.
- **Base Community Impacts**: The economic dependence of surrounding communities, workforce transitions, and long-term redevelopment outcomes following closures.
- **Environmental Cleanup**: The remediation backlog at active installations and formerly used defense sites, including PFAS contamination, unexploded ordnance, and hazardous waste.
- **Host Nation Relations**: Cost-sharing arrangements, status of forces agreements (SOFAs), and the diplomatic dimensions of overseas basing.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Domestic Military Sites | ~4,800 | DoD Base Structure Report, 2018 |
| Overseas Military Sites | ~750 in ~80 countries | David Vine, *American Military Bases Abroad*, 2024 |
| Estimated Domestic Excess Capacity | 20%+ | DoD, multiple testimonies to Congress |
| BRAC Rounds Completed | 5 (1988, 1991, 1993, 1995, 2005) | CRS Report R45705, 2023 |
| Years Since Last BRAC Round | 20 (2005) | -- |
| BRAC 2005 Estimated Annual Savings | $3.8 billion | DoD, 2005 |
| BRAC 2005 Implementation Cost | $35.1 billion | GAO-12-513, 2012 |
| DoD Real Property Replacement Value | ~$1.2 trillion | DoD Real Property Profile, 2022 |
| Environmental Remediation Sites | ~39,000 (active + FUDS) | DoD DERP Annual Report, 2023 |
| PFAS Investigation Sites (DoD) | 700+ | DoD, 2023 |
| Overseas Basing Costs (Annual) | ~$55 billion (estimated) | RAND, 2013 |

## Core Tensions

- **Strategic Need vs. Political Cost**: The DoD consistently identifies excess domestic capacity that wastes billions annually, but Congress blocks closures because every base is in someone's district. The result is a basing structure optimized for political survival rather than military effectiveness.

- **Overseas Presence vs. Sovereignty Concerns**: Forward-deployed forces enable rapid response and reassure allies, but they can generate friction with host nation populations, create dependency relationships, and project a neocolonial image that undermines diplomatic objectives.

- **Environmental Responsibility vs. Operational Urgency**: Military operations inevitably create environmental contamination, but the DoD's cleanup obligations compete with operational budgets. Communities near bases bear health risks from legacy contamination, while the fear of cleanup liability discourages honest assessment of closure candidates.

- **Alliance Commitments vs. Strategic Flexibility**: Basing agreements with allies create expectations of permanent presence. Reducing overseas footprints to gain strategic flexibility risks being perceived as abandonment, even when the strategic rationale is sound.

- **Short-Term Closure Costs vs. Long-Term Savings**: BRAC rounds require substantial upfront investment before generating savings, creating a political vulnerability that opponents exploit. BRAC 2005 cost $35 billion to implement but was projected to save $3.8 billion annually thereafter.

## Key Questions

1. How much excess domestic base capacity does the United States actually carry, and what is the true annual cost of maintaining it?
2. Can the BRAC process be reformed to overcome congressional resistance, or is an alternative mechanism needed?
3. Is the current overseas basing posture aligned with the National Defense Strategy's emphasis on great-power competition in the Indo-Pacific?
4. What is the most effective way to support communities that lose bases, and how have past transition efforts succeeded or failed?
5. How should the DoD prioritize environmental remediation at thousands of contaminated sites, and who should bear the cost?
6. What role should host nation cost-sharing play in determining overseas basing decisions?

## Vision of Success

A successful military basing policy would:

- **Align Infrastructure with Strategy**: The domestic and overseas basing footprint would directly reflect the priorities of the National Defense Strategy, with installations sized, positioned, and equipped for current and projected threats rather than historical inertia.
- **Eliminate Excess Capacity**: The DoD would maintain no more infrastructure than it needs, freeing billions annually for investment in readiness, modernization, and force structure.
- **Support Affected Communities**: Base closures would be accompanied by robust economic transition assistance, ensuring that communities are not left behind and that skilled workers find new employment.
- **Remediate Environmental Damage**: All contaminated sites would be on a clear, funded path to cleanup, with affected communities receiving transparent information and health support.
- **Optimize Overseas Presence**: The overseas network would balance deterrence and reassurance with strategic flexibility, fair cost-sharing with allies, and minimal friction with host nation populations.
- **Maintain Political Sustainability**: The basing process would be insulated from parochial politics through an independent commission mechanism with binding authority, ensuring that decisions serve national rather than local interests.
