# Military Bases: Actions

## Overview

Military basing reform is one of the most politically entrenched challenges in American defense policy. Because opposition is concentrated (base communities) while benefits are diffuse (taxpayers, warfighters), citizen action must be strategic, sustained, and focused on changing the political calculus for members of Congress. This guide outlines what individuals and organizations can do to advance rational basing policy.

## Individual Actions

### Educate Yourself

- **Read the GAO and CBO reports** on BRAC and military infrastructure. These are publicly available, nonpartisan, and provide the factual foundation for advocacy. Start with GAO-12-513 (BRAC costs and savings) and CRS Report R45705 (BRAC background).
- **Understand your local installations**. If you live near a military base, learn about its mission, workforce, economic impact, and environmental record. The DoD Base Structure Report (last published 2018) provides basic data on all installations.
- **Track PFAS contamination**. The Environmental Working Group maintains a publicly accessible map of PFAS contamination near military installations. If you live near a base, check whether your drinking water has been tested.

### Contact Your Representatives

- **Demand BRAC authorization**. Call or write your House member and Senators to support a new BRAC round. Emphasize that excess capacity wastes taxpayer money and diverts resources from military readiness.
- **Support environmental cleanup funding**. Urge your representatives to fund the Defense Environmental Restoration Program and PFAS remediation at levels necessary to protect public health.
- **Ask hard questions**. If your member of Congress opposes BRAC, ask them specifically what alternative they support for addressing 20 percent excess capacity. Demand concrete answers rather than platitudes about "supporting the troops."

### Engage Locally

- **Attend town halls and public meetings**. When defense topics come up, raise the issue of basing efficiency and environmental responsibility.
- **Join or support watchdog organizations**. Groups like the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) and Taxpayers for Common Sense track military infrastructure spending and advocate for reform.
- **If you live near a contaminated site**, participate in Restoration Advisory Boards (RABs) at local installations. These citizen advisory panels provide community input on environmental cleanup priorities.

### Support Community Resilience

- **Advocate for economic diversification** in base-dependent communities. Communities that develop diverse economic bases are more resilient to potential base closures and less politically motivated to oppose rational basing decisions.
- **Support workforce development programs** that help defense workers build transferable skills.

## Organizational Actions

### For Civic Organizations and Advocacy Groups

- **Build a pro-reform coalition**. Connect fiscal conservatives (who want to eliminate waste), defense hawks (who want resources redirected to readiness), and progressives (who want environmental accountability) around the shared goal of basing rationalization.
- **Commission independent research**. Fund studies that quantify the cost of excess capacity in specific states or districts, making the issue tangible for local audiences.
- **Develop model legislation**. Work with congressional allies to draft BRAC reauthorization bills that address the legitimate criticisms of past rounds.
- **Hold congressional scorecards**. Track and publicize members' votes on BRAC authorization, military construction earmarks, and environmental cleanup funding.

### For Base Community Organizations

- **Plan for resilience, not just protection**. Rather than solely opposing closure, develop economic diversification strategies that reduce your community's vulnerability to basing decisions.
- **Engage with redevelopment planning early**. Communities that begin transition planning before closures are announced consistently achieve better outcomes.
- **Document environmental concerns**. If your community is affected by military contamination, organize to demand accelerated cleanup and health monitoring.

### For Environmental Organizations

- **Advocate for PFAS remediation funding**. The military PFAS problem affects hundreds of communities and represents a compelling case for increased federal environmental spending.
- **Push for cleanup-closure decoupling**. Advocate for policies that require environmental remediation regardless of whether a base remains open, removing the perverse incentive to keep bases open to defer cleanup.
- **Support community health monitoring**. Help communities near contaminated installations access health screening and advocate for long-term epidemiological studies.

### For Veterans Organizations

- **Frame the issue in readiness terms**. Every dollar spent on unnecessary infrastructure is a dollar not spent on training, equipment, and support for active-duty service members. Veterans organizations carry unique credibility on this message.
- **Support quality-of-life investments**. Advocate for military construction funding to be directed toward improving housing, childcare, and training facilities at retained installations rather than sustaining excess capacity.
- **Engage with transition support**. Veterans organizations can help connect displaced defense workers with employment opportunities and transition services.

## Effective Advocacy Tips

### Framing the Message

Military base reform is an issue where framing matters enormously. Different audiences respond to different arguments:

| Audience | Effective Frame | Example Message |
|---|---|---|
| Fiscal conservatives | Waste and efficiency | "The DoD estimates it spends billions annually on infrastructure it does not need. This is the definition of government waste." |
| Defense hawks | Readiness and lethality | "Every dollar spent heating empty buildings is a dollar not spent on ammunition, training, and new equipment for our warfighters." |
| Environmentalists | Contamination and health | "Hundreds of communities are drinking PFAS-contaminated water because we are funding empty buildings instead of cleanup." |
| Local communities | Resilience and diversification | "Communities that plan for economic diversification are stronger than those that depend on a single employer, even the military." |
| General public | Fairness and common sense | "Why should taxpayers in 49 states subsidize excess military infrastructure in one state because a senator sits on the right committee?" |

### What Not to Do

- Do not frame base closure as "anti-military." This plays directly into the opposition's narrative. Frame it as "pro-warfighter" and "pro-readiness."
- Do not target specific installations in your advocacy. The strength of the BRAC process is that it removes individual bases from political negotiation. Advocate for the process, not specific outcomes.
- Do not underestimate the emotional intensity of opposition. For base communities, this is an existential economic issue. Acknowledge the legitimate concerns and advocate for robust transition support alongside closure authority.
