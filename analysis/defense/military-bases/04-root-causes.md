# Military Bases: Root Causes

## Overview

The United States maintains a military basing structure that is widely recognized as misaligned with its strategic needs. The DoD estimates over 20 percent excess domestic capacity, while overseas installations reflect Cold War-era priorities more than current threat assessments. Understanding why this misalignment persists despite decades of recognition requires examining the interlocking political, institutional, economic, and informational barriers that prevent rational basing decisions.

## Root Cause 1: Congressional Opposition to Base Closures

### The Political Economy of Bases

Military installations are among the most significant economic assets in their surrounding communities. A major base can represent thousands of jobs (military, civilian, and contractor), millions of dollars in local purchasing, and substantial tax-equivalent payments. For many rural and small-city communities, the base *is* the economy.

This economic reality creates a powerful political dynamic: every member of Congress has a direct, personal incentive to protect bases in their district or state, regardless of strategic necessity. The costs of base closure are concentrated (on the affected community) while the benefits (savings for the national defense budget) are diffused across the entire country. This asymmetry means that opponents of closure are always more motivated than supporters of rationalization.

### The BRAC Moratorium Coalition

Opposition to BRAC authorization in Congress is bipartisan and geographically distributed. Members from both parties and all regions unite to block new rounds, because:

- No member can predict which bases in their district might be targeted.
- Even members whose bases would survive have no political incentive to vote for a process that might close a colleague's base (and thereby lose a political ally).
- The uncertainty of the BRAC outcome creates a risk-averse consensus: the safest political choice is to maintain the status quo.

### Local Government Dependency

State and local governments in base communities become structurally dependent on military spending:

- Property tax exemptions for federal land reduce local revenue but are offset by Impact Aid payments (Section 6702 of Title 31) and defense workforce spending.
- Local infrastructure (roads, schools, utilities) is sized for the base population.
- Housing markets, retail economies, and service industries are oriented toward military customers.
- Community identity often becomes intertwined with the base, especially in locations where the installation has been present for generations.

## Root Cause 2: Institutional Inertia Within the Military Services

### Service Attachment to Legacy Installations

Each military service maintains deep institutional attachment to its historical installations:

- The Army's major training centers (Fort Irwin, Fort Moore, Fort Liberty) have decades of accumulated infrastructure, institutional knowledge, and environmental permits that would be extremely costly to replicate elsewhere.
- The Navy's homeports (Norfolk, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, Bremerton) are located at deepwater harbors with extensive ship repair and maintenance facilities.
- The Air Force's major bases are often tied to specific missions (nuclear deterrence, space operations, test and evaluation) that require specialized infrastructure.

These attachments are reinforced by service culture. Army divisions identify with their "home" posts. Naval communities build identity around fleet homeports. Air Force wings define themselves by their bases. Proposals to close or consolidate these installations face resistance not just from affected communities but from within the military services themselves.

### Bureaucratic Risk Aversion

Military leaders are reluctant to advocate for base closures for several reasons:

- **Career Risk**: Senior officers who publicly support closing installations risk antagonizing members of Congress who control their budgets and confirmations.
- **Operational Risk**: Consolidating onto fewer installations increases vulnerability to natural disasters, adversary attack, or industrial accidents.
- **Transition Risk**: Any major realignment disrupts operations during the transition period, creating readiness risk that commanders are evaluated on.

### Requirements Inflation

Military services tend to justify existing capacity by defining requirements broadly. A training range that is underutilized 90 percent of the year can be defended as "essential" based on peak usage during major exercises. Administrative buildings at 50 percent occupancy can be characterized as needed "surge capacity." This requirements inflation makes it difficult to establish objectively that any particular installation is truly excess.

## Root Cause 3: Inadequate Data and Analysis

### Lack of Comprehensive Capacity Assessment

Congress has blocked the DoD from conducting the comprehensive infrastructure capacity analysis that would be necessary to support rational basing decisions. The last authorized analysis was conducted in preparation for BRAC 2005. Without current, credible data on:

- Actual utilization rates of facilities
- Condition assessments of buildings and infrastructure
- Cross-service duplication of capabilities
- Comparative costs of operating similar installations in different locations

Any claim about excess capacity can be challenged as outdated or methodologically flawed, which opponents exploit to block action.

### Classified and Sensitive Information

Some basing decisions involve classified considerations (nuclear weapons storage, intelligence facilities, special operations locations) that cannot be fully discussed in public. This creates information asymmetries that make transparent analysis difficult and allow interested parties to claim that closures would compromise national security without being subject to public challenge.

### Cost Estimation Failures

The BRAC 2005 experience, where implementation costs far exceeded projections, undermined confidence in the DoD's ability to produce reliable cost-benefit analyses for basing decisions. The Government Accountability Office found that the DoD used inconsistent methodologies, made optimistic assumptions about consolidation savings, and failed to account for major cost categories (particularly military construction at receiving installations). These failures gave BRAC opponents a credible argument that future rounds would also be poorly managed and fiscally wasteful.

## Root Cause 4: Environmental Liability Concerns

### Cleanup Triggers

Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and other environmental statutes, closing a military installation triggers extensive environmental investigation, remediation, and regulatory compliance requirements. The Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) already manages approximately 39,000 contaminated sites, and every closure adds to this burden.

### PFAS as a New Barrier

The emergence of PFAS contamination as a major environmental and health issue has added a significant new dimension to the closure calculus. Virtually every military airfield where AFFF firefighting foam was used has some degree of PFAS contamination. The costs of remediating PFAS to the EPA's new drinking water standards could be enormous, and closing an installation would accelerate the timeline for addressing this contamination, increasing near-term costs.

### Liability Uncertainty

The total environmental remediation liability at military installations is not fully characterized. Estimates range from $50 billion to well over $100 billion when PFAS is included. This uncertainty makes it difficult for policymakers to accurately assess the net fiscal impact of closure decisions, as environmental costs can exceed the savings from eliminating excess capacity.

## Root Cause 5: Politicization of the BRAC Process

### BRAC 2005 Backlash

The 2005 BRAC round was perceived by many in Congress as having been manipulated by the Pentagon to advance pre-determined policy objectives (particularly the creation of joint bases and the consolidation of certain research functions) rather than purely to eliminate excess capacity. This perception, combined with the cost overruns, poisoned the well for future rounds.

### Commission Independence Concerns

The BRAC commission's independence is only as strong as the appointment process. Since commissioners are presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed, critics argue that the process is susceptible to political influence. In BRAC 2005, several commission decisions were criticized as reflecting political rather than strategic or economic considerations.

### "BRAC-Proofing" Behavior

The possibility of future BRAC rounds creates a perverse incentive for communities and their congressional representatives to engage in "BRAC-proofing," or lobbying for new construction, mission additions, and troop increases at their installations to make closure less likely. This behavior can lead to suboptimal investment decisions as resources flow to politically connected bases rather than strategically important ones.

## Root Cause 6: Overseas Basing Inertia

### Alliance Politics

Overseas bases are embedded in a complex web of alliance relationships, host nation agreements, and diplomatic expectations:

- Closing bases in allied nations can be perceived as a withdrawal of commitment, potentially destabilizing security relationships.
- Host nations that have invested in supporting U.S. presence (infrastructure, land allocation, cost-sharing) expect continuity.
- Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) and other bilateral agreements create legal frameworks that are difficult and time-consuming to renegotiate.

### Sunk Cost Thinking

The United States has invested billions in overseas infrastructure that would have to be abandoned or transferred at a loss if bases were closed. This creates a sunk cost dynamic where the scale of past investment is used to justify continued presence, regardless of whether the strategic rationale still holds.

### Host Nation Domestic Politics

In several allied nations, the presence of U.S. bases is a contentious domestic political issue:

- **Okinawa (Japan)**: Decades of local opposition to the concentration of U.S. bases on the island have made realignment politically essential but practically difficult. The replacement facility for Marine Corps Air Station Futenma has been under construction for years and remains deeply controversial.
- **South Korea**: The relocation of U.S. forces from Yongsan Garrison in central Seoul to Camp Humphreys south of the capital was a decades-long process driven by Korean domestic politics as much as military strategy.
- **Italy**: Expansion of installations at Vicenza and the construction of MUOS (Mobile User Objective System) facilities in Sicily faced significant local opposition.

### Lack of Comprehensive Cost Accounting

The true cost of maintaining overseas bases is difficult to determine because:

- Construction and operating costs are spread across multiple budget accounts.
- Host nation contributions are recorded differently by each country.
- The cost of rotating forces overseas versus stationing them in the U.S. is not straightforward to compare.
- Indirect costs (diplomatic friction, environmental damage, host nation relations) are not quantified.

A 2013 RAND study estimated total overseas basing costs at approximately $55 billion annually, but methodological debates persist.

## Systemic Interaction of Root Causes

These root causes do not operate in isolation; they form a self-reinforcing system:

1. **Congressional opposition** blocks BRAC authorization, which prevents **comprehensive data collection**.
2. **Lack of data** makes it impossible to build a credible case for specific closures, reinforcing **congressional skepticism**.
3. **Environmental liability uncertainty** increases the perceived cost of closure, giving **opponents** additional ammunition.
4. **Institutional inertia** within the services ensures that the DoD's own leadership is ambivalent about pushing for closures that might affect their preferred installations.
5. **BRAC 2005 failures** provide a convenient narrative for those who want to maintain the status quo, even though the underlying logic of eliminating excess capacity remains sound.
6. **Overseas alliance politics** create diplomatic risks that make any reposturing slow and contested.

The result is a policy equilibrium in which all major actors have incentives to preserve the status quo, even though nearly all of them acknowledge that the status quo is suboptimal. Breaking this equilibrium requires either a change in the incentive structure (a reformed BRAC process), a shock to the system (a fiscal crisis, a strategic disaster), or a sustained political effort by an actor with sufficient authority to overcome distributed resistance.
