# Military Bases: History

## Pre-World War II Foundations

American military basing before World War II was relatively modest. The continental United States hosted a network of coastal fortifications, army posts (many dating to the frontier era), and naval yards concentrated along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Overseas presence was limited to colonial possessions acquired following the Spanish-American War of 1898, including the Philippines, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone.

**Key Pre-WWII Installations**:

- **West Point (NY)** and **Annapolis (MD)**: Service academies established in 1802 and 1845, respectively.
- **Naval Station Norfolk (VA)**: Origins dating to 1767, the oldest and largest naval installation in the world.
- **Army Posts**: Forts across the American West established during the Indian Wars, many of which became permanent installations (e.g., Fort Sill, Fort Bliss, Fort Huachuca).
- **Panama Canal Zone**: Military bases constructed following the canal's completion in 1914 to protect this strategic waterway.

## World War II Expansion

The mobilization for World War II transformed the American basing landscape. Between 1940 and 1945, the U.S. constructed hundreds of new domestic training bases, airfields, shipyards, and industrial facilities, while simultaneously building a vast overseas network to support global operations.

### Domestic Buildup

- The Army grew from fewer than 200,000 troops in 1939 to over 8 million by 1945, requiring enormous training infrastructure.
- Hundreds of Army and Army Air Forces bases were constructed across the South and West, where climate and available land favored training.
- The Manhattan Project created entirely new installations at Los Alamos (NM), Oak Ridge (TN), and Hanford (WA).
- Wartime industrial production generated major depot and logistics facilities that became permanent fixtures.

### Overseas Wartime Network

- By 1945, the United States maintained military facilities in over 100 countries.
- Major base complexes were established in the United Kingdom, North Africa, Italy, France, Germany, India, China, Australia, and across the Pacific Islands.
- The wartime network included over 30,000 installations of various sizes, most of which were returned or abandoned after the war.

## Cold War Base Expansion (1945-1989)

The onset of the Cold War prevented the anticipated postwar demobilization from fully dismantling the global basing network. Instead, the United States built an even more extensive permanent overseas presence to contain Soviet expansion.

### European Basing

- **Germany**: Became the centerpiece of the U.S. military presence in Europe. At its peak, the U.S. maintained over 200 installations in West Germany, with troop levels reaching 250,000+.
- **United Kingdom**: Major air bases including Lakenheath, Mildenhall, and Fairford served as forward staging areas for nuclear-capable bombers.
- **Italy**: Aviano Air Base and Naval Air Station Sigonella became key Mediterranean hubs.
- **NATO Integration**: The establishment of NATO in 1949 formalized the basing network as part of alliance defense, with SACEUR (Supreme Allied Commander Europe) commanding forces across multiple nations.

### Pacific Basing

- **Japan**: Under the 1951 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the U.S. retained major bases including Yokosuka, Yokota, Misawa, Iwakuni, and the extensive complex on Okinawa. At peak, the U.S. controlled approximately 3,800 facilities in Japan.
- **South Korea**: Following the Korean War armistice in 1953, the U.S. maintained a permanent garrison of approximately 37,000 troops, centered on installations along the Demilitarized Zone and at Yongsan Garrison in Seoul.
- **Philippines**: Clark Air Base and Naval Station Subic Bay were the largest U.S. installations in Southeast Asia until their closure in 1991-1992.
- **Guam and the Pacific Islands**: Strategic bomber and naval facilities were maintained as part of the nuclear deterrent posture.

### Domestic Cold War Infrastructure

- **Strategic Air Command (SAC)**: Dozens of bomber and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) bases were constructed across the Great Plains and Mountain West.
- **Air Defense Command**: A network of radar stations and interceptor bases ringed the continental United States and extended through Canada (DEW Line, NORAD).
- **Nuclear Weapons Complex**: The Department of Energy (then the Atomic Energy Commission) maintained a vast network of production facilities, test sites (Nevada Test Site), and weapons storage areas.
- **Training Expansion**: Major training installations like Fort Irwin, Twentynine Palms, and the Nellis Range Complex were expanded to provide realistic combined-arms and air combat training.

## The BRAC Era (1988-2005)

By the late 1980s, it was widely recognized that the U.S. military maintained far more domestic base infrastructure than it needed, especially as end-strength was being reduced following the end of the Cold War. The political challenge was that closing bases meant eliminating jobs and economic activity in members' districts, making it nearly impossible for Congress to act through the normal legislative process.

### The BRAC Innovation

The Base Realignment and Closure process was created as a mechanism to depoliticize basing decisions by delegating them to an independent commission. The key features of the BRAC process:

1. **Independent Commission**: The Secretary of Defense recommends a list of closures and realignments. An independent, presidentially appointed commission reviews the recommendations, holds public hearings, and may add or remove bases from the list.
2. **All-or-Nothing Vote**: The commission's final list is submitted to the President and then to Congress, which must accept or reject the entire list without amendment. This prevents members from protecting individual bases.
3. **Binding Authority**: If Congress does not pass a joint resolution of disapproval within 45 legislative days, the list takes effect and the DoD must implement the closures and realignments within six years.

### BRAC Round Results

| Round | Bases Recommended | Major Closures | Realignments | Estimated Annual Savings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BRAC 1988 | 145 | 86 | 59 | $0.7 billion |
| BRAC 1991 | 43 | 26 | 17 | $1.5 billion |
| BRAC 1993 | 175 | 35 | 140 | $2.3 billion |
| BRAC 1995 | 132 | 29 | 103 | $1.8 billion |
| BRAC 2005 | 190 | 22 | 33 major; 29 minor | $3.8 billion (projected) |
| **Total** | **685** | **198** | **348+** | **~$10.1 billion** |

### BRAC 1988

The first BRAC round was authorized by the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-526). The commission, chaired by former Senator Abraham Ribicoff, recommended the closure of 86 installations and the realignment of 59 others. Major closures included:

- Fort Sheridan (IL)
- George Air Force Base (CA)
- Chanute Air Force Base (IL)
- Philadelphia Naval Shipyard (PA) (partial)

### BRAC 1991 and 1993

These rounds came during the post-Cold War drawdown, as the U.S. military was reducing end-strength by approximately 25 percent. Major closures included:

- **1991**: Fort Ord (CA), Castle Air Force Base (CA), Naval Station Philadelphia (PA)
- **1993**: Naval Air Station Cecil Field (FL), Homestead Air Force Base (FL), Naval Training Center Orlando (FL), Mare Island Naval Shipyard (CA)

### BRAC 1995

The fourth round closed 29 major installations, including:

- McClellan Air Force Base (CA)
- Kelly Air Force Base (TX)
- Long Beach Naval Shipyard (CA)
- Fort McClellan (AL)

### BRAC 2005

The final BRAC round was the largest and most complex, involving 190 recommendations affecting installations in nearly every state. Unlike previous rounds, BRAC 2005 emphasized realignment and joint basing over outright closure.

**Key Actions**:

- Closure of Fort Monmouth (NJ), with relocation of its workforce to Aberdeen Proving Ground (MD)
- Closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center (DC), consolidation into the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at Bethesda (MD)
- Creation of 12 joint bases from 26 separate installations
- Significant realignments at Fort Bragg (now Fort Liberty), Fort Benning (now Fort Moore), and Fort Sam Houston

**Controversy**: BRAC 2005 proved far more expensive than projected. The initial cost estimate of $21 billion ballooned to $35.1 billion, and the GAO found that some realignments would not produce net savings for 15-20 years. This outcome damaged the credibility of the BRAC process and gave opponents ammunition to block future rounds.

## Failed BRAC Requests (2013-Present)

Since 2012, every administration has requested BRAC authority in its annual budget submission, and Congress has rejected it every time:

| Year | Administration | Request | Congressional Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| FY2013 | Obama | BRAC round requested | Denied in NDAA |
| FY2014 | Obama | BRAC round requested | Denied in NDAA |
| FY2015 | Obama | BRAC round requested | Denied in NDAA |
| FY2016 | Obama | BRAC round requested | Denied in NDAA |
| FY2017 | Obama | Infrastructure capacity analysis | Denied in NDAA |
| FY2018 | Trump | BRAC round requested | Denied in NDAA |
| FY2019 | Trump | BRAC round requested | Denied in NDAA |
| FY2020 | Trump | BRAC round requested | Denied in NDAA |
| FY2024 | Biden | Infrastructure review language | Stripped from NDAA |

## Overseas Realignment (1990-Present)

### Post-Cold War European Drawdown

The end of the Cold War led to a dramatic reduction in the European basing footprint:

- U.S. forces in Germany declined from approximately 250,000 in 1989 to roughly 35,000 by 2020.
- Hundreds of installations in Germany were returned to the host nation, including major facilities like Frankfurt Air Base, Rhein-Main Air Base, and numerous kasernes (barracks complexes).
- Despite the drawdown, significant infrastructure remains, including Ramstein Air Base (the hub of U.S. Air Forces in Europe), Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, and the Grafenwoehr Training Area.

### Post-9/11 Expansion

The Global War on Terror generated a massive expansion of temporary and semi-permanent basing, particularly in the Middle East and Central Asia:

- **Afghanistan**: Bagram Airfield, Kandahar Airfield, and dozens of forward operating bases were established. All were closed or transferred following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021.
- **Iraq**: Large bases including Balad, Al Asad, and Camp Victory were constructed. Most were transferred, though U.S. forces returned to some after 2014 to fight ISIS.
- **Persian Gulf**: Enduring presence was expanded at Al Udeid Air Base (Qatar), Naval Support Activity Bahrain, and facilities in Kuwait.
- **Africa**: Camp Lemonnier (Djibouti) was established in 2003 as the hub for counterterrorism operations on the continent.

### Pacific Reposturing

The "Pivot to Asia" announced in 2011 and continued under subsequent administrations began a shift in basing emphasis:

- **Okinawa Realignment**: The ongoing effort to relocate Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to a new facility at Camp Schwab/Henoko, driven by local opposition and the 2006 U.S.-Japan Realignment Roadmap.
- **Guam Buildup**: Construction of new Marine Corps facilities on Guam to receive forces relocated from Okinawa.
- **Australia**: Beginning in 2012, rotational deployments of U.S. Marines to Darwin and enhanced access to Australian training areas and airfields.
- **Philippines**: The 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) granted U.S. forces rotational access to Philippine military bases, partially reversing the 1991-1992 closure of Clark and Subic.

## Community Transition Outcomes

The economic impact of base closures has varied dramatically depending on community resources, location, and redevelopment strategies:

**Success Stories**:

- **Fort Ord (CA)**: Closed in 1994, the site was transformed into California State University Monterey Bay, the Veterans Transition Center, and mixed-use development. The local economy recovered within a decade.
- **Lowry Air Force Base (CO)**: Closed in 1994, successfully redeveloped into a mixed-use community with residential, commercial, and educational uses.
- **NAS South Weymouth (MA)**: Closed in 1997, redeveloped into Southfield, a mixed-use community.

**Difficult Transitions**:

- **Fort McClellan (AL)**: Closed in 1999, complicated by significant environmental contamination. The community struggled for years with economic decline and cleanup challenges.
- **K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base (MI)**: Closed in 1995, the remote Upper Michigan location made economic diversification extremely difficult.
