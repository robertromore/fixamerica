# Military Bases: Stakeholders

## Overview

Military basing decisions involve an unusually broad range of stakeholders, from the highest levels of national security policymaking to individual families living near installations. The intensity of stakeholder engagement on this issue is driven by the fact that bases are simultaneously instruments of national defense, engines of local economic activity, sources of environmental risk, and symbols of alliance commitment. Understanding who has power, who is affected, and what motivates each group is essential to any realistic reform effort.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Department of Defense Leadership

**Role**: The Secretary of Defense, service secretaries, and Joint Chiefs of Staff are responsible for aligning the basing structure with the National Defense Strategy.

**Interests**:

- Eliminating excess capacity to redirect resources toward readiness and modernization
- Maintaining operational flexibility and force projection capability
- Minimizing political conflict with Congress over base closures

**Power**: High. The DoD initiates the BRAC process and controls the analytical framework. However, its power is constrained by congressional authority over military construction and base closure.

**Key Tension**: DoD leadership publicly advocates for BRAC authority in budget testimony but is often ambivalent privately, as base closures create friction with Congress that affects the entire defense budget.

### Military Services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force)

**Role**: Each service operates its own installations and generates the requirements that justify them.

**Interests**:

- Preserving installations that support core missions and training
- Protecting service-specific infrastructure (shipyards, test ranges, training centers)
- Maintaining institutional traditions and unit identities associated with historic bases

**Power**: Significant. Services control the data on facility utilization and condition that drives basing analyses. They can influence outcomes by how they define requirements and report capacity.

**Key Tension**: Services resist closures of their installations while competing with each other for resources. Joint basing, which threatens service autonomy, is particularly resisted.

### Congress

**Role**: Congress authorizes and funds military construction, controls the BRAC process, and appropriates the defense budget.

**Interests**:

- Protecting military installations in members' districts and states
- Maintaining defense-related jobs and economic activity in local communities
- Exercising oversight of DoD spending and infrastructure decisions
- Demonstrating support for military personnel and families

**Power**: Dominant. Congress has sole authority to authorize BRAC rounds and can block the DoD from even studying excess capacity. The Armed Services Committees and Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees are the key venues.

**Key Players**:

| Actor | Role | Typical Position |
|---|---|---|
| Senate Armed Services Committee | Authorization of BRAC and military construction | Divided; some members support reform |
| House Armed Services Committee | Authorization of BRAC and military construction | Generally opposes new BRAC rounds |
| Military Construction Subcommittees | Funding for military construction and BRAC implementation | Protective of local projects |
| State Delegations with Major Bases | Advocacy for installation protection | Strongly opposed to closures |
| Congressional Budget Office (CBO) | Independent cost analysis | Provides analytical support for reform |

### Base Communities

**Role**: Cities, counties, and regions surrounding military installations that are economically and socially integrated with the base.

**Interests**:

- Preserving jobs and economic activity generated by the installation
- Maintaining the tax base and population that support local services
- Protecting property values in base-adjacent areas
- Ensuring environmental safety from base-related contamination

**Power**: Moderate at the local level, amplified through congressional representation. Base communities organize through local governments, chambers of commerce, and dedicated advocacy organizations (see Opposition analysis).

**Affected Populations**:

| Group | Estimated Size | Primary Concern |
|---|---|---|
| Military-connected families | ~2.8 million active duty and dependents | Housing, schools, quality of life |
| DoD civilian employees | ~950,000 (DoD-wide) | Job security, relocation |
| Defense contractor employees | Varies by installation | Contract continuity |
| Local business owners | Varies | Customer base, revenue |
| Nearby residents | Varies | Environmental exposure, property values |

### Host Nations (Overseas Bases)

**Role**: Allied and partner nations that host U.S. military installations under bilateral agreements.

**Interests**:

- Security assurance from U.S. military presence (deterrence of regional threats)
- Economic benefits from U.S. spending and employment
- Minimizing social friction (noise, crime, land use, environmental damage)
- Maintaining sovereignty and domestic political legitimacy regarding foreign military presence

**Power**: Significant. Host nations can constrain U.S. operations through SOFA negotiations, land use restrictions, and political pressure. In extreme cases, host nations can demand closure (as the Philippines did in 1991).

**Key Host Nations**:

| Country | U.S. Personnel | Key Installations | Political Sensitivity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Japan | ~54,000 | Kadena AB, Yokosuka, Camp Schwab | High (especially Okinawa) |
| South Korea | ~28,500 | Camp Humphreys, Osan AB, Kunsan AB | Moderate |
| Germany | ~35,000 | Ramstein AB, Grafenwoehr, Stuttgart | Low to moderate |
| Italy | ~12,000 | Aviano AB, NAS Sigonella, Vicenza | Moderate |
| United Kingdom | ~9,000 | Lakenheath, Mildenhall, Fairford | Low |
| Bahrain | ~8,000 | NSA Bahrain (Fifth Fleet HQ) | Low (government) / Moderate (public) |
| Qatar | ~10,000 | Al Udeid AB | Low |

## Secondary Stakeholders

### Defense Industry and Contractors

**Role**: Companies that operate facilities, provide services, and manufacture products at or for military installations.

**Interests**:

- Maintaining contracts tied to specific installations
- Protecting investments in facilities and workforce at base locations
- Ensuring continuity of production and maintenance operations

**Power**: Moderate to high. Major defense contractors (Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon, BAE Systems) have significant lobbying power and can influence basing decisions through their economic footprint and political contributions.

### Defense Workforce and Labor Unions

**Role**: Civilian employees of the DoD and their union representatives.

**Interests**:

- Job security and relocation assistance during closures or realignments
- Maintaining pay, benefits, and working conditions
- Ensuring fair treatment during workforce transitions

**Power**: Moderate. Federal employee unions (AFGE, NFFE, IAM) can mobilize politically and have influence in congressional districts where defense employment is significant.

**Key Unions**:

- American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE): Represents the largest number of DoD civilian workers
- National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE): Represents workers at depots, arsenals, and laboratories
- International Association of Machinists (IAM): Represents workers at military maintenance facilities

### Environmental Groups and Affected Communities

**Role**: Organizations concerned with contamination from military operations and the health of communities near installations.

**Interests**:

- Accelerating cleanup of contaminated sites at active and closed installations
- Ensuring that PFAS and other emerging contaminants are addressed
- Protecting drinking water sources near military bases
- Holding the DoD accountable for environmental damage

**Power**: Growing. Environmental advocacy organizations have increasingly focused on military contamination, and PFAS has elevated the issue in public consciousness. Litigation has been effective in forcing DoD action.

**Key Organizations**:

| Organization | Focus Area |
|---|---|
| Sierra Club | Broad environmental advocacy, military contamination |
| Environmental Working Group (EWG) | PFAS contamination mapping and advocacy |
| Community groups near specific bases | Local health and environmental justice |
| State environmental agencies | Regulatory oversight, cleanup enforcement |

### State and Local Governments

**Role**: Governors, state legislatures, mayors, and county officials in areas affected by military installations.

**Interests**:

- Preserving military economic activity within their jurisdictions
- Managing land use and community planning around installations
- Coordinating environmental cleanup and health monitoring
- Leading economic redevelopment after closures

**Power**: Moderate. Governors and state officials can lobby congressional delegations and the White House. Local redevelopment authorities (LRAs) are key actors in post-closure transitions.

### Military Families and Veterans Organizations

**Role**: Service members, their families, and veteran advocacy groups.

**Interests**:

- Quality of housing, schools, healthcare, and community services at installations
- Stability of assignments and minimizing forced relocations
- Adequate transition support during base closures
- Access to VA services and military facilities in retirement

**Key Organizations**:

| Organization | Primary Advocacy Focus |
|---|---|
| Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) | Quality of life, healthcare access |
| National Military Family Association (NMFA) | Family support, housing, childcare |
| Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) | Veteran services, installation access |
| American Legion | Community-level veteran support |

### Taxpayers and Fiscal Watchdog Organizations

**Role**: Organizations representing the broader public interest in efficient use of defense resources.

**Interests**:

- Eliminating wasteful spending on excess military infrastructure
- Ensuring that defense dollars are directed toward readiness and capability
- Transparency in basing costs and decision-making

**Key Organizations**:

| Organization | Approach |
|---|---|
| Taxpayers for Common Sense | Government spending reform advocacy |
| Project on Government Oversight (POGO) | Defense waste and accountability |
| Congressional Budget Office (CBO) | Nonpartisan fiscal analysis |
| Government Accountability Office (GAO) | Audit and evaluation |

## Stakeholder Power Dynamics

### The Iron Triangle of Base Politics

The politics of military bases exhibit a classic "iron triangle" dynamic:

1. **Congressional Members** protect bases for political benefit (jobs, votes).
2. **Military Services** justify bases through expansive requirements definitions.
3. **Defense Industry and Communities** lobby to preserve installations that sustain their economic interests.

This triangle is extraordinarily difficult to break because each vertex reinforces the others, and no external actor has sufficient power to override the combined resistance.

### Who Wins, Who Loses

| Stakeholder | Under Current System | Under Reform |
|---|---|---|
| Base communities with excess capacity | Protected but at national cost | Face transition but with assistance |
| DoD / Warfighter | Constrained budgets, underinvestment | Freed resources for readiness |
| Taxpayers | Pay for unneeded infrastructure | Savings redirected to priorities |
| Environmental justice communities | Contamination unaddressed | Cleanup accelerated |
| Host nation populations | Status quo friction continues | Posture review may reduce or shift presence |
