# Military Bases: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to military base closures and realignment is among the most durable and bipartisan forces in American defense politics. Unlike most policy areas where opposition can be mapped along ideological lines, resistance to base closures unites members of Congress across party, region, and ideology in defense of their local economic interests. This analysis examines the major opposition groups, their arguments, their true motivations, and the strategies they employ.

## Congressional Opposition

### Members with Bases in Their Districts

**Who**: Virtually every member of Congress with a significant military installation in their district or state opposes BRAC authorization, regardless of party affiliation. This coalition typically includes 300+ members of the House and 80+ Senators.

**Stated Arguments**:

- The BRAC process is flawed, as demonstrated by the cost overruns and questionable decisions in BRAC 2005.
- The DoD has not demonstrated that excess capacity actually exists.
- Closures would harm military readiness by reducing training and operational capacity.
- The current threat environment requires maintaining maximum infrastructure flexibility.

**Actual Motivations**:

- Military bases represent thousands of direct and indirect jobs in their districts.
- Base closure is politically devastating; no member has ever benefited from losing a base.
- The uncertainty of the BRAC process means any member could be targeted, creating universal risk aversion.
- Military spending is one of the most tangible federal benefits a member can claim credit for.

**Strategy**:

- Insert BRAC-blocking language into each year's NDAA, prohibiting funds for base closure proposals or infrastructure analysis.
- Hold hearings where base community representatives testify about economic hardship.
- Coordinate bipartisan "base protection" caucuses that cross-cut other political divisions.
- Attach MILCON projects to installations as "BRAC-proofing" investments that make closure politically and economically harder.

**Effectiveness**: Very high. The congressional coalition has successfully blocked every BRAC request since 2012, and there is no indication this will change absent a major shift in political dynamics.

### Key Congressional Figures (Historical and Current)

| Member | State | Reason for Opposition |
|---|---|---|
| Multiple Armed Services Committee members | Various | Bases in districts, committee jurisdiction over BRAC |
| State delegations from base-heavy states (TX, VA, CA, FL, NC, GA) | Multiple | Disproportionate economic exposure to closures |
| Military Construction Subcommittee members | Various | Direct jurisdiction over base funding |

**Note**: The bipartisan nature of this opposition is its most striking feature. Members who disagree on virtually every other issue will cooperate to block BRAC authorization.

## Base Community Organizations

### Association of Defense Communities (ADC)

**Who**: The primary national organization representing communities near military installations. ADC has approximately 300 member communities across all 50 states.

**Stated Arguments**:

- Communities have invested heavily in supporting military installations and deserve consideration in basing decisions.
- Base closures can devastate local economies, particularly in rural areas with limited alternative economic drivers.
- The BRAC process does not adequately weigh community impact or provide sufficient transition assistance.

**Actual Motivations**:

- ADC members include local government officials, chamber of commerce leaders, and business owners whose livelihoods depend on military spending.
- The organization's primary purpose is installation preservation, though it also advocates for redevelopment assistance when closures do occur.

**Strategy**:

- Lobby Congress against BRAC authorization.
- Help communities develop "military value" enhancement plans to make their bases more closure-resistant.
- Organize testimony and media campaigns emphasizing community impact.
- Support MILCON requests that increase infrastructure investment at member installations.

### Individual Community Defense Groups

Hundreds of local organizations exist to protect specific installations:

- **Greater Killeen Chamber of Commerce** (Fort Cavazos, TX): Advocates for the Army's largest installation.
- **Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance** (Norfolk, VA): Protects the massive military complex in southeastern Virginia.
- **San Diego Military Advisory Council** (SDMAC): Represents the military community in the nation's largest Navy and Marine Corps hub.
- **Fayetteville/Fort Liberty Regional Association** (NC): Advocates for the Army's premier airborne and special operations installation.

These organizations are sophisticated advocacy operations, often funded by local governments and businesses, that maintain constant contact with congressional offices and military leadership.

## Labor Unions

### American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE)

**Who**: The largest union representing federal employees, including approximately 300,000 DoD civilian workers.

**Stated Arguments**:

- Base closures eliminate good federal jobs that provide middle-class wages and benefits.
- Civilian employees face inadequate relocation assistance and job placement support.
- The DoD's civilian workforce is already stretched thin, and further reductions would harm readiness.

**Actual Motivations**:

- Union membership and dues revenue depend on the size of the civilian defense workforce.
- AFGE's political influence is tied to its ability to deliver votes in districts with significant federal employment.
- Closures reduce the number of unionized positions, weakening organized labor's presence in the federal sector.

**Strategy**:

- Lobby Congress against BRAC authorization.
- Mobilize civilian employees to contact their representatives.
- Negotiate for enhanced severance, relocation, and retraining benefits in any closure scenario.
- Support legislation requiring priority placement of displaced workers at other federal agencies.

### Other Defense Labor Organizations

- **National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE)**: Represents workers at depots and arsenals, which are frequent BRAC targets.
- **International Association of Machinists (IAM)**: Represents maintenance workers at military repair facilities.
- **Metal Trades Council (AFL-CIO)**: Represents shipyard workers at naval installations.

## State and Local Governments

### Governors and State Officials

**Who**: Governors from states with significant military installations, regardless of party.

**Stated Arguments**:

- Military installations are essential economic anchors, especially in rural areas.
- States have invested in supporting infrastructure (roads, schools, utilities) around bases.
- Closures shift economic burden to state unemployment and welfare systems.
- State National Guard facilities should be protected from federal closure decisions.

**Actual Motivations**:

- Military installations represent a significant share of state economic output in some states (Virginia, Texas, California, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii).
- Governors who lose bases are seen as having failed to protect their states' interests.
- State economic development agencies often include military installation preservation as a core mission.

**Strategy**:

- Direct lobbying of congressional delegations and administration officials.
- State-funded "military affairs commissions" or "military installation protection programs."
- Investment in state and local infrastructure around bases to increase their military value.
- Coordination with base community organizations and industry stakeholders.

### Local Government Officials

Mayors, county commissioners, and city council members in base communities are often the most vocal opponents of closure, as the impact falls most directly on their constituents and budgets.

## Defense Industry

### Prime Contractors

**Who**: Major defense companies with facilities, contracts, and workforce at military installations.

**Stated Arguments**:

- Base closures disrupt production lines, maintenance operations, and supply chains that support military readiness.
- Contractor investments at specific locations would be stranded by closures.
- Moving production and maintenance operations is expensive and time-consuming.

**Actual Motivations**:

- Contracts tied to specific installations represent revenue that would be at risk during any transition.
- Defense companies benefit from the geographic dispersion of military spending, which creates a broad political constituency for defense budgets.
- Some contractors operate government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities at military installations where they are the primary employer.

**Strategy**:

- Political contributions to members of Congress with bases in their districts.
- Direct lobbying against BRAC authorization.
- Emphasizing "mission-critical" nature of their activities at specific installations.
- Coordinating with community organizations and labor unions for unified opposition.

## Arguments and Counter-Arguments

| Opposition Argument | Validity | Counter-Argument |
|---|---|---|
| BRAC 2005 was too expensive | Partially valid; costs exceeded projections | Cost overruns were due to scope expansion, not inherent BRAC flaws; reformed process can address this |
| No evidence of excess capacity | Invalid; DoD consistently testifies to 20%+ | Congress blocks the very studies that would provide detailed evidence |
| Closures harm readiness | Mostly invalid | Excess capacity drains readiness funding; closures free resources for training and equipment |
| Communities cannot recover | Partially valid for some | Most BRAC communities recovered within a decade; enhanced transition assistance can accelerate this |
| Current threats require maximum capacity | Weak | Threats require capability and readiness, not empty buildings; the nature of threats has changed |
| The process can be manipulated | Partially valid | Reformed commission with stronger independence can address this; transparency requirements help |

## Opposition Effectiveness Assessment

The opposition coalition against base closures is among the most effective in American politics for several reasons:

1. **Bipartisan Unity**: Unlike most policy debates, base protection crosses party lines, making it nearly impossible for either party's leadership to overcome.
2. **Concentrated Benefits, Diffused Costs**: Every base has passionate, organized defenders. The beneficiaries of closure (taxpayers, the warfighter) are diffuse and unorganized.
3. **Institutional Leverage**: Opponents occupy key positions on the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees, where they can block BRAC language regardless of broader congressional sentiment.
4. **Narrative Advantage**: "Protecting our military" and "supporting our troops" are politically potent frames that closure opponents deploy effectively, even when the actual effect of excess capacity is to divert resources from the troops.
5. **No Political Reward for Reform**: No member of Congress has ever won an election by supporting base closures. The political incentive structure is entirely one-directional.
