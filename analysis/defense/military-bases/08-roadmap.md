# Military Bases: Roadmap

## Overview

Reforming the U.S. military basing structure is a multi-decade endeavor. The political barriers to base closure are so deeply entrenched that any successful strategy must be phased, building momentum from less controversial actions toward the most difficult decisions. This roadmap outlines a four-phase approach spanning approximately 15-20 years, with near-term actions focused on building the analytical foundation and political conditions for reform, mid-term actions addressing the first wave of closures and overseas optimization, and long-term actions institutionalizing a sustainable process for ongoing basing rationalization.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-3)

### Objective

Establish the analytical infrastructure, political coalitions, and legal authorities needed to support rational basing decisions.

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|---|
| Authorize and fund comprehensive infrastructure capacity analysis | Congress (NDAA) | Year 1 | Bipartisan support, DoD testimony |
| Commission independent GAO audit of all domestic installations | Congress | Year 1 | Appropriations |
| Establish PFAS remediation trust fund | Congress | Year 1 | EPA standards finalized |

- Host nation cost-sharing renegotiations initiated with Japan, South Korea, and NATO allies
- Pacific Deterrence Initiative investments on track

## Phase 3: Implementation and Transition (Years 7-12)

### Objective

Execute BRAC closures and realignments, support community transitions, and implement overseas posture changes.

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|---|
| Execute BRAC closures and realignments | DoD | Years 7-12 | BRAC list approved |
| Deploy community transition assistance | OEA, SBA, DOL, EDA | Years 5-15 | Pre-funded transition accounts |
| Accelerate environmental remediation at closing installations | DoD/EPA | Years 7-15 | PFAS fund, DERP funding |
| Transfer surplus property to LRAs | DoD/GSA | Years 8-14 | Closure completion |
| Execute overseas posture changes | DoD/State | Years 7-12 | Posture review, alliance negotiations |
| Monitor and report transition outcomes | GAO, OEA | Ongoing | Reporting mandates |
| Demolish excess facilities at retained installations | DoD | Years 7-12 | Demolition authority and funding |

### Milestones

- All BRAC closures completed within statutory timeline
- 80 percent of displaced civilian workers placed in new employment
- Environmental remediation initiated at all closing installations
- Overseas posture changes completed for first review cycle
- Community redevelopment underway at majority of closed installations
- Annual savings from closures begin accruing

## Phase 4: Institutionalization (Years 12-20)

### Objective

Establish a permanent, sustainable mechanism for ongoing basing rationalization so that excess capacity never again accumulates to current levels.

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|---|
| Evaluate outcomes of Phase 2-3 BRAC round | GAO | Year 12 | Sufficient implementation data |
| Authorize recurring BRAC cycle (every 8-10 years) | Congress | Year 12-14 | Positive evaluation |
| Complete second overseas posture review | DoD | Year 8 | Statutory mandate |
| Publish annual installation efficiency reports | DoD | Ongoing | Data systems, reporting mandates |
| Evaluate community transition outcomes and lessons learned | GAO, OEA | Year 12 | Sufficient data |
| Adjust BRAC process based on lessons learned | Congress/DoD | Year 12-14 | Evaluation complete |
| Initiate second BRAC round if authorized | BRAC Commission | Year 14-16 | Recurring authorization |
| Environmental remediation completion at majority of sites | DoD/EPA | Year 15-20 | Sustained funding |

### Milestones

- Recurring BRAC authority established
- Excess capacity reduced to less than 5 percent
- Annual savings from all BRAC actions exceeding $8-10 billion
- Environmental remediation completed at 90 percent of priority sites
- Overseas posture aligned with current National Defense Strategy
- Community transition success rate above 80 percent

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Baseline (2025) | Phase 2 Target | Phase 4 Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Estimated excess domestic capacity | 20%+ | 10-15% | Less than 5% |
| Annual cost of excess capacity | $2-6 billion | $1-3 billion | Less than $500 million |
| Deferred maintenance backlog | $140+ billion | $100 billion | $60 billion |
| Facility utilization rate (average) | ~65% (estimated) | 75% | 85% |

### Strategic Metrics

| Metric | Baseline (2025) | Phase 2 Target | Phase 4 Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overseas posture reviews conducted | 0 (recurring) | 1 completed | 3 completed |
| Pacific basing dispersal sites | Limited | 10+ new access agreements | 20+ access agreements |
| Host nation cost-sharing (avg increase) | -- | 10% increase | 20% increase |
| Posture alignment with NDS (expert assessment) | Partially aligned | Substantially aligned | Fully aligned |

### Community Metrics

| Metric | Baseline (2025) | Phase 2 Target | Phase 4 Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Communities with pre-closure transition plans | N/A | 100% of affected communities | 100% |
| Displaced civilian workers employed within 2 years | Historical: ~75% | 85% | 90% |
| Closed installations with active redevelopment | Historical: ~80% | 90% | 95% |
| Community economic recovery (within 10 years) | Historical: ~70% | 80% | 85% |

### Environmental Metrics

| Metric | Baseline (2025) | Phase 2 Target | Phase 4 Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| PFAS sites with remediation underway | ~30% | 60% | 90% |
| DERP sites with completed remediation | ~82% | 88% | 95% |
| AFFF replacement completion | Ongoing | 100% | 100% |
| Drinking water contamination exceedances | 100+ installations | 50 or fewer | 10 or fewer |

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Congress fails to authorize BRAC | High | Critical | Build bipartisan coalition, tie to readiness arguments |
| BRAC costs exceed projections (again) | Moderate | High | Improved cost methodology, GAO validation, contingency reserves |
| Community opposition derails implementation | Moderate | Moderate | Pre-funded transition, early planning, transparent process |
| Overseas allies resist posture changes | Moderate | Moderate | Diplomatic engagement, burden-sharing incentives |
| Environmental remediation costs escalate | High | High | Dedicated trust fund, technology development investment |
| Fiscal crisis forces accelerated closures | Low | High | Pre-planned closure sequences, standing transition authority |

## Critical Path

The critical path for this roadmap runs through congressional authorization of BRAC. All other reforms can proceed in parallel, but the largest savings and the most significant strategic rationalization require the independent commission mechanism. The most likely scenario for BRAC authorization is:

1. A fiscal crisis or defense budget constraint that forces Congress to confront tradeoffs.
2. A champion within congressional leadership (Armed Services Committee chair) who is willing to spend political capital on reform.
3. A bipartisan commission or blue-ribbon panel that provides political cover for action.
4. An administration willing to make BRAC a legislative priority rather than a budget footnote.

Without at least two of these conditions, the roadmap's most impactful phases will remain aspirational.
