# Military Bases: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the misalignment between the U.S. military basing structure and strategic needs requires a multi-pronged approach: reauthorizing an improved BRAC process for domestic installations, optimizing overseas posture through systematic review, accelerating environmental remediation, and providing robust economic transition support for affected communities. Each solution must be designed to overcome the specific political, institutional, and informational barriers identified in the root causes analysis.

## Solution 1: Reauthorize a Modernized BRAC Process

### Problem Addressed

The DoD maintains an estimated 20 percent or more excess domestic infrastructure capacity at a cost of billions annually, but Congress has blocked base closures for nearly two decades because the political costs fall on individual members while the benefits are diffuse.

### Proposal

Authorize a new round of Base Realignment and Closure with reforms that address the legitimate criticisms of BRAC 2005 while preserving the core innovation of an independent commission with binding authority.

**Key Reforms**:

- **Independent Capacity Analysis**: Mandate and fund a comprehensive infrastructure capacity analysis by an independent body (GAO or a newly created entity) before the BRAC commission convenes, addressing the data gap that has undermined credibility.
- **Improved Cost Estimation**: Require the DoD to use standardized, GAO-validated cost-benefit methodologies that account for all major cost categories, including military construction at receiving installations, environmental remediation, and community transition assistance.
- **Transparency Requirements**: All BRAC deliberations, data, and analyses (except genuinely classified material) should be publicly available, reducing concerns about manipulation.
- **Community Transition Fund**: Establish a dedicated, pre-funded community transition fund that is automatically triggered upon BRAC approval, rather than requiring separate appropriations.
- **Environmental Remediation Integration**: Require that environmental remediation plans and cost estimates be developed simultaneously with closure recommendations, rather than as an afterthought.
- **Phased Implementation**: Allow the commission to recommend phased closures over 8-10 years (rather than the current 6-year mandate) to reduce short-term disruption and allow communities more time to transition.

**Expected Outcomes**:

| Metric | Projection |
|---|---|
| Annual savings (steady-state) | $3-5 billion |
| Implementation cost | $20-30 billion (one-time) |
| Breakeven period | 6-10 years |
| Installations affected | 50-100 closures/realignments |
| Excess capacity eliminated | 15-20 percentage points |

### Evidence of Effectiveness

The five completed BRAC rounds collectively generated approximately $10 billion in annual savings. The CBO has consistently found that BRAC is the only proven mechanism for achieving significant base closure savings. International allies (United Kingdom, Canada, Germany) have all undergone major base rationalization programs with demonstrable savings.

## Solution 2: Optimize Overseas Military Posture

### Problem Addressed

The overseas basing network is partially misaligned with the National Defense Strategy's emphasis on great-power competition in the Indo-Pacific. Legacy Cold War positions in Europe absorb significant resources, while the Pacific theater lacks the distributed, resilient basing infrastructure needed to deter China.

### Proposal

Establish a statutory requirement for a Quadrennial Overseas Military Posture Review (OMPR) that systematically evaluates the alignment between overseas basing and national strategy.

**Key Elements**:

- **Comprehensive Review**: Every four years, the DoD must conduct a full review of all overseas installations, evaluating their strategic rationale, cost-effectiveness, host nation relations, and alignment with the NDS.
- **Strategic Criteria**: Basing decisions should be evaluated against explicit criteria:
    - Contribution to deterrence and warfighting capability
    - Cost-effectiveness relative to alternatives (rotation, prepositioning, access agreements)
    - Quality of host nation cost-sharing
    - Environmental sustainability
    - Political sustainability with host nation population
- **Cost-Sharing Enforcement**: Establish minimum host nation cost-sharing benchmarks linked to specific consequences (reduced presence, negotiation of enhanced contributions) for nations that fall below the threshold.
- **Pacific Posture Enhancement**: Accelerate investments in distributed, resilient basing in the Indo-Pacific, including:
    - Expansion of access agreements with Pacific Island nations
    - Hardening and dispersal of facilities in Guam and the Marianas
    - Enhanced prepositioning of equipment and munitions
    - Development of expeditionary airfield and port capabilities

**Expected Outcomes**:

| Metric | Projection |
|---|---|
| Improved strategic alignment | Posture optimized for Indo-Pacific competition |
| Cost savings from rationalization | $2-5 billion annually |
| Increased host nation contributions | 10-20% improvement in cost-sharing |
| Reduced Cold War legacy presence | Gradual, managed drawdowns in Europe |

### Evidence of Effectiveness

The 2004 Global Posture Review successfully initiated the consolidation of U.S. forces in South Korea (from multiple locations to Camp Humphreys) and the reduction of European footprint. However, the review was a one-time effort without the statutory mandate or recurring requirement that would institutionalize ongoing optimization.

## Solution 3: Expand Joint Basing and Multi-Service Consolidation

### Problem Addressed

The military services maintain separate, duplicative installations even when co-location could achieve significant efficiencies. The initial joint basing effort from BRAC 2005 underperformed because it was poorly designed and lacked service buy-in.

### Proposal

Develop a reformed joint basing initiative that addresses the shortcomings of the BRAC 2005 approach:

- **Governance Reform**: Establish a clear unified command structure for joint bases under the Office of the Secretary of Defense, rather than assigning lead service responsibility, which perpetuated service parochialism.
- **Shared Services Model**: Implement common support services (facilities management, utilities, security, transportation) under a single provider at installations where multiple services are co-located.
- **Cross-Service Training**: Co-locate compatible training functions at shared installations to maximize range and facility utilization.
- **Data-Driven Consolidation**: Use facility utilization data to identify installations with complementary underutilization patterns that could benefit from merger.

### Evidence of Effectiveness

The GAO found that BRAC 2005 joint basing failed primarily due to governance problems, not inherent flaws in the concept. International militaries (United Kingdom, Australia, Canada) have achieved significant savings through tri-service basing and shared support services.

## Solution 4: Accelerate Environmental Remediation

### Problem Addressed

Approximately 39,000 contaminated sites at active and former military installations require remediation, with PFAS contamination adding tens of billions in projected costs. The slow pace of cleanup harms communities and creates a barrier to rational basing decisions (because closing installations triggers additional environmental obligations).

### Proposal

- **Dedicated PFAS Remediation Fund**: Establish a separate, mandatory-funded PFAS remediation account outside the normal defense appropriations process, preventing environmental cleanup from competing with operational budgets. Authorize $5 billion per year for 10 years.
- **Accelerated Cleanup Timelines**: Set binding deadlines for completing remedial investigations and remedial actions at the highest-priority sites (those affecting drinking water).
- **Community Health Monitoring**: Fund long-term health surveillance programs for communities affected by military contamination, administered through the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).
- **AFFF Replacement Completion**: Mandate complete replacement of PFAS-containing AFFF with fluorine-free alternatives by a date certain, ending the source of ongoing contamination.
- **Decouple Cleanup from Closure**: Reform the legal framework so that environmental remediation proceeds on the same timeline regardless of whether an installation is open or closed, removing the perverse incentive to keep installations open to defer cleanup.

### Evidence of Effectiveness

The Superfund program has demonstrated that dedicated funding and binding deadlines can accelerate cleanup of contaminated sites. DoD's own DERP program has completed remediation at approximately 80 percent of identified sites, but the remaining 20 percent includes the most complex and expensive cases.

## Solution 5: Community Economic Transition Assistance

### Problem Addressed

Base closures can devastate local economies, particularly in rural and small-city communities with limited alternative economic drivers. Past transition efforts have varied widely in effectiveness, with some communities recovering quickly and others struggling for decades.

### Proposal

- **Pre-Closure Planning**: Begin economic transition planning 3-5 years before any closure takes effect, rather than after the BRAC decision is final.
- **Enhanced Economic Development Grants**: Increase funding for the Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) by an order of magnitude, providing affected communities with $50-100 million in transition grants per major closure.
- **Federal Hiring Preference**: Provide displaced DoD civilian employees with priority placement at other federal agencies within a 100-mile radius for 5 years.
- **Infrastructure Conversion Assistance**: Fund the conversion of military infrastructure (runways, roads, utilities, buildings) to civilian use through grants to Local Redevelopment Authorities (LRAs).
- **Tax Incentives for Redevelopment**: Create designated Opportunity Zones at closed military installations, providing enhanced tax incentives for private investment.
- **Education and Retraining**: Fund community college and workforce development programs specifically tailored to the skills of displaced defense workers.

### Evidence of Effectiveness

The most successful BRAC transitions (Fort Ord to CSU Monterey Bay, Lowry AFB to mixed-use community, former NAS South Weymouth to Southfield) demonstrate that adequate planning, funding, and community leadership can produce positive outcomes. The key variables are time, resources, and the quality of local redevelopment planning.

## Solution 6: Reform Military Construction Prioritization

### Problem Addressed

The $140+ billion deferred maintenance backlog at DoD facilities reflects decades of underinvestment in existing infrastructure, partly because MILCON funding is directed by political considerations rather than facility condition and strategic priority.

### Proposal

- **Condition-Based Prioritization**: Require that MILCON funding be allocated based on objective facility condition assessments and strategic priority, with annual reporting to Congress on the methodology.
- **Demolition Authority**: Provide the DoD with expanded authority and funding to demolish facilities that are beyond economical repair, rather than maintaining them at increasing cost.
- **Energy Resilience Integration**: Require all major MILCON projects to incorporate energy resilience measures (microgrids, renewable energy, battery storage) that reduce vulnerability to grid disruption.
- **Climate Adaptation**: Mandate climate vulnerability assessments for all installations and prioritize MILCON investments that address the most significant risks (sea level rise, extreme heat, wildfire, flooding).

## Cross-Cutting Principles

All of the above solutions share several design principles:

1. **Independence from Parochial Politics**: Basing decisions should be made by independent bodies using transparent criteria, not by Congress member-by-member.
2. **Comprehensive Data**: Decision-making must be grounded in current, credible, and publicly available data on facility utilization, condition, cost, and strategic value.
3. **Fair Transition**: No community should be abandoned. Closure decisions must be paired with robust, pre-funded economic transition assistance.
4. **Environmental Responsibility**: Cleanup obligations must be funded and executed regardless of basing decisions, removing environmental liability as a barrier to rational action.
5. **Strategic Alignment**: The basing structure should serve the National Defense Strategy, not the other way around.
