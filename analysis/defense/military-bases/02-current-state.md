# Military Bases: Current State

## Domestic Installations

### Scale and Distribution

The Department of Defense manages one of the largest real property portfolios in the world. According to the DoD's Base Structure Report and Real Property Profile, the military maintains approximately 4,800 sites within the United States and its territories.

| Category | Approximate Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Major Installations | ~500 | Fort Liberty (NC), Joint Base Lewis-McChord (WA), Naval Station Norfolk (VA) |
| Guard and Reserve Centers | ~1,600 | Armories, reserve training centers |
| Depots, Arsenals, Laboratories | ~60 | Red River Army Depot (TX), Anniston Army Depot (AL) |
| Training Ranges and Areas | ~300 | Fort Irwin NTC (CA), Nellis Test and Training Range (NV) |
| Administrative and Support Sites | ~2,300+ | Recruiting stations, ROTC facilities, storage sites |

**Total Real Property**: The DoD manages approximately 585,000 facilities on 26 million acres of land, with a plant replacement value exceeding $1.2 trillion (DoD Real Property Profile, 2022).

### Excess Capacity

The DoD has consistently estimated that it maintains 20 percent or more excess domestic infrastructure capacity. This figure has appeared in testimony from senior defense officials across multiple administrations:

- In 2016, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work testified that excess capacity was "at least 22 percent."
- In 2017, a DoD-commissioned study estimated excess capacity at 19 percent for the Army, 7 percent for the Navy, 28 percent for the Air Force, and 12 percent for the Defense Logistics Agency.
- Every National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) request from the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations included language requesting BRAC authority, only to have Congress remove it.

**Estimated Cost of Excess Capacity**: Maintaining unused or underutilized installations costs the DoD an estimated $2-6 billion per year in operations and maintenance funding, though precise figures are disputed because the DoD has not been authorized to conduct a comprehensive excess capacity analysis since 2004.

### BRAC Moratorium

Congress has effectively imposed a moratorium on BRAC since the 2005 round. The annual NDAA has repeatedly included language prohibiting the DoD from spending funds to propose or prepare for base closures. This prohibition extends even to conducting the infrastructure studies that would be necessary to support a new BRAC round.

**Key Legislative Barrier**: Section 2687 of Title 10, U.S. Code, requires that any closure or realignment of a military installation where 300 or more civilian personnel are authorized must be done through the BRAC process. Since Congress will not authorize a new BRAC round, this effectively freezes the domestic basing structure in place for any significant changes.

### Joint Basing

Following BRAC 2005, the DoD consolidated 26 installations into 12 joint bases, co-locating facilities from different military services to achieve efficiencies. Results have been mixed:

| Joint Base | Components | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Joint Base Lewis-McChord (WA) | Army + Air Force | Operating, moderate savings |
| Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (HI) | Navy + Air Force | Operating, integration challenges |
| Joint Base San Antonio (TX) | Army + Air Force | Operating, largest joint base |
| Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility Washington (MD) | Air Force + Navy | Operating |
| Joint Base Langley-Eustis (VA) | Air Force + Army | Operating, cultural friction |

**Challenges**: A 2016 GAO report (GAO-16-45) found that the joint basing initiative had not demonstrated the projected savings, largely because service cultures resisted integration and because the business case analysis was inadequate. Some joint base commanders reported that the merger created bureaucratic confusion rather than efficiency.

## Overseas Presence

### Global Footprint

The United States maintains approximately 750 military installations in roughly 80 countries and territories, making its overseas basing network the most extensive in world history. These range from massive, multi-service bases to small cooperative security locations with minimal permanent personnel.

| Category | Approximate Count | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Main Operating Bases (MOBs) | ~60 | Large, permanently manned bases with significant infrastructure (e.g., Ramstein Air Base, Camp Humphreys) |
| Forward Operating Sites (FOS) | ~100 | Smaller bases with rotational or limited permanent presence |
| Cooperative Security Locations (CSLs) | ~300+ | Minimal presence, pre-positioned access agreements |
| Contingency and Temporary Locations | ~290+ | Temporary or operationally driven sites |

### Regional Distribution

| Region | Key Installations | Personnel (Approximate) |
|---|---|---|
| Europe (primarily Germany, Italy, UK) | Ramstein AB, Aviano AB, Grafenwoehr, Lakenheath | ~80,000 |
| East Asia (Japan, South Korea) | Camp Humphreys, Kadena AB, Yokosuka Naval Base | ~80,000 |
| Middle East (Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Djibouti) | Al Udeid AB, NSA Bahrain, Camp Lemonnier | ~45,000 |
| Latin America and Caribbean | Guantanamo Bay, Soto Cano AB (Honduras) | ~5,000 |
| Africa (primarily Djibouti) | Camp Lemonnier | ~7,000 |
| Other (Australia, Diego Garcia, etc.) | Pine Gap, Diego Garcia, Darwin rotation | ~5,000 |

### Indo-Pacific Reposturing

The National Defense Strategy's emphasis on great-power competition, particularly with China, has driven a gradual reposturing of forces toward the Indo-Pacific:

- **Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI)**: Congress authorized over $9 billion in FY2022-FY2025 for enhanced posture in the Pacific, including dispersed basing, prepositioned stocks, and hardened facilities in Guam, Australia, and the Mariana Islands.
- **Guam Buildup**: The relocation of approximately 5,000 Marines from Okinawa to Guam, mandated by the 2006 U.S.-Japan Realignment Roadmap, remains ongoing with costs exceeding $11 billion.
- **Distributed Operations Concept**: The Marine Corps and Air Force are shifting from large, concentrated bases (vulnerable to Chinese missile attack) toward a concept of agile, distributed operations using smaller, more dispersed locations across the Pacific island chains.

### Host Nation Cost-Sharing

Allied nations contribute varying amounts toward the cost of hosting U.S. forces:

| Country | Arrangement | Annual Contribution (Estimated) |
|---|---|---|
| Japan | Special Measures Agreement (SMA) | ~$1.9 billion |
| South Korea | Special Measures Agreement | ~$1.1 billion |
| Germany | In-kind support (infrastructure, utilities) | ~$1.0 billion (estimated) |
| Qatar | Construction and in-kind support | Significant (classified) |
| Other NATO Allies | In-kind, infrastructure | Varies |

**Burden-Sharing Debate**: U.S. administrations have increasingly demanded greater cost-sharing from allies. Japan covers approximately 75 percent of the costs of hosting U.S. forces, South Korea approximately 50 percent, and European nations substantially less. Negotiations over these agreements are politically sensitive in both the United States and host nations.

## Environmental Remediation

### Contamination Scale

Military operations have left a massive environmental remediation legacy across thousands of sites:

- **Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP)**: The DoD manages approximately 39,000 contaminated sites at active installations and Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS).
- **Active Installations**: Approximately 2,700 sites at active bases are undergoing investigation or cleanup.
- **Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS)**: Over 9,400 properties that the DoD formerly owned or used have identified contamination requiring response.
- **Completed Cleanups**: As of FY2023, the DoD reported that approximately 85 percent of active installation sites and 79 percent of FUDS sites had completed cleanup or had remedies in place.

### PFAS Contamination

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), widely used in Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) for firefighting at military airfields, have emerged as the most significant and costly contamination challenge:

- The DoD has identified over 700 installations where PFAS contamination is known or suspected.
- The estimated cost of PFAS remediation across DoD facilities ranges from $30 billion to over $50 billion, depending on cleanup standards adopted.
- In 2023, the EPA finalized drinking water standards for several PFAS compounds, significantly increasing the DoD's remediation obligations.
- Affected communities near bases like Peterson Space Force Base (CO), Pease Air National Guard Base (NH), and Naval Air Station Pensacola (FL) have reported elevated PFAS levels in drinking water.

### Remediation Funding

| Fiscal Year | DERP Funding (Active) | DERP Funding (FUDS) | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| FY2023 | $2.2 billion | $400 million | ~$2.6 billion |
| FY2024 (Request) | $2.5 billion | $450 million | ~$3.0 billion |
| Estimated Remaining Liability | $50+ billion (with PFAS) | $10+ billion | $60+ billion |

## Military Construction (MILCON)

The DoD's annual military construction budget funds new construction and major renovations at installations. In recent years, MILCON has averaged $12-15 billion annually, but the backlog of deferred maintenance and modernization needs far exceeds current funding.

- **Deferred Maintenance Backlog**: Estimated at over $140 billion across DoD facilities (DoD, 2023).
- **Condition of Facilities**: The DoD reports that a significant portion of its building inventory is in "poor" or "failing" condition, including barracks, maintenance facilities, and training infrastructure.
- **Natural Disaster Impacts**: Installations in vulnerable areas have suffered billions in damage from hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires, with Tyndall Air Force Base (FL) alone requiring over $5 billion to rebuild after Hurricane Michael in 2018.
