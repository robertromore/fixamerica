# Military Bases: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

This document presents two major federal bills addressing the misalignment of U.S. military basing infrastructure with strategic needs. The first bill reauthorizes and modernizes the Base Realignment and Closure process for domestic installations, while the second establishes a statutory framework for optimizing overseas military posture. Together, these bills aim to eliminate excess domestic capacity, align overseas presence with the National Defense Strategy, protect affected communities, and accelerate environmental remediation.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Base Realignment and Closure Reauthorization Act

**Purpose**: To authorize a new round of Base Realignment and Closure with modernized criteria, enhanced community transition funds, and integrated environmental cleanup mandates, addressing the structural barriers that have prevented rational basing decisions since 2005.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Base Realignment and Closure
Reauthorization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
    (1) The Department of Defense has consistently estimated that
    it maintains 20 percent or more excess domestic infrastructure
    capacity, at an annual cost of billions of dollars.
    (2) The last Base Realignment and Closure round was
    authorized in 2001 and executed in 2005, and no new round has
    been authorized in over two decades.
    (3) Excess infrastructure capacity diverts resources from
    military readiness, modernization, and force structure.
    (4) The BRAC process remains the only proven mechanism for
    achieving significant base closure savings.
    (5) Legitimate concerns about the cost, transparency, and
    community impact of prior BRAC rounds must be addressed
    through process reforms.
    (6) Environmental remediation obligations at military
    installations must be integrated into basing decisions rather
    than deferred.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
    (a) COMMISSION.—The term "Commission" means the Defense
    Base Realignment and Closure Commission established under
    section 5.
    (b) EXCESS CAPACITY.—The term "excess capacity" means
    infrastructure, facilities, or land held by the Department of
    Defense in excess of the requirements necessary to support the

```

**Explanation**:

This bill addresses the key failures of past BRAC rounds while preserving the core mechanism that makes BRAC effective:

- **Independent Capacity Analysis (Section 4)**: Addresses the data gap by requiring GAO to conduct the analysis that Congress has blocked the DoD from performing, ensuring that BRAC decisions are grounded in credible, current data.
- **Improved Cost Methodology (Section 6(c))**: Requires standardized, externally validated cost estimates to prevent the cost overruns that plagued BRAC 2005.
- **Community Transition Fund (Section 9)**: Pre-funds transition assistance rather than relying on subsequent appropriations, ensuring that affected communities receive support automatically.
- **Environmental Integration (Section 10)**: Requires concurrent environmental planning and remediation, rather than deferring cleanup to after closure.
- **Extended Implementation Timeline (Section 8(d))**: Allows 10 years for implementation (versus 6 in prior rounds), giving communities more time to transition and reducing short-term costs.
- **Anti-Circumvention (Section 11)**: Prevents the DoD from effectively closing bases through gradual drawdowns that avoid BRAC scrutiny.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Congressional opposition remains the dominant barrier, and the bill's all-or-nothing mechanism, while essential, is precisely what makes members uncomfortable.
- The $5 billion annual community transition fund may be criticized as excessive spending.
- Environmental remediation requirements could significantly increase the total cost of the BRAC round.

**Refinements**:

- Consider a provision allowing a limited number of installations (3-5) to be designated for "enhanced review" that gives Congress an additional 90-day comment period before closure proceeds.
- Add a requirement that the Commission include at least 2 members with experience in community economic development.
- Establish a pilot program for "virtual BRAC" that allows consolidation of headquarters functions without physical closure of installations.

### Bill 2: Overseas Military Posture Optimization Act

**Purpose**: To establish a statutory framework for aligning overseas military posture with the National Defense Strategy through quadrennial reviews, cost-sharing enforcement, and strategic posture optimization, ensuring that the overseas basing network serves current and projected threats rather than historical inertia.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Overseas Military Posture
Optimization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
    (1) The United States maintains approximately 750 military
    installations in approximately 80 countries and territories.
    (2) This overseas basing network was largely established
    during the Cold War and has not been comprehensively reviewed
    on a recurring basis.
    (3) The National Defense Strategy identifies great-power
    competition, particularly with the People's Republic of
    China, as the primary strategic challenge.
    (4) Significant portions of the overseas basing network
    reflect Cold War-era priorities that may not align with
    current strategic requirements.
    (5) Host nation cost-sharing arrangements vary widely and
    are not systematically evaluated against strategic value.
    (6) The Indo-Pacific theater requires enhanced, distributed,
    and resilient basing to support deterrence and, if
    necessary, warfighting.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
    (a) OVERSEAS MILITARY INSTALLATION.—The term "overseas
    military installation" means any military installation,
    facility, or site outside the 50 States and the District
    of Columbia that is owned, leased, operated, or controlled
    by the Department of Defense.
    (b) HOST NATION.—The term "host nation" means any foreign
    government that has entered into an agreement with the
    United States to permit the stationing of United States
    Armed Forces on its territory.
    (c) COST-SHARING.—The term "cost-sharing" means the
    monetary and in-kind contributions provided by a host nation
    toward the cost of maintaining United States military
    presence on its territory, including direct payments,
    construction, utilities, labor, and land provision.

SEC. 4. QUADRENNIAL OVERSEAS MILITARY POSTURE REVIEW.

    (a) REQUIREMENT.—Beginning not later than 2 years after the
    date of enactment of this Act, and every 4 years thereafter,
    the Secretary of Defense shall conduct a comprehensive review
    of all overseas military installations and submit a report
    to the congressional defense committees.
    (b) CONTENTS.—Each review shall include—
        (1) an assessment of each overseas installation against
        the following criteria:
            (A) contribution to deterrence and warfighting
            capability as defined by the current National
            Defense Strategy;
            (B) cost-effectiveness relative to alternatives,
            including rotational presence, prepositioning, and
            access agreements;
            (C) quality of host nation cost-sharing;
            (D) political sustainability with the host nation
            government and population;
            (E) environmental sustainability and compliance with
            host nation environmental standards;
            (F) vulnerability to adversary strike, natural
            disaster, or political disruption;
        (2) specific recommendations for installations to be
        closed, reduced, expanded, or established;
        (3) a plan for implementing recommended changes,
        including diplomatic engagement, construction timelines,
        and cost estimates;
        (4) an assessment of host nation cost-sharing across all
        allies and partners hosting U.S. forces, with
        recommendations for adjustments.
    (c) CLASSIFICATION.—The review shall be submitted in both
    classified and unclassified forms.
    (d) CONSULTATION.—The Secretary shall consult with the
    Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence,
    and combatant commanders in preparing the review.

SEC. 5. HOST NATION COST-SHARING FRAMEWORK.

    (a) BENCHMARKS.—Not later than 1 year after the date of
    enactment, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with
    the Secretary of State, shall establish cost-sharing
    benchmarks for each category of host nation based on:
        (1) the host nation's gross domestic product;
        (2) the direct security benefit the host nation derives
        from United States military presence;
        (3) the scope and scale of United States installations
        and personnel in the host nation; and
        (4) the host nation's own defense spending as a
        percentage of GDP.
    (b) REPORTING.—The Secretary shall include in each annual
    budget submission a report on the status of cost-sharing
    negotiations with each host nation, including—
        (1) the current level of host nation contributions
        (monetary and in-kind);
        (2) the benchmark level established under subsection (a);
        (3) any shortfall between current contributions and
        the benchmark; and
        (4) a plan for addressing identified shortfalls.
    (c) CONSEQUENCES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE.—
        (1) If a host nation's cost-sharing contribution falls
        below 75 percent of the established benchmark for 2
        consecutive fiscal years, the Secretary shall—
            (A) notify the host nation government of the
            shortfall;
            (B) initiate negotiations for enhanced contributions;
            and
            (C) include in the next quadrennial review a specific
            assessment of whether continued presence at current
            levels is justified absent adequate cost-sharing.
        (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to
        require the withdrawal of forces from any location where
        continued presence is determined essential to national
        security, regardless of cost-sharing levels.

SEC. 6. INDO-PACIFIC POSTURE ENHANCEMENT.

    (a) PRIORITY.—The Secretary shall prioritize investments in
    distributed, resilient basing infrastructure in the
    Indo-Pacific theater, consistent with the National Defense
    Strategy.
    (b) SPECIFIC ACTIONS.—The Secretary shall—
        (1) expand access agreements and cooperative security
        locations across the Pacific Island nations, Southeast
        Asia, and Oceania;
        (2) accelerate the hardening and dispersal of facilities
        in Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
        Islands, and other forward locations;
        (3) enhance prepositioning of equipment, munitions, and
        sustainment supplies at distributed locations;
        (4) develop expeditionary airfield and port capabilities
        that reduce dependence on large, fixed installations
        vulnerable to precision strike;
        (5) invest in fuel and logistics infrastructure that
        supports distributed operations across the island
        chains.
    (c) COORDINATION WITH ALLIES.—The Secretary shall coordinate
    Indo-Pacific posture enhancements with allied nations,
    including Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, and the
    Philippines, through existing alliance mechanisms.
    (d) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There is authorized to
    be appropriated $3,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027
    through 2031 for Indo-Pacific posture enhancement activities
    under this section, in addition to amounts authorized under
    the Pacific Deterrence Initiative.

SEC. 7. POSTURE CHANGES ALIGNED TO STRATEGY.

    (a) PROHIBITION ON ARBITRARY REDUCTIONS.—The Secretary may
    not reduce the total number of overseas military personnel
    by more than 10 percent from the level maintained on the
    date of enactment of this Act without certification to
    Congress that such reduction is consistent with the
    National Defense Strategy and has been coordinated with
    affected allies.
    (b) PROHIBITION ON PUNITIVE REDUCTIONS.—No reduction in
    overseas military presence shall be directed for the
    purpose of penalizing an ally for disagreement on
    non-security matters unrelated to the basing arrangement.
    (c) ALLIED CONSULTATION.—Before implementing any
    significant reduction in forces stationed in an allied
    nation, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State
    shall consult with the affected ally and provide not fewer
    than 180 days notice.

SEC. 8. ANNUAL REPORTING.

    (a) The Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense
    committees an annual report on the implementation of this
    Act, including—
        (1) the status of the quadrennial review;
        (2) cost-sharing levels for each host nation;
        (3) progress on Indo-Pacific posture enhancement;
        (4) any changes to the overseas installation inventory;
        and
        (5) estimated costs and savings from posture changes.
    (b) The report shall be submitted in both classified and
    unclassified forms.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

This bill creates a systematic, recurring framework for overseas basing decisions that does not currently exist in statute:

- **Quadrennial Review (Section 4)**: Institutionalizes what has historically been an ad hoc process, ensuring that overseas posture is evaluated against current strategy every four years.
- **Cost-Sharing Framework (Section 5)**: Establishes transparent benchmarks for host nation contributions, creating leverage for negotiations while avoiding punitive or destabilizing withdrawals.
- **Indo-Pacific Enhancement (Section 6)**: Provides dedicated funding for the distributed basing concept necessary to deter China, complementing the Pacific Deterrence Initiative.
- **Safeguards (Section 7)**: Prevents arbitrary or punitive reductions in overseas presence, protecting alliance relationships while still enabling strategic optimization.

**Potential Challenges**:

- The cost-sharing benchmarks may face diplomatic resistance from allies who view them as coercive.
- The quadrennial review cycle may not align well with the four-year National Defense Strategy cycle, creating potential timing conflicts.
- The $3 billion annual Indo-Pacific authorization may face competition from other defense priorities.

**Refinements**:

- Consider a provision requiring the review to assess the environmental impact of overseas installations and compliance with host nation environmental regulations.
- Add a requirement for congressional notification before establishing any new permanent overseas installation.
- Include a classified annex provision for sensitive aspects of allied cost-sharing negotiations.

## State Model Legislation

State legislation is not directly applicable to military basing decisions, as these are exclusively federal matters under the Property Clause (Art. IV, Sec. 3, Cl. 2) and the Commander in Chief power (Art. II, Sec. 2). However, states can take supportive actions:

### Model State Military Community Resilience Act

**Purpose**: To prepare state economies and communities for potential base realignment or closure by promoting economic diversification and transition planning.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Military Community
Resilience Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
(a) The legislature finds that military installations are
significant economic assets but that over-dependence on any
single employer creates economic vulnerability.
(b) The purpose of this Act is to promote economic
diversification in military-dependent communities to enhance
resilience.

SECTION 3. MILITARY COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION PROGRAM.
(a) There is established within the [Department of Commerce/
Economic Development] a Military Community Economic
Diversification Program.
(b) The Program shall provide technical assistance and grants
to counties and municipalities in which a military installation
accounts for more than 15 percent of local employment or
economic output.
(c) Eligible activities include:
    (1) economic development planning;
    (2) workforce development and retraining;
    (3) infrastructure improvements to support economic
    diversification;
    (4) attraction of private investment to military-dependent
    areas; and
    (5) development of educational institutions and research
    facilities.

SECTION 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
There is appropriated from the general fund $[X] for each
fiscal year to carry out this Act.
```

**Adaptations**: States with multiple major installations (Texas, California, Virginia, Florida, North Carolina) should scale funding proportionally. States with single dominant installations should focus on intensive transition planning.

## Regulatory Framework

### DoD Directive: Installation Utilization Reporting

**Existing Authority**: 10 U.S.C. Section 2684a (military installation resilience) and 10 U.S.C. Section 2802 (military construction authority).

**Draft Regulation**: The Secretary of Defense should issue a directive requiring each military service to report annually on facility utilization rates, condition assessments, and excess capacity at all installations with a plant replacement value exceeding $100 million. Reports should use standardized metrics developed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment.

**Explanation**: This administrative action can proceed without legislation and would begin building the data infrastructure needed for future BRAC rounds or alternative rationalization mechanisms.

### EPA Regulation: Military Installation PFAS Standards

**Existing Authority**: CERCLA Section 120 (federal facility compliance), Safe Drinking Water Act.

**Draft Regulation**: The EPA should issue a rule requiring the DoD to complete PFAS site investigations at all active military installations where AFFF was used within 5 years, with remedial action commencing within 7 years. Interim measures, including provision of alternative water supplies, should be required within 6 months of identifying contamination above Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs).

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Property Clause**: Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants Congress plenary authority over the "Territory or other Property belonging to the United States." This provides a clear constitutional basis for BRAC legislation and all federal basing decisions. The Supreme Court's decision in *Kleppe v. New Mexico*, 426 U.S. 529 (1976), affirmed that congressional power over federal property "has no limitations."

**Non-Delegation Doctrine**: The BRAC process delegates significant authority to an independent commission. In *National Federation of Federal Employees v. Cheney*, 883 F.2d 1038 (D.C. Cir. 1989), the D.C. Circuit upheld the constitutionality of this delegation, finding that the BRAC statute provided sufficient "intelligible principle" to guide the commission's decisions. The proposed bill maintains this framework with enhanced criteria that further satisfy the intelligible principle requirement.

**Judicial Review**: In *Dalton v. Specter*, 511 U.S. 462 (1994), the Supreme Court held that BRAC commission decisions are not subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act because the final decision-maker is the President, whose actions are not reviewable under the APA. This precedent should apply to the proposed bill as well.

### NEPA Compliance

The National Environmental Policy Act requires environmental impact analysis for major federal actions significantly affecting the environment. Base closures trigger NEPA requirements, which can add time and cost to the process. The proposed bill's integrated environmental planning provisions (Section 10) are designed to streamline this process by conducting environmental analysis concurrently with closure planning.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **BRAC Bill**: Enforcement is built into the all-or-nothing mechanism: once Congress fails to disapprove the list, implementation becomes a statutory mandate. The Secretary of Defense is required to execute closures within the statutory timeline.
- **Overseas Posture Bill**: Enforcement relies on reporting requirements, congressional oversight, and the quadrennial review cycle. The cost-sharing provisions include specific consequences for non-compliance but preserve executive flexibility on national security grounds.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Base Realignment and Closure Reauthorization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Commission appointment manipulation | President could appoint commissioners sympathetic to protecting favored installations | High |
| Data manipulation by services | Military services control utilization data and could underreport excess capacity to protect preferred bases | High |
| Extended timeline exploitation | The 10-year implementation window could be used to delay closures indefinitely through slow-rolling | Medium |
| Classified annex shield | Genuine national security concerns could be invoked to shield bases from closure for non-security reasons | Medium |
| Transition fund diversion | Community transition funds could be redirected to politically favored communities rather than those most in need | Medium |
| Incremental drawdown before BRAC | DoD could reduce installations below the 300-civilian threshold before BRAC convenes, excluding them from the process | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Single-round authorization | Only addresses current excess; capacity may re-accumulate | Political difficulty of recurring authorization |
| No enforcement of savings reinvestment | Savings from closures could be redirected to non-readiness purposes | Congressional appropriations discretion |
| Limited scope for Guard/Reserve | National Guard installations may be politically protected even if excess | Federal-state dual authority over Guard |
| Environmental costs may exceed savings | PFAS remediation at closing installations could be extremely expensive | Scale of contamination legacy |
| Community recovery is not guaranteed | Some communities, especially rural ones, may not recover even with assistance | Structural economic limitations |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Commission Independence**: Require that at least 4 of 9 commissioners be nominated by bipartisan congressional leadership (2 by each party's Armed Services Committee leadership), reducing presidential control over composition.
2. **Data Verification**: Require the GAO to independently verify all installation utilization data submitted by the services, with penalties for misrepresentation.
3. **Implementation Milestones**: Establish binding interim milestones (e.g., 50 percent of closures completed by year 5) with mandatory reporting to Congress.
4. **Classified Review**: Require that the Inspector General of the DoD review all classified exemption claims and certify their validity.
5. **Needs-Based Allocation**: Establish a formula for transition fund distribution based on objective economic distress indicators (unemployment rate, median income, economic diversity index), with the GAO auditing allocations annually.
6. **Recurring Authorization**: Include a provision that automatically triggers a new BRAC round every 10 years unless Congress affirmatively votes to postpone, reversing the current default.

### Overseas Military Posture Optimization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Review without action | The quadrennial review could become a bureaucratic exercise that produces reports without driving actual posture changes | High |
| Cost-sharing benchmark gaming | DoD could set benchmarks low enough that all allies appear compliant, avoiding diplomatic friction at the expense of fairness | Medium |
| National security waiver abuse | The Section 5(c)(2) national security exception could be used to exempt any installation from cost-sharing requirements | Medium |
| Ally consultation as veto | The 180-day consultation requirement could be exploited by allies to indefinitely delay posture changes | Medium |
| Indo-Pacific funding diversion | Authorized funds could be diverted to non-Pacific requirements through reprogramming | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| No binding closure authority | The review only recommends; it does not compel overseas closures | Diplomatic and executive branch prerogatives |
| Limited environmental provisions | Environmental standards at overseas installations are not addressed | Sovereignty and jurisdictional complexity |
| Host nation political changes | Posture reviews may be overtaken by political changes in host nations | Inherent diplomatic uncertainty |
| Four-year cycle may be too slow | Threat environment changes faster than quadrennial reviews | Bureaucratic planning timelines |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Action-Forcing Provisions**: Require the Secretary to certify that each quadrennial review resulted in specific, measurable posture changes, or explain in writing to Congress why no changes were warranted.
2. **Benchmark Transparency**: Require that cost-sharing benchmarks be established through a publicly available methodology reviewed by the GAO, preventing quiet manipulation.
3. **Waiver Limitations**: Require that any national security waiver of cost-sharing requirements be reviewed by the Inspector General and renewed annually.
4. **Expedited Review Authority**: Authorize the Secretary to conduct interim posture reviews in response to significant changes in the security environment, in addition to the quadrennial cycle.
5. **Funding Protection**: Prohibit reprogramming of Indo-Pacific posture enhancement funds to other purposes without prior congressional notification and a 30-day waiting period.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|---|---|
| Political will deficit | Tie BRAC authorization to defense spending caps that force tradeoffs |
| Inter-service coordination failures | Assign a single Under Secretary-level official responsibility for all basing decisions |
| Environmental liability uncertainty | Fund a comprehensive environmental liability assessment as a prerequisite to BRAC |
| Alliance diplomatic friction | Conduct overseas reviews in close coordination with State Department and through alliance consultative mechanisms |
| Data standardization | Mandate a single, DoD-wide installation data system with standardized metrics |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The BRAC Commission's authority sunsets 2 years after transmitting recommendations.
- The Community Transition Fund remains available until expended but is subject to annual GAO audit.
- The overseas posture review requirement is permanent but subject to amendment through subsequent legislation.
- All reporting requirements should be reviewed every 5 years for continued relevance.
