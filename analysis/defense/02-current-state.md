# Defense Industrial Base: Current State

## Industry Consolidation

The U.S. defense industry has consolidated dramatically since the end of the Cold War. In the early 1990s, there were over 50 prime aerospace and defense contractors. Today, there are five.

### Top 5 U.S. Defense Contractors by Revenue (FY2023)

| Rank | Company | FY2023 Defense Revenue | Key Programs / Specialties |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Lockheed Martin | ~$67 billion | F-35, F-22, Black Hawk helicopters, missile defense |
| 2 | RTX (Raytheon) | ~$42 billion | Missiles (Tomahawk, AMRAAM), radars, sensors, Pratt & Whitney engines |
| 3 | Northrop Grumman | ~$33 billion | B-21 Raider, B-2, Sentinel ICBM, James Webb Space Telescope |
| 4 | Boeing | ~$30 billion | F/A-18, F-15, P-8, KC-46 tanker, commercial aircraft |
| 5 | General Dynamics | ~$30 billion | Columbia-class & Virginia-class submarines, Abrams tanks, destroyers |

This consolidation extends to key sub-tiers. For example, there is only one U.S. company capable of building nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (HII) and only one capable of building main battle tanks (General Dynamics).

## Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Decades of globalization and offshoring have created critical dependencies on foreign suppliers, particularly China.

### Key Vulnerable Sectors

| Sector | Vulnerability | Key Materials / Components | Primary Foreign Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Microelectronics** | The U.S. has offshored most advanced semiconductor manufacturing. | Advanced logic chips, memory chips | **Taiwan** (TSMC), South Korea (Samsung) |
| **Rare Earth Elements** | Essential for magnets in jet engines, missile guidance, and sensors. | Neodymium, dysprosium, terbium | **China** (controls >85% of global processing) |
| **Rocket Motors & Munitions** | Key energetic materials and precursor chemicals are no longer produced domestically. | Solid rocket motors, TNT, RDX, ammonium perchlorate | **China**, India |
| **Castings & Forgings** | Large, complex metal castings and forgings for ship propellers, tank hulls, and aircraft structures. | Specialty steel, aluminum, titanium | Limited domestic capacity; reliance on a few global suppliers. |
| **Pharmaceuticals** | The active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for many critical medicines are produced overseas. | Penicillin, antibiotics, anesthetics | **China**, India |

## Production and Surge Capacity

The DIB is optimized for peacetime efficiency, not wartime scale. Production lines are "cold" or operate at low rates, and it can take years to ramp up.

### Munitions Production Examples

| Munition | Pre-Ukraine War Annual Production | Post-Ukraine War Target Production | Time to Double Production |
|---|---|---|---|
| **155mm Artillery Shells** | ~14,000 / month | ~100,000 / month | ~3-4 years |
| **Javelin Anti-Tank Missiles** | ~2,100 / year | ~4,000 / year | ~2 years |
| **Stinger Anti-Air Missiles** | Very low rate; line was nearly closed. | ~6,000 / year | ~2-3 years |

The long lead times are due to workforce shortages, fragile supply chains for components (like rocket motors), and the need to build new facilities and train workers.

## Workforce Challenges

- **Aging Workforce**: The average age of a skilled worker in many critical defense trades (e.g., welding, machining in shipyards and arsenals) is over 50. A "silver tsunami" of retirements is looming.
- **Skills Gap**: There is a significant shortage of workers with the required skills in STEM fields, advanced manufacturing, and cybersecurity.
- **Security Clearances**: The slow and cumbersome security clearance process is a major barrier to hiring new talent, especially from the tech sector. It can take over a year to get a Top Secret clearance.

## Barriers to Entry for New Companies

Innovative commercial technology companies and startups face significant hurdles to working with the DoD.

- **Acquisition Bureaucracy**: The DoD's traditional acquisition process is designed for large, multi-decade programs and is too slow and complex for software companies that operate on rapid development cycles.
- **Regulatory Burden**: Compliance with complex regulations like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) is costly and difficult for small companies.
- **"Valley of Death"**: Many startups with promising technology fail to cross the "valley of death"—the gap between winning a small R&D contract and securing a large, stable production contract (a "program of record").
