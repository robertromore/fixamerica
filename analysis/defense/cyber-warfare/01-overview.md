# Cyber Warfare: Overview

## Overview

Cyberspace is a critical domain of national security, underpinning the U.S. economy, critical infrastructure, and military operations. It is also a domain of constant conflict. The United States faces persistent cyberattacks from state and non-state actors who seek to steal data, disrupt critical services, and undermine democratic processes. In response, the Department of Defense (DoD) has adopted a more assertive cyber strategy, moving from a reactive, defensive posture to a proactive doctrine of "persistent engagement" and "defending forward."

This strategy, executed by U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), involves actively hunting for adversary activity on allied and partner networks to disrupt threats before they reach U.S. shores. This proactive stance is necessary in an offense-dominant domain, but it creates significant strategic and legal challenges. It blurs the line between intelligence gathering and military action, raises risks of unintended escalation, and creates complex dependencies on the private sector, which owns and operates the vast majority of the infrastructure at risk. The central challenge for U.S. policy is to deter significant attacks in cyberspace without triggering a catastrophic conflict.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of U.S. military cyber operations:

- **U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM)**: The mission, structure, and budget of the lead military command for cyberspace operations.
- **Strategic Doctrine**: The shift to "persistent engagement" and "defend forward."
- **Offensive and Defensive Operations**: The capabilities and legal frameworks for both defending DoD networks and conducting offensive cyber operations.
- **Adversary Threats**: The capabilities and doctrines of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
- **Public-Private Partnership**: The complex relationship between the government and the private sector in defending critical infrastructure.
- **Deterrence and Escalation**: The challenge of applying traditional deterrence theory to the cyber domain.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Lead Military Command | U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) | DoD |
| USCYBERCOM Budget Request (FY2025) | ~$14.5 billion (for cyber activities) | DoD, 2024 |
| Cyber Mission Force (CMF) Personnel | ~6,800 (133 teams) | USCYBERCOM, 2024 |
| Key Strategic Doctrine | Persistent Engagement / Defend Forward | 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy |
| Key Civilian Agency Partner | Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) | DHS |
| Key Intelligence Partner | National Security Agency (NSA) | DoD |
| Major State Adversaries | China, Russia, Iran, North Korea | DNI Annual Threat Assessment |
| Key Legislation (Reporting) | Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA) of 2022 | Public Law 117-103 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Defend Forward vs. Sovereignty**: The doctrine of "defending forward" on foreign networks, even with partner consent, can be seen by adversaries as an intrusion into their sovereign territory, increasing escalation risks.
- **Offense vs. Defense**: Every offensive cyber tool or vulnerability the U.S. develops and keeps secret is one that cannot be disclosed to the private sector to patch defenses. This is the "vulnerabilities equities process" dilemma.
- **Security vs. Civil Liberties**: The tools used to monitor foreign adversary networks can also sweep up the communications of U.S. persons, creating a fundamental tension with privacy rights.
- **Attribution vs. Response**: It can be difficult and time-consuming to definitively attribute a cyberattack. This "attribution problem" complicates efforts to respond in a timely and proportionate manner.
- **Public-Private Partnership**: The government needs the private sector's cooperation to defend critical infrastructure, but private companies are often wary of government intrusion and liability concerns.

## Key Questions

1. How can the U.S. effectively deter a major cyberattack when the threat of a proportional "cyber-for-cyber" response may not be credible?
2. What is the proper division of labor between the government (DoD, CISA) and the private sector in defending critical infrastructure?
3. Are the current legal and policy frameworks (e.g., AUMFs, presidential authorities) adequate for governing offensive cyber operations?
4. How can the U.S. and its allies establish international norms of behavior to prevent catastrophic escalation in cyberspace?

## Vision of Success

A successful U.S. cyber warfare policy would:

- **Maintain a Credible Deterrent**: Adversaries are convinced that the costs of launching a significant cyberattack against U.S. critical infrastructure far outweigh any potential benefits.
- **Achieve Cyber Resilience**: The U.S. can withstand and rapidly recover from a major cyberattack, ensuring the continuity of government and essential services.
- **Foster a Seamless Public-Private Defense**: The government and the private sector work in close partnership, sharing threat information and coordinating defensive actions in real-time.
- **Establish International Norms**: The U.S. leads a global coalition in establishing and enforcing clear "rules of the road" for state behavior in cyberspace.
