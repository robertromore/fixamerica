# Cyber Warfare: What You Can Do

While much of cyber warfare is conducted by secret government agencies, citizens and private companies have a critical role to play in national cyber defense. In this domain, individual and corporate actions can have a direct impact on national security.

## 1. For Individuals: Practice Cyber Hygiene

National resilience starts with individual security. Simple personal cybersecurity practices can make it harder for adversaries to succeed.

- **Use Strong, Unique Passwords**: Use a password manager to create and store complex, unique passwords for every account.
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Turn on MFA (e.g., via an authenticator app) for all important accounts, especially email and financial services. This is the single most effective step you can take to protect your accounts.
- **Update Your Software**: Keep your operating system, web browser, and applications updated to ensure you have the latest security patches.
- **Be Skeptical of Phishing**: Be wary of unsolicited emails, texts, or calls asking for personal information. Verify requests through a separate, trusted channel.

## 2. For Businesses: Build a Culture of Security

- **Implement a Security Framework**: Adopt a recognized cybersecurity framework, such as the one provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
- **Train Your Employees**: Your employees are your first line of defense. Conduct regular training on how to spot phishing attacks and practice good security hygiene.
- **Report Incidents**: If you experience a significant cyber incident, report it to CISA and the FBI. Your information can help the government identify and disrupt broader adversary campaigns.
- **Invest in Resilience**: Don't just focus on prevention. Invest in robust backup and recovery systems so you can get back online quickly after an attack.

## 3. Engage in the Policy Debate

- **Advocate for Privacy and Oversight**: Support organizations that advocate for strong privacy laws and robust oversight of government surveillance activities.
- **Support Public-Private Partnerships**: Encourage your company and industry associations to participate in information sharing programs like those run by CISA.
- **Ask Questions**: At town halls, ask your elected officials what they are doing to secure critical infrastructure in your community and to establish clear international rules for cyberspace.
