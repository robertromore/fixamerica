# Cyber Warfare: Reform Roadmap

Strengthening U.S. cyber defenses and deterrence requires a phased approach that prioritizes clarifying policy and roles in the short term, building new institutions and partnerships in the medium term, and achieving long-term resilience and international stability.

---

## Phase 1: Policy and Partnership Foundations (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on immediate legislative and executive actions to clarify U.S. deterrence policy and remove barriers to public-private partnership.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Issue Declaratory Policy** | The President issues a formal declaratory policy on cross-domain deterrence for cyberattacks. | Policy is publicly released and briefed to allies. |
| **2. Pass Liability Shield Legislation** | Congress passes legislation providing a "safe harbor" for companies that share cyber threat information with the government. | Law is enacted. CISA reports a measurable increase in voluntary information sharing from the private sector. |
| **3. Separate the "Dual Hat"** | The President, with Senate confirmation, appoints separate four-star generals to lead USCYBERCOM and the NSA. | Two separate commanders are in place. |
| **4. Launch Norms Initiative** | The State Department launches a major diplomatic initiative to build a coalition around "red lines" for cyber behavior. | First international conference is held; a draft declaration of norms is produced. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Establish a clear and credible deterrence posture and create the legal and political conditions for a true public-private partnership.

## Phase 2: Building Resilience and New Institutions (Years 3-5)

This phase focuses on implementing the structural changes needed to build a more resilient infrastructure and a deeper talent pool.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Establish "Cyber National Guard"** | Congress passes legislation authorizing and funding a new "Cyber National Guard" reserve component. | First cohort of 500 private sector experts is commissioned and completes initial training. |
| **2. Implement Critical Infrastructure Standards** | CISA, using its regulatory authority, issues binding minimum cybersecurity standards for the energy and water sectors. | Standards are finalized and published. |
| **3. Empower CISA** | Congress increases CISA's budget by 50% and formally designates it as the lead agency for domestic cyber response. | Budget is appropriated. National response plan is updated to reflect CISA's lead role. |
| **4. Solidify International Norms** | The U.S. and at least 20 other nations formally sign a joint declaration on norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace. | Declaration is signed and published. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Move from policy to practice by building the new institutions and regulatory frameworks for a more defensible nation.

## Phase 3: Achieving a Resilient and Stable Cyber Domain (Years 6-10)

This phase focuses on seeing the long-term benefits of a more resilient infrastructure and a more stable international environment.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. A Resilient Grid** | The energy sector has broadly implemented the new cybersecurity standards, including segmented networks and redundant control systems. | A major joint exercise successfully demonstrates that the power grid can withstand and rapidly recover from a simulated state-level cyberattack. |
| **A Functioning Public-Private Defense** | The Cyber National Guard is fully operational and has been successfully mobilized to assist in responding to a major incident. | The Guard is declared at Full Operational Capability (FOC). |
| **Enforced International Norms** | The international coalition successfully imposes joint sanctions on a state that violates the established "red lines." | First joint sanctions are imposed and have a measurable economic impact on the target nation. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: The U.S. has achieved a state of "deterrence by denial," where its critical infrastructure is so resilient that a catastrophic attack is no longer a credible option for an adversary, and a baseline of global stability is established through international norms.
