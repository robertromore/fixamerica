# Cyber Warfare

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of U.S. cyber warfare policy, encompassing both defensive and offensive operations.

## Overview

Cyberspace is a warfighting domain, on par with land, sea, air, and space. The U.S. military and critical infrastructure are heavily reliant on digital networks, creating a vast attack surface for adversaries. State actors like China and Russia, as well as non-state groups, are actively using cyber capabilities to conduct espionage, disrupt critical services, and shape the information environment.

This analysis examines the core components of U.S. cyber warfare strategy. It covers the roles of U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and the National Security Agency (NSA), the "defend forward" and "persistent engagement" doctrines, and the challenges of deterring attacks in a domain where attribution is difficult and the line between espionage and attack is often blurred. It also explores the complex relationship between government and the private sector, which owns and operates the majority of the infrastructure that must be defended.
