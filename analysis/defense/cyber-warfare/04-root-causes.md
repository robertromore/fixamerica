# Cyber Warfare: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

Cyberspace is an inherently unstable and conflict-prone domain. This is not due to any single policy failure, but to the fundamental technical and structural characteristics of the domain itself. These characteristics create a strong and persistent advantage for offensive actors.

## 1. The Offense-Dominant Nature of Cyberspace

The core problem is that it is easier, cheaper, and more effective to attack in cyberspace than it is to defend.

- **The Attacker's Advantage**: An attacker only needs to find one vulnerability to succeed. A defender must protect against all possible vulnerabilities, an impossible task.
- **Asymmetric Costs**: The cost of entry for a cyber operation is extremely low compared to traditional warfare. A small team of skilled hackers can develop a tool that can have a strategic effect, a task that would require billions of dollars in the physical world (e.g., to build an aircraft carrier). This empowers weaker states and non-state actors.
- **Zero-Day Exploits**: The existence of "zero-day" vulnerabilities (flaws in software that are unknown to the defender) means that even a perfectly configured and updated system can be compromised.

## 2. The Attribution Problem

It is extremely difficult to quickly and definitively prove who is responsible for a cyberattack.

- **Plausible Deniability**: Attackers can route their attacks through multiple countries and use false flags to mask their identity. This allows states to conduct aggressive actions while maintaining plausible deniability.
- **The Challenge to Deterrence**: Traditional deterrence theory relies on a credible threat of retaliation. If the victim of an attack cannot be certain who the attacker is, they cannot credibly threaten to retaliate. This severely weakens deterrence. For example, if the U.S. power grid is attacked, but the evidence is ambiguous, would a President risk nuclear war by retaliating against Russia or China?

## 3. The Entanglement of Civilian and Military Infrastructure

Unlike other warfighting domains, cyberspace is almost entirely owned and operated by the private sector.

- **A Shared Domain**: The same physical infrastructure (fiber optic cables, routers, servers) carries both military and civilian traffic. The DoD relies on commercial ISPs for its communications and on private companies for its power, water, and logistics.
- **The Risk of Collateral Damage**: This entanglement means that a military cyberattack can easily have unintended and catastrophic consequences for civilians. The 2017 NotPetya attack, aimed at Ukraine, spread globally and caused billions in damage to companies like Maersk and FedEx.
- **The Public-Private Defense Dilemma**: The government cannot defend this infrastructure on its own. It needs the cooperation of private companies. However, these companies have different incentives (profit vs. national security) and are often wary of government mandates or surveillance on their networks.

## 4. The Lack of International Norms and Arms Control

- **No "Rules of the Road"**: There is no broad international consensus on what constitutes a legitimate act of espionage versus an illegal act of war in cyberspace.
- **The Impossibility of Traditional Arms Control**: Cyber weapons are just lines of code. They can be replicated infinitely and transferred instantly. Traditional arms control, which relies on counting and inspecting physical objects like missiles or tanks, is impossible.
- **The "Vulnerabilities Equities Process" (VEP)**: The U.S. government faces a constant dilemma. When it discovers a new software vulnerability, it can either disclose it to the software vendor so it can be patched (improving defense for everyone), or it can keep it secret and develop it into a new offensive weapon. This choice between offense and defense is a core tension in cyber policy.

## Causal Chain of Cyber Instability

```text
Low barrier to entry and attacker's advantage
    ↓
States and non-state actors develop sophisticated offensive capabilities
    ↓
The attribution problem makes it difficult to deter these attacks
    ↓
The entanglement of civilian and military networks creates high risk of collateral damage
    ↓
The lack of international norms prevents the establishment of clear "rules of the road"
    ↓
Result: A domain of constant, low-level conflict with a persistent risk of catastrophic escalation
```
