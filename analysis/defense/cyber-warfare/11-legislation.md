# Cyber Warfare: Legislation

## Overview

Cyber warfare legislation operates in a rapidly evolving domain where the distinction between peace and war is blurred. Current U.S. policy relies on a patchwork of authorities: Title 10 for military cyber operations (USCYBERCOM), Title 50 for intelligence (NSA), and Title 6 for domestic security (DHS/CISA). This fragmentation creates gaps in both defensive coverage and offensive authorization, leaving critical infrastructure vulnerable and operators uncertain about their legal authorities.

The legislative framework proposed here aims to clarify these authorities, strengthen the defense of critical infrastructure (which is largely private), and establish a coherent doctrine for offensive cyber operations. It moves beyond voluntary public-private partnerships to mandatory incident reporting and baseline security standards for critical sectors.

The framework is organized around two complementary bills:

1. **The National Cyber Resilience and Deterrence Act** addresses the defensive and regulatory gap: mandatory cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure, unified incident reporting, liability protection for threat intelligence sharing, and clarification of defend-forward authorities.
2. **The Cyber Workforce and Education Act** addresses the human capital gap: a civilian surge capacity reserve, expanded scholarship programs, excepted service hiring authority to compete with the private sector, and apprenticeship pathways to diversify the pipeline.

Together, these bills address the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's central finding that the United States "is not organized to defend itself in cyberspace" and implement the Commission's core recommendations for layered cyber deterrence.

Key existing authorities that this legislation builds upon include:

- **CIRCIA (2022)**: Established the statutory basis for incident reporting but left implementation details to rulemaking. This legislation accelerates and strengthens the CIRCIA framework.
- **FISMA (2014)**: Governs federal agency cybersecurity but does not extend to private critical infrastructure. This legislation fills that gap.
- **EO 14028 (2021)**: Directed federal agencies to improve cybersecurity practices but lacks the force of law for private entities. This legislation codifies and extends those directives.
- **NDAA FY2019, Sec. 1636**: Affirmed the policy of defending forward in cyberspace but did not establish clear legal boundaries. This legislation provides statutory guardrails.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for the legislative framework proposed in this file. Congress possesses sufficient authority under existing constitutional provisions:

- **Commerce Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3): Provides authority to regulate cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure operating in or affecting interstate commerce. See the Legal Considerations section below for detailed analysis.
- **War Powers** (Article I, Section 8, Clauses 11-14): Provides authority to authorize and regulate offensive cyber operations, including defining the scope of defend-forward authorities and the threshold requiring Congressional approval.
- **Necessary and Proper Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18): Supports the creation of new institutional structures (Civilian Cyber Reserve, Cyber Apprenticeship Program) as means of carrying out enumerated powers related to national defense and commerce.
- **Spending Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1): Supports conditional grants to states for cybersecurity improvements, including the state model legislation coordination provisions.

## Federal Legislation

### The National Cyber Resilience and Deterrence Act

**Purpose**: To mandate cybersecurity standards for critical infrastructure, require incident reporting, and clarify authorities for "defend forward" operations.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Critical Infrastructure Mandate**: Authorizes CISA to establish and enforce mandatory cybersecurity performance goals for Systemically Important Entities (SIEs) in energy, water, finance, and transport. Includes civil penalties of up to 1 percent of prior-year gross revenue for non-compliance.
2. **Incident Reporting**: Codifies a 72-hour reporting requirement for substantial cyber incidents and 24-hour reporting for ransomware payments, creating the unified national reporting framework recommended by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.
3. **Cyber Force Study**: Commissions a formal study on establishing a separate uniformed Cyber Force (independent of the Army, Navy, and Air Force cyber components) to resolve the fragmented military cyber command structure.
4. **Defend Forward Authority**: Clarifies USCYBERCOM's authority to conduct persistent engagement operations outside U.S. networks to disrupt adversary activity below the threshold of war, with Congressional notification requirements for escalation-risk operations.
5. **Liability Shield**: Provides limited liability protection for companies that comply with CISA standards and share threat intelligence, removing the legal risk that has historically deterred private-sector information sharing.
6. **Reporting Requirements**: Mandates annual CISA reports to Congress on SIE compliance rates, incident trends, enforcement actions, and Cyber Force study progress, plus an independent GAO assessment at the two-year mark.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Critical Infrastructure Standards)**: Moves from "please secure your systems" to "you must secure your systems." This is the biggest shift in U.S. cyber policy history, transitioning from voluntary frameworks to enforceable mandates with civil penalties.
- **Section 5 (Incident Reporting)**: Ensures the government actually knows when attacks happen, allowing for a coordinated response and pattern recognition across sectors. The 72-hour timeline balances urgency with the practical reality that forensic triage takes time.
- **Section 7 (Liability Protection)**: The "carrot" to the regulatory "stick" -- if you share data to help the country, you cannot be sued for it. This addresses the single largest barrier to private-sector threat intelligence sharing identified by industry groups.
- **Section 8 (Reporting Requirements)**: Creates democratic accountability by requiring CISA to report annually to Congress on compliance rates, incident trends, and enforcement actions. The GAO review provides an independent check on agency self-reporting.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Designate Systemically Important Entities | 180 days after enactment | CISA |
| Incident Reporting Portal operational | 180 days after enactment | CISA |
| Issue proposed rule for SIE standards | 9 months after enactment | CISA |
| Issue final SIE cybersecurity standards rule | 1 year after enactment | CISA |
| Complete Cyber Force feasibility study | 1 year after enactment | DoD |
| First annual report to Congress | 1 year after enactment | CISA |
| GAO independent assessment | 2 years after enactment | GAO |
| First 5-year reauthorization review | 5 years after enactment | Congress |

**Challenges**:

- **Industry Pushback**: The Chamber of Commerce and sector-specific trade associations will fight mandatory standards and revenue-based fines, arguing they impose disproportionate costs on companies that are themselves victims of state-sponsored attacks.
- **Agency Turf Wars**: FBI, SEC, and Sector Risk Management Agencies (SRMAs) may resist CISA's primacy as the lead civilian cyber agency, particularly where existing sector regulators (e.g., FERC for energy, OCC for banking) have established cybersecurity oversight programs.
- **SIE Designation Politics**: The process of designating Systemically Important Entities will be politically charged, as companies resist the label and the compliance costs that follow, while advocacy groups push for broader coverage.

**Refinements**:

- Harmonize reporting requirements through the Cyber Incident Reporting Council to ensure companies do not have to report the same incident to multiple agencies with conflicting timelines and formats.
- Phase enforcement: allow a 1-year compliance grace period for newly designated SIEs, with escalating penalties only after the grace period and a good-faith compliance assessment.
- Establish sector-specific advisory committees to ensure that mandatory performance goals reflect the operational realities and risk profiles of each critical infrastructure sector.

### The Cyber Workforce and Education Act

**Purpose**: To address the critical shortage of cyber talent in the federal government by creating a "Cyber National Guard" and scholarship-for-service programs.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Civilian Cyber Reserve**: Establishes a reserve component of civilian cyber experts who can be activated for domestic cyber emergencies, with compensation protections and employer reemployment guarantees modeled on USERRA.
2. **CyberCorps Scholarship Expansion**: Doubles funding for the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service program and adds priority fields (ICS security, cloud, cryptography, AI security) aligned to critical workforce gaps.
3. **Excepted Service Hiring Authority**: Grants DHS and DoD broad authority to hire cyber talent outside the traditional General Schedule (GS) pay scale to compete with the private sector, with safeguards against misuse.
4. **National Cyber Apprenticeship Program**: Creates registered apprenticeship pathways through community colleges, HBCUs, HSIs, and Tribal colleges, with retention incentives including student loan repayment and professional development funding.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To build the cybersecurity workforce of the United States.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Cyber Workforce and Education Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States faces a cybersecurity workforce shortage of more than 500,000 unfilled positions, according to CyberSeek workforce data maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
(2) The (ISC)2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study (2023) estimates the global cyber workforce gap at 4 million professionals, with United States federal agencies among the hardest-hit employers.
(3) The NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Workforce Framework (NIST SP 800-181r1) identifies 52 distinct work roles requiring specialized training that existing federal hiring pipelines cannot fill at the pace demanded by the threat environment.
(4) The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack of 2021 and the SolarWinds supply chain compromise of 2020 demonstrated that the federal government lacks the surge capacity to respond simultaneously to multiple significant cyber incidents.
(5) Private sector compensation for cybersecurity professionals exceeds federal pay scales by 30 to 50 percent on average, creating a persistent recruitment and retention disadvantage for the Federal Government.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) CIVILIAN CYBER RESERVE.—The term "Civilian Cyber Reserve" means the body of cybersecurity professionals established under section 4 who may be called into temporary federal service to respond to significant cyber incidents.
(2) SIGNIFICANT CYBER INCIDENT.—The term "significant cyber incident" means an incident, or a group of related incidents, that the Director of CISA determines is likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people.
(3) EXCEPTED SERVICE POSITION.—The term "excepted service position" means a position in the excepted service, as defined in section 2103 of title 5, United States Code, established under this Act for the purpose of hiring cybersecurity professionals outside the competitive service.
(4) CYBERCORPS PROGRAM.—The term "CyberCorps program" means the Federal Cyber Scholarship-for-Service program administered by the National Science Foundation under section 302 of the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 (15 U.S.C. 7442).

SEC. 4. CIVILIAN CYBER RESERVE.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Defense shall jointly establish a Civilian Cyber Reserve.
(b) COMPOSITION.—The Reserve shall consist of individuals with cybersecurity expertise who are not members of the Armed Forces.
(c) ACTIVATION.—Members may be activated to federal service to respond to significant cyber incidents affecting critical infrastructure.
(d) TERMS OF SERVICE.—Members of the Reserve shall serve terms of not more than 180 days per activation, with a maximum of 365 days of activation in any 24-month period.
(e) COMPENSATION.—Activated members shall receive compensation at a rate not less than the daily equivalent of a GS-13, step 5, pay rate, or the member's private-sector compensation, whichever is greater, not to exceed the daily equivalent of Executive Schedule Level II.

SEC. 5. CYBERCORPS EXPANSION.

(a) FUNDING.—There is authorized to be appropriated $100,000,000 annually for the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service program.
(b) PRIORITY FIELDS.—The Director of the National Science Foundation shall give priority to scholarship applications in the fields of industrial control systems security, cloud security, cryptography, and artificial intelligence security.
(c) SERVICE OBLIGATION.—Each scholarship recipient shall serve in a cybersecurity position in the Federal Government for a period equal to the length of the scholarship, but not less than 2 years.

SEC. 6. HIRING AUTHORITY.

(a) AUTHORITY.—The Director of CISA may appoint personnel to positions in the excepted service without regard to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, governing appointments in the competitive service.
(b) PAY.—The Director may fix the rate of basic pay for such positions up to the rate for the Vice President.
(c) LIMITATION.—Excepted service positions established under this section shall be used exclusively for roles requiring cybersecurity expertise as defined by the NICE Workforce Framework.
(d) REPORTING.—Not later than 1 year after enactment, and annually thereafter, the Director shall report to Congress on the number of excepted service hires, their roles, compensation levels, and retention rates.

SEC. 7. CYBER APPRENTICESHIP AND TRAINING.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Labor, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall establish a National Cyber Apprenticeship Program to create industry-recognized apprenticeship pathways into cybersecurity careers in the Federal Government and critical infrastructure sectors.
(b) STANDARDS.—Apprenticeships under this section shall—
(1) meet the requirements of the National Apprenticeship Act (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.);

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act (other than section 7)—
(1) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
(2) $225,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
(3) $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
(4) $275,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
(5) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Civilian Cyber Reserve)**: Allows the government to surge capacity during a crisis (like Colonial Pipeline) without maintaining a massive standing army of expensive cyber operators. The compensation floor ensures top talent will actually answer the call.
- **Section 6 (Hiring Authority)**: Allows the government to pay closer to market rates for top-tier talent, while the limitation clause prevents abuse of the authority for non-cyber roles.
- **Section 7 (Apprenticeship)**: Creates a sustainable pipeline beyond four-year-degree holders, recognizing that many effective cyber professionals learn through hands-on experience. The HBCU/HSI/Tribal partnership addresses the severe underrepresentation of minorities in cybersecurity.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Establish Civilian Cyber Reserve framework | 180 days after enactment | DHS and DoD jointly |
| Publish Reserve activation protocols | 1 year after enactment | DHS/CISA |
| Begin expanded CyberCorps scholarship cycle | Next academic year after enactment | NSF |
| Issue excepted service hiring guidance | 90 days after enactment | CISA/OPM |
| Launch National Cyber Apprenticeship Program | 1 year after enactment | DOL with DHS |
| First cohort apprenticeship completion | 3 years after enactment | DOL |
| First annual report to Congress | 1 year after enactment | CISA |

**Challenges**:

- **Federal Pay Competitiveness**: Even with excepted service authority, agencies may struggle to match FAANG-level compensation packages that include equity, signing bonuses, and remote work flexibility.
- **Reserve Activation Conflicts**: Civilian cyber experts employed in the private sector may face employer resistance to extended government activations, particularly during periods when their own organizations are under attack.
- **Clearance Backlogs**: Security clearance processing times of 12-18 months undermine the speed advantage of hiring authorities, as many cyber positions require at minimum a Secret clearance.
- **Apprenticeship Quality Control**: Without rigorous standards, the apprenticeship program risks producing credentials without competence, diluting the value of the pathway.

**Refinements**:

- Establish reciprocal agreements with major tech employers to facilitate Reserve member activation without jeopardizing private employment, modeled on the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
- Create an expedited clearance pathway for Reserve members with pre-adjudicated interim clearances based on continuous vetting enrollment.
- Develop retention metrics and tie agency cyber workforce performance to CIO FISMA scorecards to create accountability for workforce investment.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Act

**Purpose**: To establish state-level cybersecurity standards for local government and businesses, complementing federal law. State legislation fills gaps that federal law cannot reach, particularly for state and local government networks, small businesses below the SIE threshold, and state-regulated industries (e.g., insurance, public utilities).

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Cybersecurity Act".

SECTION 2. STATE GOVERNMENT SECURITY.
(a) All state agencies shall adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework within 1 year of enactment.
(b) The State Chief Information Officer shall conduct annual penetration tests of state networks and report results to the Governor and legislature.
(c) The State CIO shall establish a cybersecurity incident response team with authority to coordinate across all state agencies during a cyber emergency.
(d) All state employees with access to sensitive systems shall complete annual cybersecurity awareness training.

SECTION 3. DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION.
(a) Any entity doing business in the State shall notify the Attorney General within 72 hours of discovering a breach of personal information affecting residents of the State.
(b) Notification to affected individuals shall be made within 30 days of discovery.
(c) The Attorney General shall maintain a public database of reported breaches.

SECTION 4. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE.
(a) The State shall establish a Cybersecurity Grant Program to assist counties, municipalities, and school districts in meeting baseline cybersecurity standards.
(b) Grant funds may be used for network assessments, security tools, employee training, and incident response planning.

SECTION 5. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE COORDINATION.
(a) The State Homeland Security Agency shall coordinate with federal CISA and private sector operators of critical infrastructure within the State to share threat intelligence and conduct joint exercises.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 2** ensures that state government leads by example rather than imposing standards on the private sector that the state itself does not meet.
- **Section 4** addresses the reality that local governments, particularly small municipalities and school districts, are frequent targets of ransomware but lack dedicated cybersecurity budgets and staff.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: CISA (DHS), with coordination from the National Cyber Director (Executive Office of the President).

**Supporting Agencies**: Department of Defense (Cyber Force study, Reserve), National Science Foundation (CyberCorps), Department of Labor (Apprenticeship), Office of Personnel Management (excepted service oversight), Sector Risk Management Agencies (sector-specific standards).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **CIRCIA Implementation**: Final rules defining "covered entity" and "substantial cyber incident" for reporting, including thresholds for ransomware payment disclosure.
2. **SIE Designation Criteria**: Rules establishing the methodology for designating Systemically Important Entities, including risk-based criteria, appeals procedures, and annual review cycles.
3. **Performance Goals**: Sector-specific mandatory cybersecurity performance standards (e.g., water, electric, financial services, transportation), developed in consultation with Sector Risk Management Agencies and industry stakeholders.
4. **Liability Protection Procedures**: Rules governing the process for claiming liability protection, including requirements for good-faith threat indicator sharing, privacy scrubbing protocols, and CISA certification of compliance.
5. **Civilian Cyber Reserve Regulations**: Joint DHS-DoD rulemaking establishing Reserve member eligibility, activation protocols, compensation schedules, employer notification requirements, and reemployment protections.
6. **Excepted Service Position Standards**: OPM guidance defining eligible position descriptions, NICE Framework alignment requirements, pay-setting methodology, and annual reporting obligations.
7. **Apprenticeship Program Standards**: DOL rulemaking establishing curriculum requirements, on-the-job training standards, credential recognition, and institutional partnership eligibility for the National Cyber Apprenticeship Program.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Subpoenas**: CISA authority to subpoena entities that fail to report incidents or provide information requested during compliance reviews.
- **Civil Penalties**: Up to 1 percent of prior-year gross revenue for SIE non-compliance with mandatory standards; up to $100,000 per day for failure to report covered incidents within the required timeline.
- **Compliance Orders**: CISA authority to issue binding compliance orders to SIEs with material deficiencies, enforceable through federal district court.
- **Referrals**: CISA referral authority to the Department of Justice for willful non-compliance or obstruction of investigations.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

#### Article I vs. Article II: War Powers and Cyber Operations

The most contested constitutional question in cyber warfare law is the allocation of authority between Congress (Article I, Section 8) and the President (Article II, Section 2). Congress holds the power to "declare War," "raise and support Armies," and "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." The President serves as Commander in Chief.

Offensive cyber operations exist in a gray zone. Operations below the threshold of "use of force" under international law (e.g., intelligence gathering, disrupting botnet infrastructure) have historically been conducted under executive authority alone. However, operations that could cause physical damage, economic disruption, or escalation to kinetic conflict implicate Congress's war powers. The legislation addresses this by:

- Codifying "defend forward" authority for persistent engagement below the use-of-force threshold under standing statutory authorization;
- Requiring presidential notification to the Gang of Eight within 48 hours for operations that risk escalation; and
- Reserving to Congress the authority to approve cyber operations reasonably expected to cause significant physical destruction or constitute an act of war.

#### Youngstown Framework Application

Justice Jackson's concurrence in *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), provides the governing framework for evaluating executive action in cybersecurity:

- **Category One (Maximum Authority)**: When the President acts pursuant to Congressional authorization, executive power is at its zenith. The legislation places most defend-forward operations and CISA enforcement in this category by providing explicit statutory authority.
- **Category Two (Twilight Zone)**: When Congress has neither granted nor denied authority, the President may act based on independent powers, but there is a "zone of twilight" of concurrent authority. Pre-legislation, most offensive cyber operations fell here, creating legal uncertainty.
- **Category Three (Lowest Ebb)**: When the President acts contrary to Congressional will, executive power is at its lowest. If Congress were to restrict certain cyber operations through this legislation and the executive conducted them anyway, courts would apply the highest scrutiny.

The legislation is designed to move the bulk of cyber operations from Category Two into Category One, providing legal certainty for operators and democratic accountability through Congressional oversight.

#### Fourth Amendment: *Carpenter* and Digital Privacy

The Supreme Court's decision in *Carpenter v. United States*, 585 U.S. ___ (2018), held that the government's acquisition of historical cell-site location information constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment, requiring a warrant. *Carpenter* recognized that pervasive digital surveillance can reveal the "privacies of life" even when individual data points seem innocuous.

This holding has direct implications for cyber threat intelligence sharing:

- **Network traffic metadata** collected under information-sharing provisions could reveal patterns of communication, association, and behavior comparable to the location data at issue in *Carpenter*.
- **Bulk collection** of flow data from internet service providers for threat detection purposes must be scrutinized under *Carpenter*'s reasoning that the "depth, breadth, and comprehensive reach" of digital data demands Fourth Amendment protection.
- The legislation addresses these concerns by requiring automated privacy scrubbing of personally identifiable information before threat indicators are shared with the government, and by prohibiting the use of shared threat data for law enforcement purposes unrelated to cybersecurity.

#### Commerce Clause Basis for Critical Infrastructure Regulation

Congress's authority to regulate critical infrastructure cybersecurity rests primarily on the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3). The interconnected nature of modern critical infrastructure -- energy grids spanning multiple states, financial networks operating nationally and globally, internet backbone infrastructure carrying interstate communications -- establishes a clear nexus to interstate commerce.

Under the substantial effects doctrine articulated in *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), Congress may regulate intrastate activity that, in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce. A cyberattack on a single water treatment facility or pipeline (as demonstrated by the Colonial Pipeline and Oldsmar, Florida incidents) can cause cascading interstate effects. This provides a firm constitutional foundation for mandatory cybersecurity standards even as applied to locally operated infrastructure.

The Tenth Amendment poses minimal concern here because the legislation regulates private entities operating critical infrastructure, not state governments. To the extent state agencies operate critical infrastructure (e.g., state-run utilities), the legislation relies on conditional spending provisions rather than direct commands, consistent with *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012).

### Preemption

The federal reporting requirement preempts conflicting state reporting timelines to simplify compliance for industry. The legislation adopts a "floor, not ceiling" approach: states may impose additional cybersecurity requirements beyond the federal baseline, but may not impose shorter or conflicting incident reporting deadlines that would fragment the national reporting system. This approach preserves state innovation while ensuring a unified national picture of the threat landscape.

Currently, all 50 states have enacted data breach notification laws with varying timelines (ranging from 24 hours to 60 days), definitions of "personal information," and notification procedures. This patchwork forces companies operating across state lines to comply with dozens of overlapping and sometimes contradictory requirements. The federal floor preempts only the reporting timeline and submission portal, not states' broader data privacy and consumer protection authorities.

### Enforcement and Judicial Review

Entities subject to CISA enforcement actions, including civil penalties and compliance orders, may seek judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Review shall be on the administrative record under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 706. The legislation preserves CISA's authority to seek emergency injunctive relief in federal district court for imminent threats to critical infrastructure.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Reasonable Belief"** | Companies delay reporting by claiming they are still "investigating" to form a belief. | High | Define "reasonable belief" to trigger upon initial detection of unauthorized access. |
| **Third-Party Vendors** | Attacks on software vendors (like SolarWinds) might not trigger reporting by the customers. | High | Explicitly include supply chain compromises in reporting triggers. |
| **SIE De Minimis Threshold** | Companies restructure operations, spin off subsidiaries, or reduce reported revenue to fall below the SIE designation threshold, avoiding mandatory standards while still operating critical systems. | Medium | Base SIE designation on functional criticality and interconnectedness rather than entity size alone; include a "look-through" provision for corporate affiliates. |
| **Excepted Service Pay Abuse** | Agencies use the excepted service cyber hiring authority to hire and pay premium salaries to personnel in roles that are not genuinely cybersecurity positions, circumventing OPM pay controls. | Medium | Require each excepted service position to map to a specific NICE Workforce Framework role, with annual OPM audit of position descriptions and duties. |
| **Vendor Notification Gap** | Managed service providers (MSPs) and cloud hosting providers experience breaches affecting hundreds of downstream entities but are not themselves "covered entities" under the reporting rule, creating a blind spot. | High | Amend the definition of "covered entity" to include MSPs, cloud service providers, and any entity that processes, stores, or transmits data on behalf of a covered entity. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Global Reach** | U.S. law cannot regulate foreign infrastructure used to stage attacks against the United States. | Sovereignty and jurisdictional limits of domestic legislation. | Pursue binding international norms through the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) process; negotiate bilateral cyber agreements with key allies and adversaries. |
| **Workforce Pipeline Insufficient** | Federal training and scholarship programs produce thousands of graduates per year, but the private sector absorbs the vast majority, leaving federal agencies perpetually understaffed. | Private sector compensation outpaces federal pay by 30-50%, and federal hiring processes take 6-12 months. | Combine excepted service hiring authority with retention bonuses, student loan repayment, and quality-of-life improvements; reduce time-to-hire through pre-adjudicated clearances. |
| **Attribution Difficulty** | "Defend forward" operations risk diplomatic escalation or retaliation when the U.S. acts on faulty attribution, potentially striking innocent third-party infrastructure or misidentifying the responsible state actor. | Sophisticated adversaries use false flags, compromised third-country infrastructure, and proxy groups to obscure the origin of attacks. | Require multi-source intelligence concurrence (at least two independent agencies) before offensive cyber operations; establish a post-action attribution review board. |
| **Legacy Systems** | Mandatory cybersecurity standards are extremely difficult to apply to decades-old SCADA and industrial control systems (ICS) that run critical infrastructure such as water treatment plants and electrical grids. | Legacy ICS/SCADA systems were designed for reliability and isolation, not cybersecurity, and many cannot be patched or upgraded without full replacement. | Create a separate compliance track for legacy systems with compensating controls (network segmentation, enhanced monitoring) and a 5-year modernization roadmap with dedicated funding. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Reporting Harmonization**: Establish a Cyber Incident Reporting Council, chaired by the National Cyber Director, with representatives from CISA, FBI, SEC, FTC, and sector-specific regulators, to unify reporting timelines, definitions, and submission portals. The Council shall publish a single reporting form and API within 1 year of enactment.
2. **SIE Designation Appeals Process**: Create an independent review panel within CISA to hear appeals from entities designated as Systemically Important Entities. The panel shall include private-sector representatives and issue binding decisions within 90 days of an appeal filing, with judicial review available in the D.C. Circuit.
3. **Annual Loophole Review**: Require CISA, in consultation with the Government Accountability Office, to conduct an annual review of regulatory loopholes and evasion strategies identified through enforcement actions, incident reports, and industry feedback. Findings shall be reported to Congress with proposed regulatory or legislative fixes.
4. **Workforce Authority Audit**: Require the Office of Personnel Management to conduct biennial audits of excepted service cyber hiring authorities to ensure positions are used exclusively for cybersecurity roles, with authority to revoke misused positions and refer abuses to the Inspector General.

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Interagency Coordination**: The legislation distributes authorities across CISA, DoD, DOJ, NSF, DOL, and OPM. Without a strong coordinating mechanism, agencies may issue conflicting guidance, duplicate efforts, or leave gaps. The National Cyber Director should serve as the central coordinator with budget certification authority.
- **Small and Medium Business Burden**: While the legislation targets Systemically Important Entities, the SIE supply chain includes thousands of small and medium businesses that may lack the resources to meet cascading security requirements imposed by their SIE customers. A small business assistance program and tiered compliance expectations are necessary.
- **Classification Barriers**: Effective cybersecurity policymaking requires that Congress, regulated entities, and the public understand the threat. Over-classification of cyber threat intelligence prevents informed compliance decisions by private sector entities and limits Congressional oversight.
- **International Harmonization**: U.S. mandatory reporting and security standards must be harmonized with allied frameworks (the EU's NIS2 Directive, the UK's Network and Information Systems Regulations) to avoid imposing duplicative compliance burdens on multinational operators of critical infrastructure.
- **Rapid Technological Change**: Legislation and regulation inevitably lag behind the threat environment. The rulemaking process (notice-and-comment, OMB review) can take 18-24 months, during which adversary tactics may shift entirely. Delegating technical standard-setting to CISA with expedited rulemaking authority is essential but raises due process concerns.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Cyber Force Study**: One-time report due within 1 year of enactment. If the study recommends establishment of a Cyber Force, the Secretary of Defense shall submit implementing legislation to Congress within 180 days of the report.
- **CISA Regulatory Authorities**: Subject to reauthorization every 5 years. The reauthorization process shall include a comprehensive GAO assessment of CISA's enforcement effectiveness, industry compliance rates, and impact on cyber incident frequency and severity.
- **Defend Forward Authority**: The statutory authorization for persistent engagement operations shall be reviewed by the Congressional intelligence committees every 3 years, with a classified report on operations conducted, escalation incidents, and diplomatic consequences.
- **Civilian Cyber Reserve**: The Reserve program shall sunset after 7 years unless reauthorized. DHS shall submit a reauthorization report to Congress at the 5-year mark, including activation statistics, cost-effectiveness analysis, and comparison with alternative surge models.
- **Excepted Service Hiring Authority**: Subject to 5-year sunset with OPM audit required before reauthorization. If the audit finds more than 10 percent of positions are not performing cybersecurity functions, the authority shall lapse unless Congress affirmatively reauthorizes with corrective provisions.
