# Cyber Warfare: Solutions

Strengthening U.S. cyber deterrence and defense requires a multi-layered strategy that enhances resilience, clarifies red lines, deepens public-private partnership, and leads an international effort to establish norms of behavior.

---

## 1. Strengthen Deterrence

**A. Adopt a "Declaratory Policy of Proportional Cross-Domain Response"**

- **Description**: The threat of a "cyber-for-cyber" response is often not a credible deterrent. The U.S. should formally declare that a significant cyberattack on its critical infrastructure could be met with a response in any domain—cyber, economic, or conventional—at a time and place of our choosing.
- **Implementation**: The President should issue a formal declaratory policy statement. This would be reinforced by wargaming and demonstrating the capability to link cyber triggers to economic sanctions or conventional military options.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Increases the credibility of U.S. deterrence by expanding the range of possible responses, forcing adversaries to calculate a much broader set of risks.

**B. Invest in Cyber Resilience ("Deterrence by Denial")**

- **Description**: The best way to deter an attack is to make it likely to fail. This means investing heavily in the resilience of U.S. critical infrastructure so that it can withstand and rapidly recover from an attack.
- **Implementation**: Use federal funds (e.g., from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) and regulatory minimum standards to force critical infrastructure sectors (power, water, finance) to build redundancy, segmentation, and out-of-band recovery systems.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Reduces the incentive for an adversary to attack by denying them the ability to cause catastrophic, long-term disruption.

## 2. Reform the Public-Private Partnership

**A. Create a "Cyber National Guard" Model**

- **Description**: The nation's top cyber talent resides in the private sector. Create a new, specialized reserve force—a "Cyber National Guard"—that allows these experts to serve part-time.
- **Implementation**: Establish a new reserve component where cyber professionals can be commissioned directly, train on military systems for a limited time each year, and be activated during a national crisis to assist in defending critical infrastructure.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Provides a surge capacity of elite technical talent during a crisis. Deepens the relationship and trust between the government and the tech sector.

**B. Legislate a Liability Shield for Information Sharing**

- **Description**: Private companies are often hesitant to share threat information with the government for fear of lawsuits or regulatory action.
- **Implementation**: Pass legislation that provides a "safe harbor" from liability for companies that share cyber threat information with CISA or other designated government agencies in good faith.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Removes a major barrier to information sharing, giving the government better visibility into adversary campaigns.

## 3. Clarify Roles and Responsibilities

**A. End the "Dual Hat" for USCYBERCOM/NSA**

- **Description**: The current arrangement where one general leads both a military command and an intelligence agency creates a potential conflict of interest and concentrates too much power.
- **Implementation**: Formally separate the leadership of USCYBERCOM and the NSA. This would require two separate four-star generals, each with their own distinct mission and chain of command.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates clearer lines of authority and accountability. Reinforces the distinction between military operations (Title 10) and intelligence collection (Title 50), which can strengthen civil liberties oversight.

**B. Empower CISA as the Lead Domestic Agency**

- **Description**: Clarify that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is the lead federal agency for domestic cybersecurity and the primary interface for the private sector.
- **Implementation**: Increase CISA's budget and personnel. Formally designate CISA as the lead agency for responding to any domestic cyber incident, with the DoD/USCYBERCOM acting in a supporting role unless directed by the President in a major crisis.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Strengthens civilian control over domestic cybersecurity and provides a clearer, more trusted "front door" for private companies to work with the government.

## 4. Promote International Norms

**A. Lead a Coalition to Define "Red Lines"**

- **Description**: While a formal treaty is unlikely, the U.S. can lead a coalition of like-minded nations to establish clear norms of behavior in cyberspace.
- **Implementation**: Launch a major diplomatic initiative to get a critical mass of nations to publicly pledge to a set of norms, such as:
    - No attacks on civilian critical infrastructure (power, water, hospitals).
    - No attacks on nuclear command and control systems.
    - No interference with election infrastructure.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates a clear standard for judging state behavior. Allows for collective international condemnation and sanctions against nations that violate the norms, isolating them from the international community.
