# Cyber Warfare: Current State

## U.S. Cyber Forces and Doctrine

### U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM)

- **Mission**: To direct, synchronize, and coordinate cyberspace planning and operations to defend and advance national interests in collaboration with domestic and international partners.
- **Structure**: USCYBERCOM is one of the 11 unified combatant commands of the Department of Defense. The Commander of USCYBERCOM is also dual-hatted as the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA).
- **Cyber Mission Force (CMF)**: The CMF is the operational arm of USCYBERCOM, consisting of approximately 6,800 personnel organized into 133 teams.
    - **National Mission Teams**: Defend the U.S. from strategic cyber threats.
    - **Combat Mission Teams**: Support other combatant commands with integrated cyber effects.
    - **Cyber Protection Teams**: Defend DoD networks and systems.

### Strategic Doctrine

- **Persistent Engagement**: This doctrine posits that to be effective in cyberspace, the U.S. must continuously engage with adversaries in the "gray zone" below the threshold of armed conflict. It involves actively challenging adversary campaigns and imposing costs to disrupt their operations.
- **Defend Forward**: A component of persistent engagement, this involves taking action in foreign cyberspace to stop threats before they reach U.S. networks. This is done with the consent of allied and partner nations on whose networks USCYBERCOM operates.

## Adversary Cyber Capabilities

The U.S. faces a diverse set of state-sponsored cyber threats.

### China (The "Pacing Threat")

| Capability | Intent / Doctrine | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Cyber Espionage** | Stealing intellectual property and military technology on a massive scale to fuel economic and military growth. | **2015 OPM Hack**: Theft of security clearance records for over 21 million federal employees. |
| **Network Attack** | Developing capabilities to disrupt or destroy U.S. critical infrastructure (e.g., power grid, pipelines) in a crisis or conflict. | **Volt Typhoon**: A recently discovered campaign that has pre-positioned malware on U.S. critical infrastructure networks. |
| **Information Operations** | Using social media and other platforms to sow discord and influence public opinion. | Active campaigns targeting U.S. elections. |

### Russia (The "Acute Threat")

| Capability | Intent / Doctrine | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Disruptive Attacks** | Using cyberattacks as a tool of coercive statecraft, often integrated with military operations. | **2017 NotPetya Attack**: A destructive malware attack disguised as ransomware that caused billions in collateral damage globally. |
| **Election Interference** | Using hacking and information operations to interfere in foreign democratic processes. | **2016 U.S. Election**: Hacking of DNC servers and subsequent information operations. |
| **Critical Infrastructure** | Targeting critical infrastructure for disruptive effects. | Cyberattacks against Ukraine's power grid. |

### Iran and North Korea

- **Iran**: Focuses on disruptive and destructive attacks, often against regional rivals and the U.S., as well as sophisticated information operations.
- **North Korea**: Primarily uses cyber operations for revenue generation through theft from financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges to fund its weapons programs.

## Legal and Policy Framework

U.S. cyber operations are governed by a complex mix of public laws, executive orders, and classified presidential directives.

### Key Authorities

| Authority | Description |
|---|---|
| **Title 10 (Armed Forces)** | Authorizes the DoD to conduct military operations, including in cyberspace. Offensive cyber operations are generally considered a Title 10 activity. |
| **Title 50 (Intelligence)** | Authorizes the intelligence community (including the NSA) to conduct intelligence gathering activities. The line between Title 10 and Title 50 activities in cyberspace is often blurry. |
| **National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 (NSPM-13)** | A 2018 directive that reportedly delegated broader authority to the Commander of USCYBERCOM to conduct offensive cyber operations without needing lengthy White House approval. |
| **Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA)** | A 2022 law requiring critical infrastructure owners to report significant cyber incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours. |

## Public-Private Partnership

The defense of cyberspace is a shared responsibility, as the private sector owns and operates an estimated 85% of U.S. critical infrastructure.

### Key Challenges

- **Information Sharing**: The government has access to classified threat intelligence that private companies need, while companies have visibility into attacks on their networks that the government needs. Sharing this information quickly and effectively is a major challenge.
- **Liability Concerns**: Companies are often hesitant to share information about breaches for fear of regulatory penalties or lawsuits.
- **Misaligned Incentives**: The government's priority is national security, while a private company's priority is shareholder value. A company may not want to make costly security investments that don't have a clear return on investment.

### Key Initiatives

- **CISA's Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC)**: An initiative to bring together government agencies and private sector partners to develop joint cyber defense plans.
- **Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)**: Industry-specific organizations that share threat information among member companies.
