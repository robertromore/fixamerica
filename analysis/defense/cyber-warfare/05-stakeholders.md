# Cyber Warfare: Stakeholders

Cybersecurity is a "whole-of-society" problem, involving a complex web of government agencies, private companies, and international actors.

## U.S. Government Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Role in Cyber Operations |
|---|---|---|
| **U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM)** | **Military Operations.** Conducting offensive and defensive cyber operations to support military objectives. | **Warfighter.** The lead organization for military cyber effects and defending DoD networks. |
| **National Security Agency (NSA)** | **Intelligence Gathering.** Collecting foreign signals intelligence (SIGINT) from cyberspace. | **Intelligence Provider.** Provides the intelligence that enables USCYBERCOM's operations. The "dual-hat" leadership structure creates a deep, symbiotic relationship. |
| **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)** | **Homeland Defense.** Defending federal civilian government networks and coordinating the defense of U.S. critical infrastructure. | **The Nation's Cyber Defender.** The lead civilian agency for domestic cybersecurity. |
| **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)** | **Law Enforcement.** Investigating cybercrime and attributing malicious cyber activity. | **The "Cop on the Beat."** Pursues criminal charges against hackers and state-sponsored actors. |
| **The White House (National Cyber Director)** | **Policy Coordination.** Synchronizing cyber policy across the entire federal government. | **Coordinator.** Ensures a whole-of-government approach to cybersecurity. |
| **Congress (Armed Services & Intelligence Committees)** | **Oversight & Funding.** Authorizing and appropriating the budget for cyber forces and programs. | **Funder and Overseer.** |

**Internal Conflicts:**

- **USCYBERCOM vs. NSA (The "Dual Hat")**: The arrangement where one four-star general leads both organizations is controversial. Proponents argue it creates synergy. Critics argue it creates a conflict between the military mission (effects) and the intelligence mission (collection), and concentrates too much power in one individual.
- **DoD vs. CISA/DHS**: A turf war over who is ultimately responsible for defending the nation in cyberspace. The DoD's "defend forward" mission can sometimes conflict with CISA's domestic, civilian-led mission.

## Private Sector Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical Infrastructure Owners** (e.g., power companies, banks, pipelines) | **Maintaining operations and profitability.** Avoiding costly downtime and regulatory penalties. | **Ownership.** They own and operate the systems that are the primary targets of strategic cyberattacks. |
| **Major Tech Companies** (e.g., Microsoft, Google, Amazon) | **Protecting their platforms and customers.** Selling cybersecurity services and cloud infrastructure. | **Control of the Digital Ecosystem.** They have more visibility into global cyber threats than most governments. Their security decisions affect billions of users. |
| **Cybersecurity Industry** (e.g., CrowdStrike, Mandiant) | **Selling security products and services.** Responding to and analyzing major breaches. | **Technical Expertise.** These companies are often the first responders to major incidents and have deep technical knowledge of adversary tactics. |

## External Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **Allies** | Access to U.S. threat intelligence; U.S. assistance in defending their networks. | Provide platforms for "defend forward" operations; add legitimacy to U.S. policy. |
| **China and Russia** | Using cyber capabilities to achieve strategic goals (espionage, disruption, influence) without triggering open conflict. | Highly sophisticated and well-resourced state-sponsored hacking groups. |
| **Iran and North Korea** | Using cyber as an asymmetric tool to counter U.S. power and generate revenue. | Niche capabilities and a high tolerance for risk. |
| **Non-State Actors** (e.g., ransomware gangs, hacktivists) | Financial profit or political goals. | Can cause strategic-level disruption (e.g., Colonial Pipeline) while operating with a degree of plausible deniability for their host nations. |
