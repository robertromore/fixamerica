# Cyber Warfare: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

Cyber warfare policy forces a collision between national security imperatives and private sector autonomy. Unlike traditional warfare, the "battlefield" (the internet and critical infrastructure) is largely owned by private companies. The debate centers on how much the government should regulate these companies to protect the nation, how aggressive the U.S. should be in "defending forward" (hacking back), and how to balance surveillance for security with privacy rights.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | National security, business autonomy | Offensive cyber, voluntary partnerships, anti-regulation |
| Liberal | Collective security, regulation | Mandatory standards, international norms, defensive focus |
| Progressive | Privacy, civil liberties, anti-militarism | Restrict offensive cyber, strict privacy protections, demilitarize internet |
| Libertarian | Privacy, property rights, non-intervention | Encryption rights, oppose mandates, private defense |
| Constitutionalist | Fourth Amendment, limited government | Warrants for surveillance, oppose executive overreach |
| Populist | National sovereignty, anti-Big Tech | Data localization, aggressive response to China/Russia |
| Centrist | Resilience, partnership, stability | Public-private collaboration, norms, balanced approach |
| Religious Right | Security, moral order | Protect families from cyber threats (pornography/trafficking) |
| Democratic Socialist | Public ownership, anti-surveillance | Digital commons, oppose corporate surveillance capitalism |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent support for offensive cyber power and business freedom from regulatory mandates; motivations align with stated principles. |
| Principle consistency | Generally oppose regulation, but carve out national security exceptions; tension between anti-regulation instincts and support for military-industrial cyber spending. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; positions on offensive cyber and anti-mandate stances have remained consistent across administrations. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frame cyber competition as US vs. China/Russia; view cyber dominance as essential to maintaining American hegemony. |

**Justification:** Conservatives want a strong offense ("hack back") but resist domestic regulation of businesses (critical infrastructure). They view cyber as a domain of warfare to be dominated, analogous to air, sea, and space. The tension between their pro-military instincts (which favor government investment and authority) and their anti-regulation instincts (which resist mandates on private companies) creates a predictable but manageable internal conflict.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- GOP support for expanding USCYBERCOM authorities, including the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act provisions granting "defend forward" operational authority.
- Chamber of Commerce opposition to SEC cyber disclosure rules (2023), arguing mandatory reporting burdens businesses without improving security.
- Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee consistently advocating for larger cyber operations budgets while opposing CISA regulatory mandates.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree threats are high; blame weak deterrence. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Blame adversaries, not lack of regulation. |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation cyber policy briefs advocating for offensive cyber authorities and opposing mandatory security regulations on the private sector.
- American Enterprise Institute (AEI) publications on deterrence theory applied to cyberspace and the case for private sector "hack back" authority.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mandatory Standards | 3/10 | Oppose; burden on business. | Regulation. |
| Defend Forward | 10/10 | Strong support. | Strength. |
| Liability Shield | 9/10 | Strong support. | Business protection. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resilience Act | 5/10 | Mixed; like liability shield, hate mandates. | Regulation. |
| Workforce Act | 7/10 | Support. | Competitiveness. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Legalize "hacking back" by private companies through a modern letters-of-marque framework, allowing vetted private firms to conduct offensive operations against foreign attackers under government oversight.
- Replace mandatory security standards with tax credits and accelerated depreciation for cyber investment, incentivizing voluntary security improvements without imposing regulatory compliance costs.
- Expand USCYBERCOM authority and budget for persistent engagement operations against adversary networks, prioritizing deterrence through demonstrated offensive capability.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarians (shared opposition to government regulatory mandates on private businesses), Populists (aligned on aggressive offensive cyber posture and desire for American dominance in cyberspace).
- **Potential bridges:** Centrists (can cooperate on public-private partnership models if liability shields are included and regulatory mandates are limited to the most critical sectors).
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives (fundamental disagreement on offensive cyber operations, corporate liability shields, and the role of military spending in cybersecurity policy).

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely focused on collective security through government regulation; view cybersecurity as a public good requiring coordinated federal action. |
| Principle consistency | Consistent support for an active government role in setting standards, enforcing compliance, and building international norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; support for mandatory standards and international cooperation has remained consistent from Obama through Biden administrations. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; prefer multilateral, cooperative approaches and view cyber policy as a shared challenge rather than a purely adversarial contest. |

**Justification:** Liberals view cyber insecurity as a classic market failure requiring government regulation. Voluntary measures have been tried for two decades and failed to produce adequate security outcomes. They support CISA mandates, international norms, and a regulatory framework that shifts cybersecurity responsibility from individual users to the companies and infrastructure operators best positioned to manage risk.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Biden National Cybersecurity Strategy (2023) shifting responsibility for cyber defense from end users to the companies and organizations best positioned to reduce risk, reflecting the liberal market-failure framework.
- Bipartisan support for CIRCIA (Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act), driven primarily by liberal members who championed mandatory reporting as essential for collective defense.
- Liberal think tank advocacy for sector-specific cybersecurity regulations modeled on the financial sector's existing compliance frameworks.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Agree on vulnerability and market failure. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agree on need for standards. |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress reports on cybersecurity regulation and the case for mandatory critical infrastructure standards.
- Brookings Institution analyses of international cyber norms and the role of multilateral institutions in governing cyberspace.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mandatory Standards | 10/10 | Strong support. | Public safety. |
| Incident Reporting | 10/10 | Strong support. | Transparency. |
| Defend Forward | 6/10 | Cautious support; worry about escalation. | Stability. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resilience Act | 10/10 | Full support. | Security. |
| Workforce Act | 9/10 | Support. | Jobs. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Enact GDPR-style comprehensive privacy regulations that establish baseline data protection standards, reducing attack surfaces by limiting the volume of personal data companies collect and retain.
- Pursue binding international treaties on cyber weapons analogous to arms control agreements, establishing norms against targeting civilian infrastructure and creating verification mechanisms for state cyber capabilities.
- Expand federal cybersecurity grants to state and local governments, ensuring that under-resourced public sector entities can meet the same security standards expected of private industry.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives (shared commitment to regulatory standards and corporate accountability), Centrists (aligned on public-private partnership models and international norms).
- **Potential bridges:** Populists (overlapping concern about foreign adversary threats, though they diverge on international cooperation and multilateral approaches).
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarians (fundamental disagreement on the role of government mandates in cybersecurity and the value of regulatory compliance frameworks).

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by privacy and civil liberties concerns; view cybersecurity policy as a potential vector for expanding the surveillance state. |
| Principle consistency | Consistent opposition to surveillance expansion regardless of which party holds power; apply the same scrutiny to Democratic and Republican cyber authorities. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; demands for encryption protections, limits on government hacking, and opposition to corporate liability shields have not shifted. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frame cyber policy as a contest between Privacy rights and Security state expansion; skeptical that security gains justify civil liberties costs. |

**Justification:** Progressives fear that "cybersecurity" is a trojan horse for surveillance. They oppose offensive cyber operations and want strict limits on government access to data.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- EFF and ACLU policy positions (often aligned with Progressives) consistently opposing expansion of government cyber authorities without robust civil liberties protections.
- Progressive opposition to Section 702 FISA renewal, with members like Senator Ron Wyden arguing the program enables mass surveillance of Americans' communications.
- Congressional Progressive Caucus members introducing legislation to reform the Vulnerabilities Equities Process and require disclosure of government-held software exploits.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree on risk; disagree on solution (more gov power). |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Blame corporate negligence and gov hoarding of exploits. |

**Source references:**

- Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) policy positions on encryption, government hacking, and the Vulnerabilities Equities Process.
- ACLU publications on surveillance reform and the civil liberties implications of cyber operations authorities.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mandatory Standards | 8/10 | Support if it forces companies to secure user data. | Corporate accountability. |
| Defend Forward | 2/10 | Oppose; militarization of internet. | Peace. |
| Liability Shield | 1/10 | Strong opposition. | Corporate accountability. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resilience Act | 6/10 | Mixed; like standards, hate liability shield. | Corporate power. |
| Workforce Act | 8/10 | Support. | Education. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Ban government purchase of zero-day exploits on the open market, requiring instead that all discovered vulnerabilities be disclosed to vendors through the Vulnerabilities Equities Process within a mandatory 30-day timeline.
- Mandate end-to-end encryption for all communications platforms and prohibit government backdoor requirements, treating strong encryption as essential civilian infrastructure.
- Establish corporate criminal liability for negligent security practices that result in breaches affecting critical infrastructure or exposing personal data at scale.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarians (shared commitment to privacy, encryption rights, and opposition to government surveillance authorities).
- **Potential bridges:** Liberals (aligned on mandatory corporate security standards, though Progressives demand stronger accountability and oppose liability shields that Liberals may accept).
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservatives (fundamental disagreement on offensive cyber operations and the role of military-industrial spending in cybersecurity).

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Rooted in privacy and property rights principles; oppose both government surveillance and government-imposed security mandates on private enterprises. |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent opposition to mandates and surveillance across all administrations; apply the same skepticism to Republican national security expansions and Democratic regulatory proposals. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; pro-encryption and anti-mandate positions have not shifted in response to high-profile cyber incidents or partisan pressure. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frame cyber policy as a State vs. Individual liberty contest; argue that government involvement in cybersecurity typically causes more harm than it prevents. |

**Justification:** Libertarians believe companies should secure themselves through market incentives and that government mandates are inefficient, counterproductive, and create a false sense of security through compliance theater. They are fiercely pro-encryption and anti-surveillance, viewing government backdoor mandates as a greater threat to cybersecurity than the adversaries they purport to counter.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute publications arguing that government encryption mandates and backdoor requirements undermine individual privacy and weaken security for all users.
- TechFreedom advocacy against CISA regulatory mandates, arguing that market incentives and insurance mechanisms drive better security outcomes than government compliance requirements.
- Libertarian-leaning members of Congress opposing CIRCIA on grounds that compelled incident reporting constitutes a form of government surveillance of private business operations.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agree on risk; blame gov for weakening encryption. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Blame gov interference. |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute policy analyses on encryption rights, government surveillance overreach, and the inefficiency of federal cybersecurity mandates.
- TechFreedom publications arguing for market-driven security solutions and opposing government mandates as counterproductive to innovation.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mandatory Standards | 1/10 | Strong opposition. | Regulation. |
| Incident Reporting | 2/10 | Oppose; compelled speech. | Privacy. |
| Liability Shield | 7/10 | Support contract freedom; mixed on gov shield. | Tort reform. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resilience Act | 2/10 | Oppose mandates. | Freedom. |
| Workforce Act | 4/10 | Skeptical of gov jobs. | Spending. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Legalize private active defense (hacking back) with clear legal frameworks, allowing companies to respond proportionally to attacks on their own networks without government permission or interference.
- Develop robust cyber insurance markets to drive security improvements through premium incentives, replacing government mandates with market-based mechanisms that reward good security practices and penalize negligence through higher costs.
- Repeal government mandates that weaken encryption or require backdoor access, recognizing that strong cryptography is the single most effective cybersecurity measure available to individuals and businesses.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives (shared commitment to strong encryption, opposition to government surveillance, and skepticism of corporate liability protections).
- **Potential bridges:** Conservatives (overlapping opposition to government regulatory mandates, though Libertarians go further in rejecting even voluntary government coordination frameworks).
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberals (fundamental disagreement on the necessity and effectiveness of government-mandated cybersecurity standards and federal regulatory authority over the private sector).

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Rooted in Fourth Amendment protections; consistently frame cyber policy through constitutional lens rather than operational security. |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent; positions on warrantless surveillance, executive authority, and data collection track closely with originalist constitutional interpretation. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; demands for warrant requirements and congressional authorization have not shifted with changes in administration. |
| Zero-sum behavior | View cyber policy as a Security vs. Rights contest; insist that constitutional protections cannot be suspended even during active cyber conflict. |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists focus on the surveillance aspects of cyber policy. They oppose warrantless data collection under the guise of "cybersecurity." Their primary lens is whether cyber authorities comply with the Fourth Amendment and the separation of powers, particularly whether offensive operations receive proper congressional authorization under the War Powers framework.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Senator Rand Paul's filibuster of Section 702 reauthorization, arguing warrantless collection of Americans' communications violates the Fourth Amendment.
- Senator Mike Lee's co-sponsorship of the USA RIGHTS Act requiring individualized warrants for querying Section 702 data.
- Constitutionalist legal scholars' amicus briefs in *Carpenter v. United States* (2018) arguing digital data deserves full Fourth Amendment protection.
- Consistent Constitutionalist opposition to CISA information-sharing provisions that lack explicit warrant requirements, arguing that voluntary corporate data sharing with intelligence agencies circumvents constitutional protections.
- Federalist Society debates on whether offensive cyber operations constitute "hostilities" under the War Powers Resolution requiring congressional authorization.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Concerned about government overreach in cyber authorities; acknowledge threats but prioritize constitutional guardrails over operational speed. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Attribute vulnerabilities to the erosion of constitutional limits on executive surveillance and the absence of meaningful congressional oversight of cyber operations. |

**Source references:**

- The American Conservative, particularly articles on the national security state and Fourth Amendment erosion.
- Federalist Society white papers on executive power and cyber operations under Article II.
- Senator Mike Lee's official statements on FISA reform and cyber surveillance authorities.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Incident Reporting | 4/10 | Wary of how government uses reported data; demand Fourth Amendment protections on any shared information. | Government retention and querying of private sector data without individualized warrants. |
| Defend Forward | 5/10 | Conditional support only with explicit Congressional authorization under War Powers framework; oppose unilateral executive action. | Separation of powers; offensive cyber operations constitute acts of war requiring legislative approval. |
| Mandatory Standards | 4/10 | Skeptical of broad federal mandates; prefer narrowly tailored requirements with constitutional due process protections. | Federal overreach into private property and commerce without clear enumerated authority. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resilience Act | 5/10 | Mixed; support resilience goals but oppose provisions that enable warrantless data sharing between private sector and intelligence agencies. | Privacy protections and Fourth Amendment compliance in information-sharing mechanisms. |
| Workforce Act | 6/10 | Cautious support; government cyber workforce is acceptable if subject to constitutional constraints on surveillance authority. | Ensuring new cyber personnel operate within constitutional limits rather than expanding warrantless collection capacity. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Require individualized, court-issued warrants for all cyber threat data sharing between private companies and government agencies, mirroring Fourth Amendment standards applied to physical searches.
- Mandate that all offensive cyber operations receive explicit Congressional authorization through a new Cyber War Powers Resolution, preventing unilateral executive action.
- Establish a dedicated Article III cyber court (modeled on but more transparent than the FISA Court) to review and approve government requests for access to private network data.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarians (shared commitment to Fourth Amendment protections and opposition to warrantless surveillance), Progressives (aligned on civil liberties concerns and opposition to unchecked executive power).
- **Potential bridges:** Conservatives (when framed as limiting executive overreach and protecting property rights from government intrusion).
- **Unlikely partners:** Centrists (who prioritize operational efficiency and public-private information sharing over constitutional procedural requirements).

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by national sovereignty concerns; view Chinese cyber operations and Big Tech data practices as twin threats to American self-determination. |
| Principle consistency | Consistently anti-China and anti-Big Tech; willing to support government intervention against both foreign adversaries and domestic technology elites when sovereignty is at stake. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; demands for TikTok bans, data localization, and aggressive cyber deterrence have not shifted across political cycles. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Strong us-vs-them framing; view cyber policy as a sovereignty contest between the American people and both foreign adversaries and cosmopolitan tech elites. |

**Justification:** Populists view cyber as a domain of national sovereignty under siege from both foreign adversaries (primarily China and Russia) and disloyal domestic elites (Big Tech). They want to ban TikTok, force data localization, and punish Big Tech for "censorship" and security failures. Their cyber policy is an extension of economic nationalism: American data should stay in America, American technology should serve American interests, and adversaries should face severe consequences for cyber attacks.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Trump executive orders on TikTok/WeChat and the broader effort to decouple American digital infrastructure from Chinese technology supply chains.
- Bipartisan congressional support for the RESTRICT Act, driven in significant part by populist concerns about foreign adversary access to American data.
- Populist media figures (Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon) framing Big Tech companies as disloyal entities that censor American speech while enabling Chinese data collection.
- Congressional populist caucus members advocating for data localization mandates as part of broader economic nationalism agenda.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Agree we are under attack. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Blame globalism/China. |

**Source references:**

- American Compass publications on economic nationalism and the case for data sovereignty against Chinese technology infiltration.
- Speeches and executive orders from the Trump administration on TikTok, WeChat, and Chinese technology supply chain threats.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mandatory Standards | 6/10 | Support if applied to Big Tech; oppose for small biz. | Punishing elites. |
| Defend Forward | 10/10 | Strong support. | Strength. |
| Cyber Force | 8/10 | Support. | Military strength. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resilience Act | 7/10 | Support security; wary of bureaucracy. | Sovereignty. |
| Workforce Act | 8/10 | Support. | Jobs. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Ban Chinese technology companies (Huawei, ZTE, TikTok, and their subsidiaries) from operating in the United States entirely, extending the existing federal procurement bans to a comprehensive market exclusion.
- Mandate data localization requiring all American user data to be stored on servers physically located within the United States, preventing foreign adversary access through jurisdictional control.
- Impose severe sanctions and retaliatory cyber operations against state-sponsored hacking groups, treating major cyber intrusions as acts of economic warfare requiring proportional response.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (shared hawkish posture on offensive cyber operations and desire to project American military strength against adversaries).
- **Potential bridges:** Progressives (overlapping hostility toward Big Tech power, though for different reasons -- Populists see tech elites as disloyal, Progressives see them as exploitative).
- **Unlikely partners:** Centrists and Liberals who favor multilateral cooperation and international norms, which Populists view as constraints on American sovereignty and freedom of action.

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Resilience and partnership. |
| Principle consistency | Consistent support for Solarium Commission model. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low. |

**Justification:** Centrists built the current CISA model. They believe in "public-private partnership" with a nudge toward mandates where voluntary measures fail.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cyberspace Solarium Commission final report (2020) and subsequent legislative recommendations, many of which were enacted through NDAA provisions. The Commission itself exemplified the centrist approach: bipartisan, expert-driven, and oriented toward pragmatic public-private solutions.
- Bipartisan support for CISA establishment (2018) and subsequent expansion of its authorities, reflecting centrist consensus on the government's coordination role.
- Third Way and CSIS joint publications advocating for "layered cyber deterrence" combining defensive resilience, public-private partnership, and calibrated offensive capabilities.
- Senate bipartisan cyber caucus members consistently advocating for incremental, consensus-based cyber legislation rather than sweeping partisan proposals.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Agree on urgency. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agree on market failure. |

**Source references:**

- Third Way reports on cyber resilience policy and the case for bipartisan public-private partnership models.
- Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) cyber policy publications, particularly the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's recommendations for "layered cyber deterrence."

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mandatory Standards | 9/10 | Support for critical sectors. | Resilience. |
| Incident Reporting | 10/10 | Core priority. | Visibility. |
| Liability Shield | 8/10 | Support as trade-off. | Partnership. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resilience Act | 10/10 | Full support. | Stability. |
| Workforce Act | 10/10 | Full support. | Capacity. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Establish a federal cyber insurance backstop modeled on the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), providing a government reinsurance mechanism for catastrophic cyber events that exceed private market capacity.
- Lead international norms development through multilateral institutions, building consensus around responsible state behavior in cyberspace and establishing consequences for violations.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberals (shared commitment to regulatory frameworks and international cooperation), Moderate Conservatives (aligned on public-private partnership models and pragmatic national security measures).
- **Potential bridges:** Corporate sector leaders who recognize that clear, predictable federal standards are preferable to a patchwork of state regulations and the uncertainty of voluntary frameworks.
- **Unlikely partners:** Ideological extremes on both sides -- Libertarians who reject any government role and Democratic Socialists who reject the public-private partnership model in favor of full public ownership.

---

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Primarily focused on online content threats (pornography, trafficking, exploitation of minors) rather than critical infrastructure security; cyber "warfare" is secondary to cyber "morality." |
| Principle consistency | Mixed; strong national defense convictions align with offensive cyber support, but domestic cyber policy priorities diverge significantly from mainstream security analysis toward content regulation. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on core moral concerns; support for broader cyber defense measures does not shift but remains subordinate to content-focused priorities. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frame cyber threats through a moral order lens; view the unregulated internet as a threat to families and religious communities as much as a national security vulnerability. |

**Justification:** The Religious Right is less focused on critical infrastructure and more on "online safety" for children and blocking pornography. They engage with cyber warfare policy primarily through the lens of protecting families from harmful online content and ensuring that religious institutions are shielded from cyber threats. National defense cyber operations receive general support rooted in traditional pro-military values.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- NCOSE (National Center on Sexual Exploitation) advocacy for mandatory age verification and ISP-level content filtering, which they frame as "cybersecurity for families."
- Family Research Council publications linking cyber threats to moral hazards, particularly online exploitation and trafficking facilitated by encrypted platforms.
- Heritage Foundation cyber policy papers endorsed by Religious Right figures that blend national security hawkishness with calls for online content regulation.
- Congressional letters from Religious Right-aligned members urging technology companies to implement stronger content moderation against exploitation material, framed as a cybersecurity and public safety imperative.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Acknowledge national cyber threats but focus attention on different threat categories: online exploitation, pornography, and trafficking rather than state-sponsored infrastructure attacks. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Attribute cyber vulnerabilities partly to moral decay in the technology sector; view Big Tech's permissive content policies as a root cause of online harm, diverging from infrastructure-focused root cause analysis. |

**Source references:**

- Family Research Council publications on internet safety and protecting children online.
- NCOSE annual "Dirty Dozen" list identifying technology companies enabling exploitation.
- Alliance Defending Freedom briefs on religious liberty in digital spaces and government content regulation authority.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mandatory Standards | 5/10 | Largely indifferent to infrastructure security mandates; would support if standards included protections for religious institutions and online safety requirements. | Not a core priority unless tied to content regulation or protection of faith-based organizations from cyber attacks. |
| Defend Forward | 8/10 | Support offensive cyber operations as extension of strong national defense posture; view cyber deterrence against adversaries as a moral imperative. | Traditional pro-military values and desire to project American strength against authoritarian regimes that persecute religious communities. |
| Incident Reporting | 5/10 | Neutral on general incident reporting; would actively support if reporting requirements included online exploitation and trafficking incidents. | Interest in leveraging cyber reporting mechanisms to combat online child exploitation. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resilience Act | 6/10 | General support for national security provisions; would prefer amendments adding online safety mandates for platforms. | Security broadly defined to include protection of families and religious communities from cyber-enabled exploitation. |
| Workforce Act | 6/10 | Support cyber workforce development as part of national strength; favor inclusion of faith-based educational institutions in training pipeline. | Ensuring religious colleges and universities can participate in federally funded cyber education programs. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Mandate robust age verification on all commercial platforms as a prerequisite for operating in the United States, framed as critical "cyber safety" infrastructure.
- Require ISP-level filtering of pornographic and exploitative content, treating content filtering as a cybersecurity measure that protects vulnerable populations.
- Establish federal grants for religious institutions to improve their cybersecurity posture against targeted attacks, including state-sponsored campaigns against faith communities.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (shared pro-military cyber posture and traditional values orientation toward online content regulation).
- **Potential bridges:** Populists (overlapping concerns about Big Tech's power and desire to impose accountability on technology platforms).
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarians (fundamental disagreement on content regulation and government filtering mandates; Libertarians view ISP-level filtering as censorship).

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by opposition to corporate surveillance capitalism; view cybersecurity through the lens of who owns and controls digital infrastructure rather than purely technical vulnerability. |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent; opposition to corporate data extraction, support for public ownership of critical digital infrastructure, and skepticism of military-industrial cyber spending all follow directly from democratic socialist principles. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; demands for public broadband, data collection bans, and corporate accountability have remained constant regardless of which party holds power. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frame cyber policy as a Public vs. Private ownership contest; argue that private ownership of critical infrastructure creates inherent security vulnerabilities driven by the profit motive. |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists view "cybersecurity" as a framework that primarily protects corporate profits and the surveillance capitalism business model. They argue that the fundamental vulnerability of American cyber infrastructure stems from private ownership of systems that should be public utilities. They want to dismantle the surveillance capitalism model and replace it with publicly owned, democratically governed digital infrastructure.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Jacobin articles arguing that cybersecurity failures are inherent to capitalism's incentive structures, where corporations externalize security costs onto users and taxpayers.
- Shoshana Zuboff's *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* (2019), widely cited in democratic socialist cyber policy discourse as evidence that private data collection is the root vulnerability.
- DSA Technology and Democracy committee position papers calling for public ownership of broadband infrastructure and prohibition of corporate mass data collection.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strongly agree that cyber vulnerabilities are severe; attribute them to capitalism's structural incentives to minimize security spending and maximize data extraction. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Full agreement that root causes are systemic; argue the profit motive drives corporations to underinvest in security, hoard user data that becomes attack surfaces, and lobby against regulation. |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mandatory Standards | 9/10 | Strong support for mandatory standards as a tool to force corporate accountability; view regulation as a step toward eventual public ownership of critical digital infrastructure. | Corporate accountability and worker/consumer protection from negligent security practices that privatize profits while socializing breach costs. |
| Liability Shield | 1/10 | Vehement opposition; view liability shields as corporate welfare that eliminates the only market mechanism holding companies accountable for security failures. | Corporate impunity; argue shields transfer breach costs entirely to workers, consumers, and taxpayers while protecting shareholder profits. |
| Defend Forward | 2/10 | Oppose offensive cyber operations as militarization of the internet that primarily benefits defense contractors; prefer diplomatic and economic approaches. | Anti-militarism; concern that offensive cyber spending enriches the military-industrial complex without addressing root causes of insecurity. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Resilience Act | 6/10 | Mixed; support mandatory standards provisions but strongly oppose liability shield as corporate giveaway that undermines accountability. | Concerned that the bill entrenches private ownership of critical infrastructure rather than moving toward public alternatives. |
| Workforce Act | 7/10 | Support workforce development if it includes public sector pathways and union protections; oppose if structured primarily as a pipeline to private defense contractors. | Ensuring cyber workers have labor protections, collective bargaining rights, and public service career options rather than funneling talent to corporate employers. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Establish publicly owned broadband infrastructure operated as a democratic utility, removing the profit motive from critical communications infrastructure and improving security through public accountability.
- Ban mass corporate data collection entirely, eliminating the vast data stores that create attractive targets for state-sponsored hackers and reducing the attack surface of American digital infrastructure.
- Create a public cyber defense corps staffed by unionized federal employees rather than relying on private contractors with misaligned profit incentives.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives (shared opposition to surveillance capitalism and corporate liability shields; aligned on civil liberties priorities).
- **Potential bridges:** Populists (overlapping skepticism of Big Tech power and support for data localization, though for different ideological reasons).
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservatives and Centrists (fundamental disagreement on the role of private enterprise in critical infrastructure and the value of liability protections for corporations).

### Common Ground Synthesis

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Offensive Cyber** | Con, Pop, Cent, RelR, Lib | Const | Prog, DemSoc |
| **Mandatory Standards** | Lib, Prog, Cent, DemSoc, Pop | RelR, Const | Con, Libt |
| **Workforce Dev** | Con, Lib, Prog, Pop, Cent, RelR, DemSoc | Const | Libt |

**Key insight:** Workforce development is the safest bet for bipartisan action. Mandates split the Right (Business Conservatives vs. National Security Populists) and the Left (Corporate Accountability Progressives vs. Anti-Regulation Democratic Socialists on liability shields). Offensive cyber unites the Right and Center but alienates the Left. The privacy coalition (Progressive-Libertarian-Constitutionalist) can serve as a blocking force on any legislation perceived as expanding surveillance authorities, making privacy protections a necessary component of any viable legislative package.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: The "Secure Infrastructure" Compact

**Bridges:** Centrist + Liberal + Populist

**Core Agreement:** Critical infrastructure must be secure against China/Russia.

**Policy Description:**

Passes the **National Cyber Resilience and Deterrence Act** with mandatory standards for "Systemically Important Entities" (SIEs) only, exempting small businesses. Includes a liability shield for companies that demonstrate compliance with federal security standards, creating a clear incentive structure: meet the standards and receive legal protection from breach-related lawsuits. The bill would be modeled on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission's recommendations and designed for attachment to the NDAA or a Homeland Security authorization bill to maximize bipartisan viability.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Centrist | Delivers the resilience-first framework championed by the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, with mandatory standards for the most critical entities and public-private collaboration mechanisms. |
| Liberal | Establishes binding regulatory standards for critical infrastructure security, addressing the market failure that voluntary measures have failed to correct over two decades. |
| Populist | Frames cyber mandates as national security requirements to counter China and Russia, with data localization provisions that keep American data on American soil. |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Accepts a liability shield for compliant companies, trading corporate accountability for the pragmatic gain of industry buy-in on mandatory standards. |
| Populist | Accepts new federal regulatory authority over private businesses, which normally conflicts with anti-bureaucracy instincts, in exchange for aggressive national security framing and anti-China provisions. |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 3/9 perspectives (plus business lobby).
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 2/3 coalition members rated 4+ consistency.
- **Durability:** High; aligns with Solarium recommendations.
- **Implementation Path:** NDAA or Homeland Security Bill.
- **Risk Factors:**
    - Progressives and Democratic Socialists may oppose the liability shield as corporate welfare.
    - Libertarians may oppose mandatory standards as government overreach.
    - The definition of "Systemically Important Entities" will be contested; too broad and it becomes a mandate on all business, too narrow and it fails to address critical vulnerabilities.

### Compromise 2: The "Privacy and Security" Deal

**Bridges:** Libertarian + Progressive + Constitutionalist

**Core Agreement:** The government shouldn't spy on us while "protecting" us.

**Policy Description:**

A bill that mandates strong encryption (no government backdoors permitted), requires individualized court-issued warrants for all cyber threat data sharing between private companies and government agencies, and encourages voluntary security standards through safe harbor provisions. The bill would also reform the Vulnerabilities Equities Process to create a presumption of disclosure for government-discovered software flaws, limiting the intelligence community's ability to stockpile exploits.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Libertarian | Codifies encryption rights into law and eliminates government backdoor mandates, protecting individual privacy and property rights in digital communications. |
| Progressive | Establishes robust civil liberties protections that prevent "cybersecurity" from becoming a pretext for expanded government and corporate surveillance of ordinary citizens. |
| Constitutionalist | Enshrines Fourth Amendment warrant requirements into cyber data sharing frameworks, ensuring digital information receives the same constitutional protection as physical property. |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Progressive | Foregoes mandatory corporate security standards, accepting voluntary frameworks in exchange for ironclad privacy and civil liberties protections. |
| Libertarian | Accepts a limited government role in setting encryption standards and operating a warrant-based data sharing framework, departing from a purely market-driven approach. |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 3/9 perspectives.
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/3 coalition members rated 4+ consistency.
- **Durability:** Low; opposed by National Security state.
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone Privacy Bill.
- **Risk Factors:**
    - Intelligence community and DOD will lobby aggressively against warrant requirements and encryption mandates.
    - Centrists and Liberals may view warrant requirements as operationally impractical for real-time threat response.
    - Business lobby may oppose encryption mandates that limit their ability to monetize user data.

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The **"Secure Infrastructure" coalition** (Compromise 1) is the governing reality. It unites the National Security establishment with the Business community (if liability shields are included). This coalition draws from the Centrist, Liberal, and Populist perspectives, which together represent the broadest base of support for mandatory cybersecurity standards. The Cyberspace Solarium Commission model provides the intellectual framework, and the liability shield provides the political currency to bring the business lobby from opponent to partner.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Business Lobby:** The Chamber of Commerce fights mandates tooth and nail unless they get liability protection. The SEC's 2023 cyber disclosure rules provoked intense industry backlash, demonstrating the political cost of mandates without corresponding protections. Any legislation must include a meaningful liability shield to neutralize this opposition.
2. **Privacy Hawks:** The Left-Right alliance (Progressives/Libertarians) can block bills that look like surveillance. This coalition successfully forced reforms to Section 215 and nearly blocked Section 702 reauthorization. Any information-sharing provisions must include robust privacy protections to avoid triggering this blocking coalition.
3. **Partisan Framing:** Cyber policy becomes difficult when either party frames it as a partisan issue. The most successful cyber legislation (CIRCIA, CISA establishment) passed with bipartisan support by avoiding partisan flashpoints like content regulation or surveillance authorities.

### Low Consistency Partners

**Conservatives** (rated 4/5 consistency) are the swing vote. They want "strength" but hate "regulation." Frame mandates as "National Security Requirements" (like building codes for bunkers) rather than "Business Regulations." The key insight is that conservatives will accept government action in cyberspace when it is framed through the national defense lens rather than the regulatory compliance lens.

**Religious Right** (rated 3/5 consistency) is the least reliable coalition partner on mainstream cyber policy because their priorities (content filtering, age verification) diverge significantly from infrastructure security. However, they can be brought into coalitions by including online safety provisions as ancillary components of broader cyber legislation.

### Recommended Approach

Pursue a **"Resilience and Liability"** strategy:

1. Lead with **Workforce Development** to build trust across perspectives. This is the single area where all nine perspectives show moderate-to-strong support, making it the ideal confidence-building measure before tackling more contentious reforms.
2. Push **Mandatory Standards** for critical infrastructure only, trading a **Liability Shield** to get business buy-in. The "Systemically Important Entities" framework limits the regulatory footprint while addressing the most urgent vulnerabilities.
3. Keep **Offensive Cyber** authorities separate to avoid alienating the Left on the resilience bill. Offensive authorities should move through the NDAA or standalone defense authorization, where the Conservative-Populist-Centrist coalition is sufficient.
4. Address **Privacy concerns** proactively by including warrant requirements and data minimization provisions in any information-sharing framework. This prevents the Progressive-Libertarian-Constitutionalist blocking coalition from derailing the resilience agenda.
5. Engage the **Religious Right** by including online safety provisions (age verification, exploitation reporting) as ancillary components of broader cyber legislation, broadening the support coalition without altering the core security framework.
