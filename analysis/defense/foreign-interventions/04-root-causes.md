# Foreign Interventions: Root Causes

## Overview

The United States does not repeatedly engage in costly, often counterproductive foreign military interventions by accident. Persistent patterns of over-intervention are driven by structural features of the American political system, economic incentives, institutional dynamics, and deeply rooted ideological commitments. Understanding these root causes is essential to designing reforms that can break the cycle.

## Structural and Institutional Drivers

### 1. The Imperial Presidency and the Erosion of Congressional War Power

The Constitution vests the power to declare war exclusively in Congress (Article I, Section 8). Since 1945, however, presidents have progressively expanded their unilateral authority to initiate military action, citing Article II Commander-in-Chief powers, self-defense under customary international law, and broadly worded congressional authorizations.

- **Key mechanism**: The 2001 AUMF provides a 60-word statutory basis that has been stretched to justify operations in at least 22 countries against groups that did not exist on September 11, 2001 (Congressional Research Service, 2024). It functions as a standing authorization for global war.
- **Congressional acquiescence**: Members of Congress have institutional incentives to avoid voting on war. A vote in favor risks political liability if the intervention fails; a vote against risks being labeled "soft on security." The result is a bipartisan preference for letting the President act and criticizing the results later.
- **Legal ambiguity**: The War Powers Resolution of 1973 was intended to reassert congressional authority, but no president has conceded its constitutionality, and Congress has never enforced its 60-day withdrawal provision. It has become, in the words of constitutional scholar Louis Fisher, "a parchment barrier."

### 2. Strategic Overextension and the Primacy Consensus

Since the end of the Cold War, the dominant framework in both parties' foreign policy establishments has been "liberal hegemony" or "primacy"--the belief that the United States must maintain global military predominance and actively shape the international order through forward-deployed forces, alliances, and, when necessary, military intervention.

- **Bipartisan consensus**: This framework is shared by neoconservatives (who emphasize democracy promotion and regime change) and liberal internationalists (who emphasize multilateral institutions and humanitarian intervention). Despite their disagreements on method, both factions support an interventionist posture.
- **Lack of strategic prioritization**: The primacy consensus resists the idea that the U.S. must choose among its commitments. The result is simultaneous engagement in counterterrorism, great power competition, alliance management, and humanitarian response, with each mission justified independently but the aggregate strain on resources and attention rarely assessed.
- **Alternative suppressed**: Scholars advocating "restraint" or "offshore balancing" (Stephen Walt, John Mearsheimer, Barry Posen, Andrew Bacevich) have produced extensive academic literature demonstrating the costs and failures of primacy, but their arguments have had limited impact on actual policy until recently.

### 3. Threat Inflation

A persistent feature of U.S. intervention decisions is the exaggeration of threats to justify military action:

| Intervention | Stated Threat | Reality |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Vietnam | "Domino theory"--if Vietnam fell, all of Southeast Asia would follow | After Vietnam's fall, the domino effect did not materialize |
| Iraq (2003) | Weapons of mass destruction; al-Qaeda links | No WMDs found; no operational al-Qaeda links |
| Libya (2011) | Imminent genocide in Benghazi | Threat was real but overstated; intervention exceeded civilian protection mandate |
| General CT operations | Existential threat from terrorism | Terrorism kills fewer Americans annually than lightning, drowning, or domestic gun violence |

**Mechanisms of threat inflation**:

- **Intelligence politicization**: Political leaders pressure intelligence agencies to produce assessments that support predetermined policy conclusions (e.g., the "stovepiping" of raw intelligence to the Vice President's office before the Iraq War).
- **Worst-case analysis**: Security agencies are institutionally biased toward worst-case scenarios because the consequences of underestimating a threat are career-ending, while the consequences of overestimating are not.
- **Media amplification**: Cable news and social media amplify threats, creating a "do something" political environment that rewards action over restraint.

### 4. The Military-Industrial Complex and Defense Industry Incentives

President Eisenhower's 1961 warning about the "military-industrial complex" identified a structural dynamic that has intensified in the subsequent six decades:

- **Economic incentives**: The defense industry is a $900+ billion annual market. Major contractors (Lockheed Martin, Raytheon/RTX, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics) are among the most politically connected corporations in America. Defense industry PACs and employees contributed over $55 million to federal candidates in the 2024 cycle (*OpenSecrets, 2024*).
- **Revolving door**: Senior military officers and civilian defense officials routinely move to defense industry positions after government service, creating incentive alignment. A 2021 POGO study found that 672 senior DoD officials and military officers took positions with defense contractors between 2014 and 2019.
- **Congressional constituency**: Defense contracts are distributed across virtually every congressional district, creating a broad political constituency for military spending and the operations that justify it. Base closures and contract cancellations are intensely resisted regardless of strategic rationale.
- **Think tank influence**: Many of the most prominent foreign policy think tanks receive significant funding from defense contractors, creating intellectual support for interventionist policies (*Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, 2023*).

### 5. Institutional Momentum and Bureaucratic Incentives

Large bureaucracies develop self-sustaining dynamics that resist change:

- **The Pentagon bureaucracy**: The Department of Defense employs over 3.4 million people (military and civilian). Its institutional culture rewards operational tempo, force projection, and the use of military tools to address problems. When the primary tool available is military force, every problem tends to look like a military problem.
- **Combatant command authorities**: The six geographic combatant commands have strong institutional incentives to identify threats in their areas of responsibility to justify resource allocation and operational authority. AFRICOM, for example, has expanded its footprint steadily since its creation in 2007, identifying new threats that require new operations.
- **Career incentives**: Military officers build careers on operational experience. Combat deployments are essential for advancement to senior ranks. This creates individual incentives that align with institutional preferences for active engagement.
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Once an intervention has begun, the political and institutional pressure to "stay the course" is immense. Acknowledging that an intervention has failed means acknowledging that the lives lost and money spent were wasted, a politically and psychologically devastating conclusion that leaders consistently defer.

### 6. Inadequate Exit Planning and the Problem of "Mission Creep"

U.S. interventions routinely lack exit strategies because:

- **Political incentives against planning for withdrawal**: Publicly discussing exit strategies can be portrayed as "planning for failure" or "telegraphing to the enemy."
- **Expanding objectives**: Initial military objectives (destroy al-Qaeda, liberate Kuwait, protect Libyan civilians) are achievable, but they expand to include state-building, democratization, and permanent security guarantees that are not achievable through military force.
- **No institutional owner for post-conflict planning**: The military plans for combat operations; the State Department and USAID plan for reconstruction. Neither has the authority, resources, or institutional capacity to plan comprehensively for the post-conflict phase. The dissolution of the State Department's Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization in 2011 eliminated one of the few institutional efforts to address this gap.

### 7. Failure to Learn from Past Mistakes

Perhaps the most frustrating root cause is the systematic failure to apply lessons from previous interventions:

- **After-action opacity**: Classified after-action reports exist for most major operations but are rarely declassified in time to inform current decisions. The Afghanistan Papers (revealed by the *Washington Post* in 2019) showed that senior leaders knew for years that the war was failing but continued to present optimistic assessments to Congress and the public.
- **Institutional resistance to self-criticism**: Military and intelligence organizations are culturally resistant to acknowledging failure. The organizational incentives favor "lessons identified" over "lessons learned"--the former is a bureaucratic exercise, the latter requires actual behavioral change.
- **Political turnover**: New administrations arrive with new teams who are often dismissive of their predecessors' experiences. The Vietnam generation's hard-won lessons about counterinsurgency were largely forgotten by the time Iraq planning began.
- **No mandatory review mechanism**: Unlike the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for aviation accidents, there is no independent body with the authority and mandate to conduct public, binding after-action reviews of military interventions.

## Ideological and Cultural Factors

### American Exceptionalism

The belief that the United States has a unique mission to spread freedom and democracy globally provides an ideological foundation for intervention that transcends partisan divisions. This belief system:

- Makes Americans receptive to arguments that military force can create democratic outcomes abroad
- Leads to dismissal of lessons from other powers' imperial experiences as irrelevant ("We're not like the British Empire")
- Creates a political environment where opposing intervention can be framed as opposing freedom itself

### Binary Threat Framing

American political culture tends to frame threats in binary, existential terms: communism vs. freedom, civilization vs. terrorism, democracy vs. authoritarianism. This framing:

- Elevates every regional conflict to a test of global credibility
- Makes restraint politically costly ("Why are we letting the bad guys win?")
- Obscures the complexity of local political dynamics that determine intervention outcomes

### Media Dynamics

- **The CNN Effect**: Real-time coverage of humanitarian crises creates political pressure to "do something," while the gradual grinding costs of occupation receive less attention.
- **Rally-around-the-flag**: Presidents consistently receive polling boosts at the outset of military operations, creating incentives to initiate action. The political costs come later, when public support erodes.
- **Asymmetric coverage**: The decision to intervene receives intense media coverage and debate. The decision to continue an ongoing intervention receives almost none, contributing to indefinite commitments.

## Summary: The Intervention Feedback Loop

These root causes are interconnected and self-reinforcing:

1. **Threat inflation** justifies the intervention decision
2. **Executive dominance** enables rapid action without democratic deliberation
3. **Military-industrial incentives** ensure sustained political support for operations and spending
4. **Inadequate planning** leads to mission creep
5. **Institutional momentum** prevents withdrawal even when failure is evident
6. **Failure to learn** ensures the cycle repeats

Breaking this cycle requires addressing not just individual interventions but the structural, institutional, and cultural factors that drive them.
