# Foreign Interventions: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming how the United States decides to use military force abroad requires addressing the structural, institutional, and cultural drivers identified in the root causes analysis. No single reform is sufficient; what is needed is a comprehensive framework that restores democratic accountability, creates rigorous decision-making standards, ensures post-intervention accountability, and builds institutional capacity for non-military engagement.

## Solution 1: Intervention Criteria Framework

### Description

Establish a formal, legislatively mandated set of criteria that must be assessed and publicly documented before any significant military intervention. This builds on the historical precedent of the Weinberger Doctrine (1984) and the Powell Doctrine (1990), but codifies the criteria in law rather than relying on executive self-discipline.

### Proposed Criteria

Before authorizing or initiating a significant military operation (defined as any deployment of armed forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities, or any operation expected to cost more than $50 million or last more than 60 days), the President must certify in writing to Congress that:

1. **Vital national interest**: A vital national security interest of the United States is at stake, specifically identified and explained
2. **Clear and achievable objectives**: The military objectives are clearly defined and achievable with available military force
3. **Diplomacy exhausted**: Reasonable diplomatic, economic, and other non-military alternatives have been attempted or are demonstrably inadequate
4. **Costs and risks assessed**: A comprehensive assessment of projected costs (financial, human, and diplomatic), risks of escalation, and probability of success has been completed and provided to Congress
5. **Exit strategy defined**: Clear criteria for success, a timeline for achieving objectives, and a plan for withdrawal have been developed
6. **Post-conflict plan**: A funded plan for post-conflict stabilization, reconstruction, or transition has been developed in coordination with the State Department, USAID, and relevant international organizations
7. **International support**: The operation has the support of relevant allies and, where feasible, authorization from the United Nations Security Council or other international bodies
8. **Public support**: The operation can be sustained with public support over its expected duration
9. **Legal authority**: The specific legal authority for the operation has been identified and, if necessary, requested from Congress

### Exceptions

- **Self-defense**: The criteria do not apply to immediate self-defense against an armed attack on the United States, its territories, or its armed forces. However, the President must submit the certification within 14 days of initiating defensive operations.
- **Humanitarian emergency**: In cases of imminent mass atrocity (genocide, ethnic cleansing, large-scale crimes against humanity), criteria 3, 7, and 8 may be provisionally waived, but the President must seek congressional authorization within 30 days.

### Implementation

- The certification is submitted to the Gang of Eight (in classified form if necessary) and to the full Congress (in unclassified form) within 48 hours of the decision to intervene
- The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is directed to conduct an independent assessment of the certification's accuracy within 30 days
- Failure to submit the certification does not automatically halt operations but triggers the enforcement provisions of the proposed Military Intervention Reform Act (see 11-legislation.md)

## Solution 2: AUMF Reform

### Description

Repeal the 2001 AUMF and replace it with a narrow, time-limited authorization that specifies the groups targeted, the countries where operations are authorized, and the conditions for expansion.

### Key Elements

- **Repeal the 2001 AUMF** with a 180-day transition period to allow operations to be transitioned to the new framework or terminated
- **New authorization**: Authorize force only against specifically named groups (e.g., al-Qaeda, ISIS) that pose a direct threat to the U.S. homeland or U.S. persons abroad
- **Geographic limits**: Specify the countries where operations are authorized; expansion to new countries requires congressional notification and a 60-day period for congressional review
- **3-year sunset clause**: The new authorization automatically expires after 3 years unless Congress affirmatively votes to renew it
- **Quarterly reporting**: The President must submit unclassified quarterly reports identifying all groups targeted, countries of operation, civilian casualties, and cost estimates

### Precedent

The concept of sunset clauses for military authorizations is not radical. The original War Powers Resolution envisioned a 60-day limit on unauthorized operations. The UK's parliamentary convention requires a Commons vote before major military action. Several U.S. allies (Germany, Canada, Denmark) require periodic legislative renewal of military deployments.

## Solution 3: Mandatory Congressional Authorization

### Description

Strengthen the War Powers Resolution to require affirmative congressional authorization for any military operation lasting more than 60 days, with automatic funding cutoff as the enforcement mechanism.

### Key Elements

- **60-day clock**: Consistent with the existing War Powers Resolution, the President must obtain congressional authorization within 60 days of introducing armed forces into hostilities
- **Automatic funding cutoff**: If Congress does not affirmatively vote to authorize the operation within 60 days, all funding for the operation is automatically suspended (with a 30-day wind-down period to ensure orderly withdrawal)
- **No-silence-as-consent**: Congressional inaction is treated as non-authorization, not consent. This addresses the current dynamic where Congress avoids voting and the President interprets silence as acquiescence
- **Expedited procedures**: Establishes privileged legislative procedures (similar to those used for trade promotion authority) to ensure that authorization resolutions receive a floor vote in both chambers within the 60-day window
- **Judicial review**: Provides standing for individual members of Congress to challenge unauthorized military operations in federal court

## Solution 4: Independent Post-Intervention Review Board

### Description

Create an independent, nonpartisan body modeled on the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to conduct after-action reviews of military interventions and publish findings and recommendations.

### Structure

- **Composition**: 7 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, with no more than 4 from the same political party. Members serve staggered 7-year terms and may not have been employed by the Department of Defense, a defense contractor, or a defense-focused think tank within the preceding 5 years.
- **Mandate**: Conduct a comprehensive review of any military intervention that lasts more than 1 year or costs more than $10 billion
- **Powers**: Subpoena authority for documents and testimony; access to classified information; authority to compel declassification of findings after security review
- **Products**: Publish a public report within 2 years of the conclusion of each intervention, including findings on decision-making, intelligence assessments, execution, outcomes, costs, civilian harm, and lessons learned
- **Recommendations**: Issue recommendations for policy, legal, and institutional reforms, with a "comply or explain" requirement for the executive branch

### Precedent

The NTSB model has been remarkably effective in aviation safety. Its independence, technical expertise, and public reporting have driven dramatic improvements in air safety. Similar independent review mechanisms exist for financial crises (the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission) and intelligence failures (the 9/11 Commission, the WMD Commission).

## Solution 5: Diplomacy-First Infrastructure

### Description

Rebuild and strengthen the institutional capacity for diplomacy and conflict prevention to provide genuine alternatives to military intervention.

### Key Elements

- **Restore State Department capacity**: Reverse the hollowing-out of the State Department that has accelerated since the 2017 hiring freeze. Increase the Foreign Service by 25% and fully fund diplomatic operations
- **Create a Conflict Prevention Fund**: Establish a $2 billion annual fund for early-warning systems, preventive diplomacy, mediation, and conflict resolution, managed jointly by the State Department and USAID
- **Elevate USAID**: Restore USAID's independence and ensure its development programs are not subordinated to short-term military objectives
- **Rebuild the Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization**: Re-establish an institutional home within the State Department for post-conflict planning, with dedicated staff, funding, and planning authority
- **International partnerships**: Strengthen U.S. participation in multilateral conflict-prevention mechanisms, including UN peacekeeping, regional organizations, and the International Criminal Court

## Solution 6: Civilian Harm Mitigation and Accountability

### Description

Establish robust mechanisms for preventing, investigating, and compensating civilian harm during military operations.

### Key Elements

- **Mandatory civilian harm assessment**: Every operation plan must include a civilian harm assessment conducted by trained civilian protection advisors
- **Independent investigation unit**: Create a permanent, independent unit within the DoD (outside the chain of command) to investigate credible reports of civilian casualties
- **Compensation fund**: Establish a funded program ($100 million annually) for ex gratia payments to civilians harmed by U.S. military operations, with a streamlined claims process accessible to affected populations
- **Transparency**: Publish annual reports on civilian casualties, investigations, and compensation, with data disaggregated by operation and country
- **DoD Directive 3000.09 codification**: Codify the existing DoD directive on civilian harm mitigation into statute, making it enforceable and resistant to executive modification

## Solution 7: Declassification and Transparency

### Description

Establish automatic declassification timelines for intervention-related records to enable public accountability and historical learning.

### Key Elements

- **10-year automatic declassification**: All records related to military intervention decisions, intelligence assessments, and operational outcomes are automatically declassified 10 years after the conclusion of operations, unless a specific exemption is granted by an independent classification review board
- **Real-time congressional access**: All classified assessments related to ongoing interventions are made available to all members of Congress (not just committee chairs and the Gang of Eight)
- **FOIA reform**: Strengthen FOIA enforcement for national security records and impose penalties on agencies that systematically delay or deny legitimate requests
- **Whistleblower protections**: Strengthen protections for government employees who disclose information about waste, fraud, abuse, or illegality in intervention operations
