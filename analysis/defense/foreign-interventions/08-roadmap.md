# Foreign Interventions: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Reforming how the United States decides to use military force abroad requires a phased approach that builds political support incrementally, demonstrates results at each stage, and addresses the most achievable reforms first while laying the groundwork for deeper structural changes. This roadmap sequences reforms based on political feasibility, institutional readiness, and the need to establish precedents that enable subsequent, more ambitious changes.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2)

### Objective

Establish transparency mechanisms and build the bipartisan coalition necessary for deeper reforms.

### Actions

**1.1 Repeal Obsolete Authorities**

- Pursue repeal of any remaining outdated military authorizations
- Build on the precedent of the 2024 repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF
- Generate momentum for addressing the 2001 AUMF

**1.2 Transparency and Reporting Requirements**

- Pass legislation requiring quarterly unclassified reports on all ongoing military operations, including troop numbers, countries of operation, legal authorities cited, civilian casualties, and costs
- Require the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to publish annual estimates of total intervention costs, including long-term veterans' care and interest on war-related borrowing
- Mandate publication of existing classified after-action reports from completed interventions (Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya) with appropriate redactions for sources and methods

**1.3 Civilian Harm Accountability**

- Codify DoD Directive 3000.09 (Civilian Harm Mitigation) into statute
- Establish the civilian harm investigation and compensation mechanisms described in the solutions
- Fund the compensation program at $100 million annually in the next NDAA

**1.4 Build the Coalition**

- Convene a bipartisan congressional caucus on intervention reform, drawing from the existing libertarian-progressive alliance
- Commission a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the total costs and outcomes of post-9/11 interventions
- Engage veterans' organizations, taxpayer groups, and civil liberties organizations as advocacy partners

### Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Indicator |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Transparency reporting legislation introduced | Month 6 | Bill introduced with bipartisan co-sponsors |
| Civilian harm provisions in NDAA | Year 1 | Signed into law as part of annual defense bill |
| GAO cost study completed | Year 1 | Public report published |
| Bipartisan caucus established | Year 1 | At least 30 members from both parties |
| Classified after-action reports declassified | Year 2 | Key Afghanistan and Iraq reports published |

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 2-4)

### Objective

Enact the core legislative reforms that address the decision-making process, legal authorities, and accountability mechanisms.

### Actions

**2.1 Military Intervention Reform Act**

- Introduce and pass the Military Intervention Reform Act (see 11-legislation.md), establishing mandatory intervention criteria, cost estimates, exit strategy requirements, and 60-day congressional authorization provisions
- Use the Phase 1 GAO study and declassified records to build the public case for reform

**2.2 AUMF Reform**

- Introduce legislation to repeal the 2001 AUMF with a 180-day transition period
- Simultaneously introduce a narrow, time-limited replacement authorization targeting specifically named groups
- Include a 3-year sunset clause with mandatory renewal vote

**2.3 War Powers Resolution Update**

- Amend the War Powers Resolution to include automatic funding cutoff provisions and expedited floor-vote procedures
- Address the congressional standing question by providing explicit statutory authorization for judicial review

**2.4 Post-Intervention Accountability Act**

- Introduce and pass the Post-Intervention Accountability Act (see 11-legislation.md), creating the Independent Post-Intervention Review Board and mandatory declassification timelines
- Appoint initial board members with confirmed independence and expertise

### Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Indicator |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Military Intervention Reform Act passed | Year 3 | Signed into law |
| 2001 AUMF repealed and replaced | Year 3-4 | New narrow authorization in effect |
| War Powers Resolution amended | Year 3 | Updated statute with enforcement mechanisms |
| Post-Intervention Review Board established | Year 4 | Board members confirmed; first review initiated |
| First intervention criteria certification | Year 4 | President submits certification for an ongoing or new operation |

## Phase 3: Institutional Transformation (Years 4-8)

### Objective

Rebuild the institutional infrastructure for diplomacy-first foreign policy and embed intervention reform into institutional culture.

### Actions

**3.1 Diplomacy-First Investment**

- Increase State Department and USAID funding by 25% over 4 years
- Re-establish and fully staff the Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization
- Create the $2 billion annual Conflict Prevention Fund

**3.2 Defense Budget Reform**

- Eliminate the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account (or its successor), which has been used to fund war operations outside normal budget caps and without rigorous oversight
- Require all military operations to be funded through the base defense budget, subject to normal appropriations process and Budget Control Act caps

**3.3 Institutional Learning Mechanisms**

- Require the National Defense University and service war colleges to incorporate intervention case studies (including failures) as a mandatory curriculum component
- Establish a "lessons learned" database accessible to all relevant agencies, maintained by the Post-Intervention Review Board
- Fund academic research on intervention outcomes through the National Science Foundation and the United States Institute of Peace

**3.4 International Partnerships**

- Re-engage with the International Criminal Court (ICC) and support its jurisdiction over war crimes and crimes against humanity
- Strengthen U.S. participation in UN peacekeeping operations and preventive diplomacy mechanisms
- Negotiate bilateral and multilateral agreements that establish shared intervention criteria with key allies

### Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Indicator |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| State Department funding increase | Year 5-6 | 25% increase achieved |
| OCO account eliminated | Year 5 | All operations funded through base budget |
| Conflict Prevention Fund operational | Year 6 | Fund disbursing resources to prevention programs |
| First Post-Intervention Review published | Year 6 | Public report on a completed intervention |
| War college curriculum updated | Year 5 | Mandatory intervention case study modules in place |

## Phase 4: Consolidation and Evaluation (Years 8-12)

### Objective

Evaluate the effectiveness of reforms, make adjustments, and ensure that institutional changes are durable.

### Actions

- **Comprehensive review**: The Post-Intervention Review Board conducts a comprehensive assessment of the reform framework's effectiveness after its first full cycle
- **Sunset review**: Congress reviews and renews (with modifications) the Military Intervention Reform Act and the Post-Intervention Accountability Act
- **International assessment**: Compare U.S. intervention outcomes in the reform period with historical baselines and with the practices of other democratic nations
- **Cultural assessment**: Evaluate whether institutional culture at DoD, the intelligence community, and the State Department has shifted toward greater restraint, deliberation, and accountability

### Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Indicator |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Reform framework comprehensive review | Year 8 | Review Board publishes assessment |
| Legislative reauthorization | Year 8-10 | Congress reviews and renews reform legislation |
| Measurable reduction in unilateral interventions | Year 10 | Fewer operations initiated without congressional authorization |
| Institutional culture shift documented | Year 12 | Independent assessment shows changes in decision-making processes |

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline (2024) | Target (Year 5) | Target (Year 10) | Measurement Method |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Congressional votes on military operations | 0 since 2002 | At least 2 votes on new or renewed authorizations | Regular votes on all significant operations | Congressional Record |
| AUMF scope (countries/groups covered) | 22+ countries, 41+ groups | Reduced to specifically named groups in specified countries | Maintained narrow scope with sunset reviews | Executive branch reports |
| Civilian casualty transparency | Partial, delayed, disputed | Quarterly public reporting on all operations | Comprehensive reporting with independent verification | DoD/Review Board reports |
| Intervention cost transparency | Incomplete; OCO used to obscure | CBO annual total-cost reports published | All costs in base budget, independently audited | CBO/GAO reports |
| Diplomatic capacity (Foreign Service officers) | ~13,000 | +10% increase | +25% increase | State Department personnel data |
| Post-intervention reviews completed | 0 (no standing mechanism) | First review initiated | Multiple reviews completed and published | Review Board annual report |
| Public confidence in intervention decisions | Low (polling) | Improved by 10+ points | Sustained improvement | Chicago Council, Pew surveys |
| Declassified intervention records | Minimal | Major completed-intervention records published | 10-year automatic declassification operational | National Archives data |

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Major terrorist attack creates "rally around the flag" that overrides reform | Medium | Very High | Build reform framework before crisis; design exceptions for genuine emergencies |
| New great power conflict (Taiwan, Eastern Europe) derails reform agenda | Medium | High | Frame reforms as strengthening decision-making, not preventing action |
| Executive branch noncompliance with new requirements | High | High | Include automatic enforcement mechanisms (funding cutoffs); provide judicial standing |
| Bipartisan coalition fractures over specific intervention (e.g., Iran) | Medium | Medium | Keep reform framework principled rather than tied to any specific conflict |
| Reform fatigue / loss of political momentum | Medium | Medium | Sequence achievable wins early to demonstrate value and sustain support |
