# Foreign Interventions: What Citizens Can Do

## Overview

The decision to send American troops into combat is among the most consequential actions a government can take, yet citizens often feel powerless to influence these decisions. In reality, public opinion is one of the strongest constraints on intervention policy. The Vietnam War ended in large part because of sustained public opposition. The 2013 decision not to strike Syria after its use of chemical weapons was driven by overwhelming public opposition to military action. Citizens who organize, advocate, and hold their representatives accountable can shift intervention policy.

## Individual Actions

### Stay Informed

- **Follow independent reporting on U.S. military operations**: Mainstream media coverage of ongoing interventions is often sparse between major events. Independent outlets and specialized publications provide more consistent coverage.
    - *The Intercept* (investigative reporting on military and intelligence operations)
    - *Just Security* (legal analysis of national security issues)
    - *Lawfare* (national security law and policy)
    - *War on the Rocks* (defense and foreign policy analysis)
    - *Defense One* (defense news and analysis)
- **Read primary sources**: Congressional Research Service reports, SIGAR reports, and DoD press briefings are publicly available and provide unfiltered information about military operations
- **Understand the costs**: Visit the Costs of War Project (watson.brown.edu/costsofwar) to understand the full financial and human costs of U.S. interventions

### Contact Elected Representatives

- **Call and write your members of Congress**: Constituent pressure is the most direct way to influence congressional action on war powers
    - Demand that your representative and senators vote on any military operation lasting more than 60 days
    - Ask specifically about their position on AUMF reform
    - Request that they co-sponsor intervention reform legislation
    - Ask why they have not used their constitutional power to authorize or end military operations
- **Attend town halls**: Ask questions about military operations and war powers at public events. These questions receive media coverage and put representatives on the record
- **Submit op-eds and letters to the editor**: Local newspapers remain influential with members of Congress, particularly in smaller media markets

### Vote

- **Research candidates' positions on military intervention**: Many candidates avoid taking specific positions on war powers. Press them for specifics during campaigns.
- **Support candidates who advocate for intervention reform**: Organizations like VoteVets, Concerned Veterans for America, and the Quincy Institute publish candidate assessments
- **Hold elected officials accountable**: Track how your representatives vote on military authorization, defense spending, and arms sales

### Engage with the Military Community

- **Listen to veterans**: Post-9/11 veterans have direct experience with the consequences of intervention policy and are often among the most thoughtful critics
- **Support veterans' organizations advocating for reform**: See the organizations table below
- **Challenge the "support the troops" conflation**: Supporting service members does not require supporting every military operation. It is possible--and often necessary--to oppose a war while honoring those who serve

### Organize Locally

- **Host community forums**: Invite veterans, scholars, and foreign policy experts to discuss intervention policy in accessible community settings
- **Coordinate constituent pressure campaigns**: Organize letter-writing, phone-banking, and town hall attendance focused on war powers issues
- **Partner with religious communities**: Many faith traditions have teachings on just war and peacemaking. Religious communities can be powerful voices for intervention reform
- **Engage student organizations**: College campuses are historically important venues for debate about military policy. Support student groups that organize educational events and advocacy

### Support Journalism

- **Subscribe to outlets that cover military operations**: Investigative journalism about military operations depends on subscriber support
- **Donate to investigative journalism funds**: Organizations like the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting fund in-depth coverage of conflict zones
- **Support FOIA litigation**: Organizations like the National Security Archive and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press use FOIA lawsuits to force disclosure of information about military operations

## Systemic Actions

### Advocacy for Specific Reforms

Citizens can build support for the specific reforms outlined in this analysis:

1. **AUMF Reform Campaign**: Organize around the demand that Congress repeal the 2001 AUMF and replace it with narrow, time-limited authorizations. This is the single most impactful legislative change.
2. **War Powers Restoration**: Demand that Congress assert its constitutional war power by voting on every significant military operation. The argument that the President needs unchecked authority to respond to threats should be challenged with the constitutional text itself.
3. **Transparency Requirements**: Advocate for mandatory public reporting on military operations, costs, and civilian casualties.
4. **Post-Intervention Accountability**: Support the creation of an independent review board to assess completed interventions and publish findings.
5. **Diplomacy-First Funding**: Advocate for increased funding for the State Department, USAID, and conflict prevention programs.

### Electoral Strategies

- **Primary challenges**: Support primary challenges to incumbents who consistently vote for unlimited military authority without oversight
- **Issue visibility**: Make intervention reform a visible campaign issue, not an afterthought
- **Cross-partisan alliance building**: The most effective intervention reform coalition bridges left and right. Libertarian-leaning conservatives and progressive Democrats share skepticism of unchecked military power, even if their underlying philosophies differ

### Long-Term Cultural Change

- **Challenge the "military equals security" equation**: Security comes from many sources, including diplomacy, economic strength, alliances, and domestic resilience. Military intervention is one tool, not the defining tool
- **Resist threat inflation**: When political leaders claim that a distant threat requires military action, ask for evidence, context, and an honest assessment of alternatives
- **Demand accountability, not just support**: The best way to "support the troops" is to ensure they are sent into harm's way only when necessary, with clear objectives, adequate resources, and a plan to bring them home
