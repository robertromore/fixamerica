# Foreign Interventions: Current State

## U.S. Military Deployments Worldwide (2024-2025)

The United States maintains the most extensive global military footprint of any nation in history. As of 2025, approximately 177,000 U.S. military personnel are stationed or deployed in roughly 80 countries, operating from approximately 750 overseas military installations.

### Major Overseas Deployments

| Region / Country | Approximate Personnel | Primary Mission | Legal Authority |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Japan | ~54,000 | Indo-Pacific deterrence, alliance obligations | Status of Forces Agreement, Mutual Security Treaty |
| Germany | ~35,000 | European deterrence, NATO obligations | Status of Forces Agreement, NATO Treaty |
| South Korea | ~28,500 | Deterrence of North Korea | Status of Forces Agreement, Mutual Defense Treaty |
| Middle East (combined) | ~40,000-45,000 | Force projection, CT operations, Israel support | Various: 2001 AUMF, Article II, bilateral agreements |
| Africa (combined) | ~6,000 | Counterterrorism advise-and-assist | 2001 AUMF, Title 10 security cooperation |
| Eastern Europe / Baltics | ~10,000+ (rotational) | NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, Ukraine deterrence | NATO Treaty, European Deterrence Initiative |

### Forward Operating Posture

- **Combatant Commands**: The U.S. divides the globe into six geographic combatant commands (EUCOM, INDOPACOM, CENTCOM, AFRICOM, SOUTHCOM, NORTHCOM), each led by a four-star general or admiral with operational authority over forces in their area of responsibility.
- **Lily Pad Bases**: Beyond major installations, the U.S. operates a growing network of smaller, more austere bases ("lily pads") across Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, often with minimal public disclosure.
- **Rotational Deployments**: Increasing reliance on rotational rather than permanent deployments, particularly in Eastern Europe and the Pacific, to maintain flexibility and reduce host-nation political friction.

## Ongoing Interventions and Operations

### Middle East

**Iraq and Syria (Operation Inherent Resolve)**

- Approximately 2,500 U.S. troops remain in Iraq and 900 in Syria as of early 2025, conducting counterterrorism operations against ISIS remnants.
- The 2001 AUMF and the 2002 Iraq AUMF continue to serve as the primary legal authorities, despite growing bipartisan calls for repeal.
- ISIS has been reduced to an insurgency but retains 3,000-5,000 fighters in the Syria-Iraq theater and has conducted over 600 attacks in 2024 alone (*NCTC, 2024*).
- U.S. forces faced over 170 attacks from Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq and Syria between October 2023 and February 2024, killing three U.S. soldiers and wounding dozens. The U.S. responded with retaliatory strikes against militia positions in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen.
- Negotiations on the future of the U.S. military presence in Iraq continue, with the Iraqi government seeking a transition from combat operations to a bilateral security partnership.

**Yemen (Houthi Crisis)**

- Beginning in late 2023, Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen launched a sustained campaign of drone and missile attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, disrupting approximately 12% of global trade.
- The U.S. and UK responded with Operation Prosperity Guardian and subsequent direct strikes against Houthi military infrastructure in Yemen.
- The Biden administration conducted these strikes under Article II self-defense authority, prompting congressional debate about the absence of specific authorization.
- As of 2025, intermittent Houthi attacks and U.S. defensive and offensive operations continue.

**Israel-Gaza Conflict**

- Following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli military campaign in Gaza, the U.S. surged military assets to the region, including two carrier strike groups, additional air defense assets, and approximately 2,000 Marines.
- U.S. forces conducted defensive operations against Houthi, Iraqi militia, and Iranian-proxy attacks directed at U.S. and allied assets.
- The U.S. provided approximately $17.9 billion in military aid to Israel in the year following October 7, 2023 (*Costs of War Project, Brown University, 2024*).
- The conflict raised fundamental questions about U.S. intervention policy, including the conditions under which the U.S. should restrain allies receiving American military support.

### Africa

- U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) maintains approximately 6,000 personnel across the continent, with a primary focus on counterterrorism in the Sahel, East Africa, and the Lake Chad Basin.
- Key targets include al-Shabaab (Somalia), ISIS-West Africa, and various al-Qaeda affiliates.
- The U.S. conducts drone strikes in Somalia under the 2001 AUMF and a 2022 executive order restoring the authority to target al-Shabaab.
- A series of military coups in the Sahel (Mali 2021, Burkina Faso 2022, Niger 2023) has forced the U.S. to withdraw or reduce military presence in countries that were central to the CT mission. The withdrawal from Niger's Air Base 201, a $110 million drone facility, was a significant operational setback.
- Russia's Wagner Group (now Africa Corps) has expanded its presence across the Sahel, filling the vacuum left by departing Western forces.

### Support to Ukraine

- While the U.S. has not deployed combat troops to Ukraine, the conflict represents the largest U.S.-backed proxy intervention since the Cold War.
- Total U.S. military aid to Ukraine from February 2022 through early 2025 exceeded $56 billion (*Kiel Institute Ukraine Support Tracker, 2025*).
- Aid includes advanced weapons systems (HIMARS, Patriot air defense, Abrams tanks, F-16s), training of Ukrainian forces in NATO countries, intelligence sharing, and logistical support.
- The U.S. role raises ongoing debate about escalation risk, the boundary between support and co-belligerency, and the endgame of the conflict.

### Other Active Operations

| Operation / Theater | Description | Legal Authority |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Counter-narcotics (Colombia, Central America) | Military advisors and intelligence support for counter-narcotics operations | Title 10 security cooperation |
| South China Sea | Freedom of navigation operations challenging Chinese territorial claims | Customary international law, UNCLOS |
| Horn of Africa / Gulf of Aden | Anti-piracy and maritime security operations | Various bilateral and multilateral authorities |
| Philippines | Expanded military cooperation, Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) | Mutual Defense Treaty, EDCA |

## Legal Authorities in Use

### Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs)

- **2001 AUMF (P.L. 107-40)**: Authorizes the President to use "all necessary and appropriate force" against those who "planned, authorized, committed, or aided" the 9/11 attacks, or who "harbored such organizations or persons." Has been interpreted to cover operations in at least 22 countries. Remains the primary legal authority for most CT operations.
- **2002 Iraq AUMF (P.L. 107-243)**: Authorized force to "defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq." The Senate voted 66-30 in March 2023 to repeal this authorization, and President Biden signed the repeal into law in March 2024. However, the 2001 AUMF remains in effect.

### Article II Powers

- Presidents have increasingly relied on Article II of the Constitution (Commander-in-Chief authority and the right of self-defense) to conduct operations without specific congressional authorization, including the 2011 Libya intervention, the 2017 Syria strikes, and the 2024 Yemen strikes.
- The War Powers Resolution of 1973 (50 U.S.C. 1541-1548) requires the President to notify Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities and to withdraw them within 60 days absent congressional authorization. No president has conceded the resolution's constitutionality, and Congress has never successfully enforced its withdrawal provision.

### Congressional Oversight

- Congress receives classified quarterly reports on AUMF operations from the executive branch but has not held a floor vote on a new AUMF since 2002.
- Multiple bipartisan AUMF reform bills have been introduced since 2014 but none has reached a floor vote in both chambers.
- The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee hold periodic hearings but lack enforcement mechanisms to compel executive compliance.

## Current Debate

The current intervention debate centers on several fault lines:

- **Restraint vs. Primacy**: A growing bipartisan "restraint" coalition (including libertarian-leaning Republicans and progressive Democrats) argues that the U.S. is strategically overextended and should reduce overseas military commitments. Proponents of "primacy" or "liberal internationalism" argue that American military engagement is essential to maintaining the rules-based international order.
- **AUMF Reform**: Broad consensus exists that the 2001 AUMF is outdated, but Congress has been unable to agree on a replacement framework. Hawks fear that repeal without replacement would leave a legal gap; restraint advocates fear that a new AUMF would simply codify the status quo.
- **Proxy War Boundaries**: U.S. support to Ukraine and Israel has intensified debate about the distinction between support and intervention, and the conditions under which the U.S. should restrain allies.
- **Great Power Competition vs. Counterterrorism**: The 2022 National Defense Strategy identifies China as the "pacing challenge," but CT operations continue to absorb significant resources and attention. Balancing these priorities is a central strategic question.
