# Foreign Interventions: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes U.S. foreign military intervention policy through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints. Foreign intervention is an area of unusual cross-partisan alignment, with a growing "restraint" coalition bridging libertarian and progressive perspectives, while a "primacy" consensus unites traditional hawks in both parties.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of 2026-02-05)

| Bill/Amendment | Type | Current Status | Last Action |
|----------------|------|----------------|-------------|
| *Military Intervention Reform Act* | *Federal* | *Proposed* | *Drafted in this analysis* |
| *Post-Intervention Accountability Act* | *Federal* | *Proposed* | *Drafted in this analysis* |
| *2001 AUMF Repeal (various versions)* | *Federal* | *Pending* | *Multiple bills introduced but none passed both chambers* |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Stated concern is national security and executive flexibility; actual priority often shifts based on which party controls the White House* |
| Principle consistency | *Inconsistent: fiscal conservatism is invoked selectively (concern about domestic spending but less scrutiny of military spending); support for executive power fluctuates with party control* |
| Goalpost stability | *Moderate: positions on intervention shift between administrations (supported Iraq War under Bush, some skepticism of interventions under Obama, mixed under Trump)* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Some: tendency to frame restraint as weakness rather than engaging with cost-benefit arguments* |

**Justification:** The conservative perspective on foreign intervention is internally divided between traditional hawks (who support robust military engagement) and a growing "restraint" wing (associated with figures like Rand Paul and the Concerned Veterans for America). The hawk wing has historically dominated Republican foreign policy but lost significant ground after the Afghanistan withdrawal. The inconsistency in applying fiscal conservatism to military spending, and the fluctuation in views on executive war power depending on which party holds the presidency, reduce the consistency score.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Republican votes on the 2002 Iraq AUMF were overwhelmingly in favor (215-6 in the House); by 2023, a significant minority supported repeal*
- *Heritage Foundation's "Index of U.S. Military Strength" consistently argues for higher defense spending while the same organization calls for fiscal restraint in domestic spending*
- *Concerned Veterans for America (Koch-affiliated) has advocated for military restraint and AUMF reform since 2015, representing a genuine shift within conservative circles*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Agrees that the U.S. has significant overseas commitments but frames many as necessary for deterrence; skeptical of framing that suggests the U.S. is "overextended"* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Rejects the emphasis on military-industrial complex influence and threat inflation; agrees somewhat on congressional abdication but attributes it to Democratic obstruction rather than bipartisan failure* |

**Source references:**

- *Heritage Foundation, "2025 Index of U.S. Military Strength," 2024*
- *Concerned Veterans for America, "Defending Defense: A Conservative Case for Restraint," 2020*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Intervention Criteria Framework | 4/10 | *Bureaucratic requirement that hamstrings the Commander-in-Chief* | *Fear that any constraint on executive military authority weakens deterrence* |
| AUMF Reform | 5/10 | *Open to updating but not repealing without replacement* | *Genuine security concern about legal gaps; also reluctance to take politically risky votes* |
| Mandatory Congressional Authorization | 4/10 | *Unnecessary when Republicans trust the President; important when they do not* | *Partisan inconsistency: support for executive authority depends on party of the President* |
| Independent Review Board | 5/10 | *Potentially useful but must not become a partisan tool* | *Concern that reviews would be used to politically attack past Republican administrations (especially Iraq)* |
| Diplomacy-First Infrastructure | 3/10 | *Diplomacy without military credibility is weakness* | *Skepticism of State Department effectiveness; preference for military tools* |
| Civilian Harm Accountability | 5/10 | *Support in principle but oppose "tying the hands" of commanders* | *Concern that accountability mechanisms would slow operations and create legal liability* |
| Declassification and Transparency | 4/10 | *Support transparency in principle but not at the expense of national security* | *Concern that declassified records would embarrass past administrations* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Military Intervention Reform Act | 3/10 | *Unconstitutional infringement on Commander-in-Chief authority; would embolden adversaries* | *Genuine concern about executive flexibility; also reluctance to create precedent constraining future Republican presidents* |
| Post-Intervention Accountability Act | 5/10 | *Review board concept acceptable if genuinely bipartisan; declassification timeline too short* | *Fear that Iraq War review would be politically damaging; some genuine security concerns about declassification* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Strengthen the President's ability to respond quickly to threats by expanding, not constraining, executive authority
- Increase defense spending to ensure military readiness rather than restricting when force can be used
- Update AUMFs to reflect current threats rather than repealing them
- Focus on "peace through strength" rather than restraint-oriented reforms

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Religious Right (shared support for strong military posture), some Centrists (on AUMF update rather than repeal)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on fiscal accountability for military spending), Populist (on skepticism of "endless wars")
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on the role of military power)

---

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Stated commitment to multilateralism and humanitarian intervention; actual positions shift based on which administration is in power and which intervention is under discussion* |
| Principle consistency | *Inconsistent: supported humanitarian intervention in Libya but criticized similar rationale in Iraq; support for restraint fluctuates when "their" president is making decisions* |
| Goalpost stability | *Moderate: positions on executive war authority shifted between Bush era (strong opposition) and Obama era (more permissive)* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Limited: generally willing to engage with cost-benefit analysis of interventions* |

**Justification:** The liberal perspective on foreign intervention is genuinely divided between a multilateral-interventionist wing (which supports humanitarian intervention through international institutions) and a restraint-sympathetic wing (which has grown since Iraq). The inconsistency between criticizing executive overreach under Republican presidents while accepting similar actions under Democratic presidents reduces the consistency score.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Democratic opposition to the Iraq War grew as the war became unpopular, but many leading Democrats (including Senators Clinton, Biden, and Kerry) voted for the 2002 AUMF*
- *The Obama administration's 2011 Libya intervention was conducted without congressional authorization and with questionable legal justification, with limited Democratic criticism at the time*
- *Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) have been among the most consistent advocates for war powers reform, representing the principled wing*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | *Agrees with most factual assessments about overextension, costs, and humanitarian consequences; may emphasize multilateral frameworks more than the analysis does* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | *Agrees on threat inflation and congressional abdication; less comfortable with critique of liberal interventionism as a root cause* |

**Source references:**

- *Center for American Progress, "A New Approach to U.S. Foreign Policy," 2023*
- *Brookings Institution, various papers on intervention and humanitarian protection*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Intervention Criteria Framework | 7/10 | *Good framework but should include humanitarian considerations more prominently* | *Concern that strict criteria might prevent legitimate humanitarian interventions* |
| AUMF Reform | 8/10 | *Strongly support repeal and narrow replacement* | *Broadly aligned; some want to preserve flexibility for humanitarian action* |
| Mandatory Congressional Authorization | 7/10 | *Support in principle; concerned about emergency response capability* | *Want to ensure humanitarian intervention remains possible without lengthy deliberation* |
| Independent Review Board | 8/10 | *Strong support for accountability and transparency* | *Genuine commitment to learning from mistakes; also interest in highlighting Republican-era failures* |
| Diplomacy-First Infrastructure | 9/10 | *Core liberal priority; invest in diplomacy and development* | *Strong alignment with liberal values of multilateralism and institutional engagement* |
| Civilian Harm Accountability | 9/10 | *Critical reform; the U.S. must take responsibility for civilian casualties* | *Genuine humanitarian concern; also responds to progressive pressure on this issue* |
| Declassification and Transparency | 8/10 | *Essential for democratic accountability* | *Broad support; may want exemptions for ongoing diplomatic negotiations* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Military Intervention Reform Act | 7/10 | *Support with modifications to preserve humanitarian intervention authority* | *Want a humanitarian exception that is broader than the self-defense exception* |
| Post-Intervention Accountability Act | 8/10 | *Strong support for the review board and declassification provisions* | *May seek to ensure the board examines impacts on foreign civilian populations* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Strengthen the humanitarian intervention exception to allow action to prevent genocide or mass atrocities with a lower authorization threshold
- Integrate the intervention framework with international institutions (UN, NATO) rather than relying solely on U.S. domestic legal processes
- Create a dedicated humanitarian protection force under UN auspices
- Invest heavily in conflict prevention and peacebuilding through USAID and multilateral institutions

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on most reforms except humanitarian intervention scope), Centrist (on pragmatic AUMF reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative restraint wing (on AUMF reform), Libertarian (on ending "endless wars")
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right, hawkish Conservatives (on reducing military posture)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Stated opposition to militarism and imperialism aligns closely with actual positions; consistently critical of intervention regardless of which party holds the White House* |
| Principle consistency | *High: applies anti-militarism principles consistently across administrations and conflicts* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable: positions on war powers and military restraint have been consistent over the past two decades* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Some: can be dismissive of legitimate security concerns when framing all intervention as imperialism* |

**Justification:** Progressives have been the most consistent critics of U.S. military intervention across administrations. The Congressional Progressive Caucus opposed both the Iraq War and the Libya intervention, and has consistently pushed for AUMF repeal and defense spending reductions. The slight deduction reflects occasional tendency to dismiss all security justifications as pretextual rather than engaging with genuine (if overstated) threats.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) cast the sole vote against the 2001 AUMF and has been a consistent voice for war powers reform*
- *Bernie Sanders voted against the Iraq War authorization in 2002 and has consistently opposed military interventions*
- *Congressional Progressive Caucus has introduced annual "People's Budget" proposals that significantly cut military spending and redirect funds to diplomacy and development*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement with the assessment of overextension, costs, and humanitarian consequences* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | *Agrees strongly on military-industrial complex influence, threat inflation, and executive overreach; would add more emphasis on imperialism and capitalism as structural drivers* |

**Source references:**

- *Congressional Progressive Caucus, "People's Budget" proposals, 2020-2025*
- *Institute for Policy Studies, "National Priorities Project" military spending analyses*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Intervention Criteria Framework | 8/10 | *Good start but criteria should set a higher bar for intervention* | *Concern that any framework might legitimize interventions that should not occur* |
| AUMF Reform | 9/10 | *Repeal all AUMFs; any replacement must be extremely narrow and time-limited* | *Strong alignment; would prefer outright repeal without replacement* |
| Mandatory Congressional Authorization | 9/10 | *Essential democratic reform* | *Fully aligned with progressive commitment to democratic accountability* |
| Independent Review Board | 9/10 | *Critical for accountability; must have real power and independence* | *Want the board to examine structural and systemic causes, not just operational failures* |
| Diplomacy-First Infrastructure | 9/10 | *Strongly support; redirect military spending to diplomacy and development* | *Would go further: significant cuts to military budget to fund massive diplomacy and development investment* |
| Civilian Harm Accountability | 10/10 | *Non-negotiable; the U.S. must acknowledge and compensate for civilian harm* | *Strongest support among all perspectives; see this as a moral imperative* |
| Declassification and Transparency | 9/10 | *Full support; the public has a right to know* | *Would prefer shorter declassification timeline (5 years rather than 10)* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Military Intervention Reform Act | 8/10 | *Support with amendments to tighten criteria and close loopholes* | *Would prefer a higher bar for intervention and shorter authorization periods* |
| Post-Intervention Accountability Act | 9/10 | *Strong support; essential accountability mechanism* | *Would want the board to also examine the structural incentives driving intervention* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Cut the military budget by 20-30% and redirect funds to diplomacy, development, climate, and domestic needs
- Close overseas military bases that serve no defensive purpose
- End all arms sales to countries that commit human rights violations
- Establish a Department of Peace or elevate the United States Institute of Peace to cabinet-level status
- Join the International Criminal Court

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist (near-complete alignment), Libertarian (on restraint and civil liberties)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on most reforms), Populist (on "ending endless wars" rhetoric)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative hawks, Religious Right (on most intervention questions)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Opposition to intervention is deeply rooted in non-interventionist philosophy and consistently applied regardless of party or circumstance* |
| Principle consistency | *Very high: applies non-intervention principle consistently across administrations, regions, and threat types* |
| Goalpost stability | *Very stable: libertarian opposition to foreign military intervention has been consistent for decades* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Minimal: willing to engage with security arguments while maintaining principled opposition* |

**Justification:** Libertarians are the most philosophically consistent perspective on foreign intervention. The CATO Institute and Reason Foundation have opposed virtually every U.S. military intervention from Vietnam through Afghanistan, regardless of which party initiated it. This consistency makes them highly predictable negotiating partners, even though their preferred outcome (near-total non-intervention) is more extreme than most other perspectives would accept.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *CATO Institute has published consistent critiques of intervention from the Gulf War through the post-9/11 wars*
- *Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) has been a consistent voice for restraint, opposing military action in Syria, Yemen, and Iran regardless of administration*
- *Libertarian Party platform has included non-interventionism as a core plank for decades*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement that the U.S. is overextended; would add that many deployments lack any legitimate defensive purpose* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | *Agrees strongly on institutional incentives, military-industrial complex, and executive overreach; would emphasize government failure rather than "market failure"* |

**Source references:**

- *CATO Institute, "Step Back: Lessons for U.S. Foreign Policy from the Failed War on Terror," Policy Analysis No. 814, 2017*
- *Posen, Barry R., "Restraint: A New Foundation for U.S. Grand Strategy," Cornell University Press, 2014 (aligned with libertarian-realist framework)*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Intervention Criteria Framework | 7/10 | *Better than the status quo but still creates a framework for intervention that should rarely occur* | *Concern that any criteria framework legitimizes intervention; would prefer a near-absolute prohibition* |
| AUMF Reform | 10/10 | *Repeal all AUMFs immediately; the Constitution is the only authorization framework needed* | *Perfectly aligned with libertarian constitutional principles* |
| Mandatory Congressional Authorization | 10/10 | *Essential constitutional restoration; the President has no authority to wage war without Congress* | *Core libertarian principle: constitutional limits on government power must be enforced* |
| Independent Review Board | 7/10 | *Support accountability but skeptical of creating another government agency* | *Tension between wanting accountability and opposing government expansion* |
| Diplomacy-First Infrastructure | 5/10 | *Diplomacy is better than war, but expanding government bureaucracy is not the answer* | *Would prefer private and multilateral alternatives to expanded State Department* |
| Civilian Harm Accountability | 7/10 | *Support in principle; best way to reduce civilian harm is to stop intervening* | *Agrees with the goal but sees the solution as ending intervention, not better managing it* |
| Declassification and Transparency | 9/10 | *Government secrecy is a tool of tyranny; maximum transparency is essential* | *Strong alignment with libertarian commitment to government transparency and individual rights* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Military Intervention Reform Act | 7/10 | *Improvements over the status quo, particularly the congressional authorization requirement, but does not go far enough* | *Would prefer stricter limits and a higher threshold for any military action* |
| Post-Intervention Accountability Act | 7/10 | *Support declassification and accountability provisions; skeptical of creating a new government board* | *Tension between accountability goals and opposition to government expansion* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Repeal all AUMFs and return to the constitutional requirement for declarations of war
- Close the majority of overseas military bases
- Reduce the military budget to a homeland-defense level
- End all foreign military aid and arms sales
- Pursue non-interventionist foreign policy modeled on Switzerland

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive and Democratic Socialist (on restraint and civil liberties; disagree on economics)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative restraint wing (on AUMF reform and fiscal concerns), Constitutionalist (on war powers)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal interventionists, hawkish Conservatives (on maintaining global military posture)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Stated commitment to original constitutional design is genuine; positions on war powers are principled and text-based* |
| Principle consistency | *High on war powers specifically: consistently argues that only Congress can authorize military force* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable: constitutional arguments about war powers do not change with political circumstances* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Limited: willing to work within constitutional framework to find acceptable outcomes* |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists are highly consistent on war powers specifically because the constitutional text is clear: Congress declares war. This textual anchor provides stability across administrations and partisan shifts. The slight deduction reflects occasional tension between strict construction (which limits executive war power) and originalist interpretations of "Commander-in-Chief" authority that some constitutionalists use to support broader executive action.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) has been a consistent advocate for congressional war power, introducing multiple AUMF reform bills*
- *The Federalist Society has hosted debates on war powers that reflect genuine intellectual engagement with the constitutional text*
- *Constitutional scholars like Jack Goldsmith (conservative) and Bruce Ackerman (liberal) agree on the basic principle that Congress must authorize war, despite disagreeing on other constitutional questions*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | *Agrees that executive war power has expanded far beyond constitutional limits; may disagree on specific factual claims about costs or outcomes* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | *Strongly agrees that congressional abdication of the war power is a root cause; less engaged with institutional or economic explanations* |

**Source references:**

- *Goldsmith, Jack and Matthew Waxman, "The Legal Legacy of Light-Footprint Warfare," Washington Quarterly, 2016*
- *Heritage Foundation Guide to the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 (Declare War)*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Intervention Criteria Framework | 6/10 | *Supportive to the extent it forces congressional deliberation; skeptical of criteria that might substitute for congressional judgment* | *Want Congress to make the decision, not an administrative checklist* |
| AUMF Reform | 8/10 | *Strongly support repeal and narrow replacement; the 2001 AUMF is constitutionally defective* | *Core constitutional principle: war authorizations must be specific and time-limited* |
| Mandatory Congressional Authorization | 9/10 | *Essential restoration of the constitutional design; the Founders intended Congress to decide on war* | *The most important reform from a constitutionalist perspective* |
| Independent Review Board | 6/10 | *Acceptable but not constitutionally required; Congress has its own oversight responsibilities* | *Prefer congressional oversight to independent agencies* |
| Diplomacy-First Infrastructure | 5/10 | *Not a constitutional issue; appropriate for Congress to fund if it chooses* | *Neutral on the policy substance; focused on procedural and structural issues* |
| Civilian Harm Accountability | 6/10 | *Due process concerns support accountability for individuals affected by government action* | *Aligned with constitutional due process principles but not a primary focus* |
| Declassification and Transparency | 7/10 | *Congress and the public need information to exercise their constitutional roles* | *Support transparency as necessary for congressional war power to function* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Military Intervention Reform Act | 7/10 | *Support the congressional authorization requirement; intervention criteria are secondary to the vote itself* | *Would prefer a simpler bill focused on the authorization requirement* |
| Post-Intervention Accountability Act | 6/10 | *Acceptable; prefer that Congress exercise its own oversight authority rather than delegating to a board* | *Preference for congressional mechanisms over independent agencies* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Simple, clean AUMF repeal and a constitutional amendment clarifying that "declare war" encompasses all significant military operations
- Strengthen the War Powers Resolution with automatic enforcement rather than creating new administrative frameworks
- Restore the congressional power of the purse as the primary check on executive war-making

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on constitutional war powers), Conservative restraint wing (on executive power limits)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on congressional authorization), Centrist (on pragmatic reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Those who support broad executive war authority regardless of constitutional text

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Stated opposition to "endless wars" and elite foreign policy; actual positions shift dramatically based on the leader and the moment* |
| Principle consistency | *Low: anti-war rhetoric coexists with support for aggressive action (e.g., "bomb the hell out of ISIS" alongside "bring the troops home")* |
| Goalpost stability | *Unstable: positions shifted from supporting the Iraq War to opposing it; supported Afghanistan withdrawal but also supported strikes against Iran* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Significant: frames foreign policy in zero-sum terms (other countries are "ripping us off"; allies are "freeloaders")* |

**Justification:** The populist perspective on foreign intervention is the least consistent of any perspective analyzed. The rhetoric of ending "endless wars" and opposing the "foreign policy establishment" coexists with support for aggressive military action when framed as strength or punishment. The Trump administration both signed the Doha withdrawal agreement with the Taliban and ordered the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. This inconsistency makes populists unreliable coalition partners on intervention reform.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Trump campaigned against the Iraq War and Afghanistan in 2016 and 2020 but increased drone strikes, reduced transparency on civilian casualties, and ordered strikes against Syria and Iran*
- *Populist media (Tucker Carlson's program, Steve Bannon's podcast) alternated between anti-war rhetoric and hawkish nationalism*
- *Populist voters oppose "endless wars" in polling but support "strong" military action against specific adversaries (ISIS, Iran, China)*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Agrees the U.S. has been in too many wars and spent too much money; frames it as elites sacrificing working-class soldiers for global interests* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Agrees on elite capture of foreign policy but rejects systemic analysis; prefers narrative of incompetent or corrupt leaders rather than structural problems* |

**Source references:**

- *Trump 2024 campaign foreign policy positions*
- *American Compass (Oren Cass), "A New Conservative Foreign Policy," 2023*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Intervention Criteria Framework | 4/10 | *Bureaucratic; the President needs freedom to act decisively* | *Want strong executive authority when "their" leader is in charge* |
| AUMF Reform | 4/10 | *Mixed: oppose "endless wars" but want the President to be "strong"* | *Inconsistent: rhetoric of restraint conflicts with desire for executive power* |
| Mandatory Congressional Authorization | 3/10 | *Congress is the "swamp"; the President should lead* | *Deep distrust of congressional processes; prefer strong executive action* |
| Independent Review Board | 3/10 | *Another unelected bureaucracy; the "deep state" reviewing itself* | *Distrust of any institutional mechanism they do not control* |
| Diplomacy-First Infrastructure | 3/10 | *The State Department is part of the "deep state"; diplomats are weak* | *Fundamental hostility to diplomatic institutions* |
| Civilian Harm Accountability | 4/10 | *Support for troops but skeptical of rules that "tie their hands"* | *Populist nationalism prioritizes American military freedom of action* |
| Declassification and Transparency | 6/10 | *Support exposing the "deep state" and the failures of the establishment* | *Selective: want transparency about establishment failures but not about "their" administration* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Military Intervention Reform Act | 3/10 | *Too much red tape; the President needs to be able to act* | *Oppose constraints on executive authority when aligned with populist leader* |
| Post-Intervention Accountability Act | 4/10 | *Review board is just another bureaucracy; declassification is good when it exposes "their" failures* | *Selective support for accountability; distrust of institutional processes* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- The President should have the authority to act decisively and bring troops home when he wants
- Stop "nation-building" and focus military power on punishing enemies and protecting the homeland
- Make allies "pay their fair share" of defense costs or withdraw U.S. protection
- Impose economic costs (sanctions, tariffs) on adversaries rather than military intervention

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Some Conservative hawks (on "strong" military posture); some overlap with restraint on "ending endless wars" rhetoric
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on anti-establishment rhetoric and specific interventions), Progressive (on rhetorical opposition to "endless wars")
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal, Centrist, Constitutionalist (populist distrust of institutions and processes conflicts with these perspectives' commitment to institutional reform)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Stated commitment to evidence-based, pragmatic policy is genuine; positions reflect careful cost-benefit analysis* |
| Principle consistency | *High: consistently applies pragmatic analysis across different interventions and administrations* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable: positions adjust based on evidence and outcomes rather than political winds* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Minimal: actively seeks bipartisan solutions and compromise frameworks* |

**Justification:** Centrists represent the most pragmatic and process-oriented perspective on intervention reform. They are willing to engage with evidence, accept reforms that improve decision-making quality, and work across partisan lines. The slight deduction reflects the tendency of the centrist "establishment" to default to existing paradigms (like the primacy consensus) even when evidence suggests they are failing.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center has supported pragmatic AUMF reform proposals*

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Stated just war framework is sometimes applied consistently; positions often driven more by alignment with conservative hawks than by theological principle* |
| Principle consistency | *Mixed: just war tradition would counsel restraint in many cases where the Religious Right has supported intervention* |
| Goalpost stability | *Moderate: strong support for intervention to protect persecuted Christians or Israel; less consistent on other cases* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Some: frames certain interventions in civilizational terms (Christianity vs. Islam) that resist compromise* |

**Justification:** The Religious Right's engagement with intervention policy is split between a genuine just war tradition (which imposes strict criteria on the use of force) and a more political alignment with conservative hawks and strong support for Israel. When these two impulses conflict, political alignment tends to dominate. Support for specific interventions is often driven by religious solidarity (protecting Middle Eastern Christians) or theological commitment (support for Israel) rather than consistent application of just war principles.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *National Association of Evangelicals has issued statements on just war that are more cautious than the political positions of most Religious Right leaders*
- *Strong support for military action to protect persecuted Christians in the Middle East*
- *Christians United for Israel (CUFI) is one of the largest pro-Israel organizations and supports U.S. military commitment to Israel's defense*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Selective engagement: concerned about specific issues (persecuted Christians, Israel) rather than the overall assessment of overextension* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | *Does not engage with structural or institutional analysis; frames intervention questions in moral and theological terms* |

**Source references:**

- *National Association of Evangelicals, "For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility," updated 2018*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Intervention Criteria Framework | 5/10 | *Compatible with just war tradition in principle; concerned it might prevent intervention to protect persecuted communities* | *Want to ensure humanitarian intervention for religious persecution remains possible* |
| AUMF Reform | 4/10 | *Cautious; do not want to weaken authority needed to protect allies or persecuted Christians* | *Concern about Israel and Middle Eastern Christian communities* |
| Mandatory Congressional Authorization | 4/10 | *Sympathetic to constitutional process but concerned about speed of response* | *Fear that deliberation will delay action when persecuted communities need immediate help* |
| Independent Review Board | 5/10 | *Acceptable if fair and not used to attack faith-based policy positions* | *Moderate engagement; not a primary concern* |
| Diplomacy-First Infrastructure | 5/10 | *Support religious freedom diplomacy; skeptical of broader diplomatic engagement with hostile regimes* | *Specific interest in International Religious Freedom Act implementation* |
| Civilian Harm Accountability | 6/10 | *Just war tradition requires minimizing civilian harm* | *Genuine theological alignment on protecting civilians* |
| Declassification and Transparency | 5/10 | *Moderate support; not a primary concern* | *Neutral on the specifics* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Military Intervention Reform Act | 4/10 | *Concerned that criteria and authorization requirements would prevent action to protect persecuted communities or Israel* | *Specific concerns about humanitarian exception scope* |
| Post-Intervention Accountability Act | 5/10 | *Acceptable; not a primary concern* | *Moderate engagement* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Strengthen the humanitarian intervention exception specifically for religious persecution
- Maintain and expand U.S. military commitment to Israel's security
- Use military power to protect Christian minorities in the Middle East and Africa
- Frame intervention decisions through just war criteria (just cause, legitimate authority, right intention, proportionality, last resort, reasonable chance of success)

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative hawks (on military posture and Israel), Populist (on cultural and civilizational framing)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on humanitarian intervention for persecuted communities), Centrist (on just war framework)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian, Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on the scope of military engagement and Israel)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Anti-imperialism and anti-militarism are genuine and deeply held; consistently applied across administrations* |
| Principle consistency | *High: opposition to military intervention is rooted in structural analysis of capitalism and imperialism* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable: positions on intervention have been consistent across the post-9/11 period* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Some: structural critique can be overly deterministic, dismissing the possibility that any intervention could be justified* |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists have been among the most consistent critics of U.S. military intervention, grounding their opposition in a structural analysis that connects militarism to capitalism, imperialism, and the concentration of economic power. This structural consistency makes their positions predictable and stable. The slight deduction reflects occasional tension between absolute anti-intervention positions and the question of whether military force can ever be justified to prevent mass atrocities.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *DSA has opposed every major U.S. military intervention and consistently calls for military budget cuts*
- *Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other DSA-aligned members have voted against military spending bills and arms sales*
- *Democratic Socialists of America's national platform calls for closing overseas military bases and ending U.S. imperialism*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement with the assessment of overextension and the human and financial costs; would add more emphasis on the connection between military intervention and global economic exploitation* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | *Strong agreement on institutional drivers; would add capitalism and imperialism as fundamental root causes rather than "merely" institutional failures* |

**Source references:**

- *Democratic Socialists of America, "Where We Stand: Political Platform," foreign policy section*

| Intervention Criteria Framework | 7/10 | *Useful reform but does not address the structural incentives for intervention* | *See criteria as insufficient without deeper structural change* |
| AUMF Reform | 9/10 | *Repeal all AUMFs; no replacement needed* | *Would prefer no standing authorization for military force abroad* |
| Mandatory Congressional Authorization | 8/10 | *Support democratic accountability; skeptical that Congress as currently constituted would exercise restraint* | *Recognize the structural problem that Congress is subject to the same lobbying pressures* |
| Independent Review Board | 8/10 | *Support accountability; must examine structural and economic drivers, not just operational failures* | *Want reviews to address the military-industrial complex explicitly* |
| Diplomacy-First Infrastructure | 8/10 | *Support increased diplomacy and development; should be funded by military budget cuts* | *Want a fundamental reorientation, not just an expansion of diplomatic capacity alongside existing military posture* |
| Civilian Harm Accountability | 10/10 | *Essential moral obligation; the U.S. must acknowledge and compensate for the harm it causes* | *Strongest support alongside progressives; see this as both a moral imperative and an argument against intervention* |
| Declassification and Transparency | 9/10 | *The public must know what is being done in their name; maximum transparency* | *Want declassification to expose the structural interests driving intervention* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Military Intervention Reform Act | 7/10 | *Improvements over the status quo but does not go far enough; need to cut military budget and close bases* | *See the bill as a step toward, not a substitute for, fundamental restructuring* |
| Post-Intervention Accountability Act | 8/10 | *Strong support for the review board and declassification provisions* | *Want the board to explicitly examine the role of corporate and economic interests in driving interventions* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Cut the military budget by 50% or more and redirect funds to universal healthcare, education, housing, and global development
- Close all overseas military bases
- End all arms sales and military aid
- Nationalize or heavily regulate the defense industry to eliminate profit incentives for war
- Join the International Criminal Court and submit to its jurisdiction
- Establish a Department of Peace

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (near-complete alignment on intervention policy), Libertarian (on restraint and some civil liberties issues)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on accountability and transparency), Populist (on anti-elite rhetoric and "ending endless wars")
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on the role and size of the military)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| AUMF Reform | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc | Con, Pop, RelR | None (but weak support from 3 perspectives) |
| Mandatory Congressional Authorization | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc | Con, RelR | Pop |
| Independent Review Board | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc, Con | RelR | Pop |
| Civilian Harm Accountability | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc, RelR | Con, Pop | None |
| Declassification and Transparency | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc, Pop | Con, RelR | None |
| Intervention Criteria Framework | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc | Con, Pop, RelR | None |
| Diplomacy-First Infrastructure | Lib, Prog, Cent, DemSoc | Con, Libt, Const, RelR | Pop |

**Key insight:** AUMF reform, mandatory congressional authorization, and civilian harm accountability have the broadest potential coalitions (6 perspectives with scores of 7+). Diplomacy-first infrastructure faces the most resistance because it requires expanding government capacity, which conflicts with libertarian and conservative principles even when those perspectives support the goal of reducing military intervention.

---

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *AUMF Repeal and Narrow Replacement with Sunset Clause*

**Bridges:** *Libertarian + Progressive + Constitutionalist + Liberal + Centrist + Democratic Socialist*

**Core Agreement:** The 2001 AUMF is an outdated, overly broad authorization that has been stretched far beyond its original intent. All six perspectives agree it should be repealed. The disagreement is over what, if anything, should replace it.

**Policy Description:**

Repeal the 2001 AUMF with a 180-day transition period. Simultaneously enact a narrow replacement authorization that names specific groups (al-Qaeda, ISIS) and specific countries, with a 3-year sunset clause requiring an affirmative vote to renew. Include quarterly reporting requirements and a prohibition on expanding the authorization to new groups or countries without a separate congressional vote.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Libertarian | *Eliminates the blank check; sunset clause ensures ongoing congressional accountability; much narrower than current authority* |
| Progressive | *Ends the legal basis for "endless wars"; sunset clause prevents indefinite authorization; reporting requirements increase transparency* |
| Constitutionalist | *Restores the constitutional design of congressional war authorization; specific naming of targets and time limits align with the Framers' intent* |
| Liberal | *Replaces an outdated authorization with a modern, accountable framework; preserves authority to address genuine threats* |
| Centrist | *Pragmatic reform that closes the current legal gap while imposing discipline; avoids the risk of an abrupt authority vacuum* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Major step toward ending the "forever war" framework; provides a path to further reducing military operations through sunset reviews* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Libertarian | *Accepting any replacement authorization rather than outright repeal* |
| Progressive | *Accepting a replacement authorization rather than outright repeal; 3-year sunset rather than immediate cessation* |
| Constitutionalist | *Accepting that a narrow authorization is needed rather than relying solely on the declaration of war power* |
| Liberal | *Accepting limits on the scope of authorization that may constrain some humanitarian operations* |
| Centrist | *Accepting a firm sunset clause rather than a more flexible review mechanism* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Accepting that some military counterterrorism operations will continue under the replacement authorization* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *Strong. The constitutional, philosophical, and practical arguments for this reform are robust and unlikely to shift. The main risk is a major terrorist attack that creates political pressure to expand the replacement authorization.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Build on the successful 2024 repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF. The bipartisan Kaine-Young AUMF reform effort provides a legislative vehicle. Attach to the annual NDAA for the best chance of passage.*

---

### Compromise 2: *Independent Post-Intervention Review Board (NTSB Model)*

**Bridges:** *Centrist + Liberal + Progressive + Libertarian + Democratic Socialist + Constitutionalist + Conservative*

**Core Agreement:** All perspectives (except Populist) agree, to varying degrees, that the U.S. needs better mechanisms for learning from past interventions. The NTSB analogy is compelling because it is a proven model of independent, evidence-based review that has improved outcomes in aviation safety without constraining operational decisions.

**Policy Description:**

Establish a 7-member independent board with subpoena authority, access to classified information, and a mandate to review any intervention lasting more than 1 year or costing more than $10 billion. Publish findings within 2 years, with a "comply or explain" requirement for executive agencies. Include mandatory declassification of intervention records after 10 years.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Centrist | *Evidence-based, institutional reform that improves decision-making quality without constraining options* |
| Liberal | *Creates accountability for past failures and transparency for democratic governance* |
| Progressive | *Provides a platform for exposing structural failures and civilian harm* |
| Libertarian | *Increases transparency and accountability for government actions; declassification reduces government secrecy* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Creates a mechanism for examining the role of corporate interests in driving interventions* |
| Constitutionalist | *Supports congressional oversight by providing independent information and analysis* |
| Conservative | *If genuinely bipartisan, can prevent future strategic failures and wasteful spending* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Centrist | *Accepting that past interventions supported by centrists (Libya, Afghanistan nation-building) will face critical review* |
| Liberal | *Accepting that the board will review interventions conducted by Democratic administrations with equal rigor* |
| Progressive | *Accepting a board structure rather than demanding immediate prosecution of decision-makers* |
| Libertarian | *Accepting the creation of a new government agency* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Accepting an institutional mechanism rather than demanding structural transformation* |
| Constitutionalist | *Accepting an independent board rather than insisting Congress conduct all oversight directly* |
| Conservative | *Accepting that the Iraq War decision-making will face independent review* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *High. The NTSB model has decades of proven effectiveness, and the concept of independent review has broad support. The main risk is politicization of board appointments.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Introduce as standalone legislation with bipartisan co-sponsors. The Afghanistan withdrawal provides a strong political impetus. Emphasize the NTSB analogy to frame the board as a technical, non-partisan institution.*

---

### Compromise 3: *Civilian Harm Accountability and Transparency Package*

**Bridges:** *Progressive + Liberal + Democratic Socialist + Libertarian + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Religious Right*

**Core Agreement:** Minimizing civilian harm during military operations is a moral imperative that virtually all perspectives support in principle. The just war tradition, constitutional due process, humanitarian international law, and libertarian opposition to government violence all converge on this point.

**Policy Description:**

Codify existing DoD civilian harm mitigation policies into statute. Establish a permanent independent civilian casualty investigation unit. Create a $100 million annual compensation fund with streamlined claims procedures. Mandate annual public reporting on civilian casualties with data disaggregated by operation and country.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Progressive | *Establishes the moral and legal obligation to acknowledge and compensate for civilian harm* |
| Liberal | *Creates the institutional mechanisms for humanitarian accountability that have been lacking* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Forces the U.S. government to acknowledge the human costs of military operations, strengthening the case against intervention* |
| Libertarian | *Increases transparency about government violence and provides accountability for government actions that harm individuals* |
| Centrist | *Practical, evidence-based reform that improves operational discipline and U.S. credibility* |
| Constitutionalist | *Grounded in due process principles; government actions that deprive individuals of life require accountability* |
| Religious Right | *Aligned with just war tradition's requirement of proportionality and discrimination* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Progressive | *Accepting accountability mechanisms within the existing military framework rather than demanding an end to all military operations* |
| Liberal | *Accepting that some operations will continue and focus on harm reduction rather than prohibition* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Accepting reform within the system rather than structural transformation* |
| Libertarian | *Accepting a new government program (the compensation fund)* |
| Centrist | *Accepting that the U.S. military's current civilian harm processes are inadequate* |
| Constitutionalist | *Accepting a statutory framework rather than relying solely on constitutional due process litigation* |
| Religious Right | *Acknowledging that current military operations may not fully satisfy just war criteria* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *Very high. Civilian harm is the least politically controversial reform because it does not constrain when force can be used, only how its consequences are handled. The main opposition is from military commanders who fear operational constraints, but the DoD's own 2023 Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan acknowledged the need for improvements.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Attach to the annual NDAA. Build on the DoD's 2023 Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan. Frame as "supporting the troops" by ensuring they operate under clear, consistent rules. Use the Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) as a key advocacy partner.*

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable reform coalition bridges the **Progressive-Libertarian-Constitutionalist axis** on congressional war power and AUMF reform with the **Liberal-Centrist** preference for evidence-based institutional reform. This 5-perspective core coalition (representing 5 of the 9 perspectives, with 4 rated 4+ on consistency) can drive meaningful reform. Adding selective Conservative support (particularly from the restraint wing represented by figures like Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and organizations like Concerned Veterans for America) expands the coalition to 6 perspectives and provides the bipartisan credibility essential for passage.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Executive branch resistance**: Every president resists constraints on war-making authority, regardless of party. Any reform must include enforcement mechanisms (automatic funding cutoffs, judicial standing) that do not depend on executive cooperation.
2. **Defense industry lobbying**: The defense industry will oppose any reforms that reduce military operations or spending. Countering this requires mobilizing the cost-conscious fiscal coalition (libertarians, fiscal conservatives) and the human-cost coalition (progressives, veterans' organizations).
3. **Populist unpredictability**: The populist perspective's low consistency score (2/5) means it cannot be relied upon as a coalition partner, despite rhetorical support for "ending endless wars." Reforms should be designed to succeed without populist support while remaining compatible with populist rhetoric.
4. **Crisis exploitation**: A major terrorist attack or international crisis could override reform momentum by triggering a "rally around the flag" dynamic. The reform framework must include emergency provisions that are credible enough to survive crisis pressure.

### Low Consistency Partners

The three perspectives rated 3 or below on consistency (Populist at 2, Conservative and Religious Right at 3) require different strategies:

- **Populist**: Do not rely on as a coalition partner. Design reforms that are compatible with populist rhetoric ("ending endless wars," "draining the swamp") to avoid active opposition, but do not make concessions to secure populist support, as those concessions may be wasted if positions shift.
- **Conservative**: Engage the restraint wing directly (Concerned Veterans for America, CATO Institute, individual senators like Paul and Lee). The hawk wing will likely oppose most reforms; focus on peeling off the restraint wing rather than converting hawks.
- **Religious Right**: Engage through the just war tradition, which provides genuine common ground on civilian harm accountability. Do not expect broad support for restraint-oriented reforms due to the Israel and religious persecution issues.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with accountability**: The civilian harm accountability package (Compromise 3) has the broadest support (7/9 perspectives) and the least political controversy. Pass this first to build momentum and demonstrate that intervention reform is achievable.
2. **Follow with the review board**: The Post-Intervention Accountability Act (Compromise 2) has 7/9 perspective support and strong bipartisan appeal through the NTSB analogy. The Afghanistan withdrawal provides compelling political context.
3. **Build toward AUMF reform**: The AUMF repeal and replacement (Compromise 1) is the most significant reform but faces the most political resistance. The success of steps 1 and 2 builds the coalition and precedent necessary for this harder lift.
4. **Sequence congressional authorization last**: The mandatory congressional authorization provisions of the Military Intervention Reform Act face the strongest opposition from the executive branch and hawks. This should be the capstone reform, enacted after the other pieces have established the framework and built the political coalition.
