# Foreign Interventions: Stakeholders

## Overview

Foreign military interventions involve a broad and diverse set of stakeholders, ranging from the civilian populations who bear the brunt of military operations to the political leaders who authorize them, the soldiers who fight them, the industries that profit from them, and the institutions that study and shape them. Understanding the interests, influence, and vulnerability of each stakeholder group is essential to designing reforms that can produce better outcomes.

## Who Is Affected

### Civilian Populations in Target Countries

**Impact**: The most directly and severely affected stakeholder group. Civilians in countries where the U.S. intervenes suffer death, injury, displacement, destruction of infrastructure, and long-term economic and social disruption.

| Impact Category | Scale | Examples |
|-----------------|-------|---------|
| Direct deaths | Hundreds of thousands | 185,000-209,000 Iraqi civilian deaths from direct violence (Iraq Body Count, 2023) |
| Displacement | Tens of millions | 38 million displaced by post-9/11 wars (Costs of War, 2021) |
| Infrastructure destruction | Entire national systems | Iraq's electrical grid, water systems, hospitals destroyed in 2003 invasion |
| Economic devastation | Generational | Afghanistan GDP per capita remains among the world's lowest after 20 years of war and aid |
| Psychological trauma | Population-wide | PTSD rates of 30-60% among populations in active conflict zones (WHO, 2022) |

**Influence**: Minimal. Civilian populations in target countries have virtually no voice in U.S. intervention decisions. They lack political representation in the U.S. system and receive limited attention in media coverage that typically focuses on U.S. casualties and strategic objectives.

### U.S. Service Members and Their Families

**Impact**: The Americans who bear the direct physical and psychological costs of intervention.

- **Post-9/11 wars**: 7,057 U.S. military deaths; 52,000+ wounded in action; an estimated 30,177 veteran suicides through 2023 (Costs of War, VA).
- **Psychological burden**: Approximately 20% of post-9/11 veterans have been diagnosed with PTSD or depression (RAND Corporation, 2023). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the "signature wound" of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
- **Repeated deployments**: The all-volunteer force meant that a small fraction of the population bore a disproportionate burden. Many service members deployed 3-5 times or more during the post-9/11 era.
- **Family impact**: Military families experience elevated rates of divorce, child behavioral problems, domestic violence, and financial stress during and after deployments.

**Influence**: Moderate. Veterans' organizations (VFW, American Legion, IAVA, VoteVets) have significant political influence on veterans' benefits and healthcare but limited influence on intervention decisions themselves. Active-duty military personnel are constrained by the norm of civilian control and cannot publicly oppose intervention policy.

### U.S. Taxpayers

**Impact**: Bear the financial costs of intervention, both immediate and long-term.

- The post-9/11 wars have cost approximately $8 trillion, including $1.1 trillion in interest on war-related borrowing and $2.2 trillion in projected future veterans' care (Costs of War, 2024).
- These costs were financed almost entirely through borrowing rather than taxation, obscuring the true cost from the public but adding to the national debt.

**Influence**: Diffuse. Public opinion on intervention is significant but typically only manifests as a constraint after an intervention is already underway and casualties mount. The financing of wars through debt rather than taxes reduces the immediate sense of personal cost.

### Allied Nations

**Impact**: U.S. allies are affected by intervention decisions in multiple ways:

- **NATO allies** have been drawn into U.S.-led interventions (Afghanistan, Libya) with significant costs in lives and resources
- **Regional allies** (Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, South Korea, Japan) depend on U.S. military commitments for their security
- **Coalition partners** bear reputational and political costs when interventions fail

**Influence**: Significant but variable. Close allies like the UK, France, and Australia have some influence on U.S. intervention decisions through diplomatic channels and coalition participation. However, the U.S. has repeatedly demonstrated willingness to act unilaterally (Iraq 2003) or to abandon coalition commitments (Syria 2019 withdrawal announcement) when domestic political considerations dominate.

## Who Has Power

### The President

**Role**: The single most powerful actor in intervention decisions. The President commands the armed forces, controls the intelligence agencies, sets the foreign policy agenda, and can initiate military operations with minimal or no congressional input.

**Interests**:

- National security (genuine and perceived)
- Political legacy and public approval (the "rally around the flag" effect)
- Credibility with allies and adversaries
- Domestic political calculations (diverting attention from domestic problems; avoiding accusations of weakness)

**Constraints**:

- Public opinion (especially casualty sensitivity)
- Congressional funding authority (in theory)
- International law and alliance relationships
- Military advice (which presidents may accept or override)

### The Pentagon and Joint Chiefs of Staff

**Role**: The Department of Defense plans and executes military operations, advises the President on military options, and manages the $850+ billion defense budget.

**Interests**:

- Organizational survival and budget maximization
- Maintaining the all-volunteer force and force readiness
- Professional military advice (which sometimes counsels restraint)
- Career advancement tied to operational experience

**Dynamics**: The military's relationship with intervention is complex. Senior military leaders have sometimes counseled against intervention (General Colin Powell's resistance to intervention in Bosnia; military skepticism about the Iraq invasion's post-conflict planning), but the institutional culture favors action and the professional incentive structure rewards combat experience.

### The Intelligence Community

**Role**: The CIA, NSA, DIA, and 15 other agencies provide the intelligence assessments that inform intervention decisions and conduct covert operations.

**Interests**:

- Organizational autonomy and budget
- Threat validation (intelligence agencies have institutional incentives to identify threats)
- Covert action capabilities (the CIA's Directorate of Operations has a distinct culture that values operational activity)

**Concerns**: Intelligence has been politicized in multiple intervention decisions. The most consequential example was the Iraq WMD intelligence failure, where a combination of analytical groupthink, political pressure, and inadequate sourcing produced a fundamentally flawed National Intelligence Estimate that was used to justify the invasion.

### Congress

**Role**: The Constitution grants Congress the sole power to declare war and the power of the purse. In practice, Congress has been a largely passive actor in intervention decisions.

**Interests**:

- Avoiding political accountability for unpopular wars
- Protecting defense-related jobs in their districts
- Oversight (when politically convenient)
- Re-election (which creates incentives both for and against intervention depending on the political moment)

**Dynamics**: The structural incentives facing members of Congress strongly favor deference to the President on intervention decisions:

- Voting to authorize force creates political risk if the intervention fails
- Voting against authorization creates risk of being labeled "soft" if a threat materializes
- Allowing the President to act without a vote avoids both risks

This dynamic explains why Congress has not declared war since 1942 and has not voted on a new AUMF since 2002.

### The Defense Industry

**Role**: The five largest defense contractors (Lockheed Martin, RTX/Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics) and their suppliers produce the weapons, platforms, and services used in military operations.

**Interests**:

- Revenue and profit (military operations drive demand for munitions, replacement equipment, and new systems)
- Contract continuity and expansion
- Political influence through campaign contributions, lobbying, and the revolving door

**Influence Mechanisms**:

| Mechanism | Scale | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Lobbying expenditures | $133 million (2023) | OpenSecrets |
| Campaign contributions (defense sector) | $55 million (2024 cycle) | OpenSecrets |
| Revolving door officials | 672 senior DoD officials to contractor positions (2014-2019) | POGO, 2021 |
| Jobs in congressional districts | 2.1 million+ direct defense industry jobs spread across most districts | NDIA, 2023 |

### Foreign Policy Think Tanks

**Role**: Think tanks provide intellectual frameworks, policy recommendations, expert testimony, and personnel for incoming administrations. They significantly shape the parameters of "acceptable" foreign policy debate.

**Key Institutions and Orientations**:

| Think Tank | Orientation | Notable Positions |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Brookings Institution | Center-left internationalist | Generally supports engagement and multilateral intervention |
| Council on Foreign Relations | Establishment bipartisan | Supports U.S. global leadership; mainstream interventionist |
| Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) | Centrist/hawkish | Supports robust forward presence and alliance commitments |
| Heritage Foundation | Conservative hawk | Supports strong military, selective intervention |
| American Enterprise Institute (AEI) | Neoconservative | Advocated strongly for Iraq War; supports democracy promotion |
| CATO Institute | Libertarian restraint | Opposes most interventions; advocates offshore balancing |
| Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft | Transpartisan restraint | Advocates military restraint and diplomatic engagement |
| Center for a New American Security (CNAS) | Center-left hawk | Supports U.S. military engagement and alliance structure |

**Concerns**: Many major think tanks receive funding from defense contractors, foreign governments, and other stakeholders with direct interests in intervention policy, raising questions about intellectual independence (*New York Times, 2014; Quincy Institute analysis, 2023*).

### Media

**Role**: Media organizations shape public understanding of interventions through coverage decisions, framing, and access to information.

**Dynamics**:

- Coverage tends to be most intense at the beginning and end of interventions, with limited attention to the middle period when critical decisions about escalation, strategy, and withdrawal are made
- The "embedded journalist" model, widely used since Iraq 2003, provides access but creates dependency on military sources and perspectives
- Cable news incentives favor dramatic conflict narratives over nuanced analysis of costs and consequences
- The decline of international reporting by U.S. outlets has reduced the public's ability to assess intervention outcomes independently
