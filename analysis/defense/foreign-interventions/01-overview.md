# Foreign Interventions: Overview

## Overview

The United States has engaged in more foreign military interventions than any other nation since World War II. From the Korean War through the post-9/11 campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, American military power has been deployed to contain adversaries, topple regimes, protect civilians, combat terrorism, and build democratic institutions abroad. The results have been deeply mixed: some interventions achieved their stated objectives (the Gulf War, the Balkans), while others resulted in protracted quagmires, massive civilian casualties, and strategic failure (Vietnam, Iraq, Libya).

The decision to use military force abroad is among the most consequential a nation can make. Yet the U.S. process for making these decisions is often characterized by threat inflation, inadequate planning for post-conflict phases, open-ended authorizations that circumvent meaningful congressional debate, and a persistent failure to learn from past mistakes. The cost in lives, treasure, and global credibility has been staggering: the post-9/11 wars alone have cost an estimated $8 trillion and contributed to over 900,000 deaths, according to Brown University's Costs of War Project.

Reforming how the United States decides to intervene, how it conducts interventions, and how it holds decision-makers accountable is essential to restoring democratic oversight of the war power and preventing future strategic disasters.

## Scope

This analysis examines the full spectrum of U.S. foreign military intervention:

- **Intervention Criteria**: When and under what circumstances the use of military force is justified, including the evolution from the Weinberger Doctrine to current practice
- **Decision-Making Process**: How intervention decisions are made, including the roles of the President, Congress, the intelligence community, and the military
- **Nation-Building**: The record of post-conflict reconstruction and democratic institution-building
- **Exit Strategies**: Planning for disengagement and the persistent problem of "mission creep"
- **Humanitarian Intervention**: The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine and its application
- **Lessons Learned**: Systematic analysis of what has worked and what has failed across seven decades of intervention
- **Legal Authorities**: The constitutional and statutory framework governing the use of force, including AUMFs and the War Powers Resolution

## Core Tensions

- **Security vs. Restraint**: The tension between maintaining global order through military force and avoiding overextension that weakens American security and finances
- **Executive Speed vs. Democratic Deliberation**: The President's claimed need for rapid military action versus the constitutional requirement for congressional authorization
- **Humanitarian Obligation vs. Strategic Interest**: Whether the U.S. should intervene to prevent mass atrocities even when no direct national security interest is at stake
- **Short-Term Military Victory vs. Long-Term Political Stability**: The persistent gap between winning wars and winning the peace
- **Alliance Credibility vs. Independent Judgment**: Pressure to intervene to maintain alliance credibility versus the need to make each intervention decision on its own merits
- **Transparency vs. Operational Security**: The democratic need for public debate about military operations versus genuine security concerns about revealing operational details

## Key Questions

1. What criteria should govern the decision to use military force abroad, and who should make that determination?
2. Why has the United States repeatedly failed at nation-building, and can it be done successfully?
3. How can Congress reclaim its constitutional war power without undermining the ability to respond to genuine emergencies?
4. What accountability mechanisms should exist for interventions that fail or cause disproportionate civilian harm?
5. Is the current U.S. global military posture sustainable, and does it serve American interests?
6. How should the U.S. balance humanitarian obligations with the limits of military power?

## Vision of Success

A reformed approach to foreign intervention would:

- **Be Legally Grounded**: All military operations abroad are conducted under explicit, time-limited congressional authorization with clearly defined objectives and exit criteria
- **Be Strategically Disciplined**: Intervention decisions are made through a rigorous, evidence-based process that honestly assesses costs, risks, and the probability of success
- **Prioritize Diplomacy**: Military force is genuinely a last resort, with robust diplomatic and economic tools deployed first
- **Plan for the Aftermath**: No intervention proceeds without a detailed, funded, and realistic post-conflict plan
- **Be Accountable**: Independent after-action reviews are mandatory, findings are declassified on a reasonable timeline, and leaders are held accountable for decisions based on faulty intelligence or deliberate deception
- **Learn from History**: Institutional mechanisms ensure that lessons from past interventions are systematically captured and applied to future decisions
- **Minimize Harm**: Civilian protection is a central planning consideration, not an afterthought, with robust investigation and compensation mechanisms for civilian casualties
