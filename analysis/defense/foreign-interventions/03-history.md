# Foreign Interventions: History

## Overview

The history of U.S. foreign military intervention since 1945 is a story of expanding commitments, recurring patterns of success and failure, and a persistent gap between the initial justification for military action and the long-term consequences. Each era of intervention has produced lessons that policymakers have, more often than not, failed to apply to the next conflict.

## Pre-Cold War Foundations

American intervention abroad predates World War II. The Monroe Doctrine (1823) asserted U.S. predominance in the Western Hemisphere. The Spanish-American War (1898) marked the emergence of the U.S. as a global military power, resulting in the annexation of the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam. The Philippine-American War (1899-1902) and repeated "Banana Wars" interventions in Central America and the Caribbean (1898-1934) established patterns of regime change, occupation, and nation-building that would recur throughout the 20th century.

World War II transformed the U.S. from a reluctant participant in global affairs into the world's preeminent military and economic power. The successful postwar reconstruction of Germany and Japan under the Marshall Plan and Allied occupation established the template for nation-building that policymakers would later attempt to replicate, often without the conditions that made those efforts succeed.

## The Korean War (1950-1953)

### Context

- North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, and the U.S. led a United Nations coalition to repel the invasion.
- President Truman committed U.S. forces without a formal declaration of war, calling it a "police action" under UN authority, establishing a precedent for executive-initiated military action that endures to this day.

### Key Events

- The initial UN/U.S. success at the Inchon landing (September 1950) was followed by General MacArthur's advance into North Korea, which provoked China's entry into the war in November 1950.
- The war settled into a grinding stalemate along the 38th parallel, ending in an armistice in July 1953.

### Outcome and Lessons

- **Outcome**: South Korea was preserved as an independent state, but at a cost of 36,574 U.S. deaths, over 100,000 wounded, and an estimated 2-3 million Korean civilian deaths.
- **Lessons**: The dangers of mission creep (from defending South Korea to conquering the North); the risk of provoking intervention by a major power (China); the difficulty of achieving decisive victory in limited wars; the precedent of committing to war without a congressional declaration.

## The Vietnam War (1955-1975)

### Context

- U.S. involvement escalated gradually from military advisors under Eisenhower and Kennedy to a massive ground war under Johnson, justified by the domino theory and the containment of communism.
- The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964) provided congressional authorization based on an alleged attack on U.S. naval vessels that was later shown to have been exaggerated or fabricated.

### Key Events

- At its peak in 1968, over 536,000 U.S. troops were deployed in Vietnam.
- The Tet Offensive (January 1968) shattered public confidence in the war effort despite being a tactical defeat for North Vietnam.
- Nixon's "Vietnamization" policy (1969-1973) gradually withdrew U.S. ground forces while expanding air operations, including the secret bombing of Cambodia.
- The Paris Peace Accords (January 1973) ended direct U.S. military involvement. Saigon fell in April 1975.

### Outcome and Lessons

- **Outcome**: 58,220 U.S. military deaths; an estimated 2-3 million Vietnamese deaths (civilian and military combined); a unified communist Vietnam.
- **Lessons**: The limits of military power against a determined insurgency with popular support; the corrosive effects of deception and the "credibility gap" on democratic governance; the importance of understanding local political dynamics; the danger of incremental escalation without clear objectives; the political impossibility of sustaining a costly war without public support.
- **Policy Impact**: The War Powers Resolution (1973) was enacted specifically in response to Vietnam. The "Vietnam Syndrome" constrained U.S. intervention for two decades, reflected in the Weinberger Doctrine (1984) and the Powell Doctrine (1990), both of which established strict criteria for the use of force.

## Cold War Proxy Wars and Covert Interventions

### CIA-Led Regime Change

The CIA conducted numerous covert operations to overthrow or undermine governments perceived as sympathetic to the Soviet Union:

| Operation | Country | Year | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|------|---------|
| TPAJAX | Iran | 1953 | Overthrew PM Mossadegh; reinstated Shah. Led to 1979 revolution and decades of hostility |
| PBSUCCESS | Guatemala | 1954 | Overthrew Arbenz government; decades of civil war and instability followed |
| Bay of Pigs | Cuba | 1961 | Failed invasion. Humiliation for Kennedy administration; cemented Castro's rule |
| Chile | Chile | 1970-1973 | CIA-backed destabilization contributed to Pinochet coup and military dictatorship |
| Afghanistan (Operation Cyclone) | Afghanistan | 1979-1989 | Armed mujahideen against Soviets. Some recipients later formed the Taliban and al-Qaeda |
| Iran-Contra | Nicaragua | 1981-1986 | Illegal arms sales to Iran to fund Contras; major political scandal |

### Lessons from Covert Interventions

- Short-term "successes" frequently produced catastrophic long-term consequences (Iran 1953 led to the Islamic Revolution; Afghanistan mujahideen funding contributed to the rise of al-Qaeda).
- Covert action allowed the executive branch to circumvent democratic accountability.
- Regime change without a viable political alternative typically produced instability, not democracy.
- The "blowback" from covert operations often created the threats that later interventions were launched to address.

## The Gulf War (1990-1991)

### Context

- Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 prompted a U.S.-led coalition of 35 nations under UN Security Council authorization.
- President George H.W. Bush obtained congressional authorization (narrowly, 52-47 in the Senate) before commencing operations.

### Key Events

- Operation Desert Shield (August 1990-January 1991): Buildup of 700,000 coalition troops in Saudi Arabia.
- Operation Desert Storm (January-February 1991): A 38-day air campaign followed by a 100-hour ground war that liberated Kuwait.

### Outcome and Lessons

- **Outcome**: Kuwait was liberated; Iraqi forces were expelled. The U.S. lost 148 battle deaths and 467 wounded. Iraqi military casualties were estimated at 20,000-30,000, with significant civilian casualties from the air campaign and subsequent sanctions.
- **Lessons**: Often cited as a model of successful intervention due to its clear objectives, broad coalition, UN authorization, congressional vote, and disciplined exit strategy. However, the decision not to march on Baghdad left Saddam Hussein in power, contributing to the conditions that led to the 2003 invasion. The "clean war" narrative obscured significant civilian suffering.

## Post-Cold War Humanitarian Interventions (1992-1999)

### Somalia (1992-1994)

- **Operation Restore Hope** began as a humanitarian mission to protect food aid during a famine.
- Mission expanded to include disarming warlords and nation-building (the "Mogadishu Mission").
- The "Black Hawk Down" incident (October 1993) killed 18 U.S. soldiers and prompted a withdrawal.
- **Lessons**: Mission creep from humanitarian aid to combat operations; the risks of intervening in failed states without understanding local power dynamics; the political fragility of interventions that produce televised casualties.

### Bosnia (1992-1995)

- Three years of ethnic cleansing and genocide, including the Srebrenica massacre (July 1995), finally prompted NATO intervention.
- A sustained NATO air campaign (Operation Deliberate Force, August-September 1995) combined with Croatian and Bosnian ground offensives forced the Serbs to negotiate.
- The Dayton Accords (December 1995) ended the war, and a NATO-led stabilization force (IFOR/SFOR) of 60,000 troops deployed to enforce the peace.
- **Lessons**: The cost of delayed intervention (100,000+ killed before NATO acted); the effectiveness of airpower when combined with ground forces and a political strategy; the long-term commitment required for post-conflict stabilization (international forces remained for over a decade).

### Kosovo (1999)

- NATO launched a 78-day air campaign (Operation Allied Force) against Serbia to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, without UN Security Council authorization.
- The campaign was conducted without ground troops and ultimately forced Serbian withdrawal.
- **Lessons**: Air power alone can achieve limited objectives but cannot prevent atrocities on the ground during the campaign itself; humanitarian intervention without UN authorization sets a contested precedent; the importance of a post-conflict plan (Kosovo remains a contested territory with ongoing international presence).

## The Post-9/11 Era

### Afghanistan (2001-2021)

**Initial Phase (2001-2002)**

- The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, authorized by the 2001 AUMF and supported by a broad international coalition, rapidly toppled the Taliban regime that had harbored al-Qaeda.
- A combination of CIA paramilitary teams, U.S. Special Forces, airpower, and Afghan Northern Alliance fighters achieved the initial military objective in weeks.
- Al-Qaeda's leadership, including Osama bin Laden, escaped into Pakistan during the Battle of Tora Bora (December 2001), partly due to inadequate U.S. troop levels and reliance on Afghan proxies.

**Nation-Building Phase (2002-2014)**

- The U.S. gradually expanded its mission from counterterrorism to counterinsurgency and state-building.
- At its peak (2011), approximately 100,000 U.S. troops were deployed in Afghanistan, along with tens of thousands of NATO allies.
- Efforts to build Afghan national security forces, democratic institutions, and infrastructure absorbed hundreds of billions of dollars, but were undermined by corruption, ethnic divisions, Taliban resilience, and the distraction of the Iraq War.
- The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) documented systematic waste, fraud, and failure across virtually every aspect of the reconstruction effort.

**Withdrawal (2020-2021)**

- The Trump administration signed the Doha Agreement with the Taliban in February 2020, committing to a full withdrawal.
- The Biden administration completed the withdrawal in August 2021, culminating in the chaotic evacuation from Kabul that killed 13 U.S. service members and approximately 170 Afghan civilians.
- The Taliban retook control of the country within days of the U.S. departure, erasing two decades of nation-building effort.

**Outcome and Lessons**

- **Costs**: 2,461 U.S. military deaths; 20,000+ wounded; ~176,000 total deaths (Afghan military, police, civilians, Taliban, and others); ~$2.3 trillion spent.
- **Lessons**: The limits of counterinsurgency doctrine when the host government lacks legitimacy; the impossibility of building a nation from the outside without local ownership; the dangers of mission creep and the absence of clear exit criteria; the need for honest assessment rather than "progress reports" designed to sustain political support; the structural incentives that prevent bureaucracies from acknowledging failure.

### Iraq War (2003-2011, and Return)

**Invasion and Occupation (2003-2011)**

- The 2003 invasion was justified by claims that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and was linked to al-Qaeda. Both claims were later shown to be false.
- The initial military campaign toppled Saddam Hussein's regime in three weeks, but the U.S. was unprepared for the insurgency that followed.
- Critical early decisions, particularly the disbanding of the Iraqi army (CPA Order 2) and the de-Baathification of Iraqi society, fueled the insurgency by creating hundreds of thousands of armed, unemployed men with military training and deep grievances.
- A vicious sectarian civil war (2006-2008) was partially quelled by the "Surge" of 30,000 additional U.S. troops and the "Anbar Awakening" alliance with Sunni tribes.
- The last U.S. combat troops departed Iraq in December 2011 under a status of forces agreement negotiated by the Bush administration.

**Return (2014-Present)**

- The rise of ISIS in 2014, which captured Mosul and declared a "caliphate" across large portions of Iraq and Syria, prompted the U.S. to return with airstrikes and ground advisors under Operation Inherent Resolve.
- Approximately 2,500 U.S. troops remain in Iraq as of 2025.

**Outcome and Lessons**

- **Costs**: 4,431 U.S. military deaths; 31,000+ wounded; an estimated 185,000-209,000 Iraqi civilian deaths from direct violence (Iraq Body Count / Costs of War); ~$2.9 trillion spent.
- **Lessons**: The catastrophic consequences of intelligence failures and political manipulation of intelligence; the danger of invading a country without a post-conflict plan; the long-term destabilizing effects of regime change in a deeply divided society; the creation of new threats (ISIS) as a consequence of the invasion itself; the human and financial costs of occupation.

### Libya (2011)

- NATO, led by the U.S., France, and the UK, launched an air campaign to protect civilians during the Libyan civil war, authorized by UN Security Council Resolution 1973.
- The mission rapidly expanded from civilian protection to regime change, culminating in the overthrow and killing of Muammar Gaddafi.
- No post-conflict stabilization plan was implemented. Libya descended into prolonged civil war, becoming a failed state and a hub for arms trafficking, human smuggling, and jihadist groups.
- **Lessons**: President Obama later called the failure to plan for post-Gaddafi Libya the "worst mistake" of his presidency. The intervention demonstrated that air power can topple a regime but cannot build stability, and that "regime change lite" without a post-conflict commitment is a recipe for chaos.

### Syria (2011-Present)

- The U.S. role in the Syrian civil war has been limited and inconsistent: arming and training Syrian rebels (many of whom defected or lost their weapons to jihadists), conducting airstrikes against ISIS, and maintaining a small ground presence in northeastern Syria alongside Kurdish forces (SDF).
- President Obama set a "red line" on chemical weapons use in 2013 but declined to enforce it militarily after the Syrian government crossed it, damaging U.S. credibility.
- The U.S. conducted limited strikes against Syrian government targets in 2017 and 2018 in response to chemical weapons use.
- **Lessons**: The costs of inconsistency and half-measures; the difficulty of intervening in a multi-sided civil war with competing interests; the limits of proxy warfare; the humanitarian catastrophe that can result from inaction (over 500,000 dead, 13 million displaced).

## Synthesis: Recurring Patterns

Across seven decades of intervention, several patterns recur:

1. **Threat Inflation**: Nearly every major intervention has been justified by exaggerated or fabricated threats (Gulf of Tonkin, Iraq WMDs, the domino theory).
2. **Inadequate Post-Conflict Planning**: Military victories are rarely matched by adequate political and reconstruction planning (Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan).
3. **Mission Creep**: Limited initial objectives expand into open-ended commitments (Somalia, Afghanistan).
4. **Failure to Learn**: Lessons from each intervention are identified in after-action reports and academic analysis but are systematically ignored in subsequent decisions.
5. **Executive Dominance**: Congress has progressively ceded its war power to the President, with the 2001 AUMF representing the most extreme example.
6. **Optimism Bias**: Decision-makers consistently underestimate costs and timelines while overestimating the tractability of political problems (the "cakewalk" prediction for Iraq; the "light footprint" assumption for Libya).
7. **Blowback**: Interventions frequently create the conditions for the next crisis (arming Afghan mujahideen contributed to al-Qaeda; disbanding the Iraqi army contributed to ISIS; toppling Gaddafi created a failed state).
