# Civil-Military Relations: Reform Roadmap

Strengthening civil-military relations requires a long-term, phased approach that focuses first on education and building expertise, then on implementing structural reforms and new programs.

---

## Phase 1: Building the Intellectual Foundation (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on creating the new institutions and educational programs needed to enhance civilian expertise and reform military education.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Charter New Institutions** | Congress passes legislation to charter the "Congressional War College" and the "National Commission on AI and Security." | Institutions are chartered; boards of directors are appointed. |
| **2. Reform PME Requirements** | The Secretary of Defense issues a directive requiring changes to promotion board precepts to favor civilian graduate education. | New promotion precepts are published and applied to the next promotion cycle. |
| **3. Launch Exchange Program Expansion** | The DoD doubles the number of slots in the Secretary of Defense Executive Fellows program and launches a pilot "Civilian Tour of Duty" program. | 50 civilian professionals are placed in DoD roles in the first year of the pilot. |
| **4. Codify Norms** | Congress passes legislation extending the "cooling-off period" for retired senior officers. | Legislation is enacted. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Create the institutional and educational infrastructure needed to bridge the civil-military gap and improve oversight.

## Phase 2: Launching and Scaling New Programs (Years 3-5)

This phase focuses on operationalizing the new institutions and launching the national service initiative.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Open New Institutions** | The Congressional War College matriculates its first class of staffers. The National Commission on AI and Security holds its first public hearing and issues its first report. | First class graduates. First report is delivered to Congress. |
| **2. Launch National Service Fellowship** | Congress passes and funds the "National Service Fellowship Act." The first cohort of fellows begins their service year. | 10,000 fellows are placed in military and civilian service roles in the first year. |
| **3. Increase Civilian Graduate Education** | The number of military officers attending top-tier civilian graduate schools increases by 50% over the baseline. | Enrollment targets are met across all services. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Move from planning to execution. Begin to build the cadre of expert civilians and broadly-educated officers who will lead the next generation.

## Phase 3: Institutionalizing a New Relationship (Years 6-10)

This phase focuses on seeing the long-term benefits of the reforms as graduates of the new programs move into senior leadership positions.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. A New Generation of Leaders** | The first graduates of the Congressional War College are promoted to staff director and chief of staff positions on Capitol Hill. | At least 25% of key defense committee staff are graduates of the program. |
| **2. AI Oversight in Practice** | Congress enacts legislation based on the recommendations of the National Commission on AI and Security, establishing permanent oversight mechanisms. | New AI oversight laws are passed and implemented. |
| **3. A Broader Pool of Veterans** | The National Service Fellowship program leads to a measurable increase in the diversity and geographic distribution of military recruits. | The percentage of recruits from under-represented regions increases by 10%. |
| **4. A Less Partisan Military** | The norm against partisan endorsements by retired senior officers is re-established, with fewer such endorsements in presidential election cycles. | The number of public endorsements by retired 3- and 4-star officers decreases by 75% compared to the 2020/2024 cycles. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: A new, healthier equilibrium in civil-military relations is achieved, characterized by higher levels of mutual understanding, more effective oversight, and a renewed commitment to non-partisanship.
