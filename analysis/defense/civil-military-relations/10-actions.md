# Civil-Military Relations: What You Can Do

Bridging the civil-military gap is a responsibility that falls on both civilians and military personnel. Informed citizens can take several steps to foster a healthier relationship and strengthen democratic accountability.

---

## 1. Get Educated

- **Read Beyond the Headlines**: Seek out high-quality analysis on civil-military relations from the sources listed in the [Resources](09-resources.md) section. Understand the core theories and the current debates.
- **Learn About the Modern Military**: Make an effort to understand the structure, culture, and challenges of the modern All-Volunteer Force. Follow publications like *War on the Rocks* or the service-specific *Times* newspapers (e.g., *Army Times*).
- **Distinguish Reverence from Understanding**: It is possible to respect and support service members while also critically examining the military as an institution. Avoid the trap of unquestioning reverence, which can stifle accountability.

## 2. Bridge the Gap Personally

- **Engage with Veterans**: If you don't have a personal connection to the military, seek one out. Volunteer with a local veterans service organization. Hire veterans. Ask them about their experiences.
- **Encourage Service**: Promote all forms of public service—including military, AmeriCorps, and others—as an honorable and valuable path for young Americans.
- **Visit a Military Base or Museum**: Many bases offer public tours, and military museums provide a window into the history and culture of the armed forces.

## 3. Demand Accountability from Civilian Leaders

- **Ask Your Representatives About Oversight**: At town halls, ask your elected officials specific questions about their oversight responsibilities:
    - "What steps is your office taking to ensure you have the technical expertise to oversee the DoD's AI and cyber programs?"
    - "What is your position on the politicization of retired military officers, and do you solicit their endorsements?"
    - "How do you ensure that authorizations for the use of military force are narrowly defined and have clear objectives?"
- **Advocate for Congressional Capacity**: Support efforts to increase the pay and professionalism of congressional staff, particularly on the defense committees, to improve their ability to conduct oversight.

## 4. Uphold Norms

- **Challenge Politicization**: When you see politicians using the military as a partisan prop, or retired generals making partisan attacks, call it out. Upholding the norm of a non-partisan military is a civic responsibility.
- **Promote Nuanced Discussion**: In your own conversations, push back against simplistic stereotypes of the military, whether they are overly heroic or overly critical. Encourage a more nuanced and informed public discourse.
