# Civil-Military Relations: Legislation

## Overview

Civil-military relations in the United States are governed by a framework of laws, norms, and traditions designed to ensure civilian control of the military while maintaining military professionalism. Key statutes include the **National Security Act of 1947**, the **Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986**, and the **Insurrection Act of 1807**. These laws are supplemented by Department of Defense directives (particularly DoD Directive 1344.10 on political activities), the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and longstanding professional norms within the officer corps.

However, recent years have seen a fraying of these norms. The politicization of the military, the erosion of the "cooling-off" period for retired officers, and the controversial use of active-duty troops in domestic protests have highlighted gaps in the legal framework. Two waivers of the civilian control cooling-off period in five years (2017 and 2021), hundreds of retired officers working for foreign governments without proper approval, and increasing rates of partisan social media activity among active-duty personnel have collectively weakened the foundations of civil-military relations.

The legislative approach proposed here addresses these challenges through two complementary federal bills:

- **The Civilian Control and Military Professionalism Act** targets active-duty politicization, Insurrection Act reform, and institutional civics education.
- **The Retired Officer Conduct and Conflict of Interest Act** targets the post-service revolving door, foreign employment, and the use of military credentials for partisan endorsements.

Together with a model state bill for National Guard accountability, these proposals aim to reinforce the non-partisan nature of the military, strengthen civilian oversight, and clarify the limits of domestic military use. They seek to codify norms that were previously assumed but are now contested, while respecting the constitutional rights of service members and the legitimate authority of the Commander-in-Chief.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for this topic area.* The Constitution already establishes civilian control through a deliberate separation of military powers: the President serves as Commander-in-Chief (Article II, Section 2), while Congress holds the power to declare war, raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy, and make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces (Article I, Section 8). The legislative reforms proposed below operate within this existing constitutional framework, strengthening statutory guardrails rather than altering the constitutional allocation of authority.

## Federal Legislation

### The Civilian Control and Military Professionalism Act

**Purpose**: To strengthen the barriers between political activity and military service, reinforce the cooling-off period for civilian leadership roles, and enhance transparency in civil-military interactions.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Cooling-Off Period Restoration**: Restores the mandatory waiting period for a retired officer to serve as Secretary of Defense to 10 years (from 7) and requires a supermajority vote in the Senate to grant a waiver.
2. **Political Activity Ban**: Explicitly prohibits active-duty personnel from participating in political rallies, endorsing candidates, or engaging in partisan fundraising, with stricter penalties under the UCMJ.
3. **Insurrection Act Reform**: Amends the Insurrection Act to require Congressional consultation and a time limit for the deployment of active-duty troops domestically.
4. **Resignation Transparency**: Requires senior officers (O-9 and O-10) to submit a written justification to Congress if they resign in protest of a lawful order, protecting them from retaliation while ensuring accountability.
5. **Civics Education**: Mandates enhanced civics and constitutional training for all service members at accession and key career milestones.

AN ACT

To reinforce civilian control of the Armed Forces and ensure the non-partisan nature of the military.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Civilian Control and Military Professionalism Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Civilian control of the military is a bedrock principle of American democracy, enshrined in Article I and Article II of the Constitution and reaffirmed in the National Security Act of 1947.
(2) The appointment of recently retired general officers to civilian leadership positions erodes the distinction between military and civilian roles, as evidenced by waivers granted in 2017 and 2021 for recently retired four-star officers to serve as Secretary of Defense.
(3) Public trust in the military, while still comparatively high, has declined significantly; the Reagan National Defense Survey, November 2023, found that only 45 percent of Americans have a great deal of trust and confidence in the military, down from 70 percent in 2018.
(4) A RAND Corporation study, "Political Activities and the Military" (2021), found increasing rates of partisan social media engagement among active-duty service members, undermining perceptions of non-partisanship.
(5) The deployment of active-duty military personnel and National Guard units during the June 2020 civil unrest in Washington, D.C. raised serious concerns about the politicization of military force for domestic political purposes, as documented by the Congressional Research Service Report R46166 (2020).
(6) Clear statutory guardrails are necessary to prevent the misuse of the military for domestic political purposes and to preserve the institutional credibility of the Armed Forces.
(7) The Government Accountability Office (GAO-22-105093, 2022) identified gaps in DoD ethics oversight procedures, including inconsistent enforcement of political activity restrictions across the military services.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) COVERED MILITARY OFFICER.—The term "covered military officer" means—
    (A) any commissioned officer of the Armed Forces serving in the grade of O-7 or above on active duty;

    (D) using official military authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of an election.
(3) CIVILIAN CONTROL PRINCIPLE.—The term "civilian control principle" means the constitutional and statutory framework under which the Armed Forces of the United States are subordinate to civilian authority, including the authority of the President as Commander-in-Chief and the authority of Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.
(4) DOMESTIC DEPLOYMENT.—The term "domestic deployment" means any use of members of the Armed Forces in an active duty capacity within the territory of the United States, its territories, or possessions for the purpose of enforcing Federal or State law or maintaining public order.

SEC. 5. INSURRECTION ACT REFORM.

(a) CONSULTATION.—The President may not deploy members of the Armed Forces under chapter 13 of title 10, United States Code (commonly known as the "Insurrection Act"), unless the President has submitted a certification to Congress that—
    (1) State and local authorities are unable or unwilling to maintain public order;
    (2) The President has consulted with the Governors of the affected States; and
    (3) The deployment is necessary to enforce Federal law or protect constitutional rights that cannot be secured through civilian law enforcement.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Provides precise legal definitions to prevent ambiguity in enforcement. "Covered military officer" captures both active and retired senior leaders. "Partisan political activity" is defined broadly enough to cover modern forms of political engagement, including social media, while preserving the right of service members to vote, hold private political opinions, and engage in nonpartisan civic activities.
- **Section 4 (SecDef Eligibility)**: Reverses the trend of waivers (Mattis in 2017, Austin in 2021) that has blurred the line between the uniformed military and civilian leadership. The 10-year cooling-off period and supermajority waiver requirement ensure that such appointments remain genuinely exceptional. The notification requirement adds transparency to the waiver process.
- **Section 5 (Insurrection Act Reform)**: Checks the President's power to deploy troops domestically by requiring certification to Congress, consultation with affected Governors, and a necessity finding. The 30-day time limit, weekly reporting, and prohibited uses provisions prevent open-ended or mission-creeping deployments and protect First Amendment activities.
- **Section 6 (Political Activity Ban)**: Codifies DoD Directive 1344.10 into statutory law enforceable under the UCMJ, making it a punishable offense to politicize the uniform. The social media extension addresses the most common modern vector for partisan military activity.
- **Section 7 (Civics Education)**: Recognizes that legal prohibitions alone are insufficient; a professional military culture of non-partisanship must be cultivated through education. The senior officer module addresses the unique responsibilities and post-retirement risks of general and flag officers.
- **Section 8 (Reporting)**: Creates accountability through annual Congressional reporting and a 3-year GAO review to assess whether the Act is achieving its intended effects.

**Legislative Vehicle**: This bill could be introduced as a standalone measure or incorporated as a title within the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA vehicle is recommended because it receives reliable annual floor consideration and bipartisan negotiation through the Armed Services Committees.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Promulgate updated UCMJ Manual provisions | 180 days after enactment | DoD / President |
| Issue updated DoD Directive 1344.10 | 180 days after enactment | Office of the Secretary of Defense |
| Develop and pilot civics curriculum | 1 year after enactment | Joint Chiefs / Service Secretaries |
| Full civics program operational across all branches | 2 years after enactment | Service Secretaries / PME institutions |
| Establish social media monitoring guidance | 180 days after enactment | DoD General Counsel / Service JAGs |
| GAO effectiveness review | 3 years after enactment | Government Accountability Office |

**Challenges**:

- **Executive Pushback**: Presidents of both parties will resist limits on Insurrection Act authority, viewing it as an encroachment on Commander-in-Chief prerogatives. The certification and consultation requirements may face veto threats.
- **Free Speech Concerns**: Restrictions on political activity must be carefully crafted to avoid violating service members' First Amendment rights. Service members retain the right to vote, hold private opinions, and engage in nonpartisan civic activities; the prohibition targets only partisan activity conducted in a military capacity.
- **Enforcement Complexity**: Social media monitoring raises privacy concerns and practical challenges. Consistent enforcement across service branches will require clear guidance from DoD General Counsel.

**Refinements**:

- Clarify that "consultation" with Governors does not mean "permission," preserving federal supremacy in true emergencies (e.g., enforcing civil rights as during the 1957 Little Rock crisis).
- Include a safe harbor provision for service members who inadvertently engage in prohibited social media activity, allowing for corrective counseling before punitive action on first offenses.
- Establish a joint DoD-Congressional advisory panel to periodically review and update the definitions of "partisan political activity" as communication technologies evolve.

### The Retired Officer Conduct and Conflict of Interest Act

**Purpose**: To regulate the post-service employment of retired general and flag officers, preventing the "revolving door" where generals monetize their rank by working for foreign governments or defense contractors immediately after retirement.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Foreign Employment Ban**: Prohibits retired general/flag officers from accepting employment or compensation from foreign governments for 5 years after retirement.
2. **Lobbying Restriction**: Extends the ban on lobbying the DoD for retired senior officers to 5 years.
3. **Transparency Database**: Creates a public database of all waivers granted for foreign employment and all post-service employment of senior officers in the defense sector.
4. **Pension Forfeiture**: Authorizes the forfeiture of retirement pay for violations of these provisions.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To ensure the integrity of the retired officer corps and prevent conflicts of interest.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Retired Officer Conduct and Conflict of Interest Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) A Department of Defense Inspector General investigation (DODIG-2022-085, 2022) found that at least 500 retired senior military officers accepted employment with foreign governments between 2015 and 2022, many without obtaining the legally required prior approval under 37 U.S.C. 908.
(2) The "revolving door" between the Pentagon and defense contractors undermines public confidence in the acquisition process; the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) identified over 380 senior DoD officials who transitioned to defense industry positions between 2019 and 2023.
(3) Retired officers retain their commission and are subject to recall under 10 U.S.C. 688; their post-service conduct therefore continues to reflect upon the Armed Forces and may create conflicts of interest with national security obligations.
(4) The Government Accountability Office (GAO-23-106705, 2023) found that DoD has no centralized system for tracking post-retirement employment of senior officers, creating significant oversight gaps.
(5) Retired general and flag officers who publicly endorse candidates for political office leverage the institutional prestige of the military for partisan purposes, eroding public confidence in military non-partisanship (Center for a New American Security, "Retired Flag Officers in Political Campaigns," 2021).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) RETIRED OFFICER.—The term "retired officer" means any commissioned officer of the Armed Forces who—
    (A) retired in the grade of O-7 or above; or
    (B) at any time during active service held a position requiring Senate confirmation under title 10, United States Code.
(2) COVERED POLITICAL ENDORSEMENT.—The term "covered political endorsement" means—
    (A) any public statement, advertisement, or communication expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate for Federal, State, or local office in which the retired officer is identified by military rank, title, or service affiliation;
    (B) any appearance at a campaign event, convention, or fundraiser in which the retired officer is introduced or identified by military rank or title; or
    (C) any solicitation of political contributions that references the retired officer's military service or rank.
(3) COOLING-OFF PERIOD.—The term "cooling-off period" means the 5-year period beginning on the date of the retirement of a retired officer from active service in the Armed Forces.
(4) FOREIGN GOVERNMENT.—The term "foreign government" includes—
    (A) any government of a foreign country, including any political subdivision thereof;
    (B) any entity owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a foreign government; and
    (C) any state-owned enterprise, sovereign wealth fund, or government-affiliated entity of a foreign country.
(5) DEFENSE CONTRACTOR.—The term "defense contractor" means any person or entity that holds a contract with the Department of Defense valued at $10,000,000 or more, or that received aggregate contract payments from the Department in excess of $25,000,000 during the most recent fiscal year.

SEC. 4. FOREIGN EMPLOYMENT RESTRICTIONS.

(a) PROHIBITION.—A retired officer may not accept employment with, or compensation from, a foreign government during the cooling-off period.
(b) WAIVER.—The Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense may jointly waive this prohibition if they certify to Congress that such employment is in the national security interest of the United States.
(c) NOTIFICATION.—A retired officer who seeks a waiver under subsection (b) shall submit a written application to the Secretary of Defense not later than 60 days before the proposed start date of such employment, including a description of the position, the foreign government involved, and the compensation to be received.

SEC. 5. LOBBYING RESTRICTIONS.

(a) AMENDMENT.—Section 207 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to prohibit retired officers from lobbying the Department of Defense for a period of 5 years after retirement.
(b) SCOPE.—The prohibition in subsection (a) includes—
    (1) direct communication with DoD officials on behalf of a defense contractor or foreign government;
    (2) consulting or advising a defense contractor or foreign government on strategies for influencing DoD procurement, policy, or personnel decisions; and
    (3) serving on the board of directors of a defense contractor during the cooling-off period if the officer's duties include oversight of DoD-related business.

SEC. 6. COVERED POLITICAL ENDORSEMENTS.

(a) DISCLOSURE.—A retired officer who makes a covered political endorsement shall, within 30 days, file a disclosure statement with the DoD Standards of Conduct Office identifying the endorsement, the campaign or candidate involved, and any compensation received.
(b) DISCLAIMER.—Any covered political endorsement must include a prominent disclaimer stating that the endorsement reflects the personal views of the individual and not the views of the Department of Defense or any branch of the Armed Forces.

SEC. 7. TRANSPARENCY.

(a) DATABASE.—The Secretary of Defense shall maintain a publicly accessible, searchable database of—
    (1) all waivers granted under Section 4;
    (2) all notifications of post-government employment filed by retired officers;
    (3) all covered political endorsement disclosures filed under Section 6; and
    (4) all violations adjudicated under this Act and the penalties imposed.

SEC. 8. PENALTIES.

(a) FORFEITURE.—A violation of Section 4, Section 5, or Section 6 shall result in the suspension of retired pay for a period of not less than 1 year and not more than 5 years, depending on the severity of the violation.
(b) CIVIL PENALTIES.—In addition to pay suspension, the Secretary of Defense may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $50,000 per violation.
(c) REFERRAL.—Knowing and willful violations of Section 4 or Section 5 shall be referred to the Department of Justice for potential criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 207.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
(1) $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
(2) $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
(3) $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
(4) $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
(5) $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this Act and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Provides precise legal definitions that close common evasion routes. "Retired officer" captures Senate-confirmed officials regardless of retirement grade. "Foreign government" is defined broadly to include state-owned enterprises (preventing the evasion tactic of working for a government-controlled company rather than the government itself). "Cooling-off period" establishes a clear 5-year standard. "Defense contractor" uses dollar thresholds to focus on significant relationships while avoiding overreach.
- **Section 4 (Foreign Employment)**: Stops the practice of U.S. generals retiring and immediately going to work for Saudi Arabia, the UAE, or other foreign governments, which compromises U.S. interests and potentially exposes classified knowledge. The 60-day advance notification requirement creates an administrative checkpoint.
- **Section 5 (Lobbying Restrictions)**: Broadens the existing 18 U.S.C. 207 restrictions by expanding the scope to include consulting and board service, not just direct lobbying contacts. This closes the "strategic advisor" loophole that has been widely exploited.
- **Section 6 (Political Endorsements)**: Does not ban political speech by retired officers (which would raise serious First Amendment concerns) but requires disclosure and a disclaimer, ensuring transparency and preventing the false impression of military institutional endorsement.
- **Section 7 (Transparency)**: Creates a centralized, publicly searchable database to replace the current system where approvals and violations are scattered across agencies and often secret. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.
- **Section 8 (Penalties)**: Establishes a graduated penalty structure from pay suspension to civil fines to criminal referral, providing proportionate responses to different levels of violation severity.

**Legislative Vehicle**: This bill could be introduced as standalone legislation or as a title within the NDAA. Given its focus on ethics and post-service conduct, it may also be paired with broader government ethics reform packages. The Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee would both have jurisdictional interest.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Issue waiver guidance and application procedures | 180 days after enactment | State / DoD |
| Publish updated JER provisions for post-retirement conduct | 180 days after enactment | DoD Standards of Conduct Office |
| Launch public transparency database | 1 year after enactment | DoD Standards of Conduct Office / CIO |
| Notify all retired O-7+ officers of new obligations | 90 days after enactment | DFAS / Service Secretaries |
| Establish endorsement disclosure intake system | 1 year after enactment | DoD Standards of Conduct Office |
| GAO audit of database completeness and compliance | 3 years after enactment | Government Accountability Office |

**Challenges**:

- **Enforcement Difficulty**: Tracking employment of retirees is difficult without self-reporting. Foreign employment, in particular, may occur through intermediaries, shell companies, or consulting arrangements that are difficult to detect.
- **Legal Challenges**: Retirees may argue that employment and lobbying restrictions violate their right to work and their First Amendment rights. Courts have generally upheld reasonable post-service restrictions for government employees, but the 5-year duration will face scrutiny.
- **Jurisdictional Complexity**: Enforcement may require coordination between DoD, the State Department, and the Department of Justice, creating potential for inter-agency delays and disputes.

**Refinements**:

- Establish a confidential reporting mechanism (whistleblower hotline) for defense industry insiders or foreign government contacts to report suspected violations, supplementing self-reporting.
- Create a pre-clearance process by which retiring officers can submit prospective employment plans for review before retirement, providing legal certainty and reducing inadvertent violations.
- Include a grandfathering provision for officers who retired before the Act's effective date, applying the disclosure and endorsement provisions but exempting existing employment relationships from the foreign employment ban.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State National Guard Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To clarify the Governor's authority over the National Guard while establishing accountability mechanisms for domestic deployments. This model legislation addresses a gap in state-level oversight: while federal law governs the military extensively, state National Guard deployments under Title 32 (state status) are often subject to minimal legislative oversight, allowing Governors broad discretion in how and when Guard units are used for domestic purposes.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] National Guard Accountability Act".

SECTION 2. DEPLOYMENT CRITERIA.
(a) The Governor may deploy the National Guard for domestic law enforcement purposes only upon a written declaration of emergency specifying the nature of the threat and the specific mission of the Guard.
(b) Such deployment shall be limited to 30 days unless extended by the State Legislature.
(c) The declaration shall specify the geographic area of the deployment and the rules of engagement governing the use of force.

SECTION 3. OVERSIGHT.
(a) The Adjutant General shall submit a daily report to the Legislature during any domestic deployment detailing the activities, location, and use of force by Guard members.
(b) The Legislature may, by majority vote, terminate a domestic deployment at any time.

SECTION 4. USE OF FORCE STANDARDS.
(a) National Guard members deployed for domestic law enforcement purposes shall operate under rules of engagement approved by the Adjutant General that are consistent with civilian law enforcement standards.
(b) The use of military weapons systems, armored vehicles, or crowd control agents not available to civilian law enforcement shall require separate written authorization by the Governor.

SECTION 5. AFTER-ACTION REVIEW.
(a) Within 90 days of the conclusion of any domestic deployment, the Adjutant General shall submit a comprehensive after-action report to the Legislature, including the total cost, duration, personnel involved, any use of force incidents, any complaints received, and recommendations for future policy.
```

**Explanation**: This model legislation balances the Governor's legitimate emergency authority with legislative oversight. The 30-day limit mirrors the federal Insurrection Act reform and prevents indefinite deployments. The use of force standards provision addresses concerns about the militarization of domestic law enforcement by requiring civilian-equivalent standards for Guard members operating in domestic roles.

**Adaptations**: States may adjust the deployment duration, reporting frequency, and use of force standards based on their specific legal frameworks and state constitutional provisions. States with part-time legislatures may designate an interim oversight committee to receive reports when the full legislature is not in session.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Article I vs. Article II**: The Insurrection Act reform touches on the core tension between Congress's power to make laws and the President's power as Commander-in-Chief. However, the Supreme Court has generally upheld Congress's ability to regulate the *use* of the military (e.g., Posse Comitatus Act of 1878). The *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer* (1952) framework, particularly Justice Jackson's concurrence, supports Congressional authority to limit presidential military deployments when acting pursuant to its Article I, Section 8 powers to "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces."

**First Amendment**: Restrictions on political activity by active-duty personnel are well-established under *Parker v. Levy*, 417 U.S. 733 (1974), which held that the military is a "specialized society separate from civilian society" where different First Amendment standards apply. For retired officers, the legal analysis is more complex because retirees have greater speech protections; however, the disclosure and disclaimer approach (rather than outright bans) is more likely to survive constitutional scrutiny under *Pickering v. Board of Education*, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), balancing test.

**Due Process**: The pension forfeiture and civil penalty provisions must provide adequate procedural protections, including notice, an opportunity to be heard, and the right to appeal. The Acts include severability clauses to ensure that invalidation of one provision does not bring down the entire statute.

### Preemption

Federal law governs the military exclusively under the Supremacy Clause and the federal government's plenary authority over national defense. States have authority over their National Guard only when in Title 32 (state) status. The Model State National Guard Accountability Act operates within this framework, applying only to state-controlled deployments and not purporting to regulate federalized Guard units.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Active-Duty Personnel**: Enforcement through the existing UCMJ court-martial and non-judicial punishment system, with updated Manual for Courts-Martial provisions.
- **Retired Officers**: Enforcement through DFAS pension withholding, civil penalties administered by the DoD Standards of Conduct Office, and DOJ criminal referral for knowing violations.
- **Transparency**: Public database serves as a self-enforcing mechanism by enabling journalists, watchdog organizations, and Congressional oversight committees to identify potential violations.

### Judicial Review

Challenges to these Acts would likely be heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (for regulatory challenges) or the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (for UCMJ challenges). The standard of review for military-related legislation is generally deferential, as courts recognize Congress's broad authority over military affairs.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Consultant" vs. "Lobbyist"** | Retired generals work as "strategic advisors" or "consultants" to defense contractors, technically avoiding the statutory definition of lobbying while performing functionally identical influence activities. | High | Define "lobbying" broadly to include behind-the-scenes advising, strategic counsel, and any activity intended to influence DoD decisions, as done in the Retired Officer Act Section 5(b). |
| **Shell Companies** | Foreign government payments routed through U.S.-registered LLCs, shell corporations, or intermediary consulting firms to disguise the true source of compensation. | High | Require disclosure of beneficial ownership of all paying entities; apply the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) reporting standards to retired senior officers. |
| **Social Media Exemptions** | Active-duty members use anonymous or pseudonymous social media accounts to engage in partisan activity, circumventing identification-based prohibitions. | Medium | Extend prohibitions to cover conduct that is reasonably attributable to a service member regardless of whether they use their name, and establish a complaints-based investigation process for anonymous partisan accounts linked to military personnel. |
| **"Educational" Speaking Loopholes** | Retired officers deliver paid speeches at politically aligned events framed as "educational" or "policy discussion" rather than explicit campaign endorsements, using military credentials to lend authority to partisan messaging. | Medium | Define "covered political endorsement" to include events organized by or financially benefiting a candidate, campaign, or party regardless of whether the event is labeled educational or policy-oriented. |
| **Think Tank Revolving Door** | Retired officers take positions at think tanks with explicit partisan or ideological orientations, using their military credentials to advocate for specific policy positions that benefit their think tank's funders, including defense contractors. | Medium | Require disclosure of think tank employment and any defense contractor or foreign government funding received by the employing organization; include think tank positions in the transparency database. |
| **Media Commentary as "Personal Opinion"** | Retired officers serve as paid military analysts on cable news or other media platforms, delivering partisan commentary while identified by military rank, claiming it reflects "personal opinion" rather than institutional endorsement. | Low | Require the disclaimer provision (Section 6(b)) to apply to all paid media appearances where the retired officer is identified by military rank; require disclosure of media consulting contracts in the transparency database. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Cultural Norms Outpace Legal Remedies** | Laws and regulations cannot fully address a culture of politicization that has developed over decades. Compliance may be superficial if underlying attitudes do not change. | The erosion of the non-partisan military ethic is driven by broader societal polarization, social media incentives, and the political value of military endorsements, forces that operate outside the legal framework. | Sustained investment in civics education (Section 7 of the Civilian Control Act) is the only long-term fix; legal prohibitions set boundaries, but culture ultimately determines behavior. |
| **Enforcement Resource Constraints** | The DoD Standards of Conduct Office and Service Inspector General offices lack the staffing and technical capacity to monitor compliance with foreign employment, lobbying, and social media provisions at scale. | These offices were designed for a smaller volume of oversight cases and have not been resourced for the expanded mandate. | Dedicate specific appropriations for enforcement staffing in the authorization; require the DoD IG to include civil-military relations compliance in its annual audit plan. |
| **Retroactivity Limitations** | The legislation applies prospectively, meaning hundreds of retired officers currently in foreign employment, lobbying, or paid media roles are not covered by the new restrictions. | Constitutional due process and ex post facto principles prevent applying new criminal or punitive provisions to conduct that was legal when it occurred. | Apply disclosure and transparency requirements retroactively (which is permissible), while applying employment bans only to officers who retire after enactment; offer a voluntary compliance program for currently retired officers. |
| **Inter-Agency Coordination Gaps** | Effective enforcement requires cooperation between DoD, State Department, DOJ, DFAS, and potentially the intelligence community, creating jurisdictional friction and potential for cases to fall between bureaucratic cracks. | The U.S. government lacks a single entity responsible for post-service conduct of military retirees; responsibility is fragmented across multiple agencies with different missions and incentive structures. | Establish a Joint Post-Service Conduct Review Board with representatives from DoD, State, and DOJ, empowered to adjudicate cases and make referrals; designate DoD as lead agency. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Broaden Definitions**: Amend the definition of "foreign government employment" to include state-owned enterprises, sovereign wealth funds, and government-affiliated entities, as done in the Retired Officer Act Section 3(4).
2. **Establish Joint Review Board**: Create a standing inter-agency board (DoD, State, DOJ) to review and adjudicate post-service conduct cases, ensuring that enforcement does not fall between bureaucratic cracks and that retired officers receive consistent treatment regardless of which agency detects a violation.
3. **Mandate Periodic Definition Updates**: Require the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Attorney General, to review and update regulatory definitions of "lobbying," "foreign government," and "partisan political activity" every 3 years to keep pace with evolving evasion tactics, communication technologies, and organizational structures.
4. **Strengthen Whistleblower Protections**: Establish a confidential reporting mechanism for defense industry employees, foreign government contacts, and fellow military retirees to report suspected violations, with explicit protections against retaliation for good-faith reports.
5. **Expand Transparency Database Scope**: Require the database to capture not only waivers and self-reported employment, but also media consulting contracts, think tank affiliations, paid speaking engagements, and any board positions held by retired officers at organizations receiving more than $1,000,000 annually from defense contractors or foreign governments.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| **Inconsistent enforcement across service branches** | Require the DoD IG to publish annual service-by-service compliance reports and establish uniform enforcement standards through a joint regulation. |
| **Chilling effect on legitimate post-service careers** | Provide clear safe harbors for non-lobbying private sector employment, academic positions, and nonprofit service; offer pre-clearance guidance to retiring officers. |
| **Database maintenance and data quality** | Designate a permanent database administrator within the DoD Standards of Conduct Office with dedicated IT funding; require annual data quality audits by the GAO. |
| **Political weaponization of enforcement** | Insulate adjudication from political appointees by vesting initial violation determinations in career civil servants and providing for appeal to an independent administrative law judge. |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Insurrection Act**: The 30-day limit acts as a sunset for each specific deployment, requiring affirmative Congressional action to extend.
- **Comprehensive Review**: The GAO shall conduct a comprehensive review of both Acts 5 years after enactment to assess effectiveness, identify unintended consequences, and recommend legislative adjustments.
- **Definitions Review**: The Secretary of Defense shall review regulatory definitions every 3 years and report to Congress on whether amendments are needed to address emerging evasion tactics.
