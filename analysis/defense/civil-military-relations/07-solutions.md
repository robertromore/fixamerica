# Civil-Military Relations: Solutions

Strengthening U.S. civil-military relations requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to bridge the gap between the military and society, enhance civilian expertise, and adapt oversight mechanisms for the 21st century.

## 1. Bridge the Civil-Military Gap

**A. Establish a National Service Program**

- **Description**: Create a voluntary, not mandatory, national service program that encourages all young Americans to complete one year of service in either a military or civilian capacity.
- **Implementation**: Establish a "National Service Fellowship" that offers significant benefits (e.g., full college tuition, hiring preference for federal jobs) in exchange for one year of service. Civilian options would include working in schools, conservation corps, or elder care. Military service would remain a multi-year commitment but would be part of the same national service framework.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Fosters a shared sense of civic duty. Exposes a broader cross-section of society to service, creating a larger pool of future civilian leaders with some connection to the military or public service.

**B. Expand and Incentivize Civil-Military Exchange Programs**

- **Description**: Dramatically expand programs that place mid-career military officers in civilian organizations and vice-versa.
- **Implementation**: Increase funding for programs like the Secretary of Defense Executive Fellows, which places officers in Fortune 500 companies for a year. Create a parallel program to bring mid-career civilian professionals (from tech, finance, etc.) into the Pentagon for a "tour of duty."
- **Anticipated Impact**: Builds personal relationships and cross-cultural understanding between the military and key civilian sectors.

## 2. Enhance Civilian Expertise and Oversight

**A. Create a Congressional "West Point" for Staffers**

- **Description**: Congress lacks the institutional expertise to effectively oversee the modern military. Create a dedicated, non-partisan "Congressional War College" to provide advanced, in-depth education on defense policy, budgeting, and technology to congressional staffers.
- **Implementation**: Charter a new, independent educational institution, modeled on the National War College but reporting to Congress. It would offer a one-year, full-time master's degree program for senior committee and personal staff.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates a permanent cadre of highly knowledgeable civilian staffers on Capitol Hill, improving the quality of legislation and oversight.

**B. Establish a Civilian Oversight Board for Military AI**

- **Description**: Create an independent, external body to provide technical and ethical oversight of the DoD's development and use of AI and autonomous systems.
- **Implementation**: Charter a "National Commission on AI and Security," composed of leading civilian AI experts, ethicists, historians, and former military leaders. The commission would have the authority to review classified AI programs and would be required to provide regular, public reports to Congress and the President.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Addresses the "expertise gap" by providing civilian leaders with an independent source of technical advice. Ensures that ethical considerations are integrated into AI development from the start.

## 3. Reform Professional Military Education (PME)

**A. Mandate Civilian Graduate Education for Senior Officers**

- **Description**: Require that a significant portion of future generals and admirals earn a graduate degree from a civilian university, rather than solely from a military war college.
- **Implementation**: Change promotion board precepts to require that, by 2040, at least 40% of newly promoted one-star generals/admirals must have a master's degree from a top-50 civilian university in a relevant field (e.g., public policy, international relations, engineering).
- **Anticipated Impact**: Exposes future military leaders to diverse, civilian perspectives during their formative mid-career years. Reduces intellectual insularity and improves their ability to think critically about strategy and policy.

**B. Strengthen and Codify Norms of Non-Partisanship**

- **Description**: Rebuild the norm that senior military leaders, both active and retired, should remain outside of partisan politics.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Legislation**: Pass a law extending the "cooling-off period" before retired generals and admirals can accept positions as lobbyists or on corporate boards from one year to three years.
    - **Norms**: The President and leaders of both parties should publicly commit to not using active duty military personnel as political props and to not solicit endorsements from retired senior officers.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Helps restore the military's standing as a trusted, non-partisan institution.
