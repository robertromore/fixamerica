# Civil-Military Relations: History

## Historical Development

The American model of civil-military relations is unique, shaped by a foundational suspicion of standing armies and a continuous effort to balance military effectiveness with democratic accountability.

### The Founding Era (1776-1815): Subordinating the Military

- **Founders' Fear**: The framers of the Constitution were deeply suspicious of a large, permanent "standing army," which they saw as a tool of European monarchical tyranny and a threat to liberty.
- **Constitutional Safeguards**: They embedded civilian control directly into the Constitution:
    - **Article I**: Gives Congress the power to declare war, raise and support armies, and make rules for the military.
    - **Article II**: Makes the elected President the Commander in Chief of the armed forces.
- **Early Tensions**: The **Newburgh Conspiracy (1783)**, where Continental Army officers considered a coup over unpaid wages, was a formative crisis that was defused by George Washington, cementing the principle of military subordination to civilian power.

### The 19th and Early 20th Century: A Small, Isolated Force

- **Small Peacetime Military**: For most of its history, the U.S. maintained a very small professional army, relying on state militias and rapidly mobilized citizen-soldiers during wartime (e.g., the Civil War, World War I).
- **Civil-Military Gap**: The professional officer corps was a small, insular group, largely separate from mainstream American society.

### World War II and the Cold War: Rise of the National Security State

- **The "Garrison State"**: World War II and the Cold War led to the creation of a large, permanent, and globally deployed standing military for the first time in U.S. history.
- **National Security Act of 1947**: A landmark law that created the modern civil-military architecture:
    - Established the **Department of Defense (DoD)** to unify the military services under a civilian **Secretary of Defense**.
    - Created the **National Security Council (NSC)** to advise the President.
    - Created the **Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)**.
- **The Truman-MacArthur Controversy (1951)**: President Truman fired General Douglas MacArthur for publicly challenging the administration's strategy during the Korean War. This was a powerful and public affirmation of the principle that the President, not the generals, sets policy.
- **The Military-Industrial Complex**: In his 1961 farewell address, President Eisenhower, a former general, famously warned of the "unwarranted influence" of the growing "military-industrial complex."

### The Vietnam Era and the All-Volunteer Force (1964-1990)

- **A Crisis of Trust**: The Vietnam War created a deep crisis in civil-military relations. The military felt it had been asked to fight a war with political constraints that made victory impossible, while much of the public grew hostile to the military and the draft.
- **The All-Volunteer Force (AVF)**: In 1973, the draft was abolished. The creation of the AVF professionalized the military but also began the process of separating it from the broader society, laying the groundwork for the modern civil-military gap.
- **Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986**: This major reform strengthened civilian control and joint-service operations by elevating the authority of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the principal military advisor to the President and SecDef, while keeping the service chiefs out of the direct chain of command.

### The Modern Era (1991-Present): A Widening Gap and New Challenges

- **The "Revered but Disconnected" Military**: After the success of the First Gulf War, the military's public prestige soared. However, as < 0.5% of the population served in the post-9/11 wars, the military became an institution that was highly trusted but poorly understood by the public it served.
- **"Revolt of the Generals"**: During the Iraq War, several retired generals publicly and harshly criticized the civilian leadership of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, sparking a debate about the proper role of military dissent.
- **Politicization**: The 2010s and 2020s saw a sharp increase in the willingness of retired senior officers to engage in partisan politics, including speaking at political conventions, which many observers saw as a dangerous erosion of the military's non-partisan ideal.
- **The Rise of New Domains**: The creation of **U.S. Cyber Command (2010)** and the **Space Force (2019)** institutionalized new warfighting domains whose speed and complexity created new and profound challenges for traditional civilian oversight.
