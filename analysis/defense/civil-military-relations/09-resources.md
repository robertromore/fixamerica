## Foundational Academic Works

- **Huntington, Samuel P. *The Soldier and the State: The Theory and Politics of Civil-Military Relations* (1957).**
    - The seminal, foundational text of the field. Huntington's theory of "objective civilian control," which advocates for a professional, autonomous, and non-partisan military, remains the starting point for all modern debate.

- **Feaver, Peter D. *Armed Servants: Agency, Oversight, and Civil-Military Relations* (2003).**
    - A modern counterpoint to Huntington. Feaver's "agency theory" model posits that the relationship is a constant negotiation between a civilian "principal" and a military "agent." It focuses on the mechanisms civilians use to monitor and control the military.

- **Kohn, Richard H. "The Erosion of Civilian Control of the Military in the United States Today" (2002).**
    - An influential essay that raised alarms about a post-Cold War crisis in civil-military relations, arguing that the military had become too influential and politically active.

- **Janowitz, Morris. *The Professional Soldier: A Social and Political Portrait* (1960).**
    - A classic sociological study of the military as a profession, focusing on the internal culture and values of the officer corps.

## Key Reports and Government Sources

- **National Defense Strategy (NDS)**
    - While a strategic document, the NDS often contains language about the importance of the profession of arms and the health of the All-Volunteer Force.

- **GAO Reports on Professional Military Education (PME)**
    - The Government Accountability Office periodically reviews the curriculum and effectiveness of the military's war colleges and other PME institutions.

## Think Tanks and Research Organizations

- **Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)**: Often publishes reports and hosts events on civil-military relations, particularly regarding military professionalism and ethics.
- **Center for a New American Security (CNAS)**: The Military, Veterans, and Society Program focuses heavily on the health of the All-Volunteer Force and the civil-military gap.
- **The Triangle Institute for Security Studies (TISS)**: A consortium of universities (including Duke, UNC, and NC State) that is a leading academic center for the study of civil-military relations.
- **War on the Rocks / Texas National Security Review**: Online publications that frequently feature articles and debates on civil-military relations by leading scholars and practitioners.
