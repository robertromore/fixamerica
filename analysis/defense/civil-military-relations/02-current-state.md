# Civil-Military Relations: Current State

## The Civil-Military Gap

The "gap" refers to the measurable divergence in experience, demographics, and political views between the military and the society it serves. This gap is a direct consequence of the All-Volunteer Force (AVF).

### Key Indicators of the Gap

| Metric | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Share of Population Serving** | < 0.5% | The smallest share of the population serving since before World War II. |
| **Share of Population who are Veterans** | ~5% | This number is declining as the large cohorts of Vietnam and Cold War veterans age. |
| **Veterans in Congress** | ~18% | A historic low, down from a peak of ~75% in the 1970s. Fewer civilian leaders have direct military experience. |
| **Recruits with a Military Parent** | ~30% | A significant portion of the force comes from military families. |
| **Recruits with any Family Member who Served** | ~80% | The military is increasingly becoming a "family business," isolated from the general population. |

## Public Trust and Perception

The public holds the military in high esteem, but this reverence exists alongside a profound lack of knowledge about the institution.

### Public Confidence in U.S. Institutions (2024)

| Institution | "A Great Deal" or "Quite a Lot" of Confidence |
|---|---|
| **The Military** | **60%** |
| Small Business | 57% |
| The Police | 43% |
| The Presidency | 26% |
| The Supreme Court | 23% |
| Newspapers | 15% |
| **Congress** | **8%** |

This "confidence gap" between the military and other institutions, especially Congress, is a defining feature of modern civil-military relations. While high trust is positive, some analysts worry it leads to a lack of critical public scrutiny.

## Politicization

There is growing concern about the erosion of the military's traditional non-partisanship.

- **Retired Officer Endorsements**: The 2016, 2020, and 2024 presidential elections saw an unprecedented number of retired generals and admirals publicly endorsing candidates, a break from historical norms.
- **Partisan Identification**: Surveys of military personnel show a growing partisan divide within the force that mirrors broader societal trends.
- **Use of Military as Political Props**: Both political parties have been criticized for using military personnel or settings as backdrops for partisan political events.

## Challenges from Emerging Technologies

The speed and complexity of new warfighting domains challenge traditional civilian oversight.

### AI and Autonomous Systems

- **Speed of Warfare**: An AI-driven conflict in which autonomous systems engage in combat at machine speed could unfold faster than a human decision-making cycle. This challenges the ability of the President or Congress to provide meaningful "in-the-loop" control.
- **"Expert Deference"**: The technical complexity of AI creates a risk that civilian leaders will simply defer to the judgment of military and technical experts, abdicating their oversight role.
- **Ethical Oversight**: The DoD has established ethical principles for AI, but there is no consensus on how to translate these principles into technical safeguards or how to ensure civilian oversight of autonomous targeting decisions.

### Cyber Warfare

- **Blurred Lines**: Cyber operations blur the lines between intelligence gathering and military action, and between foreign and domestic domains.
- **Covert Action**: Many cyber operations are conducted covertly, with limited visibility to Congress and the public, creating an accountability gap.
- **Private Sector Role**: Critical national infrastructure is largely owned and operated by the private sector. Defending it requires a complex civil-military-commercial partnership that is not well-defined. U.S. Cyber Command's "Defend Forward" strategy involves conducting operations on private networks in foreign countries, raising complex legal and oversight questions.

## Professional Military Education (PME)

PME institutions are responsible for teaching future military leaders about their role in a democracy.

- **Current Curriculum**: War colleges (e.g., Army War College, National War College) include courses on civil-military relations, ethics, and constitutional law.
- **Critiques**: Critics argue that PME has become too focused on operational planning and has not adequately adapted to teaching the complexities of great power competition, technological change, and the military's relationship with society. There is ongoing debate about whether PME sufficiently encourages critical thinking and the ability to offer candid, independent advice to civilian leaders.
