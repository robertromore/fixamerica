# Civil-Military Relations

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between the U.S. military and the civilian society and government it serves.

## Overview

The principle of civilian control over the military is a bedrock of American democracy. However, the health of this relationship is under strain from a widening "civil-military gap," the increasing politicization of the armed forces, and the rise of new technologies that challenge traditional models of oversight.

This analysis examines the current state of U.S. civil-military relations, including public trust in the military, the declining number of veterans in civilian leadership, and the ethical and oversight challenges posed by artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous weapons, and cyber warfare. It explores the root causes of the growing disconnect between the military and society and proposes solutions to ensure a healthy and sustainable relationship for the 21st century.
