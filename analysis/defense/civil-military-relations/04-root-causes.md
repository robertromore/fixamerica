# Civil-Military Relations: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current strains in U.S. civil-military relations are not the result of a single failure but of several long-term, interlocking trends. These include the structural separation of the military from society, the increasing complexity of warfare, and the erosion of shared norms in a polarized political environment.

## The All-Volunteer Force (AVF) and the "Warrior Caste"

The decision to end conscription in 1973 and create the AVF is the single most important root cause of the modern civil-military gap.

- **Professionalism at the Cost of Separation**: The AVF created a more professional, experienced, and effective military force. However, by making service a career choice rather than a common civic duty, it severed the primary link between the military and the broader society.
- **The Self-Reproducing Force**: With few external incentives to join, the military has increasingly relied on recruiting from within its own community. With ~80% of recruits having a family member who served, the force has become a "warrior caste"—a subculture with its own values, traditions, and experiences that are increasingly alien to the rest of the country.
- **Lack of Shared Experience**: With < 0.5% of the population serving, very few civilians—including political elites, journalists, and academics—have any direct experience with the military. This leads to a public that either romanticizes the military or misunderstands it, and a political class that lacks the experiential knowledge to conduct effective oversight.

## The Increasing Complexity and Speed of Warfare

As war becomes more technological, it becomes less accessible to civilian understanding and control.

- **The "Expertise" Gap**: Civilian leaders are, by design, generalists. They cannot be expected to have deep technical expertise in hypersonic missile design, quantum computing, or cyber network defense. This creates an "expertise gap" where they become heavily reliant on the advice of uniformed military and technical experts.
- **The Risk of Deference**: This expertise gap can lead to "expert deference," where civilian leaders feel unqualified to challenge the military's recommendations. This subtly erodes the principle of civilian control, as de facto decision-making power shifts to the experts.
- **The Challenge of Machine Speed**: AI-enabled and cyber warfare operate at speeds that defy human cognition. A traditional oversight model where a President or Congress deliberates before authorizing action is unworkable when a conflict can escalate in milliseconds. This creates immense pressure to pre-delegate authority to automated systems or to military commanders, further removing civilians from the decision loop.

## Political Polarization and the Erosion of Norms

The military, once seen as a bastion of non-partisanship, is being pulled into the country's broader political polarization.

- **The Politicization of the Officer Corps**: There is a growing trend of retired senior officers publicly endorsing political candidates and engaging in harsh partisan criticism. This damages the military's reputation for non-partisanship and creates the perception that military leadership is aligned with one political party.
- **The Public's Partisan Lens**: The public increasingly views the military through a partisan lens. Surveys show that trust in the military is becoming polarized, with one party's supporters expressing significantly higher confidence than the other's.
- **Politicians Using the Military**: Politicians from both parties increasingly use the military as a political symbol, either by attacking its leadership for being too "woke" or too "politicized," or by using troops in uniform as a backdrop for partisan events. This treats the military as just another political interest group rather than a neutral instrument of the state.

## The Rise of the Private Sector in Warfighting

- **From Supplier to Operator**: For most of history, the private sector built weapons and sold them to the government. Today, in domains like cyber and space, private companies are not just suppliers; they are integral to warfighting itself.
- **New Stakeholders**: Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and SpaceX own and operate critical digital and space infrastructure (e.g., cloud networks, satellite constellations) that the military depends on.
- **Accountability Gap**: This creates a new civil-military-commercial relationship that is not well understood or governed. How does Congress oversee a military operation that relies on a private company's network? Who is accountable when a commercial satellite used by the military is attacked? This diffusion of responsibility further complicates civilian oversight.
