# Maritime Security: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

The legislative framework for U.S. maritime security rests on a combination of statutory fleet requirements, defense authorization and appropriations acts, treaty obligations, and executive authority. The current framework is inadequate in several key respects: the 355-ship fleet requirement established in the FY2018 NDAA lacks enforcement mechanisms, the shipbuilding industrial base receives insufficient sustained investment, and the legal authorities governing freedom of navigation operations and allied cooperation are fragmented across multiple statutes and executive directives.

This document proposes two complementary federal bills:

1. **The Naval Modernization and Readiness Act** addresses the force structure and industrial base crisis by establishing a binding 355-ship floor, accelerating shipbuilding, reducing the maintenance backlog, and creating a framework for unmanned systems acquisition.
2. **The Maritime Security Cooperation Act** addresses the allied interoperability and strategic posture deficit by codifying naval cooperation programs, establishing FONOPS reporting requirements, and formalizing South China Sea policy.

Together, these bills aim to align statutory authority, appropriations, and strategic requirements for the maritime domain.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required. Congress possesses ample authority under existing constitutional provisions:

- **Raise and Support Armies / Provide and Maintain a Navy** (Article I, Section 8, Clauses 12-13): The most direct constitutional basis. Congress has explicit power to provide and maintain a Navy and to make rules for its regulation.
- **Commerce Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3): Supports provisions related to the shipbuilding industrial base, commercial shipping security, and maritime trade protection.
- **Declare War / Define Offenses Against the Law of Nations** (Article I, Section 8, Clauses 10-11): Supports provisions governing freedom of navigation operations and responses to maritime aggression.
- **Treaty Power** (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2): Supports the allied cooperation provisions, which implement and extend existing treaty commitments (U.S.-Philippines MDT, ANZUS, U.S.-Japan Security Treaty).
- **Necessary and Proper Clause** (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18): Supports the creation of new programs (workforce development, unmanned systems acquisition framework) as means of carrying out naval powers.

## Federal Legislation

### The Naval Modernization and Readiness Act

**Purpose**: To establish a binding 355-ship floor for the U.S. Navy battle force, accelerate shipbuilding production, eliminate the maintenance backlog at public shipyards, revitalize the shipbuilding workforce, and create an acquisition framework for unmanned naval systems.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **355-Ship Floor**: Establishes 355 battle force ships as the statutory minimum fleet size, with a compliance timeline and waiver provisions only for wartime emergency.
2. **Shipbuilding Acceleration**: Authorizes multi-year procurement for Virginia-class, Arleigh Burke Flight III, and Constellation-class programs at specified minimum rates.
3. **Maintenance Backlog Reduction**: Authorizes $25 billion over 10 years for the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan, appropriated separately from the shipbuilding account.
4. **Workforce Development**: Establishes a National Maritime Workforce Initiative with apprenticeship programs, training subsidies, and retention incentives.
5. **Unmanned Systems Acquisition**: Creates a rapid acquisition pathway for unmanned surface and undersea vessels, with accelerated testing and evaluation procedures.
6. **Reporting**: Requires the Secretary of the Navy to report annually on fleet size trajectory, shipbuilding delivery performance, maintenance on-time rates, and workforce metrics.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To strengthen the United States Navy through fleet modernization, shipbuilding
acceleration, maintenance backlog elimination, workforce development, and
unmanned systems acquisition.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Naval Modernization and Readiness Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The People's Republic of China has built the world's largest navy by
hull count, with over 370 vessels and a projected fleet of 400 by 2030.
(2) The United States Navy has approximately 296 battle force ships,
well below the 355-ship requirement established in Section 1025 of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.
(3) The United States shipbuilding industrial base has contracted from
over 30 major shipyards and 180,000 production workers during the Cold War
to 7 major shipyards and approximately 42,000 production workers today.
(4) The four public naval shipyards face an estimated $21 billion
maintenance backlog that degrades fleet readiness and extends ship
repair periods by 20 to 40 percent.
(5) The submarine industrial base cannot currently sustain the production
rate of 2 Virginia-class submarines per year required by the Navy's
shipbuilding plan and the AUKUS agreement.
(6) Unmanned naval systems offer the potential to expand fleet capacity
at lower cost, but acquisition pathways are not optimized for rapid
fielding.

transaction authority under section 4022 of title 10, United
States Code, to procure unmanned naval vessel prototypes in
quantities of up to 10 per class for operational experimentation.
(d) FLEET INTEGRATION PLAN.—Not later than 180 days after
enactment, the Chief of Naval Operations shall submit a plan to
Congress for the integration of unmanned naval vessels into fleet
operations, including:
    (1) Concept of operations for manned-unmanned teaming.
    (2) Command and control architecture.
    (3) Maintenance and logistics support requirements.
    (4) Training pipeline for unmanned systems operators.
```

**Explanation**: The bill addresses the three most critical maritime security deficits simultaneously. The 355-ship floor with a compliance timeline creates accountability that the existing statutory requirement lacks. Multi-year procurement and block buy authority reduce per-unit costs and provide industry with the production stability needed to invest in workforce and facilities. The SIOP authorization in a separate account prevents maintenance funding from being raided to pay for new construction. The workforce initiative addresses the root cause of shipbuilding delays. The unmanned systems provisions create a legal framework for integrating autonomous vessels into the fleet.

**Potential Challenges**:

- The $2.5 billion per year SIOP authorization represents a significant increase in Navy military construction spending and will face competition from other appropriations priorities.
- Multi-year procurement commitments limit Congress's year-to-year flexibility, which some appropriators resist.
- Designating unmanned vessels as battle force ships is controversial, as critics argue it inflates fleet numbers without proportional combat capability.

**Refinements**:

- Consider a "1+1" approach to unmanned battle force designation: for every 2 unmanned vessels designated as battle force, the equivalent of 1 manned ship must also be added, preventing unmanned ships from substituting for manned combatants.
- Include a GAO audit requirement every 3 years to assess SIOP cost and schedule performance.
- Add a provision requiring the Secretary to certify that unmanned vessels meet defined reliability thresholds before designating them as battle force ships.

### The Maritime Security Cooperation Act

**Purpose**: To strengthen allied naval interoperability, codify freedom of navigation policy, establish congressional reporting on South China Sea operations, and formalize maritime security cooperation programs with Indo-Pacific partners.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Allied Naval Interoperability Fund**: Establishes a dedicated fund for bilateral and multilateral naval interoperability programs, including communications systems, data-sharing agreements, combined exercises, and logistics cooperation.
2. **FONOPS Reporting**: Requires the Secretary of Defense to report annually to Congress on freedom of navigation operations conducted, including locations, legal basis, and any incidents.
3. **South China Sea Policy**: Codifies U.S. policy that China's nine-dash line claim has no legal basis, that the 2016 PCA ruling is binding, and that the U.S. will continue to exercise freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.
4. **Maritime Security Assistance**: Authorizes expanded security cooperation with the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Taiwan, including provision of excess defense articles, training, and maritime domain awareness capabilities.
5. **AUKUS Implementation**: Authorizes the transfer of Virginia-class submarines to Australia and related technology and provides congressional authorization for the SSN-AUKUS development program.
6. **UNCLOS Sense of Congress**: Expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to strengthen its legal standing in maritime disputes.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To enhance maritime security cooperation with allies and partners, codify
freedom of navigation policy, and strengthen the rules-based maritime order.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Maritime Security Cooperation Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The People's Republic of China has asserted unlawful maritime claims
across the South China Sea through the "nine-dash line," in violation of
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 award of
the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Republic of Philippines v.
The People's Republic of China.
(2) China has militarized artificial islands in the Spratly Islands
and uses maritime militia forces to coerce neighboring states.
(3) Freedom of navigation is a foundational principle of the
rules-based international order and a vital interest of the United States.
(4) Allied and partner navies in the Indo-Pacific collectively possess
significant capability that, when integrated with United States naval
forces, creates maritime power exceeding the sum of its parts.
(5) The AUKUS trilateral security partnership between the United
States, United Kingdom, and Australia represents a generational
investment in allied submarine capability and advanced military
technology cooperation.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION OPERATION.—The term "freedom of navigation
operation" means a naval operation conducted by the United States to
challenge excessive maritime claims by coastal states that are
inconsistent with international law as reflected in UNCLOS.
(2) NINE-DASH LINE.—The term "nine-dash line" means the demarcation
line used by the People's Republic of China to claim sovereignty or
sovereign rights over most of the South China Sea.
(3) INDO-PACIFIC PARTNER.—The term "Indo-Pacific partner" means
Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, India, Taiwan, New Zealand, Thailand,
and any other nation designated by the Secretary of State as a
maritime security partner in the Indo-Pacific region.

SEC. 4. ALLIED NAVAL INTEROPERABILITY FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established in the Treasury a fund to
be known as the "Allied Naval Interoperability Fund."
(b) PURPOSE.—Amounts in the Fund shall be available for:
    (1) Procurement and installation of interoperable communications
    and data-sharing systems between United States and allied naval
    forces.
    (2) Combined naval exercises and training programs.
    (3) Logistics cooperation agreements, including mutual logistics
    support, cross-servicing, and fuel sharing.
    (4) Combined maritime domain awareness systems, including shared
    satellite, unmanned, and undersea surveillance capabilities.
(c) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There is authorized to be
appropriated $300,000,000 per year for fiscal years 2027 through
2036 to the Fund.
(d) BILATERAL AGREEMENTS.—The Secretary of Defense, with the
concurrence of the Secretary of State, is authorized to enter into
bilateral or multilateral agreements to implement the programs
funded under this section.

SEC. 5. FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION REPORTING.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—Not later than March 1 of each year, the
Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense
committees and the Committees on Foreign Relations and Foreign
Affairs a report on freedom of navigation operations conducted
during the preceding fiscal year.
(b) CONTENTS.—The report shall include:
    (1) The number of freedom of navigation operations conducted,
    by geographic region.
    (2) The specific excessive maritime claims challenged by each
    operation.
    (3) The legal basis for each operation under international law
    as reflected in UNCLOS.
    (4) Any incidents involving foreign military or coast guard
    forces during freedom of navigation operations, including
    unsafe or unprofessional interactions.
    (5) An assessment of the effectiveness of freedom of navigation
    operations in preserving the rules-based maritime order.
(c) CLASSIFICATION.—The report required under subsection (a)
shall be submitted in unclassified form with a classified annex
as necessary.

(a) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the United States
that:
    (1) The nine-dash line claim of the People's Republic of China
    has no legal basis under international law.
    (2) The award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration of July 12,
    2016, in The Republic of Philippines v. The People's Republic
    of China (PCA Case No. 2013-19) is final and legally binding
    on the parties.
    (3) The United States will continue to conduct freedom of
    navigation operations in the South China Sea to challenge
    excessive maritime claims inconsistent with international law.
    (4) An armed attack on Philippine public vessels, aircraft, or
    armed forces, including its Coast Guard, in the South China
    Sea would invoke United States obligations under Article IV
    of the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and
    the Republic of the Philippines of August 30, 1951.
(b) PROHIBITION ON RECOGNITION.—No department or agency of the
United States Government may take any action that recognizes or
implies recognition of the nine-dash line claim of the People's
Republic of China or any related claims of sovereignty or
sovereign rights over features, waters, or resources in the
South China Sea that are inconsistent with international law.

SEC. 7. INDO-PACIFIC MARITIME SECURITY ASSISTANCE.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.—The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence
of the Secretary of State, is authorized to provide maritime
security assistance to Indo-Pacific partners, including:

Secretary shall give priority to:
    (1) The Philippines.
    (2) Vietnam.
    (3) Indonesia.
    (4) Taiwan.
    (5) Malaysia.
(c) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There is authorized to be
appropriated $200,000,000 per year for fiscal years 2027 through
2036 to carry out this section.

SEC. 8. AUKUS IMPLEMENTATION.

(a) SUBMARINE TRANSFER AUTHORIZATION.—The President is authorized
to transfer up to 5 Virginia-class attack submarines to the
Government of Australia pursuant to the AUKUS agreement, subject
to the following conditions:
    (1) Each transfer shall not occur until the Secretary of Defense
    certifies that the transfer will not reduce the United States
    attack submarine force below the level required to meet
    combatant commander requirements.
    (2) The Royal Australian Navy demonstrates the capability to
    operate, maintain, and support nuclear-powered submarines in
    compliance with the highest standards of nuclear safety and
    nonproliferation.
(b) SSN-AUKUS DEVELOPMENT.—The Secretary of the Navy is
authorized to participate in the joint development of a

industrial cooperation related to the program.
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 1 year after enactment and annually
thereafter, the Secretary of Defense shall report to Congress on
the status of AUKUS Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 implementation.

SEC. 9. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNCLOS.

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress that:
    (1) The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
    reflects customary international law and provides the
    authoritative legal framework for maritime rights and
    obligations.
    (2) The United States should ratify UNCLOS to strengthen its
    legal standing in maritime disputes and its ability to
    defend freedom of navigation.
    (3) Ratification would enhance, not diminish, United States
    sovereignty by providing legal tools to challenge excessive
    maritime claims by other states.
```

**Explanation**: This bill codifies policies and practices that currently rest on executive discretion and informal agreements. The FONOPS reporting requirement ensures congressional oversight of a sensitive military activity. The South China Sea policy section converts current U.S. positions into statutory policy, making them harder to reverse through executive action alone. The AUKUS provisions provide the legal authorization needed for submarine transfers and joint development. The UNCLOS sense-of-Congress provision is deliberately non-binding, reflecting the political reality that ratification remains difficult, while signaling congressional intent.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Codifying the mutual defense commitment to the Philippines in the South China Sea context could be seen as escalatory by Beijing.
- UNCLOS ratification faces opposition from senators concerned about sovereignty and international tribunal jurisdiction.
- AUKUS submarine transfers require that U.S. production capacity can sustain both American and Australian requirements, which is currently uncertain.
- Taiwan-related provisions must be carefully drafted to avoid violating the "One China" framework while still providing meaningful assistance.

**Refinements**:

- Add a classified assessment requirement before each submarine transfer to ensure U.S. force levels are protected.
- Include a provision for congressional notification 60 days before any FONOPS that carries elevated escalation risk, similar to the War Powers Resolution notification framework.
- Add a requirement for the Secretary of State to report on diplomatic efforts to negotiate a binding South China Sea Code of Conduct through ASEAN.

## State Model Legislation

Maritime security is primarily a federal responsibility, but state governments can contribute to the shipbuilding industrial base and maritime workforce.

### Maritime Workforce Development Act (State Model)

**Purpose**: To support the development of a skilled workforce for the naval shipbuilding industrial base through state-funded training programs and incentives.

**Applicability**: States with major shipyards or significant maritime industry presence (Virginia, Connecticut, Maine, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Alabama, Washington, Hawaii, California).

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Maritime Workforce
Development Act".

SECTION 2. MARITIME TRADES TRAINING PROGRAM.

(a) The [State Workforce Agency] shall establish a Maritime
Trades Training Program to prepare residents for employment
in the naval shipbuilding and ship repair industry.
(b) The Program shall include:
    (1) Accelerated certification courses in welding, pipefitting,
    electrical work, machining, and marine coatings at state
    community colleges and vocational institutions.
    (2) Partnerships with naval shipyards and defense contractors
    operating in the State for on-the-job training placements.
    (3) Tuition assistance of up to [amount] per student for
    eligible maritime trades courses.

SECTION 3. SHIPYARD WORKER HOUSING FUND.

(a) There is established in the State Treasury a Shipyard Worker
Housing Fund to provide grants to municipalities in shipyard-
adjacent communities for the construction or rehabilitation of
affordable workforce housing.
(b) There is appropriated [$X] per year for [X] years to the Fund.

SECTION 4. TAX INCENTIVES.

(a) A shipyard or ship repair facility operating in the State
shall be eligible for a credit against [state income/business
tax] equal to 25 percent of qualified training expenditures
for new employees in certified maritime trades.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Department of the Navy -- Unmanned Vessel Classification

**Existing Authority**: 10 U.S.C. 8062 (Composition of the Navy); Secretary of the Navy classification authority.

**Proposed Regulation**: The Secretary of the Navy should issue a formal instruction establishing classification criteria for unmanned surface and undersea vessels, including:

- **Battle Force Designation**: Criteria for designating unmanned vessels as battle force ships (displacement, endurance, combat capability thresholds).
- **Manning Standards**: Requirements for human oversight ratios (e.g., one operator per 3-5 unmanned platforms for near-autonomous operations).
- **Safety and Navigation**: Rules for unmanned vessel navigation consistent with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs).
- **Weapons Release Authority**: Policies governing autonomous weapons employment by unmanned vessels, including requirements for human authorization before lethal engagement.

### MARAD -- Shipbuilding Industrial Base Assessment

**Existing Authority**: 46 U.S.C. 50101 (Maritime Administration authority for industrial base assessment).

**Proposed Regulation**: The Maritime Administration should conduct biennial assessments of the naval shipbuilding industrial base, including workforce capacity, supplier base health, and infrastructure condition, and submit findings to Congress and the Secretary of the Navy.

## Legal Considerations

### UNCLOS and U.S. Non-Ratification

The United States has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982), despite successive administrations of both parties, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the State Department supporting ratification. The U.S. position is that most UNCLOS provisions reflect customary international law and are therefore binding on all states regardless of ratification.

However, non-ratification creates vulnerabilities:

- The U.S. cannot bring claims before UNCLOS dispute resolution mechanisms (e.g., the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea).
- China and other states can argue that the U.S. lacks standing to invoke UNCLOS provisions it has not formally accepted.
- Non-ratification undermines U.S. credibility in urging other states to comply with UNCLOS norms.

The Maritime Security Cooperation Act includes a non-binding sense-of-Congress provision encouraging ratification. A stronger approach would be a separate ratification resolution, but this faces persistent opposition in the Senate from sovereignty-concerned members.

### War Powers and Naval Operations

Freedom of navigation operations and Taiwan Strait transits are conducted under the President's commander-in-chief authority. These operations do not involve the introduction of U.S. forces "into hostilities" under the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541) and therefore do not trigger reporting requirements -- unless a hostile incident occurs.

However, sustained naval combat operations like those in the Red Sea against Houthi forces raise War Powers questions. The Biden administration relied on the President's Article II authority to defend U.S. vessels and commercial shipping, but some members of Congress argued that sustained operations required specific authorization. The legislation proposed here does not resolve this debate but establishes FONOPS reporting that provides Congress with greater situational awareness.

### Taiwan Relations Act and Strategic Ambiguity

The Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301-3316) commits the U.S. to provide Taiwan with defensive arms and to maintain the capacity to resist force or coercion that would jeopardize Taiwan's security. It does not contain a mutual defense commitment comparable to the NATO Article 5 obligation.

The Maritime Security Cooperation Act's provisions on maritime security assistance to Taiwan are carefully drafted to be consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and the existing "One China" policy framework. No provision in the proposed legislation constitutes a mutual defense commitment or recognition of Taiwan as a sovereign state separate from the "One China" framework.

### Posse Comitatus and Coast Guard Operations

The Coast Guard, as a military service within DHS (and transferable to the Navy in wartime under 14 U.S.C. 103), is not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. 1385) and can conduct law enforcement operations that the Navy cannot. This distinction is relevant to South China Sea operations, where Coast Guard cutters can perform law enforcement missions (counter-fishing, maritime interdiction) that complement Navy FONOPS without the same escalation risks.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Naval Modernization and Readiness Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Unmanned vessel inflation | The Secretary could designate large numbers of marginally capable unmanned vessels as battle force ships to meet the 355-ship floor without achieving actual combat capability. | High |
| SIOP fund raiding | Despite the separate account provision, Congress could reduce other Navy accounts in anticipation of SIOP funding, resulting in no net increase. | Medium |
| Waiver abuse | The presidential waiver for the 355-ship floor could be invoked repeatedly to avoid compliance with fleet size requirements. | Medium |
| Workforce gaming | Shipyard employers could cycle workers through training programs to claim subsidies without achieving long-term retention. | Low |
| Multi-year procurement lock-in | Long-term procurement contracts for underperforming ship classes (e.g., if the Constellation-class continues to experience problems) could lock in procurement of ships that do not meet requirements. | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No funding mandate | The bill authorizes but does not appropriate. Without corresponding appropriations, the authorizations are hollow. | Separation of authorization and appropriation in Congress. |
| Does not address crew shortfalls | Building more ships requires more sailors to crew them. The bill does not address Navy end-strength or retention. | Focus on industrial base rather than personnel policy. |
| No enforcement mechanism for 355-ship floor | There are no consequences if the Secretary fails to meet the timeline, beyond reporting requirements. | Constitutional limits on Congress mandating executive action. |
| Columbia-class crowding out | The bill does not resolve the tension between Columbia-class and Virginia-class production at shared shipyard facilities. | Industrial base capacity constraints that legislation alone cannot solve. |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Add a provision requiring that unmanned vessels designated as battle force ships must pass a Fleet Operational Readiness Assessment demonstrating autonomous endurance, combat lethality, and reliability thresholds before designation.
2. Include appropriations language in each annual defense appropriations act specifying that SIOP funding is additive to, not a substitute for, baseline Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy funding.
3. Limit the presidential waiver to a single 2-year period, with any extension requiring congressional approval by joint resolution.
4. Require 5-year retention commitments as a condition of workforce development subsidies, with clawback provisions for employers who do not meet retention targets.
5. Include an off-ramp provision allowing the Secretary to reduce multi-year procurement quantities by up to 25% with 180 days' notice to Congress if a ship class fails to meet cost or performance thresholds.
6. Add a companion provision addressing Navy end-strength growth and retention incentives to ensure the fleet can be adequately crewed.

### Maritime Security Cooperation Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| FONOPS reporting evasion | The Secretary could classify the entire FONOPS report, limiting congressional and public oversight. | Medium |
| South China Sea policy ambiguity | The prohibition on recognizing the nine-dash line is clear, but gray-zone actions (e.g., bilateral fisheries agreements that implicitly acknowledge Chinese jurisdiction) might not be covered. | Medium |
| AUKUS certification manipulation | The Secretary could certify that submarine transfers do not reduce force levels below requirements even when requirements are set artificially low. | Medium |
| Maritime assistance diversion | Security assistance funds could be diverted to non-maritime programs through broad interpretation of "maritime security." | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| UNCLOS provision is non-binding | The sense-of-Congress on UNCLOS ratification has no legal force and is unlikely to change the Senate calculus. | Persistent sovereignty concerns among senators. |
| Does not address Taiwan Strait deterrence directly | The bill provides maritime security assistance to Taiwan but does not clarify U.S. defense commitments. | Political impossibility of codifying a defense commitment without abandoning strategic ambiguity. |
| No mechanism to compel allied burden-sharing | The interoperability fund provides U.S. resources but does not require allies to match contributions. | Limits of bilateral legislation on allied sovereign decisions. |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require that the FONOPS annual report include an unclassified summary with sufficient detail for meaningful public and congressional oversight, with only operational security-sensitive specifics in the classified annex.
2. Define "recognition" in the nine-dash line prohibition broadly to include any executive agreement, memorandum of understanding, or diplomatic communication that implies acceptance of Chinese jurisdictional claims in the South China Sea.
3. Require that the submarine transfer certification be based on a force-level assessment conducted by an independent body (e.g., the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, or GAO) rather than the Secretary alone.
4. Add a matching fund requirement for the Allied Naval Interoperability Fund: U.S. contributions to specific bilateral programs should be contingent on the partner nation committing at least 50% of the U.S. contribution from its own resources.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Authorization-appropriation gap | Include a legislative finding that the authorizations in these bills represent the minimum funding necessary for national security and urge the appropriations committees to fully fund them. |
| Interagency coordination | Require the National Security Council to designate a Senior Director for Maritime Security responsible for coordinating implementation across DoD, State, DHS, and the intelligence community. |
| Industrial base fragility | Establish a Maritime Industrial Base Council (modeled on the Defense Industrial Base Council) to identify and address supply chain vulnerabilities on a rolling basis. |
| Escalation management | Require the Secretary of Defense to maintain updated escalation response options for South China Sea and Taiwan Strait incidents and brief congressional leadership quarterly. |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The Allied Naval Interoperability Fund and Maritime Security Assistance authorizations should be reauthorized every 5 years, with a GAO assessment of program effectiveness 6 months before expiration.
- The SIOP authorization should be reviewed at the 5-year mark, with an independent cost estimate for the remaining 5 years.
- The 355-ship floor should be reviewed by the Secretary of the Navy every 4 years as part of the Quadrennial Defense Review or its successor process, with recommendations to Congress on whether the number should be adjusted based on threat assessment and force design evolution.
