# Maritime Security: History

## The Foundations of American Sea Power

### Early Republic and the Birth of the Navy (1775-1890)

The United States was born as a maritime nation. The Continental Navy was established in 1775 to challenge British sea power, and the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power "to provide and maintain a Navy" (Article I, Section 8). The early Republic's first foreign crises were maritime -- the Quasi-War with France (1798-1800) and the Barbary Wars (1801-1815) -- establishing the principle that the U.S. would use naval force to protect commerce and assert freedom of navigation.

For most of the 19th century, however, the U.S. Navy remained a coastal defense and commerce raiding force, far inferior to the Royal Navy. The Civil War (1861-1865) demonstrated the transformative potential of industrial naval technology -- ironclads, mines, and submarines -- but the postwar fleet was allowed to deteriorate into obsolescence.

### The Mahanian Revolution (1890-1914)

The modern American approach to maritime security was shaped by Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose *The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660-1783* (1890) argued that national greatness depended on control of the seas through a powerful battle fleet, overseas bases, and a strong merchant marine. Mahan's ideas directly influenced the naval buildup under Presidents Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt.

Key developments:

- **1898 Spanish-American War**: The destruction of Spanish fleets at Manila Bay and Santiago demonstrated American naval capability and resulted in the acquisition of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico -- establishing the U.S. as a Pacific and Caribbean power.
- **1907 Great White Fleet**: Roosevelt's deployment of 16 battleships on a global circumnavigation demonstrated American naval reach and signaled the U.S. as a world power.
- **1914 Panama Canal**: The completion of the canal allowed rapid fleet movement between the Atlantic and Pacific, a strategic advantage that remains relevant today.

### World War I and the Interwar Period (1914-1941)

World War I saw the U.S. Navy deploy to European waters to counter the German submarine threat, convoying troops and supplies across the Atlantic. The postwar Washington Naval Treaty (1922) imposed limits on capital ship construction, establishing a 5:5:3 ratio among the U.S., Britain, and Japan. This treaty system collapsed in the 1930s as Japan withdrew and began an aggressive naval buildup.

The interwar period saw critical doctrinal development:

- **War Plan Orange**: The Navy's strategic plan for war with Japan, which envisioned an island-hopping campaign across the Pacific -- remarkably prescient of the actual course of World War II.
- **Carrier Aviation**: The development of aircraft carriers as offensive weapons, pioneered at exercises like Fleet Problem IX (1929), which demonstrated the vulnerability of battleships to air attack.

## The Pacific War and the Birth of Global Naval Dominance (1941-1945)

### Decisive Naval Campaigns

World War II transformed the U.S. Navy from a major regional force into the dominant global navy, a position it has held ever since.

- **Pearl Harbor (December 1941)**: Japan's surprise attack destroyed much of the Pacific battleship fleet but missed the carriers, which became the basis for the subsequent counteroffensive.
- **Battle of Midway (June 1942)**: The decisive naval engagement of the Pacific War. U.S. carriers sank four Japanese carriers, shifting the strategic balance permanently. This battle validated the carrier as the capital ship of the modern era.
- **Guadalcanal Campaign (1942-1943)**: A grueling naval and ground campaign that demonstrated the importance of sea control for amphibious operations.
- **Submarine Campaign**: U.S. submarines destroyed approximately 55% of Japan's merchant fleet and 30% of its naval vessels, strangling Japan's island economy. This campaign demonstrated the strategic value of undersea warfare -- a lesson that resonates in current planning against China.
- **Leyte Gulf (October 1944)**: The largest naval battle in history, resulting in the destruction of the Japanese fleet as an effective fighting force.

### Industrial Mobilization

The U.S. shipbuilding industrial base achieved extraordinary production during the war:

- 18 fleet carriers and 86 escort carriers constructed
- Over 200 submarines built
- Thousands of destroyers, destroyer escorts, amphibious ships, and auxiliaries
- At peak production, a Liberty ship could be built in 42 days

This industrial capacity, now drastically diminished, is frequently cited as a benchmark for what a national mobilization could achieve.

## Cold War Maritime Strategy (1945-1991)

### Containment at Sea

The Cold War Navy was built around two missions: nuclear deterrence through submarine-launched ballistic missiles and sea control to ensure reinforcement of NATO allies in Europe.

- **1950s-1960s**: The Navy transitioned to nuclear propulsion (USS *Nautilus*, 1954) and developed the Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile, establishing the sea-based leg of the nuclear triad.
- **1962 Cuban Missile Crisis**: The naval quarantine of Cuba demonstrated the utility of naval power for coercive diplomacy short of war. The crisis also revealed the dangers of naval confrontation between nuclear powers.
- **Vietnam War (1964-1975)**: Carrier aviation played a central role in the air campaign against North Vietnam. Riverine and coastal operations demonstrated the Navy's versatility, but the war also highlighted the limitations of sea power against a land-based insurgency.

### The Maritime Strategy (1980s)

The Reagan-era "Maritime Strategy" represented the most ambitious articulation of American sea power doctrine during the Cold War.

- **600-Ship Navy**: The Reagan administration pursued a buildup to 600 ships, including 15 carrier battle groups, to achieve maritime superiority over the Soviet Navy.
- **Forward Strategy**: The Maritime Strategy called for offensive operations in Soviet home waters -- the Norwegian Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Barents Sea -- to destroy the Soviet ballistic missile submarine force and divert Soviet resources from the Central European front.
- **Secretary of the Navy John Lehman** championed the buildup and the strategy, arguing that naval superiority was essential to winning the Cold War without fighting it.

The fleet peaked at 594 ships in 1987.

## Post-Cold War Drawdown and Transformation (1991-2008)

### The Peace Dividend

The collapse of the Soviet Union eliminated the U.S. Navy's primary adversary. The fleet was drawn down sharply through the 1990s, from 594 ships in 1987 to approximately 280 by 2007.

- **"From the Sea" (1992)**: The Navy's post-Cold War strategic concept shifted focus from open-ocean warfare against the Soviet Navy to power projection from the sea against regional adversaries.
- **Transformation Programs**: The Navy pursued ambitious but often troubled transformation programs, including:
    - **DD(X)/Zumwalt-class (DDG-1000)**: Originally planned as a 32-ship class, cut to 3 due to cost growth (over $8 billion per hull). The Zumwalt's advanced gun system was cancelled after ammunition costs reached $800,000 per round.
    - **Littoral Combat Ship (LCS)**: Intended as a low-cost, modular combatant for operations in contested coastal waters. The program has been widely criticized for limited survivability, unreliable propulsion, and the failure of its modular mission package concept.
    - **Seawolf-class (SSN-21)**: A Cold War-era submarine designed for deep-water anti-submarine warfare. Only 3 were built due to costs exceeding $3 billion per hull.

### Operations Tempo

Despite the drawdown, the post-Cold War Navy maintained an extraordinarily high operational tempo:

- **1991 Gulf War**: Carrier strikes, Tomahawk cruise missile launches, and mine countermeasures during Operation Desert Storm.
- **1995-1999 Balkans**: Carrier aviation and cruise missile strikes in Bosnia and Kosovo.
- **2001-2021 War on Terror**: Sustained carrier and amphibious operations in support of Afghanistan and Iraq, including Maritime Security Operations in the Persian Gulf and Horn of Africa.

## The Pivot to the Pacific and Great Power Competition (2008-Present)

### Strategic Reorientation

The recognition that China's military modernization posed a long-term challenge to U.S. maritime dominance prompted a strategic reorientation beginning in the late 2000s.

- **2011 "Pivot to Asia"**: The Obama administration announced a strategic rebalance to the Indo-Pacific, including plans to station 60% of naval assets in the Pacific by 2020.
- **2017 National Security Strategy**: Identified "great power competition" with China and Russia as the primary challenge, displacing counterterrorism as the organizing principle of U.S. defense strategy.
- **2018 National Defense Strategy**: Labeled China as a "strategic competitor" and directed the Department of Defense to prioritize preparations for high-end conflict.
- **2022 National Defense Strategy**: Identified China as the "pacing challenge" -- the threat against which U.S. force development should be measured.

### South China Sea Confrontations

- **2009**: China formally submitted its "nine-dash line" claim to the United Nations, asserting sovereignty over most of the South China Sea.
- **2013-2016**: China conducted massive land reclamation on seven features in the Spratly Islands, creating over 3,200 acres of artificial land and constructing military facilities including airstrips, hangars, radar, and missile launchers.
- **2016 Arbitral Ruling**: The Permanent Court of Arbitration in *Philippines v. China* ruled that China's nine-dash line claim had no legal basis under UNCLOS and that China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights. China rejected the ruling as "null and void."
- **2018-Present**: Escalating confrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard/navy vessels at Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, with the U.S. repeatedly affirming its mutual defense commitment to the Philippines.

### Taiwan Strait Escalation

- **2022**: Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan triggered an unprecedented Chinese military response, including large-scale naval and air exercises, missile launches over Taiwan, and a simulated blockade that crossed the Taiwan Strait median line.
- **2023-2025**: PLA activity around Taiwan has remained elevated, with regular incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ and increased naval patrols. U.S. Navy transits of the Taiwan Strait continue monthly.

### Red Sea Operations (2023-Present)

Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea beginning in November 2023 forced the U.S. Navy to conduct sustained combat operations for the first time since World War II to defend commercial shipping.

- **Operation Prosperity Guardian**: A multinational maritime security operation to protect commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
- **Operation Poseidon Archer**: U.S. and UK strikes on Houthi launch sites and weapons storage.
- The operations demonstrated both the continued indispensability of U.S. naval power and the strain of maintaining presence across multiple theaters simultaneously. U.S. destroyers expended hundreds of interceptor missiles, raising questions about munitions stocks and the cost-exchange ratio of using multi-million-dollar missiles against low-cost drones.

### AUKUS and Allied Integration

In September 2021, the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia announced the AUKUS trilateral security partnership:

- **Pillar 1**: Australia will acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines, beginning with the purchase of 3-5 Virginia-class boats from the U.S. in the 2030s, followed by a jointly developed SSN-AUKUS design.
- **Pillar 2**: Cooperation on advanced capabilities including hypersonics, electronic warfare, autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, and undersea technology.

AUKUS represents the most significant expansion of allied submarine cooperation since the Cold War and a major commitment to collective deterrence in the Indo-Pacific.
