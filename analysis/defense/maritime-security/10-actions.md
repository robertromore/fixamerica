# Maritime Security: Actions

## Overview

Maritime security may seem distant from the daily lives of most Americans, but the U.S. Navy's ability to maintain open sea lanes, deter aggression, and sustain a credible shipbuilding industrial base depends on informed public engagement and sustained political will. Citizens, whether they live on the coast or in the heartland, have a role to play.

## Individual Actions

### Stay Informed

- **Follow naval affairs**: Read publications such as the U.S. Naval Institute's *Proceedings*, *War on the Rocks*, and the Center for International Maritime Security (CIMSEC) for accessible analysis of maritime security issues.
- **Track the shipbuilding budget**: The Navy's annual shipbuilding plan and the Congressional Budget Office's analysis of that plan are publicly available. Understanding the gap between requirements and funding is the first step to advocacy.
- **Monitor the South China Sea**: The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) at CSIS provides real-time tracking of developments in the South China Sea, including island construction, military deployments, and confrontations.

### Contact Elected Officials

- **Advocate for shipbuilding investment**: Write or call your members of Congress to support full funding of the Navy's shipbuilding plan, the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan, and workforce development programs. Emphasize that maritime security is a jobs issue -- the shipbuilding supply chain spans 48+ states.
- **Support the 355-ship Navy**: Express support for maintaining the statutory 355-ship fleet requirement and funding the industrial base to achieve it.
- **Ask about readiness**: Urge your representatives on the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees to prioritize ship maintenance and crew training, not just new construction.

### Support the Naval Workforce

- **Promote skilled trades**: If you work in education or workforce development, advocate for vocational and technical training programs in welding, pipefitting, electrical work, and other trades critical to shipbuilding.
- **Mentorship and recruitment**: If you are a veteran or work in the maritime industry, mentor young people considering careers in shipbuilding or naval service.

## Community Actions

### Support Shipyard Communities

- If you live in a shipyard-adjacent community (Newport News, VA; Groton, CT; Bath, ME; Pascagoula, MS; Bremerton, WA; Pearl Harbor, HI; San Diego, CA), support local workforce development initiatives, housing programs for shipyard workers, and community organizations that serve military families.
- Advocate for state and local investments in infrastructure (roads, schools, housing) that make shipyard communities attractive to skilled workers.

### Host or Attend Educational Events

- Invite speakers from naval affairs think tanks (CSIS, CSBA, Hudson Institute, Naval Institute) to community forums, universities, or civic organizations.
- Support Navy Week events and Fleet Week visits to your city, which build public understanding of naval operations and military service.

## Advocacy and Organizational Engagement

### Key Organizations

| Organization | Focus | Website |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| U.S. Naval Institute (USNI) | Professional naval education and thought | usni.org |
| Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) | Indo-Pacific security policy | csis.org |
| Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) | Defense strategy and force design | csbaonline.org |
| Center for International Maritime Security (CIMSEC) | Maritime security analysis | cimsec.org |
| Navy League of the United States | Citizen support for naval services | navyleague.org |
| Surface Navy Association | Surface warfare community support | navysna.org |
| Submarine League | Submarine force advocacy | navalsubleague.org |
| Shipbuilders Council of America | Shipbuilding industry advocacy | shipbuilders.org |
| Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) | South China Sea monitoring | amti.csis.org |
| Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) | Foreign policy and national security | cfr.org |

### Attend Congressional Hearings

- The Senate Armed Services Committee's Seapower Subcommittee and the House Armed Services Committee's Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee hold regular hearings on Navy shipbuilding, fleet readiness, and maritime strategy. These hearings are open to the public and livestreamed. Attending or watching demonstrates citizen interest and engagement.

### Submit Public Comments

- When the Navy or Department of Defense solicits public comment on environmental impact statements for base construction, shipyard expansion, or training exercises, submit informed comments that balance environmental stewardship with national security requirements.

## Professional and Academic Actions

### For Researchers and Academics

- Conduct and publish research on naval strategy, shipbuilding economics, maritime law, and Indo-Pacific security. Peer-reviewed analysis informs policy.
- Participate in wargaming exercises hosted by the Naval War College, RAND, CSIS, and other institutions. Wargaming has been a critical tool for testing strategies and identifying capability gaps since the Navy began the practice in the 1880s.

### For Legal Professionals

- Study and write about UNCLOS, freedom of navigation, and the legal dimensions of the South China Sea disputes. The legal arguments for the rules-based maritime order need skilled advocates.
- Advocate for U.S. ratification of UNCLOS, which would strengthen America's legal standing to challenge China's claims.

### For Engineers and Technologists

- Consider careers in naval engineering, shipbuilding, autonomous systems, and defense technology. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Office of Naval Research (ONR), and defense contractors all face workforce shortages in technical fields.
- Contribute to open-source research on autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, and marine robotics that could advance naval capabilities.

## What Not to Do

- **Do not advocate for specific weapon systems or platforms without understanding the tradeoffs.** Maritime security is a system-of-systems problem; advocating for more carriers at the expense of submarines, or vice versa, can be counterproductive.
- **Do not treat maritime security as a partisan issue.** Strong naval capability has historically enjoyed bipartisan support. Frame advocacy in terms of national interest, economic security, and alliance commitments, not partisan politics.
- **Do not dismiss allied contributions.** The U.S. cannot maintain maritime security alone. Supporting allied naval capabilities is not a sign of American weakness but a force multiplier.
