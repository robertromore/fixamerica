# Maritime Security: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the U.S. maritime security deficit requires action across six interconnected domains: fleet modernization and force design, shipbuilding industrial base revitalization, unmanned systems integration, allied interoperability, asymmetric capabilities, and strategic posture. No single reform is sufficient; the challenge demands a coordinated approach that accepts tradeoffs and resists the temptation to fund everything at current levels while hoping the threat will wait.

## 1. Fleet Modernization and Force Design

### Adopt a Hybrid Fleet Architecture

The Navy should move beyond the binary choice of "fewer exquisite ships" vs. "more cheap ships" and adopt a hybrid architecture that combines high-end manned platforms with large numbers of unmanned and optionally manned vessels.

**Key Elements:**

- **Maintain 11 aircraft carriers** but extend the retirement date of Nimitz-class carriers to bridge the gap until Ford-class production matures. Carriers remain essential for missions short of high-end war and for allied assurance.
- **Accelerate Virginia-class submarine production to 2.0 per year** by 2030 through targeted workforce and supply chain investments. The submarine force is the single most important asymmetric advantage the U.S. holds over China.
- **Procure Constellation-class frigates** at a rate of 2 per year once the lead ship demonstrates acceptable performance. Frigates provide distributed surface combatant capacity at roughly one-third the cost of a destroyer.
- **Deploy Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs)** as distributed missile magazines, each carrying 16-32 vertical launch cells. Target 30+ LUSVs operational by 2035.
- **Deploy Extra-Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (XLUUVs)** for mine warfare, ISR, and payload delivery. The Orca XLUUV program should be accelerated.
- **Invest in Light Amphibious Warships (LAW)** to support Marine Corps Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations. Procure 25-35 LAWs to enable distributed operations across Pacific island chains.

### Implement Distributed Maritime Operations

Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) is the Navy's warfighting concept for operating in a contested A2/AD environment. Full implementation requires:

- Fielding the Naval Operational Architecture (NOA) -- the network that enables disaggregated forces to share targeting data and coordinate fires.
- Equipping surface combatants, submarines, unmanned systems, and Marine Corps units with long-range anti-ship missiles (LRASM, SM-6, Maritime Strike Tomahawk).
- Training and exercising distributed formations at scale, not just in tabletop exercises but in at-sea events involving dozens of platforms.

## 2. Shipbuilding Industrial Base Revitalization

### Workforce Development

- **Establish a National Maritime Workforce Initiative**: A federally funded program, modeled on the CHIPS Act workforce provisions, to recruit, train, and retain shipyard workers. This should include:
    - Partnerships with community colleges and vocational schools in shipyard regions to create accelerated certification programs for welders, pipefitters, electricians, and other trades.
    - Apprenticeship subsidies for shipyard employers, covering 50% of training costs for the first two years.
    - Retention bonuses for skilled workers who remain in the shipbuilding workforce for 5+ years.
    - Housing assistance in high-cost-of-living areas near shipyards (Newport News, Groton, Bremerton, Pearl Harbor).

- **Expand the Submarine Industrial Base (SIB) Workforce**: Specifically target the recruitment of 14,000+ additional workers needed across the submarine supplier network by 2030, as identified by the Submarine Industrial Base Council.

### Infrastructure Investment

- **Fully fund the Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan (SIOP)**: The Navy's 20-year, $21 billion plan to modernize the four public shipyards. Congress should appropriate SIOP funding above the Navy's shipbuilding topline to avoid competition between new construction and infrastructure.
- **Expand dry dock capacity**: Build at least 2 new dry docks at public shipyards capable of servicing Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarines.
- **Invest in private shipyard expansion**: Provide capital grants or accelerated depreciation for private shipyards investing in new facilities, digital shipbuilding technologies, and modular construction capabilities.

### Procurement Reform

- **Adopt multi-year procurement (MYP) and block buy contracts**: These contract structures reduce per-unit costs by 10-15% by providing production stability. Extend MYP authority to the Virginia-class, Arleigh Burke-class, and Constellation-class programs.
- **Stabilize the shipbuilding plan**: The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan changes annually, undermining industry confidence. Congress should establish a binding 5-year shipbuilding commitment, updated biennially.
- **Streamline acquisition**: Reduce the time from requirements definition to contract award. The Constellation-class frigate took over a decade from initial concept to lead ship construction start.

## 3. Unmanned Systems Integration

### Surface Unmanned Systems

- **Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV)**: A 200-300 foot autonomous vessel designed to carry vertical launch cells for offensive and defensive missiles. The Navy should complete prototyping and begin low-rate production by 2028.
- **Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel (MUSV)**: A smaller autonomous vessel for ISR, electronic warfare, and communications relay. The Sea Hunter/Sea Hawk demonstrators have proven the concept; operational deployment should begin by 2027.

### Undersea Unmanned Systems

- **Extra-Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV)**: The Boeing Orca program, designed for mine warfare, ISR, and payload delivery. Despite development delays, the XLUUV offers transformative potential for undersea distributed operations.
- **Snakehead LDUUV**: A submarine-launched Large Displacement Unmanned Undersea Vehicle for ISR and payload delivery in contested waters.

### Aerial Unmanned Systems

- **MQ-25 Stingray**: The carrier-based unmanned tanker that will extend the range of the carrier air wing by refueling F/A-18s and F-35Cs in flight. This is the Navy's highest-priority unmanned aviation program.
- **Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA)**: Autonomous or semi-autonomous unmanned combat aircraft that operate alongside manned fighters. The Navy should participate in the Air Force's CCA program to develop carrier-capable variants.

### Integration Challenges

- **Command and Control**: Unmanned systems require reliable, jam-resistant communications and autonomous decision-making algorithms. The Navy must invest in AI-enabled autonomy that allows unmanned platforms to operate in communications-denied environments.
- **Trust and Acceptance**: The fleet must develop trust in unmanned systems through progressive integration -- starting with ISR and logistics missions before moving to combat.
- **Maintenance and Logistics**: Unmanned systems require maintenance infrastructure, trained operators, and logistics support. The Navy must plan for these requirements rather than treating unmanned platforms as "free."

## 4. Allied Interoperability

### Deepen AUKUS Implementation

- **Accelerate Pillar 1**: Ensure that the Virginia-class submarine transfers to Australia proceed on schedule in the early 2030s. This requires protecting Virginia-class production capacity from being crowded out by Columbia-class demands.
- **Expand Pillar 2**: Accelerate joint development of autonomous undersea vehicles, hypersonic weapons, and electronic warfare capabilities. Establish joint test ranges and interoperability standards.
- **SSN-AUKUS**: Invest in the joint design of the next-generation nuclear attack submarine that will replace both the Virginia-class and the Astute-class in U.S., UK, and Australian service.

### Strengthen the U.S.-Japan Naval Alliance

- **Combined Fleet Headquarters**: Establish a standing combined U.S.-Japan fleet headquarters that can plan and execute integrated operations in peacetime and transition seamlessly to wartime command.
- **Interoperable Aegis Networks**: Fully integrate U.S. and Japanese Aegis Baseline 9/10 systems to enable cooperative engagement capability, allowing one ship to fire and another to guide missiles.
- **Joint Submarine Operations**: Expand combined submarine exercises and develop shared undersea surveillance networks.

### Build a Pacific Maritime Coalition

- **Quad Naval Cooperation**: Deepen naval cooperation among the U.S., Japan, Australia, and India through the Malabar exercise series and operational coordination in the Indian Ocean.
- **Philippines Basing**: Maximize the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) sites, pre-positioning equipment and building infrastructure to support distributed operations in the northern Philippines -- closest to Taiwan and the South China Sea.
- **Southeast Asian Partnerships**: Provide maritime security assistance (training, equipment, intelligence sharing) to Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore to build their capacity to monitor and contest Chinese encroachment.

## 5. Asymmetric Capabilities

### Mine Warfare

- **Develop next-generation naval mines**: Invest in smart, autonomous mines that can distinguish between military and commercial targets, self-activate and deactivate on command, and be deployed by submarines, aircraft, and unmanned systems.
- **Revitalize mine countermeasures**: The cancellation of the LCS mine countermeasures module left a critical gap. Invest in unmanned mine countermeasures systems that can operate ahead of the fleet in contested waters.
- **Stockpile offensive mines**: Maintain sufficient quantities of Quickstrike and next-generation mines to deny key chokepoints to adversary naval forces in a conflict.

### Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles

- **Accelerate LRASM procurement**: The AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile is the Navy's primary anti-ship weapon for surface combatants and aircraft. Increase procurement rates and develop submarine-launched variants.
- **Maritime Strike Tomahawk**: The modernized Tomahawk with anti-ship capability provides a long-range (1,000+ nm) anti-ship option from surface combatants and submarines.
- **SM-6 Anti-Ship Mode**: The SM-6 Standard Missile has a secondary anti-ship capability. Maximizing SM-6 production provides both air defense and surface warfare capability from a single weapon.

### Undersea Warfare

- **Maintain the acoustic advantage**: Invest in submarine quieting technology to ensure that U.S. submarines remain significantly quieter than Chinese boats. This advantage is the foundation of undersea dominance.
- **Expand the SOSUS/IUSS network**: Modernize and expand the undersea surveillance network in the Western Pacific to detect and track Chinese submarines.
- **Submarine-launched unmanned systems**: Equip Virginia-class submarines with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) and develop submarine-launched UUVs for ISR, mine warfare, and decoy operations.

### Marine Corps Stand-In Forces

- **Field the Marine Littoral Regiment (MLR)**: Complete the fielding of three Marine Littoral Regiments equipped with Naval Strike Missiles, organic ISR, and the ability to operate from austere Pacific island locations.
- **Secure basing access**: Negotiate basing agreements with Pacific island nations (Palau, Micronesia, Marshall Islands) to enable EABO.

## 6. Strategic Posture

### Clarify Deterrence Signaling

- **Taiwan deterrence**: Without abandoning strategic ambiguity, the U.S. should increase the credibility of deterrence through visible preparations -- pre-positioning munitions on Guam and Pacific bases, accelerating Pacific infrastructure investments, and conducting large-scale combined exercises that demonstrate the ability to defend Taiwan.
- **South China Sea**: Sustain or increase FONOPS tempo and expand multilateral FONOPS with allied navies to demonstrate collective commitment to the rules-based order.
- **Red Sea**: Transition Red Sea security operations to a coalition framework that does not disproportionately consume U.S. Navy assets needed for the Indo-Pacific.

### Munitions Industrial Base

- **Increase missile production**: The Red Sea operations revealed dangerously low stocks of key interceptor missiles (SM-2, SM-6). The DoD should fully fund the Navy's unfunded priority list for munitions procurement and invest in expanding missile production lines at Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and other manufacturers.
- **Stockpile for conflict**: Build and maintain munitions stockpiles sufficient for at least 30 days of high-intensity combat in the Western Pacific, as recommended by CSBA and other analysts.
