# Maritime Security: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes U.S. maritime security through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Maritime security is one of the few defense policy areas that has historically enjoyed broad bipartisan support -- virtually all perspectives agree that the U.S. needs a strong Navy. The disagreements are about *how strong*, *what composition*, *at what cost*, and *with what strategic purpose*. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of February 2026)

| Bill/Amendment | Type | Current Status | Last Action |
|----------------|------|----------------|-------------|
| *Naval Modernization and Readiness Act* | *Federal* | *Proposed* | *Drafted for 119th Congress* |
| *Maritime Security Cooperation Act* | *Federal* | *Proposed* | *Drafted for 119th Congress* |

*Note: Status reflects 119th Congress. See [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md) for full bill text.*

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment -- conservatives genuinely support naval power as a core national security priority and a traditional government function. |
| Principle consistency | Generally consistent. Support for strong defense and military spending aligns with stated principles, though tension exists with fiscal restraint goals. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on fleet size and shipbuilding; some variation on willingness to increase the defense topline vs. reallocating within the existing budget. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low. Conservatives generally do not oppose naval spending to deny Democrats a win; defense is treated as above partisanship. |

**Justification:** Conservatives have been among the most consistent advocates for naval power since the Reagan era. The Heritage Foundation's annual *Index of U.S. Military Strength* consistently rates the Navy as under-resourced. The principal internal tension is between defense hawks who support topline increases and fiscal hawks who want naval modernization funded through cuts elsewhere.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Heritage Foundation, *Index of U.S. Military Strength*, 2024: Rates the Navy as "weak" and calls for accelerated shipbuilding.
- Republican Party platforms since 2016 have consistently called for a 355-ship Navy or larger.
- Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), ranking member/chair of Senate Armed Services Committee, has been a vocal advocate for a 355+ ship fleet.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement that the Navy is too small and that China's naval buildup is the defining threat. May emphasize threat more starkly than project analysis. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree on shipbuilding industrial base decline and insufficient defense spending. Less inclined to blame carrier-centric institutional culture; more likely to blame insufficient overall defense budgets and past administration decisions to cut fleet size. |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation, *Index of U.S. Military Strength*, 2024.
- American Enterprise Institute, "A Bigger, Better Navy," 2023.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fleet modernization / 355-ship floor | 9/10 | Strongly support; may advocate for even larger fleet (400+ ships). | Genuine national security concern; some also value defense spending in their districts. |
| Shipbuilding industrial base revitalization | 8/10 | Support workforce development and shipyard investment. | Prefer market-driven approaches where possible; comfortable with government investment in defense industrial base. |
| Unmanned systems | 7/10 | Generally supportive but cautious about replacing manned platforms. | Skepticism about unproven technology; concern about reducing crewed combatant numbers. |
| Allied interoperability | 8/10 | Support strengthening alliances, especially in the Indo-Pacific. | Insist allies increase their own spending and burden-sharing before U.S. provides more. |
| FONOPS / South China Sea posture | 9/10 | Strongly support aggressive FONOPS and Taiwan Strait transits. | Genuine commitment to rules-based order; also desire to confront China. |
| UNCLOS ratification | 3/10 | Generally oppose. | Sovereignty concerns about international tribunal jurisdiction. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Naval Modernization and Readiness Act | 8/10 | Strong support for 355-ship floor, shipbuilding acceleration, and workforce development. Skepticism about unmanned vessel battle force designation. | Want real combat ships, not paper fleet inflation. |
| Maritime Security Cooperation Act | 7/10 | Support allied cooperation, FONOPS codification, and South China Sea policy. Oppose UNCLOS sense-of-Congress. | Sovereignty concerns about UNCLOS; want stronger Taiwan language. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Increase the defense topline to 4% of GDP (from ~3.5%) to fund naval modernization without cutting other services.
- Expand the fleet goal beyond 355 to 400+ ships, including a larger submarine force.
- Reject UNCLOS ratification and instead strengthen the U.S. position through unilateral naval dominance.
- Provide Taiwan with more advanced defensive weapons and increase the frequency of Taiwan Strait transits.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Populist (on shipbuilding jobs and confronting China), Constitutionalist (on naval authority and sovereignty), Religious Right (on strong defense).
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on bipartisan shipbuilding investment), Liberal (on allied cooperation and rules-based order).
- **Unlikely partners:** Democratic Socialist (on defense spending levels), Progressive (on overall military posture).

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Mixed. Liberals express support for maritime security but are pulled between defense investment and domestic spending priorities. |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent. Support for rules-based international order should logically lead to strong naval support, but defense spending skepticism creates tension. |
| Goalpost stability | Some shifting. May support naval programs in theory but seek to reduce funding in appropriations to fund domestic priorities. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate. Defense spending is often framed as competing with social programs, making naval investment a lower priority. |

**Justification:** Liberals generally support a strong Navy in principle, particularly for its role in maintaining the rules-based international order and allied relationships. However, they are less willing than conservatives to increase the defense topline and more inclined to question whether 355 ships is the right number. The Obama administration's "pivot to Asia" demonstrated liberal commitment to Indo-Pacific security, but internal tensions about defense spending levels limit follow-through.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- The Obama administration established the rebalance to Asia and supported FONOPS but also oversaw continued fleet drawdown.
- Democratic members of the Armed Services Committees generally support shipbuilding but vote for lower defense toplines than Republicans propose.
- Center for American Progress has published reports supporting maritime security while calling for defense spending restraint.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree the Navy faces challenges but less alarmed than conservatives about the U.S.-China naval balance. Emphasize diplomatic and economic dimensions of the challenge. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agree on industrial base decline and acquisition dysfunction. More willing to question whether carrier-centric force structure is the right approach. Less inclined to blame insufficient spending alone. |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress, "Rebalancing the Force for the Indo-Pacific," 2023.
- Obama, Barack. "Remarks to the Australian Parliament," November 17, 2011.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fleet modernization / 355-ship floor | 5/10 | Support modernization but question whether 355 is the right number. Prefer capability over quantity. | Concern about opportunity cost relative to domestic spending. |
| Shipbuilding industrial base revitalization | 7/10 | Support workforce development and training programs. Favor government-led programs. | Align with union and labor constituency; good jobs. |
| Unmanned systems | 7/10 | Support as cost-effective alternative to expensive manned platforms. | May see unmanned systems as a way to maintain capability at lower cost. |
| Allied interoperability | 9/10 | Strongly support. Multilateralism and allied burden-sharing are core liberal values. | Genuine belief in international cooperation; also reduces U.S. cost burden. |
| FONOPS / South China Sea posture | 7/10 | Support FONOPS but prefer diplomatic engagement alongside military posture. Want to avoid escalation. | Tension between defending rules-based order and avoiding conflict with China. |
| UNCLOS ratification | 8/10 | Strongly support. See ratification as strengthening U.S. legal position and international credibility. | Genuine commitment to international law and multilateral frameworks. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Naval Modernization and Readiness Act | 6/10 | Support workforce development and maintenance provisions. Skeptical of 355-ship floor as too rigid; prefer capability-based assessment. | Cost concerns; would prefer more flexible fleet size based on strategic review. |
| Maritime Security Cooperation Act | 8/10 | Strong support for allied cooperation, FONOPS reporting, and UNCLOS sense-of-Congress. | Would strengthen UNCLOS provision beyond sense-of-Congress if politically feasible. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Replace the rigid 355-ship floor with a capability-based fleet assessment conducted every 4 years.
- Invest more heavily in unmanned systems and cyber/electronic warfare capabilities as cost-effective alternatives to additional manned platforms.
- Prioritize diplomatic engagement with China on maritime issues alongside military posture.
- Ratify UNCLOS to strengthen U.S. legal standing in maritime disputes.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Centrist (on bipartisan compromise and pragmatic investment), Progressive (on some acquisition reform and diplomacy).
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on allied cooperation and rules-based order), Populist (on shipbuilding jobs and worker training).
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on overall defense spending levels).

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent. Progressives genuinely believe military spending is excessive and that resources should be redirected to domestic programs. |
| Principle consistency | High internal consistency. Opposition to defense spending is consistent with broader critique of militarism and military-industrial complex. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable. Unlikely to be won over to major fleet increases regardless of how concerns are addressed. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Defense spending viewed inherently as zero-sum with domestic spending. |

**Justification:** Progressives are the most skeptical of the nine perspectives about the need for a larger Navy. They do not dispute that China's navy is growing but question the assumption that the U.S. must maintain naval superiority at any cost. They emphasize the opportunity cost of defense spending, the risks of militarized confrontation with China, and the influence of the defense industry on policy. Their positions are internally consistent and predictable.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Barbara Lee have consistently voted against defense spending increases and questioned naval procurement priorities.
- Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft has published analyses arguing for restraint in the Indo-Pacific and reduced naval forward presence.
- Progressive Caucus budget proposals consistently call for reduced defense spending.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Accept basic facts about fleet sizes but frame the situation differently -- emphasize that the U.S. Navy is still the world's most capable by far, and that China's fleet includes many small vessels not comparable to U.S. combatants. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agree on acquisition dysfunction and industrial base decline. Strongly agree that carrier-centric culture is a problem. Disagree that the fundamental issue is insufficient spending; argue the issue is misallocation and bloated programs. |

**Source references:**

- Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, "Responsible Defense Spending," 2024.
- Congressional Progressive Caucus, "People's Budget FY2025."

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fleet modernization / 355-ship floor | 3/10 | Oppose a rigid numerical floor. Argue the U.S. already has the world's most powerful navy. | Fundamental belief that defense spending is excessive and crowds out domestic priorities. |
| Shipbuilding industrial base revitalization | 5/10 | Support worker training and good jobs aspects. Oppose what they see as corporate welfare for defense contractors. | Pro-worker but anti-military-industrial complex. |
| Unmanned systems | 4/10 | Skeptical of autonomous weapons and AI in warfare. Support reduced human risk but concerned about lowering barriers to conflict. | Genuine ethical concerns about autonomous weapons; also concerned about proliferation. |
| Allied interoperability | 6/10 | Support multilateralism in principle but concerned about militarized alliances provoking conflict with China. | Prefer diplomatic engagement and economic cooperation over military alliances. |
| FONOPS / South China Sea posture | 4/10 | View FONOPS as unnecessarily provocative and risking escalation with a nuclear-armed power. | Genuine concern about great-power conflict; also general skepticism of military posturing. |
| UNCLOS ratification | 9/10 | Strongly support as a matter of international law and multilateral cooperation. | Consistent with commitment to international institutions and rule of law. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Naval Modernization and Readiness Act | 3/10 | Oppose the 355-ship floor and overall spending level. May support workforce provisions if decoupled from fleet expansion. | View as a giveaway to defense contractors; prefer redirecting funds to domestic investment. |
| Maritime Security Cooperation Act | 5/10 | Support UNCLOS provision and FONOPS reporting (for oversight). Oppose South China Sea policy codification as escalatory. | Want diplomatic rather than military approach to South China Sea. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Cap naval spending at current levels and focus on efficiency, not fleet growth.
- Redirect savings from cancelled or reduced ship programs to infrastructure, healthcare, and climate.
- Pursue diplomatic resolution of South China Sea disputes through ASEAN and UNCLOS mechanisms.
- Reduce FONOPS frequency and pursue military-to-military communications with China to reduce escalation risk.
- Impose stricter oversight on defense contractor profits and cost-plus contracts.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist (on defense spending restraint and domestic investment).
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on diplomacy, allied cooperation, and UNCLOS), Libertarian (on reducing military interventionism).
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on defense spending levels), Populist (on confrontational China posture).

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent. Libertarians genuinely oppose large government programs, including military ones, on principled grounds. |
| Principle consistency | High. Opposition to overseas military commitments and federal spending is consistent across policy domains. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable. Unlikely to support major fleet increases; consistent in preferring smaller government and less foreign intervention. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low. Positions are driven by principle rather than opposition to any specific party. |

**Justification:** Libertarians apply their small-government principles consistently to defense policy. They do not dispute the importance of a navy -- the Constitution explicitly authorizes one -- but argue that the current fleet is sized for global empire, not national defense. They support a navy sufficient to defend American waters and trade routes but oppose the forward-deployed global presence model.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute has published extensively arguing for a smaller, defense-oriented Navy rather than a global power projection fleet.
- Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and other libertarian-leaning members consistently vote against NDAAs they view as excessive.
- Reason Foundation has advocated for defense procurement reform and reduced military spending.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Accept the factual data but reject the framing that the U.S. Navy is "too small." Argue it is sized for global empire, not defense. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Strongly agree on acquisition dysfunction, cost overruns, and defense industry influence. Disagree that the solution is more spending. |

- Preble, Christopher. *The Power Problem: How American Military Dominance Makes Us Less Safe*. Cornell University Press, 2009.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fleet modernization / 355-ship floor | 2/10 | Oppose as an unjustified expansion of military power. A 200-250 ship Navy focused on homeland defense would suffice. | Genuine belief that forward presence creates more threats than it prevents. |
| Shipbuilding industrial base revitalization | 3/10 | Oppose government subsidies and workforce programs as market distortions. If the market cannot sustain shipbuilding, the fleet requirement is wrong. | Principled opposition to government industrial policy. |
| Unmanned systems | 5/10 | Cautiously interested if unmanned systems reduce costs and personnel requirements. | Concerned about autonomous weapons and the lowering of barriers to military action. |
| Allied interoperability | 4/10 | Skeptical of alliance commitments that entangle the U.S. in foreign conflicts. Support allies defending themselves. | Genuine non-interventionism; want allies to provide their own defense. |
| FONOPS / South China Sea posture | 3/10 | View FONOPS as an unnecessary provocation that risks war over interests that are not vital to the U.S. | Consistent non-interventionism; the South China Sea is not an American lake. |
| UNCLOS ratification | 3/10 | Oppose as ceding sovereignty to international organizations. | Consistent opposition to international treaties that constrain U.S. sovereignty. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Naval Modernization and Readiness Act | 2/10 | Oppose the 355-ship floor, government workforce programs, and overall spending levels. May support acquisition reform provisions. | View as expanded government and military-industrial complex entrenchment. |
| Maritime Security Cooperation Act | 3/10 | Oppose allied interoperability fund and maritime security assistance as entangling alliances. Oppose AUKUS submarine transfers as escalatory. | Principled non-interventionism. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Reduce the fleet to 200-250 ships focused on homeland defense, nuclear deterrence, and essential sea lane protection.
- Withdraw from forward-deployed posture in the Western Pacific and allow regional allies to balance China independently.
- Eliminate cost-plus contracts and introduce fixed-price competition for all ship classes.
- Abolish the Jones Act to allow a competitive commercial shipbuilding market.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on reducing military spending and interventionism -- rare alignment).
- **Potential bridges:** Constitutionalist (on limited government and sovereignty concerns), Populist (on opposing foreign entanglements).
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on defense spending levels), Centrist (on maintaining forward presence).

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Very strong alignment. Constitutionalists engage with maritime security through the constitutional text, which explicitly authorizes a Navy. |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent. The Constitution's grant of naval power makes the Navy one of the most constitutionally legitimate government functions. |
| Goalpost stability | Very stable. Positions are anchored to constitutional text and original understanding. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low. Positions are principled and predictable. |

**Justification:** The Constitutionalist perspective is uniquely well-suited to maritime security because the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to "provide and maintain a Navy" (Article I, Section 8, Clause 13). Unlike many other government programs that Constitutionalists view skeptically, the Navy is one of the few institutions with unambiguous constitutional authorization. This creates strong, principled support for naval power combined with insistence on proper congressional oversight.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- The Federalist Society and Constitutional scholars consistently identify national defense as a core enumerated power.
- Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) supports strong defense while insisting on War Powers compliance and congressional authorization for military operations.
- Constitutional originalists cite the founders' strong emphasis on naval power (John Adams: "a naval power, next to the militia, is the natural defense of the United States").

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree with the factual assessment of fleet shortfalls and Chinese threat. Emphasize the constitutional mandate to maintain a Navy. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree on industrial base decline and acquisition dysfunction. Particularly concerned about executive overreach in naval operations without congressional authorization. |

**Source references:**

- U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clauses 11-14.
- Adams, John. *Thoughts on Government*, 1776.
- Federalist Society, defense and national security panel discussions.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fleet modernization / 355-ship floor | 8/10 | Support -- the Constitution authorizes a Navy and Congress should fund one adequate to national defense. | Want Congress to set fleet requirements, not the executive branch alone. |
| Shipbuilding industrial base revitalization | 7/10 | Support as necessary to fulfill the constitutional naval mandate. | Prefer that federal programs respect federalism; support state-level workforce programs. |
| Unmanned systems | 6/10 | Cautiously supportive but concerned about autonomous weapons exceeding congressional authorization for the use of force. | Insist on clear congressional oversight of unmanned weapons employment authorities. |
| Allied interoperability | 6/10 | Support alliances authorized by treaty (Senate advice and consent). Skeptical of executive agreements that bypass the treaty process. | Insist on Senate ratification of any binding alliance commitments. |
| FONOPS / South China Sea posture | 7/10 | Support as an exercise of constitutional naval authority, but insist that sustained operations that risk hostilities require congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution. | Want proper congressional oversight; skeptical of open-ended executive military actions. |
| UNCLOS ratification | 4/10 | Split. Some support ratification through proper treaty process; others oppose as ceding sovereignty to international tribunals. | Core concern is whether UNCLOS constrains U.S. sovereign prerogatives. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Naval Modernization and Readiness Act | 7/10 | Support 355-ship floor and congressional role in setting fleet requirements. Want stronger congressional oversight provisions. | Concern about executive waiver provision; want Congress to retain control. |
| Maritime Security Cooperation Act | 6/10 | Support FONOPS reporting and congressional oversight. Concerned about AUKUS submarine transfer authority as potentially bypassing treaty process. | Insist on proper constitutional procedures for international commitments. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Require explicit congressional authorization before any FONOPS that carries elevated escalation risk.
- Mandate that any defense cooperation agreement involving technology transfer or military commitment be submitted as a treaty for Senate advice and consent.
- Strengthen the War Powers provisions to require congressional authorization within 30 days of sustained naval combat operations.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on strong defense and constitutional governance), Religious Right (on national security).
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on limited government and congressional oversight), Centrist (on bipartisan process).
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (on defense spending), Democratic Socialist (on military posture).

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Mixed. Populists support a strong Navy and confronting China, but the depth of commitment to specific naval programs varies with political winds. |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent. Populists support defense spending in principle but sometimes oppose specific programs or spending bills for anti-establishment reasons. |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate. Positions on China and naval power are stable; positions on specific legislation and spending levels can shift. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate. Some populist opposition to defense bills reflects anti-establishment posturing rather than principled disagreement. |

**Justification:** Populists are strongly supportive of a powerful Navy, particularly as a tool for confronting China, which they view as an economic and strategic competitor. They are also strongly supportive of shipbuilding as a source of good American manufacturing jobs. However, their anti-establishment orientation means they may oppose specific defense bills if they perceive them as enriching defense contractors or reflecting establishment priorities. The "drain the swamp" instinct can conflict with the "build more ships" instinct.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Former President Trump called for a 355-ship Navy but also criticized specific defense programs as wasteful.
- Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) has supported naval modernization while criticizing the defense establishment.
- Populist media emphasizes China threat and American industrial decline but is skeptical of "Pentagon spending."

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strongly agree that China's naval buildup is a major threat and that the U.S. Navy is too small. Emphasize the industrial decline narrative. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Strongly agree on industrial base decline and shipyard job losses. Frame the issue as part of broader deindustrialization caused by globalization and offshoring. |

**Source references:**

- Trump administration 2017 National Security Strategy, identifying great-power competition.
- American Compass (Oren Cass), industrial policy framework for defense.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fleet modernization / 355-ship floor | 8/10 | Strongly support. Want American ships built in American shipyards by American workers. | Genuine national security concern combined with economic nationalism. |
| Shipbuilding industrial base revitalization | 9/10 | The single strongest area of populist support. View shipyard revitalization as reindustrialization. | Worker-focused; want good manufacturing jobs, not contractor profits. |
| Unmanned systems | 5/10 | Mixed. Support technology but concerned about replacing human workers with robots and displacing jobs. | Economic concern about automation displacing shipyard and military jobs. |
| Allied interoperability | 5/10 | Skeptical of alliances that they perceive as "freeloading" by allies. Support bilateral deals where allies pay their share. | Want allies to increase their own spending dramatically before U.S. invests more in interoperability. |
| FONOPS / South China Sea posture | 8/10 | Strongly support confronting China. View FONOPS as showing strength. | Confronting China aligns with economic nationalist worldview. |
| UNCLOS ratification | 2/10 | Strongly oppose as surrendering sovereignty to international bureaucrats. | Deep skepticism of international organizations. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Naval Modernization and Readiness Act | 7/10 | Support 355-ship floor and workforce development. Skeptical of unmanned systems provisions. Want stronger "Buy American" provisions. | Want to ensure money goes to workers, not defense contractor executives. |
| Maritime Security Cooperation Act | 5/10 | Support confronting China in the South China Sea. Skeptical of allied interoperability fund (seen as subsidizing allies) and AUKUS submarine transfers (giving away American submarines). | Economic nationalism; want allies to buy their own capabilities. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Require 100% domestic content for all naval combatants, including sub-tier suppliers.
- Revitalize the U.S. merchant marine alongside the Navy through an expanded Jones Act.
- Impose tariffs on Chinese-built ships and maritime equipment.
- Require allied nations to pay the full cost of any U.S. military capabilities provided to them.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on strong defense and confronting China), Religious Right (on national security).
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on shipbuilding jobs and workforce development), Democratic Socialist (on industrial policy and good jobs).
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on defense spending and trade), Progressive (on militarized China policy).

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment. Centrists genuinely seek pragmatic, evidence-based solutions to maritime security challenges. |
| Principle consistency | Consistent. Support for bipartisan defense investment and allied cooperation aligns with centrist values. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable. Centrists are the most reliable coalition partners on defense because their positions are driven by analysis rather than ideology. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low. Centrists actively seek bipartisan compromise. |

**Justification:** Centrists are the most natural coalition-builders on maritime security. They support a strong Navy, accept the China threat assessment, and favor both domestic investment (shipbuilding, workforce) and international cooperation (alliances, UNCLOS). Their positions are data-driven and pragmatic, making them reliable negotiating partners, though they can be criticized for lacking a strong vision.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center has published reports supporting sustained naval investment and allied cooperation.
- Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Sen. Angus King (I-ME) have been consistent bipartisan advocates for naval modernization.
- CSIS analyses, which tend toward centrist positions, consistently support the 355-ship goal and allied interoperability.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement with the factual assessment. Centrists accept the data on fleet shortfalls, Chinese buildup, and industrial base decline. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree on virtually all root causes. Willing to acknowledge institutional resistance to change (carrier-centric culture) as well as funding shortfalls. |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fleet modernization / 355-ship floor | 8/10 | Support as a reasonable target based on force structure assessments. Open to adjustments based on evolving threat and capability. | Prefer evidence-based targets over rigid mandates. |
| Shipbuilding industrial base revitalization | 8/10 | Strong support for bipartisan workforce and infrastructure investment. | View as both national security and economic policy. |
| Unmanned systems | 8/10 | Support as a pragmatic way to expand fleet capacity at manageable cost. Want rigorous testing before full commitment. | Evidence-driven; want to see unmanned systems prove themselves before scaling. |
| Allied interoperability | 9/10 | The strongest centrist priority. View allied cooperation as the most cost-effective force multiplier. | Genuine multilateralism combined with pragmatic burden-sharing. |
| FONOPS / South China Sea posture | 8/10 | Support sustained FONOPS alongside diplomatic engagement. Want to calibrate military posture to minimize escalation risk. | Seek balance between deterrence and provocation. |
| UNCLOS ratification | 7/10 | Support as strengthening U.S. legal position and international credibility. | Pragmatic assessment that ratification is in U.S. interest. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Naval Modernization and Readiness Act | 8/10 | Strong support. View as a balanced approach combining fleet requirements, industrial base investment, and unmanned systems. | Would prefer slightly more flexibility in the 355-ship floor (e.g., capability-based adjustments). |
| Maritime Security Cooperation Act | 9/10 | Very strong support. View as the highest-priority bill because allied cooperation is the most effective force multiplier. | Would strengthen UNCLOS provision if politically feasible. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Conduct a bipartisan commission on naval force structure (modeled on the National Commission on the Future of the Navy) every 4 years to update the fleet size requirement based on current threat and capability assessments.
- Establish a standing congressional caucus on maritime security to build bipartisan consensus.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (on allied cooperation and UNCLOS), Conservative (on fleet modernization and China threat).
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on shipbuilding jobs), Constitutionalist (on proper congressional process).
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on forward presence), Progressive (on spending levels).

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Moderate alignment. The Religious Right supports strong defense as part of broader national security conservatism but does not have deep independent positions on naval force structure. |
| Principle consistency | Mixed. Support for strong defense is consistent, but positions on specific naval programs are often derivative of broader conservative or populist positions rather than independently developed. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on general support for strong defense; less defined on specifics. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low on defense specifically. |

**Justification:** The Religious Right generally supports a strong Navy as part of an overall strong national defense posture, but maritime security is not a primary focus of this perspective. Their positions tend to align with the conservative mainstream on defense issues. The most distinctive aspect of the Religious Right perspective on maritime security relates to values of protecting the innocent (e.g., supporting the Philippines against Chinese coercion) and religious freedom globally (which U.S. naval presence can support).

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Family Research Council and similar organizations consistently support defense spending increases.
- Religious Right voters reliably support pro-defense candidates.
- Limited independent policy development on naval specifics.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Generally accept the assessment of Chinese threat and fleet shortfalls. Less engaged with technical details. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Accept the general narrative of decline and the need for investment. |

**Source references:**

- Family Research Council, National Security and Foreign Policy platform, 2024.
- General alignment with Heritage Foundation defense positions.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fleet modernization / 355-ship floor | 7/10 | Support strong defense, including naval modernization. | Generally aligned with conservative position; not independently analyzed. |
| Shipbuilding industrial base revitalization | 7/10 | Support as good jobs for American families and communities. | Value the community-stabilizing effect of shipyard employment. |
| Unmanned systems | 5/10 | Cautious. Concerned about autonomous lethal systems and ethical implications. | Moral concerns about delegating lethal authority to machines. |
| Allied interoperability | 7/10 | Support alliances with democracies and nations that share values, including religious freedom. | Prefer alliances with value-aligned nations. |
| FONOPS / South China Sea posture | 7/10 | Support protecting smaller nations (Philippines) from Chinese bullying. | Moral framing -- protecting the weak from the strong. |
| UNCLOS ratification | 3/10 | Generally oppose, aligned with conservative sovereignty concerns. | Distrust of international organizations. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Naval Modernization and Readiness Act | 7/10 | General support, aligned with conservative position. | Would want ethical oversight provisions for unmanned systems. |
| Maritime Security Cooperation Act | 6/10 | Support allied cooperation and protecting the Philippines. Skeptical of UNCLOS. | Value-based approach to alliances. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Include provisions supporting religious freedom and human rights in maritime security cooperation agreements with partner nations.
- Establish ethical review board oversight for autonomous naval weapons systems.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on strong defense), Constitutionalist (on national security and sovereignty).
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on confronting China), Centrist (on bipartisan defense).
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (on defense spending), Democratic Socialist (on military posture).

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent. Democratic Socialists genuinely view defense spending as excessive and believe resources should be redirected to public goods. |
| Principle consistency | High. Opposition to military spending is consistent with broader critique of capitalism, imperialism, and the military-industrial complex. |
| Goalpost stability | Very stable. Unlikely to support major naval expansion under any framing. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Defense spending is fundamentally viewed as zero-sum with social spending. |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists are, along with Progressives, the most opposed to naval expansion. They view the military-industrial complex as a driver of both excessive spending and international conflict. They would support shipyard worker protections and good jobs but oppose the military purpose of the spending. Their positions are internally consistent and highly predictable.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) platform calls for dramatically reduced military spending.
- Sen. Sanders has consistently opposed NDAAs and called for redirecting defense funds to healthcare, education, and climate.
- Jacobin and other Democratic Socialist publications regularly critique naval spending as imperialism.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Accept basic facts but fundamentally reframe the situation. Argue the U.S. Navy is already overwhelmingly dominant and that characterizing the situation as a crisis serves defense industry interests. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agree on defense industry influence and acquisition dysfunction. Reject the premise that the U.S. needs a larger navy; argue the root cause of insecurity is militarism itself. |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Fleet modernization / 355-ship floor | 2/10 | Strongly oppose. View as a massive transfer of public wealth to defense corporations. | Fundamental opposition to military spending at current or increased levels. |
| Shipbuilding industrial base revitalization | 4/10 | Support good jobs and worker training; would prefer the skills applied to civilian infrastructure (green energy, public transit). | Pro-worker but anti-military purpose. Would support conversion of military shipyards to civilian production. |
| Unmanned systems | 2/10 | Strongly oppose autonomous weapons. Concerned about accountability, ethics, and lowering barriers to conflict. | Deep ethical and political opposition. |
| Allied interoperability | 4/10 | Skeptical of military alliances. Prefer economic and diplomatic cooperation. | View military alliances as imperialism with extra steps. |
| FONOPS / South China Sea posture | 3/10 | View as provocative and potentially leading to catastrophic great-power war. Prefer diplomatic resolution. | Genuine anti-war conviction. |
| UNCLOS ratification | 8/10 | Support as an instrument of international law and peaceful dispute resolution. | Consistent with preference for multilateral institutions over military power. |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Naval Modernization and Readiness Act | 2/10 | Oppose. Would redirect the $25+ billion in new spending to healthcare, education, and climate. Support workforce provisions only if decoupled from fleet expansion. | Fundamental opposition to defense spending increases. |
| Maritime Security Cooperation Act | 4/10 | Support UNCLOS provision and FONOPS reporting (for oversight). Oppose most other provisions as militaristic. | Want to constrain, not expand, military operations. |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Reduce the Navy to a defensive force of 200 ships focused on homeland defense and humanitarian operations.
- Convert military shipyards to civilian production (offshore wind energy platforms, ferries, public transit vessels).
- Replace military alliances with economic cooperation agreements and conflict prevention mechanisms.
- Create a Department of Peace to handle international disputes diplomatically.
- Redirect savings from naval reductions to a Green New Deal and universal public services.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on defense spending restraint and anti-militarism).
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on reducing foreign military commitments -- rare alignment), Liberal (on UNCLOS and diplomatic approaches).
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on defense spending), Populist (on confrontational China posture), Constitutionalist (on naval authority).

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Shipbuilding industrial base | Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Constitutionalist, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right | Democratic Socialist, Libertarian | -- |
| Fleet modernization / 355-ship | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right | Liberal | Progressive, Libertarian, Democratic Socialist |
| Allied interoperability | Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Constitutionalist, Centrist, Religious Right | Populist, Libertarian, Democratic Socialist | -- |
| FONOPS / SCS posture | Conservative, Liberal, Constitutionalist, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right | -- | Progressive, Libertarian, Democratic Socialist |
| Unmanned systems | Conservative, Liberal, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Centrist | Populist, Religious Right | Progressive, Democratic Socialist |
| UNCLOS ratification | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Constitutionalist | Conservative, Libertarian, Populist, Religious Right |

**Key insight:** Shipbuilding industrial base revitalization has the broadest coalition potential (7/9 perspectives supportive) because it combines national security, economic development, and good jobs. UNCLOS ratification is the most divisive issue, splitting perspectives roughly along internationalist vs. sovereignty lines. The 355-ship fleet goal has a working majority (5-6 perspectives) but faces significant opposition from the fiscal restraint and anti-militarist camps.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *National Shipbuilding and Maritime Workforce Investment*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Populist + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Religious Right

**Core Agreement:** All six perspectives agree that the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base has declined dangerously and that investment in American manufacturing jobs and workforce training is desirable. This is the single policy area with the broadest cross-ideological support.

**Policy Description:**

A standalone bill focused exclusively on shipbuilding industrial base revitalization, decoupled from fleet size mandates and foreign policy provisions that divide the coalition. The bill would authorize $2.5 billion per year for SIOP, $500 million per year for workforce development, and tax incentives for shipyard capital investment. It would include strong "Buy American" provisions and labor standards to satisfy both populist and liberal constituencies.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Rebuilds defense industrial capacity, strengthens national security |
| Liberal | Creates good union jobs, funds workforce training, invests in communities |
| Populist | Reindustrializes America, rebuilds manufacturing, "Buy American" provisions |
| Centrist | Evidence-based investment in a documented national need |
| Constitutionalist | Fulfills the constitutional mandate to "provide and maintain a Navy" |
| Religious Right | Supports families and communities in shipyard regions |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepting government-led workforce programs rather than purely market-driven approaches |
| Liberal | Investing in defense industry rather than purely civilian programs |
| Populist | Accepting that some provisions may benefit defense contractors, not just workers |
| Centrist | Accepting a standalone bill rather than a comprehensive reform package |
| Constitutionalist | Accepting federal workforce programs that go beyond strict enumerated powers |
| Religious Right | No specific concessions; aligns naturally with this approach |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High. Industrial base investment is not controversial once decoupled from fleet size and foreign policy debates. The jobs and manufacturing framing is durable across political cycles.
- **Implementation Path:** Could be introduced as a standalone bill or incorporated into the NDAA. Strong potential for bipartisan co-sponsorship.

---

### Compromise 2: *Bipartisan Naval Readiness and Maintenance Act*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Populist

**Core Agreement:** No perspective opposes maintaining the ships the Navy already has. Fixing the maintenance backlog, reducing repair delays, and improving readiness is unobjectionable even to those who oppose fleet expansion. Progressives and Democratic Socialists can accept maintenance spending on existing ships even while opposing new construction.

**Policy Description:**

A narrow bill focused on funding the public shipyard maintenance backlog ($21 billion over 10 years), improving surface ship and submarine maintenance on-time rates, and investing in public shipyard infrastructure. The bill deliberately excludes new ship construction, fleet size mandates, and foreign policy provisions.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Improves readiness of the existing fleet, which is a precondition for deterrence |
| Liberal | Invests in public infrastructure and good jobs without expanding the military |
| Centrist | Evidence-based response to documented GAO findings on maintenance delays |
| Constitutionalist | Maintaining the Navy Congress has already authorized is a core responsibility |
| Populist | Creates shipyard jobs and rebuilds American industrial capacity |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | No fleet size increase in this bill; must pursue that separately |
| Liberal | Accepting defense-related spending without offsetting domestic spending increase |
| Centrist | Accepting a narrow bill rather than comprehensive reform |
| Constitutionalist | No specific concessions |
| Populist | No "Buy American" provisions beyond existing law (maintenance performed at government shipyards) |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (with potential soft support from Progressives and Democratic Socialists who prefer maintenance over new construction)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Very high. Maintenance funding is politically easy to support and difficult to oppose.
- **Implementation Path:** Could pass as a standalone bill or as NDAA language. Minimal opposition expected.

---

### Compromise 3: *Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Partnership Act*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Religious Right

**Core Agreement:** Strong allied navies reduce the burden on the U.S. Navy and increase collective deterrence. Investing in allied interoperability and partner nation maritime capacity is more cost-effective than building additional U.S. ships and enjoys broad support.

**Policy Description:**

A bill establishing the Allied Naval Interoperability Fund ($300 million/year), authorizing expanded maritime security assistance to Indo-Pacific partners, and codifying the AUKUS implementation framework. The bill excludes FONOPS policy, South China Sea declarations, and UNCLOS provisions that divide the coalition.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Strengthens alliances and increases allied burden-sharing |
| Liberal | Multilateral approach to security; invests in cooperation, not unilateral military buildup |
| Centrist | Most cost-effective approach to Indo-Pacific security; evidence-based force multiplier |
| Constitutionalist | Alliances authorized by Senate-ratified treaties; proper constitutional process |
| Religious Right | Supports democratic allies and nations facing Chinese coercion |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Excluding strong South China Sea declarations and FONOPS expansion |
| Liberal | Accepting military cooperation rather than purely diplomatic engagement |
| Centrist | Accepting a narrower bill rather than comprehensive maritime security reform |
| Constitutionalist | Accepting executive authority for some cooperation agreements without individual treaty ratification |
| Religious Right | No specific concessions |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High. Allied cooperation enjoys bipartisan support and is politically easier than increasing U.S. defense spending.
- **Implementation Path:** Could be introduced as a standalone bill or incorporated into the NDAA. Strong potential for bipartisan support, particularly from members with Indo-Pacific focus.

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable legislative coalition for maritime security reform consists of **Conservatives, Centrists, Constitutionalists, and Populists** -- a center-right grouping that agrees on the need for a stronger Navy and a more robust shipbuilding industrial base. This coalition commands a working majority in Congress and can attract Liberal support on specific provisions (allied cooperation, workforce development, maintenance). The addition of Liberal support on selected issues creates a potential supermajority.

### Key Obstacles

- **Defense topline**: The fundamental obstacle is whether Congress will increase the defense budget sufficiently to fund naval modernization without cutting other services. This is a budget fight, not a maritime security fight.
- **Carrier vs. distributed force debate**: Institutional resistance to shifting resources from carriers to submarines, unmanned systems, and distributed platforms will persist regardless of legislative mandates. This is a cultural and organizational challenge that legislation alone cannot resolve.
- **UNCLOS ratification**: The single most useful legal reform -- ratifying UNCLOS -- faces persistent opposition from sovereignty-concerned perspectives (Conservative, Libertarian, Populist, Religious Right) that constitute a blocking minority in the Senate.
- **Industrial base timeline**: Even with maximum investment, the shipbuilding industrial base cannot be expanded overnight. Workforce development takes 3-5 years; shipyard construction takes 5-10 years. The gap between when investment begins and when ships are delivered creates a window of vulnerability.

### Low Consistency Partners

The **Liberal**, **Populist**, and **Religious Right** perspectives (all rated 3/5 consistency) require careful management:

- **Liberals** can be engaged through multilateral cooperation and UNCLOS provisions, but their support for fleet modernization is contingent on defense spending not crowding out domestic priorities. Framing naval investment as jobs and infrastructure may help.
- **Populists** are strong allies on shipbuilding and confronting China but may defect on specific legislation if they perceive it as benefiting defense contractors. Worker-focused framing and "Buy American" provisions are essential.
- **Religious Right** largely follows the conservative mainstream on defense but can be engaged through values-based framing (protecting the Philippines, supporting democratic allies, ethical oversight of autonomous weapons).

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with the industrial base**: Shipbuilding and workforce investment has the broadest support (7/9 perspectives). Pass a standalone industrial base bill first to build momentum and demonstrate bipartisan capability.
2. **Fix readiness next**: A narrow maintenance and readiness bill is nearly unopposable. Use it to demonstrate competence and build trust.
3. **Pursue allied cooperation**: An Indo-Pacific partnership bill can attract a bipartisan coalition and improve deterrence without the political cost of a fleet size fight.
4. **Fight the fleet size battle last**: The 355-ship floor is achievable with a center-right coalition but will face opposition from the left. Build the case through industrial base investment and readiness improvements first, then make the fleet size argument on the foundation of a revitalized industrial base that can actually deliver the ships.
5. **Defer UNCLOS**: Ratification is desirable but not achievable in the current political environment. Continue to treat UNCLOS provisions as customary international law while building the case for eventual ratification.
