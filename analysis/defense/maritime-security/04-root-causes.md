# Maritime Security: Root Causes

## Overview

The challenges facing U.S. maritime security are not the result of any single decision or event but of interconnected structural, economic, and strategic factors that have accumulated over decades. This section analyzes the root causes of the gap between American maritime security requirements and current capabilities.

## 1. Collapse of the Shipbuilding Industrial Base

### The Problem

The U.S. shipbuilding industrial base has contracted dramatically since the Cold War. The number of private shipyards capable of building major naval combatants has fallen from more than 30 in the 1980s to 7 today. The production workforce has shrunk from over 180,000 to approximately 42,000.

### Why It Persists

- **Feast-or-Famine Procurement**: The Navy's procurement budget fluctuates with political cycles, making it impossible for shipyards to plan long-term investments in workforce and infrastructure. A shipyard cannot hire and train thousands of welders for a contract that may be cancelled or delayed the following year.
- **Consolidation**: Defense industry consolidation in the 1990s (encouraged by the "Last Supper" under Secretary of Defense William Perry) reduced the number of prime contractors, eliminating competitive pressure that once drove efficiency and innovation.
- **Jones Act Limitations**: The Jones Act requires that domestic waterborne commerce be carried on U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed ships. While intended to sustain the merchant marine and shipbuilding base, the law has instead created an uncompetitive commercial sector -- U.S.-built commercial ships cost 5-8 times more than foreign equivalents, so the commercial fleet has withered, and shipyards depend entirely on government contracts.
- **Supplier Base Fragility**: The submarine industrial base alone depends on over 5,000 suppliers across 48 states. Single-source and sole-source dependencies create bottleneck risks. The casting and forging capacity for submarine hulls is particularly constrained.

### Data

| Metric | 1987 | 2024 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Major Private Shipyards | 30+ | 7 | -77% |
| Production Workforce | 180,000+ | ~42,000 | -77% |
| Annual Combatant Deliveries | 15-20 | 5-7 | -65% |
| Public Shipyard Maintenance Backlog | Manageable | $21 billion | Critical |

## 2. Rising Per-Hull Costs

### The Problem

The cost of individual naval vessels has risen relentlessly, driven by technological complexity, design instability, and low production rates. When fewer ships are built, fixed costs are spread over fewer hulls, driving up unit costs, which leads to fewer ships being ordered -- a vicious cycle sometimes called the "death spiral."

### Key Examples

| Ship Class | Planned | Built | Cost Per Hull (Then-Year $B) |
|------------|---------|-------|------------------------------|
| Zumwalt (DDG-1000) | 32 | 3 | ~$8.0 |
| Ford-class (CVN-78) | TBD | 2 (building) | ~$13.3 (lead ship) |
| Virginia-class (SSN-774) | 66 (plan) | 23 delivered | ~$3.5 (Block V) |
| Constellation-class (FFG-62) | 20 | 0 (building) | ~$1.4 (est., rising) |
| Columbia-class (SSBN-826) | 12 | 0 (building) | ~$9.5 (lead ship, est.) |

### Why It Persists

- **Requirements Creep**: Each successive ship class is loaded with additional requirements by the Navy, raising costs and extending development timelines.
- **Concurrency**: Building ships before designs are finalized leads to expensive rework. The Ford-class carrier suffered from concurrency in its development of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), and Advanced Weapons Elevators.
- **Low Production Rates**: Building only 5-7 combatant ships per year means production lines are inefficient. Submarine production at 1.2-1.4 boats per year instead of the planned 2 per year raises per-unit costs substantially.
- **Lack of Competition**: With only 1-2 shipyards capable of building any given ship type, there is limited competitive pressure on cost.

## 3. China's Rapid Naval Expansion

### The Problem

China has executed the most rapid peacetime naval buildup in modern history. The PLAN has grown from a coastal defense force to a blue-water navy in roughly two decades, surpassing the U.S. Navy in hull count and challenging it in several key capability areas.

### Why This Happened

- **State-Directed Shipbuilding**: China's shipbuilding industry is state-owned and state-directed. The government can order ships without competing for budget authority against other priorities in the same way the U.S. Congress must. Chinese shipyards build both military and commercial vessels, maintaining a workforce and industrial base far larger than their American counterparts.
- **Commercial Shipbuilding Dominance**: China builds approximately 50% of the world's commercial ships by gross tonnage. This massive commercial base provides a warm industrial foundation -- skilled workers, supply chains, and construction techniques -- that directly supports military shipbuilding.
- **Lower Labor Costs**: Chinese shipyard workers earn a fraction of their American counterparts, and Chinese environmental, labor, and safety regulations are less costly to comply with.
- **Strategic Prioritization**: The PRC's leadership has consistently prioritized naval modernization as essential to its strategy of displacing U.S. influence in the Western Pacific, reunifying Taiwan, and asserting control over the South China Sea. General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly called for "building a strong maritime country."

### Comparison of Shipbuilding Capacity

| Metric | United States | China |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Shipbuilding Capacity (est. tonnage) | ~0.1% of global commercial output | ~50% of global commercial output |
| Naval Shipyards | 7 private + 4 public | 6+ major naval yards |
| Annual Naval Vessel Output | 5-7 combatants | 15-20 combatants (est.) |
| Surge Potential | Limited | Substantial (commercial yards adaptable) |

## 4. Over-Reliance on Carrier Strike Groups

### The Problem

The aircraft carrier has been the centerpiece of American naval power since World War II. But the carrier's dominance is increasingly challenged by precision-guided anti-ship missiles, including China's DF-21D and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles, which can threaten carriers at ranges exceeding 1,500 km. The concentration of roughly 5,000 sailors and 70+ aircraft on a single $13 billion platform creates a high-value target whose loss would be both a military and psychological catastrophe.

### Why It Persists

- **Institutional Culture**: The carrier community dominates Navy leadership. The path to four-star rank runs through carrier command, creating institutional incentives to protect carrier programs even when strategic logic may favor alternative investments.
- **Sunk Costs and Path Dependence**: Billions have been invested in carrier infrastructure -- shipyards, air wings, training pipelines, logistics. Shifting away from the carrier would strand these investments and require decades to rebuild around a different concept.
- **Power Projection Utility**: Carriers remain the most visible symbol of American military power and the most versatile platform for missions short of high-end war -- humanitarian assistance, deterrent presence, strike operations against lesser adversaries. No alternative platform provides the same political signaling and operational flexibility.
- **Political Economy**: Carrier construction supports tens of thousands of jobs at Huntington Ingalls Industries in Newport News, Virginia, and across a nationwide supply chain. Congressional support for carriers is bipartisan and durable.

## 5. Deferred Maintenance and Readiness Decline

### The Problem

The Navy's four public shipyards -- which perform virtually all maintenance on nuclear-powered ships -- suffer from decades of deferred infrastructure investment. Dry docks date to World War II or earlier. The cumulative maintenance backlog is estimated at $21 billion.

### Why It Persists

- **Budget Competition**: Maintenance and infrastructure compete for funds with new ship construction. New ships are politically visible; dry dock repairs are not. Congress and Navy leadership consistently prioritize procurement over sustainment.
- **Workforce Shortfalls**: Public shipyards have struggled to recruit and retain skilled workers, particularly in high-cost-of-living areas like Hawaii, Washington, and Virginia.
- **Operational Demand**: Combatant commanders demand continuous forward presence, which pressures the Navy to deploy ships even when maintenance is due. Ships are deployed with known material deficiencies, accelerating wear and extending subsequent maintenance periods.
- **The 2017 Collisions**: The fatal collisions of USS *Fitzgerald* and USS *John S. McCain* in 2017, which killed 17 sailors, were directly linked to training and maintenance shortfalls caused by excessive operational tempo. The Navy's own investigations confirmed that the fleet was stretched beyond sustainable limits.

## 6. Strategic Ambiguity Regarding Taiwan

### The Problem

The United States maintains a policy of "strategic ambiguity" regarding whether it would defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack. While the Taiwan Relations Act (1979) commits the U.S. to provide Taiwan with defensive arms and to maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force that would jeopardize Taiwan's security, it does not contain an explicit defense commitment. This ambiguity creates uncertainty in both deterrence and force planning.

### Why It Persists

- **Diplomatic Complexity**: An explicit defense commitment would be perceived by Beijing as a fundamental violation of the "One China" framework and could precipitate the crisis it seeks to prevent.
- **Taiwan's Own Behavior**: An unconditional commitment could embolden Taiwan to pursue formal independence, triggering Chinese military action.
- **Domestic Politics**: While presidential statements have become increasingly explicit (Presidents Biden and Trump both made statements suggesting the U.S. would defend Taiwan), these statements have not been formalized in policy, reflecting the political difficulty of committing to a potential war with a nuclear-armed peer.
- **Force Planning Difficulty**: Without clarity on the commitment, the Navy cannot optimize its force structure for the Taiwan contingency. Too much preparation risks provocation; too little risks deterrence failure.

## 7. Multi-Theater Demand on a Shrinking Fleet

### The Problem

The U.S. Navy must simultaneously maintain credible presence in the Indo-Pacific (deterring China), the Middle East (countering Iran, defending against Houthi attacks), the European theater (supporting NATO against Russian maritime threats), and global sea lanes. A 296-ship Navy cannot sustain the presence requirements of all these theaters.

### Why It Persists

- **Alliance Commitments**: The U.S. has mutual defense treaties and security partnerships that create expectations of naval presence across every major maritime region.
- **The 3:1 Deployment Ratio**: For every ship deployed, approximately two more are in maintenance or training. A 296-ship fleet yields roughly 100 ships available for deployment at any time -- insufficient to maintain adequate presence in three or more major theaters.
- **Crisis Response**: Unplanned crises (like the Houthi campaign) absorb ships that were allocated to other theaters, creating cascading presence gaps.
- **Allies' Limited Capacity**: While allied navies collectively possess significant capability, few can operate independently of U.S. logistics and command-and-control infrastructure for sustained periods.

## 8. Insufficient Investment in Asymmetric Capabilities

### The Problem

While China has invested heavily in asymmetric systems designed to counter U.S. naval advantages -- anti-ship ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons, submarine-launched cruise missiles, sea mines -- the U.S. has been slower to develop its own asymmetric counters.

### Key Gaps

- **Mine Warfare**: The Navy has chronically underinvested in mine countermeasures and offensive mining. The LCS mine countermeasures mission package was cancelled. The Navy has no dedicated mine warfare vessel in production.
- **Unmanned Systems**: While programs like the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV) and Extra-Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (XLUUV) are in development, none has reached operational deployment at scale.
- **Land-Based Anti-Ship Missiles**: The Marine Corps' Force Design 2030 envisions land-based anti-ship missile batteries deployed on Pacific islands, but funding and basing access remain uncertain.
- **Offensive Mining**: Offensive sea mines are among the cheapest and most effective naval weapons, but the Navy has limited stocks and has not invested in next-generation autonomous mines.
