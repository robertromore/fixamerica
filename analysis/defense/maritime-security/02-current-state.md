# Maritime Security: Current State

## U.S. Navy Fleet Composition

### Battle Force Inventory

As of early 2025, the U.S. Navy operates approximately 296 battle force ships, well below the 355-ship goal established in the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act and reaffirmed in multiple Navy force structure assessments.

| Ship Type | Current Count | 355-Ship Plan | Gap |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----|
| Aircraft Carriers (CVN) | 11 | 12 | -1 |
| Large Surface Combatants (CG/DDG) | 92 | 104 | -12 |
| Small Surface Combatants (LCS/FFG) | 25 | 52 | -27 |
| Attack Submarines (SSN) | 49 | 66 | -17 |
| Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBN) | 14 | 12 | +2 |
| Guided Missile Submarines (SSGN) | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Amphibious Warfare Ships | 31 | 38 | -7 |
| Combat Logistics Force | 30 | 32 | -2 |
| Mine Warfare | 8 | 18 | -10 |
| Expeditionary Support | 36 | 21 | +15 |
| **Total** | **~296** | **355** | **-59** |

### Submarine Force

The submarine force is widely regarded as the U.S. Navy's most critical asymmetric advantage. The current attack submarine fleet of 49 SSNs is projected to decline to as few as 42 by the early 2030s due to retirements outpacing new construction, even as demand for submarine deployments has increased.

- **Virginia-class (SSN-774)**: The Navy's current attack submarine. Planned production rate of 2 per year, but delivery has slipped to roughly 1.2-1.4 per year due to supply chain and workforce constraints.
- **Columbia-class (SSBN-826)**: The replacement for the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine. The lead boat is under construction, with 12 planned. This program consumes significant shipyard capacity and workforce, crowding out Virginia-class production.
- **AUKUS Pillar 2**: Under the trilateral security partnership with Australia and the UK, Australia will acquire Virginia-class submarines beginning in the early 2030s, placing additional demand on the U.S. industrial base.

### Carrier Operations

The Navy maintains 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, operating on a 36-month Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP) cycle. At any given time, approximately 3-4 carriers are deployed or surge-ready.

- **Ford-class (CVN-78)**: The newest carrier class, designed to reduce operating costs and increase sortie generation rates. USS *Gerald R. Ford* (CVN-78) completed its first deployment in 2023. USS *John F. Kennedy* (CVN-79) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Industries.
- **Nimitz-class**: Ten carriers remain in service, with the oldest, USS *Nimitz* (CVN-68), scheduled for decommissioning in the late 2020s.

### Surface Combatants

- **Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51)**: The backbone of the surface fleet with 73 ships in commission. Flight III variants with the AN/SPY-6 radar are in production.
- **Ticonderoga-class (CG-47)**: Aging guided missile cruisers being decommissioned; 9 remain in service. No direct replacement is currently programmed.
- **Constellation-class (FFG-62)**: The new guided-missile frigate, intended to replace the troubled Littoral Combat Ship program. The lead ship, USS *Constellation*, has experienced significant construction delays and cost growth. Originally planned for delivery in 2026, it is now expected no earlier than 2029.
- **Littoral Combat Ship (LCS)**: The 25-ship LCS fleet has been plagued by reliability issues, limited combat capability, and the cancellation of multiple mission modules. The Navy is already decommissioning ships well short of their expected service lives.

## PLA Navy Expansion

### Fleet Size and Trajectory

The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has become the world's largest navy by hull count, with over 370 battle force ships as of 2024. The Office of Naval Intelligence projects the PLAN will grow to approximately 400 vessels by 2030 and 440 by 2035.

| PLAN Capability | Current Estimate | 2030 Projection |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Total Battle Force Ships | 370+ | ~400 |
| Aircraft Carriers | 3 (Liaoning, Shandong, Fujian) | 4-5 |
| Modern Destroyers (Type 052D/055) | 45+ | 60+ |
| Modern Frigates (Type 054A/B) | 40+ | 50+ |
| Attack Submarines (SSN) | 6 | 10+ |
| Diesel-Electric Submarines (SS/SSP) | 48+ | 50+ |
| Amphibious Assault Ships (Type 075/076) | 4+ | 6-8 |

### Qualitative Improvements

China's naval expansion is not merely quantitative. Key qualitative advances include:

- **Type 055 Cruiser**: A 13,000-ton large surface combatant with 112 vertical launch cells, advanced phased-array radar, and integrated electric propulsion. Eight are in service with more under construction. This vessel is comparable to the U.S. Ticonderoga-class in capability.
- **DF-21D and DF-26 Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles (ASBM)**: Land-based "carrier killer" missiles with ranges exceeding 1,500 km, designed to target U.S. carriers operating in the Western Pacific.
- **YJ-21 Hypersonic Anti-Ship Missile**: Ship-launched hypersonic weapon that complicates U.S. missile defense. Deployed on Type 055 destroyers.
- **Submarine Modernization**: Introduction of the Type 095 SSN, expected to be significantly quieter than previous Chinese nuclear submarines, narrowing the acoustic gap with U.S. boats.
- **Fujian (CV-18)**: China's third and largest aircraft carrier, featuring electromagnetic catapults (EMALS) similar to the U.S. Ford-class, enabling operation of fixed-wing early warning aircraft.

## South China Sea Tensions

### China's Claims and Militarization

China claims sovereignty over virtually the entire South China Sea through the "nine-dash line," a claim rejected by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in *Philippines v. China* (2016). Despite the ruling, China has:

- Built and militarized seven artificial islands in the Spratly Islands, equipping them with airstrips, radar installations, anti-ship cruise missiles (YJ-12B), and surface-to-air missile systems (HQ-9B).
- Deployed a maritime militia of hundreds of fishing vessels used to harass other nations' fishermen and coast guard forces.
- Established an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea and may impose one over the South China Sea.
- Maintained near-constant coast guard and naval presence around contested features such as Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal.

### Second Thomas Shoal Confrontation

The ongoing standoff at Second Thomas Shoal (Ayungin Shoal) has become the most dangerous flashpoint in the South China Sea. The Philippines maintains a small marine garrison aboard the grounded ship BRP *Sierra Madre*. Chinese coast guard vessels have repeatedly used water cannons, lasers, and ramming tactics to obstruct Philippine resupply missions, causing injuries to Filipino sailors.

The U.S. has affirmed that the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty (1951) applies to armed attacks on Philippine forces in the South China Sea, raising the stakes of any further escalation.

## Freedom of Navigation Operations

### FONOPS Tempo

The U.S. Navy conducts approximately 8-12 FONOPS per year in the South China Sea alone, challenging unlawful maritime claims by China and other coastal states. These operations assert rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), even though the United States has not ratified UNCLOS.

| FONOPS Category | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Innocent Passage | Transiting through territorial seas without stopping or engaging in prohibited activities. | Transiting within 12 nm of Mischief Reef (an artificial feature that does not generate territorial sea entitlements). |
| High Seas Freedoms | Exercising navigation rights beyond territorial seas, including within Exclusive Economic Zones. | Operating within China's claimed EEZ around the Paracel Islands. |
| Transit Passage | Exercising the right of transit through international straits. | Transiting the Taiwan Strait, which the U.S. characterizes as an international waterway. |

### Taiwan Strait Transits

The U.S. Navy conducts roughly one transit per month through the Taiwan Strait, reinforcing the position that the strait is an international waterway. PLA Navy and Air Force assets routinely shadow these transits, and the frequency and aggressiveness of PLA intercepts has increased markedly since 2022.

## Key Maritime Chokepoints

| Chokepoint | Daily Oil Transit (million barrels) | Strategic Significance | Primary Threat |
|------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Strait of Hormuz | 21.0 | ~30% of global seaborne oil | Iran (mines, fast attack craft, ASCMs) |
| Strait of Malacca | 16.0 | Primary route between Indian and Pacific Oceans | Piracy, potential PRC leverage |
| Suez Canal | 9.0 | Europe-Asia trade route | Regional instability, Houthi attacks |
| Bab el-Mandeb | 6.2 | Gateway to Red Sea and Suez | Houthi anti-ship missiles and drones |
| Taiwan Strait | N/A (critical trade route) | ~50% of global container traffic | PRC naval/air forces |
| Panama Canal | 1.0 | Atlantic-Pacific link | Drought-related capacity restrictions |

## Red Sea and Houthi Threat

Since late 2023, Houthi forces in Yemen have launched sustained attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb Strait using anti-ship ballistic missiles (ASBMs), anti-ship cruise missiles, explosive uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), and one-way attack drones.

- Over 100 attacks on commercial vessels were recorded between November 2023 and mid-2025.
- The U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian and subsequent strikes under Operation Poseidon Archer have degraded but not eliminated the Houthi threat.
- Major shipping lines have rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope, adding 10-14 days and significant fuel costs to Europe-Asia voyages.
- The Red Sea operations have consumed significant Navy resources, including Arleigh Burke-class destroyers firing expensive SM-2 and SM-6 missiles to intercept relatively cheap Houthi weapons -- an unfavorable cost exchange ratio.

## Shipbuilding Industrial Base

### Current Capacity

The U.S. maintains seven major private shipyards capable of building naval combatants:

| Shipyard | Location | Primary Programs |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Huntington Ingalls Industries - Newport News | Newport News, VA | Aircraft carriers, submarines |
| General Dynamics Electric Boat | Groton, CT / Quonset Point, RI | Submarines |
| General Dynamics Bath Iron Works | Bath, ME | Destroyers |
| General Dynamics NASSCO | San Diego, CA | Auxiliary/logistics ships |
| Fincantieri Marinette Marine | Marinette, WI | Frigates (FFG-62) |
| Austal USA | Mobile, AL | Littoral Combat Ships, EPFs |
| Bollinger Shipyards | Multiple, LA/MS | Heritage-class cutters (USCG) |

Additionally, four public (Navy-owned) shipyards perform maintenance and modernization:

- Norfolk Naval Shipyard (Portsmouth, VA)
- Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (Kittery, ME)
- Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (Bremerton, WA)
- Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard (Pearl Harbor, HI)

### Workforce Challenges

- The private shipbuilding workforce has declined from over 180,000 production workers in the 1980s to approximately 42,000 today.
- Submarine construction at Electric Boat and Newport News is constrained by a shortage of welders, pipefitters, and other skilled trades workers. Electric Boat alone needs to hire roughly 4,000 additional workers by 2030.
- Public shipyards face a maintenance backlog of approximately $21 billion in deferred infrastructure investment (Navy Shipyard Infrastructure Optimization Plan).
- Submarine maintenance periods (availabilities) routinely exceed scheduled duration by 20-40%, reducing the number of attack submarines available for deployment.

## Readiness and Maintenance

The Navy's surface fleet and submarine force face persistent readiness challenges:

- **Surface Ship Maintenance**: In FY2024, approximately 37% of surface ship maintenance periods were completed on time. The remainder overran, reducing operational availability.
- **Submarine Maintenance Backlog**: Attack submarine maintenance delays have resulted in an estimated loss of over 30 submarine-years of operational availability over the past decade, according to GAO.
- **Crew Shortages**: The Navy faces shortfalls in critical ratings including nuclear-trained personnel, electronics technicians, and information warfare specialists. Retention of mid-career officers and senior enlisted remains a challenge.
