# Maritime Security: Opposition

## Overview

Reforming U.S. maritime security -- whether by changing fleet composition, revitalizing the shipbuilding base, or restructuring naval strategy -- faces opposition from multiple directions. Some resistance is institutional, rooted in organizational culture and bureaucratic self-interest. Some is economic, reflecting the financial interests of the defense industrial base and the communities that depend on it. Some is strategic, reflecting genuine disagreements about threat assessment and the proper role of naval power. Understanding these sources of opposition is essential to crafting politically viable reforms.

## Carrier Aviation Community

### Who They Are

The carrier aviation community (often called "the brown shoes" from their traditional uniform) has dominated Navy leadership since World War II. The career path to Chief of Naval Operations and other four-star positions runs overwhelmingly through carrier command. Naval aviators and aviation-aligned officers hold disproportionate influence over strategy, requirements, and procurement.

### What They Oppose

- **Reducing the carrier fleet below 11**: Any proposal to operate fewer than 11 carrier strike groups is met with fierce institutional resistance, even though some analysts argue that money saved by retiring older carriers could fund larger numbers of distributed, survivable platforms.
- **Shifting resources to submarines and unmanned systems**: While the carrier community does not publicly oppose submarines, it resists budget reallocations that would reduce carrier air wing investment, carrier construction, or carrier-centric operational concepts.
- **Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO)**: DMO envisions spreading offensive and defensive capability across many smaller, harder-to-target platforms. While officially adopted as doctrine, implementation threatens the carrier's primacy and is resisted in practice through requirements processes that protect carrier funding.

### Why They Oppose Reform

- **Institutional Identity**: The carrier is the most visible symbol of American naval power. Admirals who spent their careers on flight decks have deep personal and professional investment in the platform.
- **Proven Utility**: Carriers have been extraordinarily useful in every conflict since World War II. The argument "carriers have always been decisive" carries institutional weight, even if future conflicts may look different.
- **Risk Aversion**: Untested alternatives (unmanned systems, distributed forces) are seen as higher risk than proven platforms. The Navy's culture rewards caution in acquisition.

### Cited Justifications

- Carriers provide unmatched operational flexibility, functioning as mobile airfields that can project power without requiring access to land bases.
- No adversary has successfully attacked a U.S. carrier since World War II.
- The "carrier killer" missile threat is overstated; carriers operate with extensive multi-layered defenses.

### Counter-Evidence

- CSBA wargames and RAND analyses have repeatedly shown that carriers operating within the range of Chinese A2/AD systems face severe survivability challenges. See CSBA, *Winning the Salvo Competition* (2014) and RAND, *The U.S.-China Military Scorecard* (2015).
- The Ford-class carrier program has exceeded $13 billion per hull -- a concentration of investment that reduces the total number of platforms the Navy can field.
- The loss of even one carrier in combat would eliminate approximately 15% of the Navy's fixed-wing aviation capacity and be a devastating psychological blow.

## Shipbuilding Industrial Base

### Who They Are

The shipbuilding industrial base includes the prime contractors (HII, General Dynamics, Fincantieri), their extensive supplier networks across 48+ states, and the congressional delegations that represent shipyard communities. The Shipbuilders Council of America is the primary industry lobbying organization.

### What They Oppose

- **Foreign shipbuilding for the U.S. Navy**: Proposals to build auxiliary or support ships in allied foreign shipyards (Japan, South Korea) to free up U.S. capacity for combatants are fiercely opposed as threats to American jobs and industrial sovereignty.
- **Cancellation of legacy programs**: Even when programs are failing (as with the LCS), the shipyards and their political allies resist cancellation because of the jobs at stake.
- **Design simplification**: Industry profits from complex, customized designs. Proposals for commercial-standard ships, modular construction, or simplified warships threaten the premium that defense shipbuilding commands.
- **Competition from new entrants**: Established shipbuilders resist policies that would bring new competitors into the market, even though expanded competition could increase capacity and reduce costs.

### Why They Oppose Reform

- **Business Model**: Defense shipbuilding operates on cost-plus contracts that incentivize complexity and scope growth rather than cost reduction.
- **Workforce Protection**: Shipyard workers are represented by skilled trade unions, and shipyard communities depend heavily on Navy contracts. Any change that threatens jobs generates intense political opposition.
- **Sunk Investment**: Shipyards have invested in tooling, facilities, and workforce training for specific ship classes. Changing programs means writing off those investments.

### Political Dimensions

- Huntington Ingalls Industries is the largest industrial employer in Virginia and Mississippi. General Dynamics Bath Iron Works is the largest private employer in Maine. These political facts shape congressional votes on shipbuilding.
- Shipbuilding spending is distributed across almost every state through the supplier network, giving the industry broad congressional support.
- The Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus is one of the largest caucuses on Capitol Hill.

## Army and Air Force Budget Competitors

### Who They Are

The U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force compete with the Navy for shares of the defense topline within the Department of Defense.

### What They Oppose

- **Increasing the Navy's budget share at their expense**: The defense budget is not unlimited. Every additional dollar for shipbuilding is a dollar not spent on Army modernization (tanks, long-range fires) or Air Force procurement (F-35, B-21, Next Generation Air Dominance).
- **Maritime-centric strategy**: The Army and Air Force have institutional interests in strategies that emphasize land and air power, respectively. An Indo-Pacific-centric strategy that prioritizes naval forces implicitly devalues continental and air-dominance strategies.

### Their Arguments

- The Army argues that land-based fires (long-range missiles, hypersonic weapons) can contribute to maritime security more cost-effectively than additional ships. The Army's Multi-Domain Task Forces, equipped with the Typhon mid-range capability and Dark Eagle hypersonic weapon, are designed to engage naval targets from land.
- The Air Force argues that long-range bombers (B-21 Raider) and stealth fighters (F-35, NGAD) can perform anti-ship and sea-denial missions that overlap with naval capabilities.
- Both services argue that excessive focus on the Indo-Pacific neglects the European theater (Army) and the strategic nuclear mission (Air Force).

## Fiscal Hawks and Budget Reducers

### Who They Are

Members of Congress, think tanks, and advocacy organizations that prioritize deficit reduction and oppose increases in defense spending.

### What They Oppose

- **A 355-ship Navy**: Achieving and sustaining a 355-ship fleet would require annual shipbuilding budgets of $30-35 billion, roughly double the current level, according to CBO estimates. Fiscal hawks view this as unaffordable.
- **Defense topline increases**: Any proposal to grow the Navy must be funded either by increasing the defense topline or by cutting other programs. Fiscal conservatives resist topline increases.

### Their Arguments

- The U.S. already spends more on defense than the next 10 nations combined. The problem is not insufficient spending but inefficient allocation.
- The Navy should reform its acquisition process and reduce per-hull costs before asking for more money.
- Diplomatic and economic tools can supplement military presence, reducing the need for a larger fleet.

## Anti-Interventionists and Non-Interventionists

### Who They Are

A cross-ideological coalition that opposes the global military posture that a large Navy enables. This includes some libertarians, progressives, and nationalist populists.

### What They Oppose

- **Forward presence**: The concept that the U.S. must maintain naval forces deployed worldwide is seen as an unnecessary extension of empire.
- **FONOPS as provocation**: Critics argue that FONOPS in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait transits are unnecessarily provocative and increase the risk of war with a nuclear-armed China.
- **Alliance entanglement**: The mutual defense treaty with the Philippines and the implicit commitment to Taiwan are seen as risks that could drag the U.S. into a war over stakes not commensurate with the costs.

### Their Arguments

- The U.S. should reduce its global military footprint and allow regional powers to balance China on their own.
- The South China Sea is not a vital U.S. interest worth fighting over.
- A war with China over Taiwan would be catastrophic and is not worth the risk, regardless of the outcome.

### Counter-Evidence

- The collapse of maritime security would disrupt global trade on which the U.S. economy depends. Approximately $5.3 trillion in trade transits the South China Sea annually.
- Historical precedent (1930s) suggests that allowing aggressive powers to revise the international order by force leads to larger and more costly conflicts.
- Allied confidence in U.S. commitments is a strategic asset; abandoning allies would trigger proliferation and hedging behavior that would worsen the security environment.

## Environmental and Regulatory Opposition

### Who They Are

Environmental organizations and regulatory agencies that raise concerns about the environmental impact of naval operations, shipbuilding, and base construction.

### What They Oppose

- **SONAR and marine mammals**: Environmental groups have challenged the Navy's use of active sonar, which can harm marine mammals. Litigation under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and National Environmental Policy Act has occasionally restricted training areas and schedules.
- **Base expansion**: Construction of new naval facilities or expansion of existing ones in the Pacific faces opposition from local communities and environmental groups concerned about habitat destruction, pollution, and cultural heritage.
- **Shipyard pollution**: Naval shipyards and their suppliers generate hazardous waste, including heavy metals, solvents, and radioactive materials from nuclear ship work. Communities near shipyards have raised environmental justice concerns.

### Their Arguments

- National security does not exempt the Navy from environmental law.
- The Navy can adapt training and operations to minimize environmental harm without sacrificing readiness.
- Military PFAS contamination at bases and shipyards is a serious public health concern requiring remediation.
