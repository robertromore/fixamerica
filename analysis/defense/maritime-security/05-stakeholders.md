# Maritime Security: Stakeholders

## Overview

U.S. maritime security involves a complex web of military services, government agencies, private industry, allied nations, and international organizations. Understanding who has power, who is affected, and who shapes policy is essential to evaluating proposals for reform.

## Military Stakeholders

### U.S. Navy

- **Role**: The primary service responsible for sea control, power projection, strategic deterrence (via SSBNs), and freedom of navigation operations.
- **Key Commands**:
    - **U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM)**: The combatant command responsible for the Indo-Pacific theater, the highest-priority maritime region. Headquartered at Camp H.M. Smith, Hawaii.
    - **U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM)**: Responsible for the Middle East, including the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and Arabian Sea.
    - **U.S. European Command (EUCOM)**: Responsible for the European theater, including the Mediterranean and Arctic.
    - **U.S. Fleet Forces Command**: Responsible for training and readiness of Atlantic Fleet forces.
    - **U.S. Pacific Fleet**: Operational command of Pacific-based naval forces.
    - **U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/Sixth Fleet**: Operational command in the European and African theaters.
- **Interests**: Maintaining or growing fleet size, securing shipbuilding budget, preserving carrier aviation as the primary power projection platform, maintaining the submarine advantage.
- **Influence**: High. The Navy is one of the three military departments within the Department of Defense and has a dedicated civilian leadership (Secretary of the Navy, Under Secretary) and uniformed leadership (Chief of Naval Operations, Vice Chief).

### U.S. Marine Corps

- **Role**: The Marine Corps is a naval service that provides expeditionary forces for operations ashore launched from the sea. Under Force Design 2030, the Marines are transforming into a lighter, more distributed force optimized for operations within the weapons engagement zone in the Indo-Pacific.
- **Key Initiatives**:
    - **Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations (EABO)**: Deploying small, mobile, lethal units on Pacific islands to deny sea control to adversaries using land-based anti-ship missiles (Naval Strike Missile) and sensor networks.
    - **Stand-in Forces**: Marine units designed to operate within an adversary's A2/AD umbrella, providing targeting data and fires to support the joint force.
- **Interests**: Sufficient amphibious shipping to support dispersed operations, integration with Navy distributed maritime operations, fielding anti-ship missiles and long-range fires.
- **Influence**: Moderate to high. The Commandant of the Marine Corps reports to the Secretary of the Navy and sits on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

### U.S. Coast Guard

- **Role**: The Coast Guard is a military service within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that enforces maritime law, conducts search and rescue, protects ports and waterways, and maintains aids to navigation. It also conducts operations in support of combatant commanders.
- **Key Programs**:
    - **National Security Cutters (NSC)**: 418-foot Legend-class cutters for open-ocean missions.
    - **Offshore Patrol Cutters (OPC)**: Replacement for the aging Medium Endurance Cutters.
    - **Polar Security Cutters**: Icebreakers for Arctic operations, addressing a critical gap as the Arctic opens due to climate change.
- **Interests**: Fleet recapitalization, adequate funding (the USCG budget is a fraction of the Navy's), recognition of its role in great-power competition.
- **Influence**: Moderate. Housed within DHS rather than DoD, the Coast Guard often receives less attention and funding despite its critical maritime role.

## Government Stakeholders

### Department of Defense (Office of the Secretary of Defense)

- **Role**: Sets defense policy, issues guidance to military departments, and oversees the defense budget.
- **Key Officials**: Secretary of Defense, Under Secretary for Policy, Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment, Assistant Secretary for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs.
- **Interests**: Balancing competing service priorities within the defense topline, ensuring force posture aligns with the National Defense Strategy.

### Department of State

- **Role**: Manages diplomatic aspects of maritime security, including freedom of navigation policy, the South China Sea, Taiwan relations, and international maritime law.
- **Key Offices**: Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs.
- **Interests**: Maintaining rules-based maritime order through diplomatic means, managing the U.S.-China relationship, strengthening alliances.

### National Security Council

- **Role**: Coordinates interagency policy on maritime security issues, including Taiwan policy, FONOPS approval, and crisis management.
- **Interests**: Preventing escalation while maintaining deterrence, integrating diplomatic, economic, and military instruments.

### Congress

- **Role**: Authorizes and appropriates funds for naval shipbuilding, sets fleet size requirements, conducts oversight through the Armed Services and Appropriations committees.
- **Key Committees**:
    - Senate Armed Services Committee (Seapower Subcommittee)
    - House Armed Services Committee (Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee)
    - Senate and House Appropriations Committees (Defense Subcommittees)
- **Interests**: Varies by member. Generally supportive of Navy shipbuilding (which creates jobs in their districts), but divided on fleet composition, threat assessment, and budget topline.
- **Influence**: Very high. Congress controls the purse strings and has frequently added or cut ships from the Navy's shipbuilding plan.

## Industry Stakeholders

### Shipbuilding Prime Contractors

| Company | Key Programs | Employment (Approx.) | Location |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) | Aircraft carriers, submarines, amphibious ships | 44,000 | Newport News, VA; Pascagoula, MS |
| General Dynamics (Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works, NASSCO) | Submarines, destroyers, auxiliaries | 35,000+ | Groton, CT; Bath, ME; San Diego, CA |
| Fincantieri Marinette Marine | Constellation-class frigates | 2,500+ | Marinette, WI |
| Austal USA | LCS, Expeditionary Fast Transport | 4,000+ | Mobile, AL |
| Bollinger Shipyards | USCG Heritage-class cutters | 3,000+ | Louisiana, Mississippi |

- **Interests**: Stable, long-term procurement plans that enable workforce investment; favorable contract terms; protection of legacy programs; avoiding competition from foreign shipyards.
- **Influence**: Very high. The defense shipbuilding industry employs tens of thousands of workers across dozens of states and is represented by powerful lobbying organizations and congressional delegations.

### Defense Technology Companies

- **Key Players**: Lockheed Martin (Aegis Combat System), Raytheon/RTX (SM-6 missiles, sensors), Northrop Grumman (E-2D Hawkeye, Triton UAS), Boeing (MQ-25 Stingray, P-8 Poseidon), L3Harris (unmanned systems, electronic warfare).
- **Interests**: Securing contracts for ship systems, weapons, sensors, and unmanned platforms; protecting their share of the Navy's procurement and R&D budgets.
- **Influence**: High. These companies are among the largest defense contractors and maintain extensive lobbying operations and congressional relationships.

## Allied Navies

### Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF)

- **Fleet**: Approximately 50 major combatants, including 4 helicopter carriers (2 being converted to carry F-35Bs), advanced Aegis destroyers (Maya-class), and a modern submarine fleet of 24 boats.
- **Significance**: The most capable allied navy in the Indo-Pacific. Japan has significantly expanded its defense posture, including acquiring counterstrike capabilities (Tomahawk cruise missiles) and doubling its defense budget.
- **Interoperability**: Extensive. U.S. Navy and JMSDF conduct regular bilateral and multilateral exercises, share basing (Yokosuka, Sasebo), and operate compatible systems (Aegis).

### Royal Australian Navy (RAN)

- **Fleet**: ~12 major combatants, including Hobart-class destroyers with Aegis and Collins-class submarines (to be replaced under AUKUS).
- **Significance**: Australia is a treaty ally with growing capability and willingness to invest in Indo-Pacific security. AUKUS represents a generational commitment.
- **Interoperability**: High and deepening. The AUKUS Pillar 1 submarine program will create unprecedented integration of the U.S., UK, and Australian submarine forces.

### Royal Navy (United Kingdom)

- **Fleet**: ~30 major combatants, including 2 Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, Type 45 destroyers, and Astute-class nuclear attack submarines.
- **Significance**: The UK maintains global reach and is the closest U.S. naval partner. The 2021 deployment of HMS *Queen Elizabeth* Carrier Strike Group to the Indo-Pacific signaled British commitment to the region.
- **Interoperability**: Very high. The "special relationship" extends to naval operations, intelligence sharing (Five Eyes), and now submarine technology transfer (AUKUS).

### Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN)

- **Fleet**: ~20 major combatants, including Sejong the Great-class Aegis destroyers and modern diesel-electric submarines.
- **Significance**: Critical to Korean Peninsula contingencies and increasingly relevant to broader Indo-Pacific security.
- **Interoperability**: Good. U.S. and ROK naval forces conduct regular exercises and share basing at Busan.

### Other Partner Navies

- **India**: Operating 1 aircraft carrier with a second under construction, modern destroyers and frigates, and a growing submarine fleet. India is a critical partner through the Quad (U.S., Japan, Australia, India) but maintains strategic autonomy and does not participate in formal alliances.
- **Philippines**: A treaty ally with a small, underequipped navy, but critical to South China Sea operations due to geographic position. The U.S. has expanded access to Philippine bases under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).
- **Singapore**: Hosts a U.S. Navy logistics facility and is a key partner for operations in the Strait of Malacca.
- **Taiwan**: Operates a navy of approximately 90 vessels, focused on anti-invasion defense. The U.S. provides defensive arms under the Taiwan Relations Act but does not have a mutual defense treaty.

## Commercial Shipping Industry

- **Stakeholders**: Major shipping companies (Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, COSCO), the International Chamber of Shipping, port authorities, marine insurance providers (Lloyd's of London).
- **Interests**: Secure and predictable sea lanes, low insurance premiums, avoidance of conflict zones. The rerouting of shipping away from the Red Sea due to Houthi attacks has cost the industry billions.
- **Influence**: Moderate. The commercial shipping industry does not have direct influence over military policy but exerts economic pressure through insurance rates, route choices, and lobbying of governments to maintain maritime security.

## International Organizations

- **United Nations**: UNCLOS (which the U.S. has not ratified) provides the legal framework for maritime zones, navigation rights, and dispute resolution. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets shipping safety and environmental standards.
- **International Court of Justice / Permanent Court of Arbitration**: The 2016 PCA ruling in *Philippines v. China* remains the most significant legal decision on South China Sea claims, even though China refuses to comply.
- **ASEAN**: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations has attempted to negotiate a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea with China, but progress has been slow, and critics argue that China uses negotiations to delay without conceding.

## Affected Populations

- **U.S. Military Personnel and Families**: Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who serve at sea, often on extended deployments of 7-9 months, with significant impacts on mental health, family stability, and retention.
- **Shipyard Workers**: The approximately 42,000 private shipyard production workers and 38,000 public shipyard workers whose livelihoods depend on Navy procurement and maintenance funding.
- **Global Trade-Dependent Economies**: Virtually every nation depends on secure sea lanes. Disruption to the Strait of Malacca alone would affect the economies of Japan, South Korea, China, and Southeast Asia.
- **Coastal Populations in Contested Areas**: Filipino fishermen excluded from traditional fishing grounds by Chinese maritime militia; Taiwanese citizens facing the threat of blockade or invasion; Yemeni coastal communities affected by strikes on Houthi targets.
