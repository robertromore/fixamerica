# Maritime Security: Overview

## Overview

The United States Navy is the foundation of American global power projection and the guarantor of the rules-based maritime order that has underpinned international trade since 1945. Approximately 90 percent of global commerce moves by sea, and the U.S. Navy's ability to ensure freedom of navigation through critical chokepoints -- the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz, the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, and the Taiwan Strait -- is essential to both American and global economic security.

Today, this maritime order faces its most serious challenge in decades. The People's Republic of China (PRC) has built the world's largest navy by hull count, surpassing 370 vessels, and is using that fleet to assert expansive and unlawful territorial claims across the South China Sea. Simultaneously, the U.S. Navy has shrunk to approximately 296 battle force ships, well below the 355-ship floor that multiple administrations and congressional mandates have identified as the minimum required to meet strategic commitments. The U.S. shipbuilding industrial base, once the arsenal of democracy, now produces roughly 5-7 combatant ships per year compared to China's estimated 15-20.

This gap between strategic requirements and available force structure represents the defining challenge of American maritime security in the 21st century. Resolving it requires not merely building more ships but rethinking how the Navy fights, what it buys, and how it sustains partnerships with allied navies that collectively still dwarf any potential adversary.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of U.S. maritime security:

- **Naval Force Posture**: The size, composition, and readiness of the U.S. fleet, including the balance between carriers, submarines, surface combatants, and amphibious ships.
- **Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS)**: The legal basis for and execution of operations challenging excessive maritime claims, particularly in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait.
- **South China Sea**: China's island-building campaign, militarization of artificial features, and the legal and strategic implications of the 2016 Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling.
- **Taiwan Strait**: The naval dimensions of cross-strait deterrence, including sea control, amphibious defense, and mine warfare.
- **Sea Lane Protection**: Safeguarding global shipping routes from state and non-state threats, including Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, and Russian threats to undersea cables.
- **Shipbuilding Industrial Base**: The decline of U.S. naval shipbuilding capacity, workforce challenges, and strategies for revitalization.
- **Maritime Alliances**: The role of allied navies -- Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, Royal Australian Navy, Royal Navy, Republic of Korea Navy -- in collective maritime security.

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Fleet Size vs. Capability**: Larger numbers of smaller, less expensive ships vs. fewer exquisite, highly capable platforms. A 355-ship fleet of current designs would cost roughly $32 billion per year to sustain -- far above current budgets.
- **Carrier-Centric vs. Distributed**: The aircraft carrier remains the Navy's primary power projection platform, but its survivability in a contested anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) environment is increasingly questioned. Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) offer an alternative but require fundamental changes to fleet architecture.
- **Pacific Priority vs. Global Presence**: The Indo-Pacific is the priority theater, but the Navy must also maintain presence in the Middle East, Europe, and other regions. Every ship deployed to the Red Sea is one unavailable for the Pacific.
- **Manned vs. Unmanned**: Unmanned surface and subsurface vessels promise to expand the fleet at lower cost, but their reliability and operational integration remain unproven at scale.
- **Readiness vs. Modernization**: Every dollar spent on maintaining aging ships is a dollar not spent on next-generation platforms. The Navy faces a persistent tension between near-term readiness and long-term transformation.
- **Deterrence vs. Provocation**: FONOPS and Taiwan Strait transits are essential to maintaining the rules-based order, but they carry escalation risk in a period of heightened great-power competition.

## Key Questions

1. Can the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base be revitalized quickly enough to close the gap with China's naval production, or must the Navy pursue a fundamentally different force design?
2. How should the Navy balance investment in aircraft carriers against submarines, unmanned systems, and distributed platforms in an A2/AD environment?
3. What is the minimum force structure required to simultaneously deter China in the Indo-Pacific and sustain operations in the Middle East and Europe?
4. How can the U.S. more effectively integrate allied naval capabilities to create combined maritime power that exceeds the sum of its parts?
5. What legal and strategic framework should govern FONOPS and Taiwan Strait operations to maximize deterrence while minimizing escalation risk?

## Vision of Success

A successful U.S. maritime security posture would:

- **Sustain Credible Deterrence**: The U.S. and allied navies maintain sufficient capability and presence to deter Chinese aggression against Taiwan and across the South China Sea, convincing PRC leadership that military adventurism would fail.
- **Ensure Freedom of Navigation**: All nations can transit international waters and straits freely, and excessive maritime claims are consistently challenged through a combination of FONOPS, legal instruments, and diplomatic pressure.
- **Rebuild the Shipbuilding Base**: A revitalized American shipbuilding industrial base produces the ships, submarines, and unmanned systems the Navy needs at a rate and cost that are strategically sustainable.
- **Field a Balanced Fleet**: The Navy operates a force of 355 or more battle force ships that is optimized for distributed operations, incorporates unmanned systems at scale, and maintains the undersea advantage that is America's asymmetric edge.
- **Deepen Maritime Alliances**: The U.S., Japan, Australia, the UK, South Korea, India, and partners in Southeast Asia operate with a level of interoperability that enables combined operations across the full spectrum of maritime missions.
- **Protect Global Commerce**: Sea lanes remain open and secure, commercial shipping operates without prohibitive risk or insurance costs, and undersea infrastructure -- cables, pipelines -- is actively defended.
