# Maritime Security: Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to restoring U.S. maritime security competitiveness over a 15-year period (2026-2040). The timeline recognizes that shipbuilding, workforce development, and strategic transformation cannot be achieved overnight, but also that the threat environment -- particularly China's trajectory toward a potential Taiwan contingency in the late 2020s to mid-2030s -- demands urgency in the near term.

The roadmap is organized into three phases: Immediate Actions (2026-2028), Mid-Term Buildup (2029-2033), and Long-Term Transformation (2034-2040).

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions (2026-2028)

**Focus**: Maximize readiness of the existing fleet, begin industrial base expansion, field available asymmetric capabilities, and strengthen alliances.

### Force Readiness

- Fully fund surface ship and submarine maintenance backlogs to return deferred availability ships to operational status.
- Surge hire at public shipyards to reduce maintenance overruns. Target: reduce average maintenance overrun from 40% to 20% by 2028.
- Extend the service life of select Arleigh Burke-class destroyers by 5 years through targeted modernization.
- Accelerate delivery of the first Constellation-class frigate (FFG-62) and resolve design and production issues at Fincantieri Marinette Marine.

### Industrial Base

- Enact the Naval Modernization and Readiness Act (see [Legislation](11-legislation.md)) establishing a 355-ship floor and shipbuilding workforce development program.
- Begin SIOP Phase 1 investments at all four public shipyards. Priority: Norfolk and Pearl Harbor dry dock modernization.
- Establish 10 new community college shipbuilding certification programs in shipyard-adjacent communities.
- Recruit 5,000 additional production workers across the submarine industrial base.

### Asymmetric Capabilities

- Deploy the first Marine Littoral Regiment (MLR) to Okinawa/Southwest Islands with operational Naval Strike Missile capability.
- Begin low-rate production of the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV).
- Accelerate LRASM and Maritime Strike Tomahawk procurement to build stockpiles for Indo-Pacific contingencies.
- Increase SM-6 production rate from ~125 to 250+ per year.

### Alliances

- Establish the U.S.-Japan Combined Fleet Headquarters.
- Complete infrastructure development at EDCA sites in the northern Philippines (Lallo, Santa Ana, Cagayan).
- Conduct the first combined U.S.-Japan-Australia-Philippines maritime exercise in the South China Sea.
- Begin AUKUS Pillar 1 submarine crew training and infrastructure preparation in Australia.

### Strategic Posture

- Sustain or increase FONOPS in the South China Sea to 12+ operations per year.
- Pre-position munitions and logistics at Guam, Tinian, Palau, and the Philippines.
- Transition Red Sea operations to a coalition-led framework, reducing U.S. destroyer commitment from 3-4 ships to 1-2 by 2028.

## Phase 2: Mid-Term Buildup (2029-2033)

**Focus**: Scale up shipbuilding production, integrate unmanned systems into fleet operations, achieve allied interoperability milestones, and close the most critical capability gaps.

### Shipbuilding

- Achieve Virginia-class production rate of 2.0 per year by 2030.
- Deliver the first Columbia-class SSBN (SSBN-826) and sustain production at 1 per year.
- Deliver Constellation-class frigates at 2 per year.
- Begin construction of the first Arleigh Burke Flight III replacement (DDG(X) or equivalent next-generation surface combatant).
- Begin series production of LUSVs: target 10 operational by 2033.
- Commission the first 3 Light Amphibious Warships.

### Unmanned Systems

- Achieve Initial Operating Capability (IOC) for the LUSV with vertical launch cells.
- Deploy Medium Unmanned Surface Vessels (MUSVs) for ISR and electronic warfare in the Western Pacific.
- Begin operational deployment of Orca XLUUVs for mine warfare and ISR.
- Integrate MQ-25 Stingray unmanned tanker into all carrier air wings.

### Industrial Base

- Complete SIOP Phase 2: all four public shipyard dry docks modernized or replaced.
- Expand private shipyard capacity through capital grants, targeting a 20% increase in production throughput at HII, Electric Boat, and Bath Iron Works.
- Achieve submarine industrial base workforce target of 56,000+ workers (current: ~42,000).
- Establish a strategic reserve of critical shipbuilding materials (specialty steel, castings, electronic components).

### Alliances

- Transfer the first Virginia-class submarine to Australia under AUKUS Pillar 1.
- Achieve full Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) interoperability between U.S. and Japanese Aegis ships.
- Field the second and third Marine Littoral Regiments in the Western Pacific.
- Establish a combined U.S.-Australia submarine maintenance facility in Western Australia.

### Munitions

- Build Indo-Pacific munitions stockpiles to support 30+ days of high-intensity conflict.
- Achieve SM-6 production rate of 400+ per year.
- Complete development and begin procurement of next-generation hypersonic anti-ship missiles.

## Phase 3: Long-Term Transformation (2034-2040)

**Focus**: Achieve and sustain the 355-ship fleet, complete the transition to a hybrid manned-unmanned force, and establish enduring maritime superiority in the Indo-Pacific.

## Risks and Contingencies

### Risk: Taiwan Contingency Before 2030

If China initiates a military confrontation over Taiwan before the mid-term buildup is complete, the U.S. must be prepared to fight with the fleet it has, not the fleet it plans. This risk demands:

- Maximum readiness of the existing fleet (Phase 1 priority).
- Pre-positioned munitions and logistics in the Western Pacific.
- Allied integration sufficient to operate combined forces from day one.
- Deterrence signaling to convince China the current force is sufficient to impose unacceptable costs.

### Risk: Shipbuilding Industrial Base Fails to Scale

If workforce recruitment and supply chain expansion do not meet targets, the 355-ship fleet goal will slip. Contingency:

- Explore foreign construction of auxiliaries and logistics ships (allied shipyards in Japan, South Korea) to free U.S. capacity for combatants.
- Increase investment in unmanned systems as a fleet size multiplier.
- Extend service lives of existing ships where structurally sound.

### Risk: Budget Constraints

If the defense topline does not increase sufficiently to fund the shipbuilding plan, the Navy must prioritize:

1. Submarine production (highest asymmetric value).
2. Munitions stockpiles (most critical gap).
3. Unmanned systems (best cost-to-capability ratio).
4. Maintenance and readiness (avoid hollowing out the existing fleet).
5. New manned surface combatants (lower priority if unmanned alternatives mature).
