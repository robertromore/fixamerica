# Defense Policy: Citizen Actions

## What You Can Do

Defense policy often feels inaccessible to the average citizen due to its complexity and secrecy. However, public engagement is essential for ensuring accountability, supporting service members, and aligning military strategy with national values.

### Individual Actions

- **Audit Your Representatives**: Check how your members of Congress vote on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Do they support amendments for auditing the Pentagon or restricting arms sales?
- **Support Veterans**: Hire veterans if you are an employer, or mentor transitioning service members through organizations like American Corporate Partners.
- **Educate Yourself**: Read the National Defense Strategy summary to understand the government's stated priorities and compare them with actual spending.

### Community Actions

- **Host Town Halls**: Organize local forums with representatives to discuss defense spending and its impact on the local economy versus other priorities.
- **Support Military Families**: Engage with local Blue Star Families chapters to support spouses and children of deployed service members.
- **University Engagement**: If affiliated with a university, advocate for transparency in defense-funded research and recruitment.

### Political Actions

- **Demand Financial Accountability**: Contact representatives to demand they withhold funding until the DoD passes a clean financial audit.
- **Advocate for War Powers**: Urge Congress to repeal outdated Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) and reclaim its constitutional authority to declare war.
- **Promote Diplomatic Alternatives**: Support candidates who prioritize State Department funding and diplomatic engagement alongside defense.
