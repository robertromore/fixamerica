# Counterterrorism: Legislation

## Overview

U.S. counterterrorism (CT) policy has been defined for over two decades by the **2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)**, passed days after 9/11 with a single dissenting vote (Rep. Barbara Lee, D-CA). This 60-word statute has been stretched to justify military operations in at least 22 countries against more than 41 groups, many of which did not exist in 2001. The 2002 AUMF authorizing force against Iraq has similarly outlived its original purpose and remains on the books despite the end of combat operations in Iraq.

The legislative framework proposed here aims to end the "Forever War" paradigm through two complementary bills:

- **The Endless War Termination and AUMF Reform Act** repeals the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, replaces them with a narrowly tailored and time-limited authorization against specific groups, and establishes mandatory congressional oversight and sunset provisions.
- **The Targeted Killing Oversight and Transparency Act** codifies standards for drone strikes and targeted killings outside active battlefields, transfers lethal strike authority from the CIA to the Department of Defense, mandates civilian casualty investigations, and creates a compensation fund for civilian victims.

Together, these bills seek to balance the operational need to strike genuine terrorist threats with the constitutional requirement for congressional authorization of war, the due process rights of individuals (including U.S. citizens), and the moral imperative to minimize civilian harm.

**Key principles guiding this legislation**:

- Congressional authorization must be specific, time-limited, and subject to regular renewal
- Definitions of key terms must be statutory, not left to executive interpretation
- All lethal operations must be subject to uniform legal standards and transparency requirements
- The distinction between Title 10 (military) and Title 50 (intelligence) operations must not be used to evade oversight
- Civilian harm must be independently investigated, publicly reported, and compensated
- Victims of U.S. operations must have access to formal compensation mechanisms
- Historical operations must be subject to declassification review to enable public accountability
- Partner force operations supported by U.S. intelligence must meet the same standards as direct U.S. operations

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for this legislation. The existing constitutional framework is sufficient:

- **Article I, Section 8** grants Congress the power "To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water" and "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces."
- **Article II, Section 2** designates the President as "Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States."
- **The Fifth Amendment** provides that no person shall "be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."

The proposed legislation operates within these existing constitutional authorities. It reasserts congressional war powers that have been gradually ceded to the Executive Branch through open-ended authorizations, executive interpretations, and congressional acquiescence. The Supreme Court has recognized in *Youngstown* (1952) that Congress has broad authority to regulate the use of military force, and the legislation's restrictions on targeting standards and agency authority fall within Congress's power to "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces."

The one area of constitutional uncertainty is the proposed FISA-like targeting court for U.S. citizens, which would require Article III judges to review targeting decisions in an *ex parte* setting. While the FISA Court provides a precedent for specialized national security courts, the life-or-death stakes of targeting decisions are qualitatively different from surveillance warrants. This provision may require further constitutional analysis, but it represents the most feasible judicial check on executive targeting power short of a constitutional amendment.

## Federal Legislation

### The Endless War Termination and AUMF Reform Act

**Purpose**: To repeal the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, replace them with a narrowly tailored authority against specific terrorist groups, and establish a mandatory sunset provision.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Repeal**: Repeals the 2001 AUMF (9/11) effective 180 days after enactment and the 2002 AUMF (Iraq) effective immediately.
2. **Definitions**: Provides precise statutory definitions of "associated forces," "hostilities," and "covered military operation" to prevent executive reinterpretation.
3. **Specific Targets**: Authorizes force only against Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and specifically named associated forces that meet the statutory co-belligerency standard.
4. **Geographic Limits**: Limits the use of force to specific countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq) unless the President certifies a new threat and Congress does not object within 60 days.
5. **Ally Notification**: Requires notification to partner nations when operations are conducted in their territory.
6. **Transition Planning**: Mandates a comprehensive plan for shifting all ongoing operations from old AUMF authorities to the new framework.
7. **Sunset Clause**: The new authorization expires automatically after 3 years, forcing Congress to vote to renew or end the war.
8. **Transparency**: Requires quarterly reports listing all groups, countries, casualty estimates, and legal bases for any expansion of force.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To repeal outdated authorizations for the use of military force and replace them with a narrow, time-limited authority.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Endless War Termination and AUMF Reform Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40) has been used to justify military operations in at least 22 countries against at least 41 groups, far exceeding any reasonable reading of the original authorization (Brown University Costs of War Project).
(2) The 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 107-243) is obsolete and has been cited to justify operations unrelated to its original purpose.
(3) The Constitution vests the power to declare war solely in Congress under Article I, Section 8, and open-ended war authorizations undermine that constitutional structure.
(4) More than two decades of continuous military operations without renewed congressional debate have eroded democratic accountability and allowed unchecked mission creep.
(5) The Congressional Research Service has documented over 50 unclassified instances of Executive Branch reliance on the 2001 AUMF for operations against groups with tenuous connections to the September 11, 2001, attacks.
(6) A new, narrowly tailored authorization is needed to address current terrorist threats while restoring the constitutional balance between the Executive and Legislative Branches.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE.—The term "authorization for use of military force" means a statutory authorization by Congress for the use of the Armed Forces of the United States against a specified enemy or in a specified theater of operations.
(2) ASSOCIATED FORCES.—The term "associated forces" means an organized, armed group that—
    (A) has entered the fight alongside al-Qaeda or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria; and
    (B) is a co-belligerent with al-Qaeda or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.
    A group may not be designated as an associated force solely on the basis of shared ideology.
(3) HOSTILITIES.—The term "hostilities" means any situation in which units of the Armed Forces of the United States are actively engaged in exchanges of fire with hostile forces, not including combatant commands' presence, training, advising, or intelligence-sharing activities.
(4) COVERED MILITARY OPERATION.—The term "covered military operation" means any operation involving the use of lethal force by the Armed Forces of the United States, including drone strikes and special operations raids, conducted under the authority of this Act.

SEC. 4. REPEAL OF EXISTING AUTHORIZATIONS.

(a) 2001 AUMF.—The Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is repealed effective 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.
(b) 2002 AUMF.—The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is repealed effective immediately.

SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE.

(a) AUTHORITY.—The President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against—
    (1) Al-Qaeda;
    (2) The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS); and
    (3) The following associated forces: [List specific groups like Al-Shabaab].
(b) GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION.—The authority granted in subsection (a) may only be exercised in [List Countries].
(c) EXPANSION.—The President may add a group or country to this authorization by submitting a report to Congress. Such addition shall be effective for 60 days unless Congress enacts a joint resolution of approval.
(d) NOTIFICATION OF ALLIES.—Not later than 48 hours after initiating a covered military operation in the territory of an allied or partner nation, the Secretary of Defense shall notify the government of such nation, except where doing so would compromise operational security of an imminent action.

SEC. 6. TRANSITION PLANNING.

(a) TRANSITION PLAN.—Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the congressional defense committees a transition plan for shifting ongoing operations from the authorities of Public Law 107-40 to the authority of this Act.
(b) ELEMENTS.—The transition plan shall include—
    (1) a list of all operations currently conducted under the 2001 AUMF;
    (2) an assessment of which operations qualify under the authority of section 5;
    (3) a timeline for the termination or transfer of each operation; and
    (4) a risk assessment for each termination or transfer.

SEC. 7. SUNSET.

The authority granted by section 5 shall expire on the date that is 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 8. REPORTING.

Not later than 90 days after enactment, and every 90 days thereafter, the President shall submit to Congress a report listing—
    (1) all groups and countries where force has been used under this authority;
    (2) the number of covered military operations conducted;
    (3) the estimated number of combatant and civilian casualties; and
    (4) the legal basis for any expansion of force under section 5(c).

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $22,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $18,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.
(b) AVAILABILITY.—Amounts authorized to be appropriated under subsection (a) are in addition to any amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated for military operations and shall remain available until expended.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect immediately.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Provides precise statutory definitions to prevent Executive Branch reinterpretation. The "associated forces" definition requires both co-belligerency *and* active fighting alongside named groups, closing the loophole that allowed the Executive to unilaterally expand the war to new organizations. The exclusion of groups based solely on "shared ideology" prevents ideological dragnet designations.
- **Section 4 (Repeal)**: Provides a 6-month wind-down period for the 2001 AUMF to allow for an orderly transition, while immediately repealing the obsolete 2002 Iraq AUMF.
- **Section 5 (Authorization)**: Ends the open-ended "associated forces" framework where the Executive Branch unilaterally decides who the nation is at war with. The ally notification provision ensures partner nations are informed when operations occur in their territory.
- **Section 6 (Transition)**: Requires the Executive Branch to produce a comprehensive accounting of all current operations and a plan for transitioning each one, preventing claims that the repeal created an unforeseen operational gap.
- **Section 7 (Sunset)**: The most critical reform. It forces every future Congress to take an affirmative vote on continuing military operations, ensuring democratic legitimacy and preventing perpetual war by default.
- **Section 9 (Appropriations)**: Declining annual authorizations reflect the expectation that operations will narrow over the life of the Act, with the tapering funding structure creating a natural incentive to wind down operations.

**Legislative Vehicle**: This bill is most viable as an amendment to the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), where war powers provisions have historically been debated. It could also be introduced as a standalone bill through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Submit Initial Target List | 30 days after enactment | President |
| Submit Transition Plan | 90 days after enactment | Secretary of Defense |
| 2002 AUMF Expires | Immediately upon enactment | Law |
| 2001 AUMF Expires | 180 days after enactment | Law |
| First Quarterly Report | 270 days after enactment | President |
| Sunset Review Begins | 2.5 years after enactment | Congressional committees |
| First Sunset Vote | 3 years after enactment | Congress |

**Challenges**:

- **Executive Veto**: Presidents of both parties have consistently vetoed or threatened to veto limits on their war powers, viewing such limits as unconstitutional encroachments on Commander-in-Chief authority.
- **Congressional Inertia**: Members of Congress often prefer *not* to vote on war to avoid political risk. The current system lets members claim credit for military successes and blame the Executive for failures.
- **Operational Continuity**: Military and intelligence officials will argue that a 180-day transition window is insufficient for ongoing operations and that publicly listing target groups and countries compromises operational security.

**Refinements**:

- Include a "fast track" procedure for the renewal vote, modeled on Trade Promotion Authority, to prevent filibusters from accidentally ending the war authority through procedural failure.
- Add a classified annex provision allowing the President to notify the "Gang of Eight" (congressional leadership and intelligence committee chairs) about sensitive targeting decisions that cannot be publicly disclosed.
- Include a provision allowing emergency 30-day extensions upon presidential certification of imminent threat, subject to expedited congressional review.

### The Targeted Killing Oversight and Transparency Act

**Purpose**: To codify standards for drone strikes and targeted killings outside of active battlefields, reducing civilian casualties and increasing accountability.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **"Near Certainty" Standard**: Codifies the Obama-era policy requiring "near certainty" that no civilians will be killed before a strike is authorized outside active hostilities.
2. **Signature Strike Prohibition**: Explicitly bans targeting based on behavioral patterns, location, or association rather than positive identification of a specific individual.
3. **Judicial Review**: Establishes a specialized court (similar to FISA) to review targeting of U.S. citizens.
4. **Civilian Casualty Reporting**: Mandates independent investigations of all allegations of civilian harm and public reporting of the results.
5. **Transfer to DoD**: Requires that all lethal strikes be conducted by the Department of Defense (which has more transparency) rather than the CIA.
6. **Declassification**: Requires a comprehensive review and public disclosure of historical targeted killing operations.
7. **Victim Compensation**: Establishes a dedicated fund for compensating civilians harmed by U.S. counterterrorism operations.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To establish standards and oversight for the use of lethal force outside of areas of active hostilities.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Targeted Killing Oversight and Transparency Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has documented that between 2004 and 2020, United States drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Afghanistan killed between 10,000 and 17,000 people, including an estimated 800 to 1,750 civilians.
(2) A 2021 Department of Defense report acknowledged that the United States conducted approximately 93,000 air and artillery strikes in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan between 2014 and 2019, and that its civilian casualty assessment processes were inadequate.
(3) The New York Times "Civilian Casualty Files" investigation revealed systemic failures in the Department of Defense's civilian casualty assessment procedures, including cases in which no investigations were conducted despite credible reports of civilian harm.
(4) The killing of United States citizen Anwar al-Awlaki in 2011, and the subsequent killing of his 16-year-old son, raised unresolved constitutional questions about due process and executive authority.
(5) Operations conducted under AUMF authorities have been carried out in at least 22 countries, many without meaningful congressional authorization or public awareness.
(6) The Central Intelligence Agency's lethal drone program operates with significantly less transparency and accountability than Department of Defense operations.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) TARGETED KILLING.—The term "targeted killing" means the intentional use of lethal force by the United States Government against a specific individual who is not in the custody of the United States and who is located outside an area of active hostilities.
(2) HIGH-VALUE TARGET.—The term "high-value target" means an individual whom the United States Government has identified as posing a significant threat to United States national security and who has been placed on a targeting list maintained by the National Security Council.
(3) CIVILIAN CASUALTY.—The term "civilian casualty" means the death or injury of any person who is not a lawful military target under the law of armed conflict, including individuals whose status is unknown at the time of the strike.
(4) IMMINENT THREAT.—The term "imminent threat" means a threat from an individual who is personally and continuously involved in planning or directing a specific operation that, if carried out, would cause significant harm to United States persons. The term does not include a generalized association with a terrorist organization or the expression of support for terrorist ideology.

SEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR USE OF FORCE.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—In locations outside of areas of active hostilities, lethal force may only be used if—
    (1) The target poses a continuing, imminent threat to United States persons;
    (2) Capture is not feasible; and
    (3) There is near certainty that the target is present and that non-combatants will not be injured or killed.
(b) PROHIBITION ON SIGNATURE STRIKES.—No strike may be authorized based solely on patterns of behavior, location, or association. Each strike must be directed at a specific, identified individual.

SEC. 5. AGENCY AUTHORITY.

(a) EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY.—The Department of Defense shall have exclusive authority to conduct lethal strikes outside of areas of active hostilities. The Central Intelligence Agency may not conduct such strikes.
(b) TRANSITION.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall transfer all lethal strike authorities, assets, and personnel to the Department of Defense.

SEC. 6. CIVILIAN CASUALTY INVESTIGATIONS.

(a) INVESTIGATION.—The Secretary of Defense shall conduct an independent investigation of any strike that results in an allegation of civilian casualties from any credible source, including local media, nongovernmental organizations, and partner governments.
(b) EX GRATIA PAYMENTS.—The Secretary is authorized and directed to make ex gratia condolence payments to the families of civilians killed or injured in United States operations, in amounts not less than $50,000 per death and $25,000 per serious injury.
(c) INDEPENDENT REVIEW.—The Inspector General of the Department of Defense shall conduct annual audits of civilian casualty investigations and report findings to the congressional defense committees.

SEC. 7. DECLASSIFICATION AND TRANSPARENCY.

(a) DECLASSIFICATION REVIEW.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence shall conduct a declassification review of all records relating to targeted killings conducted by the United States between 2001 and the date of enactment of this Act.
(b) PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.—The Director of National Intelligence shall make publicly available, to the greatest extent consistent with national security, the total number of strikes, the countries in which they were conducted, and the estimated number of combatant and civilian casualties.
(c) CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFINGS.—The Secretary of Defense shall provide classified quarterly briefings to the congressional intelligence and armed services committees on all targeted killings conducted during the preceding quarter.

SEC. 8. VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established within the Department of Defense the "Civilian Victims of U.S. Counterterrorism Operations Fund" to provide compensation and assistance to civilians harmed by United States counterterrorism operations.
(b) ADMINISTRATION.—The Secretary of Defense shall administer the Fund and establish procedures for claims, including—
    (1) simplified claims procedures accessible to foreign nationals;
    (2) coordination with local embassy and consular offices; and
    (3) access to independent legal assistance for claimants.
(c) AUTHORIZATION.—There is authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2031 to carry out this section.

SEC. 9. REPORTING.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—The President shall publish an annual unclassified report on the total number of combatants and non-combatants killed by United States strikes outside of active hostilities, disaggregated by country.
(b) CLASSIFIED SUPPLEMENT.—A classified supplement may accompany the report required under subsection (a) if the President determines that certain information would compromise intelligence sources and methods.

SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act (other than section 8)—
    (1) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.
(b) AVAILABILITY.—Amounts authorized to be appropriated under subsection (a) shall remain available until expended.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Provides statutory precision to terms that the Executive Branch has historically interpreted expansively. The definition of "imminent threat" is deliberately narrow, rejecting the Obama-era Office of Legal Counsel interpretation that "imminence" does not require evidence of a specific plot. The definition of "civilian casualty" includes persons of unknown status, closing the "military-age male" presumption that previous administrations used to minimize reported civilian deaths.
- **Section 4 (Standards)**: Sets a high legal bar for strikes, codifying the "near certainty" standard and explicitly prohibiting "signature strikes" (targeting based on behavior patterns rather than individual identification) that have caused disproportionate civilian casualties in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.
- **Section 5 (Agency Authority)**: Ends the CIA's "covert" drone war, ensuring all military actions are conducted under Title 10 of the U.S. Code with its attendant oversight, transparency, and uniform code of military justice requirements rather than under Title 50 covert action authorities.
- **Section 7 (Declassification)**: Creates a mechanism for historical accountability by requiring a declassification review of the full scope of the targeted killing program, enabling public debate about two decades of operations conducted largely in secret.
- **Section 8 (Victim Compensation)**: Establishes a formal mechanism for compensating civilian victims, replacing the ad hoc and inconsistent ex gratia payment system that has left most civilian victims and their families without recourse.

**Legislative Vehicle**: This bill should be introduced through the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, given its intersection of national security and civil liberties. It could also be attached as an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Promulgate signature strike prohibition | 30 days after enactment | Secretary of Defense |
| Establish Victim Compensation Fund | 90 days after enactment | Secretary of Defense |
| CIA transfer of lethal strike authorities | 180 days after enactment | Director of CIA |
| Publish initial civilian casualty methodology | 180 days after enactment | DoD IG |
| Complete declassification review | 1 year after enactment | Director of National Intelligence |
| First annual report published | 1 year after enactment | President |

**Challenges**:

- **Intelligence Community Resistance**: The CIA will resist the transfer of lethal strike authority, arguing that Title 50 covert action provides essential operational flexibility and deniability in sensitive countries where host nations do not publicly consent to U.S. operations.
- **Classification Barriers**: The declassification review will encounter resistance from agencies that argue disclosure of targeting methods and country-level strike data will compromise intelligence sources and methods and damage relationships with partner governments.
- **Judicial Review Feasibility**: Creating a FISA-like court for targeting decisions raises questions about whether Article III judges can meaningfully review time-sensitive targeting decisions and whether such review would satisfy due process requirements.

**Refinements**:

- Add a provision allowing the CIA to retain intelligence collection and targeting recommendation capabilities while transferring execution authority to DoD, preserving interagency cooperation.
- Include a classified exemption process allowing the DNI to withhold specific records from declassification upon written certification to the intelligence committees, with mandatory re-review every 5 years.
- Establish an interagency transition team, co-chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Director of the CIA, to manage the transfer of lethal authorities over the 180-day transition period.

---

## Congressional Oversight Mechanisms

### The War Powers Consultation Committee

**Proposal**: Establish a permanent bipartisan committee of House and Senate leaders to consult with the President *before* sensitive operations, replacing the ad-hoc "Gang of Eight" model for war powers.

**Structure**: The committee would consist of 12 members: the Speaker of the House, the House Minority Leader, the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders, and the chairs and ranking members of the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs/Relations, and Intelligence Committees of each chamber.

**Authority**: The committee would have the authority to:

- Receive advance notice of all proposed AUMF expansions under Section 5(c) of the AUMF Reform Act
- Request classified briefings on any ongoing counterterrorism operation
- Issue advisory opinions on whether proposed operations exceed existing statutory authorization
- Trigger expedited floor consideration of joint resolutions to authorize or prohibit specific operations

### Quarterly Reporting Requirements

Both bills require periodic reporting. The combined reporting framework would require:

- **Quarterly classified briefings** to the intelligence and armed services committees on all covered military operations, including operational details, targeting decisions, and civilian casualty assessments
- **Quarterly unclassified reports** listing groups and countries subject to operations, aggregate casualty data, and any AUMF expansion requests
- **Annual public reports** on civilian casualties, ex gratia payments, declassification review progress, and victim compensation fund disbursements
- **Ad hoc notifications** within 48 hours of any operation resulting in confirmed or suspected civilian casualties

### Coordination Between Bills

The two bills are designed to operate in tandem. The AUMF Reform Act defines *who* the United States is authorized to fight and *where*, while the Targeted Killing Act defines *how* force may be used and *what accountability mechanisms* apply. If only one bill is enacted, it still provides meaningful reform, but the full legislative framework requires both:

- Without the AUMF Reform Act, the Targeted Killing Act's standards apply but the underlying open-ended authorization remains.
- Without the Targeted Killing Act, the AUMF Reform Act narrows the scope of war but does not address targeting standards or civilian harm.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Defense (USSOCOM, CENTCOM, and relevant geographic combatant commands) with coordination through the National Security Council.

**Supporting Agencies**: Director of National Intelligence (declassification review), Central Intelligence Agency (authority transfer), Department of State (partner nation coordination and victim compensation).

**Timeline for Rulemaking**: All regulations required under this section shall be promulgated in proposed form within 120 days of enactment and in final form within 240 days of enactment, following notice-and-comment procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). Interim guidance shall be issued within 30 days of enactment to ensure immediate operational compliance.

**Interagency Coordination**: The National Security Council shall establish an interagency working group, co-chaired by representatives of the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate implementation across all affected agencies and resolve interagency disputes.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **DoD Law of War Manual Update**: Revise to codify the "near certainty" statutory standard for strikes outside areas of active hostilities and the prohibition on signature strikes.
2. **Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan (CHMR-AP)**: Full implementation and expansion of the DoD's civilian harm policy, including mandatory post-strike assessments for every operation, not just those with allegations of civilian harm.
3. **Targeting Review Board Procedures**: Establish procedures for the new targeting review process that implements the statutory standards, including chain-of-command approval requirements and documentation protocols.
4. **Victim Compensation Fund Regulations**: Promulgate regulations governing claims procedures, evidentiary standards, payment amounts, and appeals processes for the Civilian Victims Fund.
5. **CIA-to-DoD Transfer Protocols**: Develop interagency memoranda of understanding governing the transfer of personnel, assets, intelligence streams, and operational authorities from Title 50 to Title 10.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **IG Investigations**: DoD Inspector General reviews of strike logs, civilian casualty assessments, and compliance with the near-certainty standard.
- **Funding Restrictions**: Congress can cut funding for specific operations or theaters if reporting requirements are ignored. The Appropriations Committees can include classified riders restricting operations in specific countries.
- **GAO Audits**: The Government Accountability Office shall conduct biennial audits of civilian casualty data and victim compensation fund disbursements.
- **Inspector General Cross-Agency Review**: The Intelligence Community Inspector General and the DoD Inspector General shall conduct a joint annual review of the CIA-to-DoD authority transfer and its impact on operational effectiveness.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Article I vs. Article II Tensions**: The fundamental constitutional question underlying this legislation is the distribution of war powers between Congress and the President. Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power "To declare War" and "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." Article II, Section 2 designates the President as "Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy." The proposed legislation asserts Congressional authority to define the scope and conditions of military force, which the Executive Branch has historically resisted as an encroachment on Commander-in-Chief powers.

**The Youngstown Framework**: The Supreme Court's decision in *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), provides the foundational framework for evaluating these competing claims. Justice Jackson's concurrence established three categories of presidential power: (1) when the President acts with express or implied congressional authorization, executive power is at its maximum; (2) when Congress is silent, the President operates in a "zone of twilight"; and (3) when the President acts contrary to the express will of Congress, executive power is at its "lowest ebb." This legislation moves counterterrorism operations from the first category (acting under the broad 2001 AUMF) to a more constrained authorization, and any executive action outside its terms would fall into Jackson's third category, where presidential power is most vulnerable to judicial challenge.

**Due Process and Targeted Killing of U.S. Citizens**: The killing of Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011 raised profound 5th Amendment due process concerns. In *Al-Aulaqi v. Obama*, 727 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2010), Judge Bates dismissed al-Awlaki's father's pre-strike challenge on standing and political question grounds, but expressly noted the "stark" and "perplexing" nature of a claim that the Executive could target a citizen for killing without judicial review. The proposed FISA-like targeting court attempts to fill this due process gap, though its constitutionality is untested. The key question is whether *ex parte*, classified judicial review satisfies the "some process" requirement articulated in *Hamdi*.

**Detention Authority and the AUMF**: In *Hamdi v. Rumsfeld*, 542 U.S. 507 (2004), the Supreme Court held that the 2001 AUMF authorized the detention of enemy combatants but that a U.S. citizen held as an enemy combatant must receive "notice of the factual basis for his classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government's factual assertions before a neutral decisionmaker." The plurality opinion by Justice O'Connor established that even in wartime, the government's interest must be balanced against the individual's due process rights using the *Mathews v. Eldridge* balancing test. If the AUMF authorizes detention with procedural safeguards, the argument follows that the far graver deprivation of targeted killing should require at least comparable process, which this legislation seeks to provide.

**Commander-in-Chief Power**: The Executive Branch consistently argues that Congress cannot micromanage tactical targeting decisions. The Office of Legal Counsel has maintained that the President has inherent authority under Article II to use force to defend the nation from imminent threats, regardless of statutory limitations. This legislation will face legal challenges arguing that provisions like the signature strike prohibition and the near-certainty standard unconstitutionally constrain the President's tactical military judgments. However, Congress's power of the purse and its authority to "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" provide a strong textual basis for these restrictions.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Congressional Enforcement**: Congress enforces these provisions through the power of the purse. If the Executive Branch fails to comply with reporting requirements, Congress may restrict funding for specific operations through appropriations riders. The fast-track procedures for joint resolutions of disapproval ensure that Congress can act to terminate unauthorized operations without being blocked by filibuster.

**Judicial Enforcement**: The proposed FISA-like targeting court provides a judicial check on the targeting of U.S. citizens. For non-judicial enforcement, the Inspector General system provides independent oversight, with the DoD IG and IC IG empowered to investigate non-compliance and refer matters to the Attorney General.

**International Law Compliance**: The legislation aligns U.S. counterterrorism operations with international humanitarian law and international human rights law standards, reducing the risk of proceedings before international tribunals and strengthening U.S. credibility in multilateral counterterrorism cooperation.

### Preemption

Not applicable; federal war powers are exclusive under the Constitution. State and local governments have no authority over military operations or foreign affairs. However, state governments may have limited roles in supporting transparency through state freedom-of-information laws applicable to state National Guard units deployed in support of federal counterterrorism operations.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **"Active Hostilities" Definition** | President declares a whole country an "area of active hostilities" to avoid the stricter targeting rules that apply outside such areas, effectively exempting entire theaters from oversight. | High | Statutorily define "active hostilities" to require sustained combat between organized armed forces and require congressional notification within 48 hours of any new designation. |
| **"Collective Self-Defense"** | Citing Article 51 of the UN Charter to use force to defend "partner forces" without AUMF authority, allowing operations against groups not named in any authorization. | Medium | Require advance reporting to Congress on all "collective self-defense" strikes and limit duration to 72 hours without congressional approval. |
| **"Imminent Threat" Elasticity** | Despite the statutory definition, the Executive Branch could reassert the OLC's 2010 interpretation that "imminence" does not require evidence of a specific, imminent plot, effectively gutting the targeting standard. | High | Include a statutory rule of construction explicitly repudiating the "broader concept of imminence" and requiring evidence of a specific planned operation. |
| **Intelligence Community Exemptions** | The CIA could argue that intelligence collection activities that happen to result in deaths (e.g., partnered operations with foreign intelligence services) fall outside the definition of "targeted killing" and are not covered by the Act. | High | Define "lethal force" to include any operation directed, facilitated, or materially supported by U.S. intelligence personnel that results in the death of a targeted individual. |
| **Covert Action Distinction** | The Executive Branch could characterize operations as "covert action" under Title 50 rather than military operations under Title 10, arguing they fall outside the scope of legislation governing the "Armed Forces." | Medium | Include a provision stating that the Act applies to all lethal operations conducted by or at the direction of any department or agency of the United States Government, regardless of the statutory title under which the operation is authorized. |
| **Partner Force Loopholes** | The United States could circumvent targeting restrictions by providing intelligence, logistics, and real-time targeting data to foreign partner forces who then conduct the strike, achieving the same result without directly pulling the trigger. | High | Require that all "substantial assistance" to partner force targeting decisions be subject to the same near-certainty standard and reporting requirements as direct U.S. strikes. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Over-the-Horizon Difficulty** | Hard to verify targets and conduct post-strike civilian casualty assessments without troops on the ground, leading to underreporting of civilian harm. | Intelligence gaps caused by withdrawal from forward operating positions. | Invest in improved ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) capabilities, expand partnerships with local NGOs for post-strike assessment, and fund human intelligence networks. |
| **Classification Barrier to Accountability** | Most strike data remains classified, preventing public scrutiny and academic research into the effectiveness and legality of targeted killing programs. | National security classification system was designed for state-on-state conflict, not decades-long counterterrorism campaigns. | Mandate presumptive declassification of strike data older than 5 years and require annual unclassified statistical summaries. |
| **No Retroactive Application** | The legislation establishes standards going forward but does not address accountability for civilian casualties caused by prior operations conducted under lower standards. | Legislation typically does not apply retroactively, and the political costs of investigating past operations are high. | Establish a non-judicial truth commission to review past operations and provide recommendations for institutional reform and victim redress. |
| **Foreign Partner Non-Compliance** | Partner forces receiving U.S. intelligence and equipment may not adhere to U.S. targeting standards, creating civilian harm that is attributable to U.S. support but outside U.S. legal control. | Sovereignty of partner nations and limited U.S. leverage over operational decisions made by foreign militaries. | Condition security assistance on partner adoption of civilian harm mitigation policies and embed U.S. advisors in partner targeting cells with authority to halt strikes. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Partner Force Reporting**: Mandate reporting under Section 1202 authority for all partner force support operations, including intelligence sharing and real-time targeting assistance.
2. **Imminent Threat Definition Guardrails**: Include a statutory rule of construction explicitly repudiating the OLC's 2010 "broader concept of imminence" memorandum, requiring evidence of a specific planned operation rather than general organizational membership.
3. **Covert Action Closure**: Amend the National Security Act of 1947 to clarify that covert action authority under Title 50 does not extend to lethal operations against individuals on targeting lists, regardless of how the operation is characterized.
4. **Intelligence Community Coverage**: Define the scope of the Targeted Killing Act to cover operations "directed, facilitated, or materially supported" by any U.S. government entity, preventing agencies from claiming their role was merely advisory.
5. **Retroactive Accountability Framework**: Establish a non-judicial review commission to examine past operations and recommend institutional reforms, modeled on the Church Committee's review of intelligence abuses.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Executive Branch may interpret definitions narrowly to preserve operational flexibility. | Include statutory rules of construction and mandate that all interpretive guidance be shared with the intelligence committees. |
| Classification system may be used to prevent public accountability. | Establish a presumption of declassification for operational data older than 5 years and require written justification for continued classification. |
| Transition from CIA to DoD lethal authorities may disrupt ongoing operations. | Establish 180-day transition period with interagency transition team and allow temporary dual authorization during transition. |
| Partner nations may withdraw cooperation if operations become more transparent. | Develop diplomatic framework for classified bilateral agreements that preserve partnership while meeting congressional reporting requirements. |
| Victim compensation fund may be underfunded relative to claims. | Include an automatic appropriations adjustment mechanism triggered when claims exceed 75% of annual authorization. |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **AUMF Sunset**: 3 years (Section 7 of AUMF Reform Act), requiring affirmative congressional vote for renewal.
- **Targeted Killing Act Review**: The Government Accountability Office shall conduct a comprehensive review of the Targeted Killing Oversight Act 3 years after enactment, including assessments of civilian casualty trends, compliance with the near-certainty standard, and the effectiveness of the victim compensation fund.
- **Appropriations Review**: Authorization of appropriations for both Acts expires after FY2031, requiring reauthorization.
