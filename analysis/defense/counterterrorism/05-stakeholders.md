# Counterterrorism: Stakeholders

The U.S. counterterrorism enterprise is a vast and complex network of government agencies, military commands, and private sector partners.

## U.S. Government Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Role in the CT Enterprise |
|---|---|---|
| **The President & National Security Council (NSC)** | Preventing attacks on the U.S. homeland; setting the legal and policy framework for CT operations. | **Decision-Maker.** Makes final decisions on high-value targets and approves CT policy. |
| **Department of Defense (DoD)** | Executing the military aspects of CT. | **Operator.** Provides the forces and platforms for surveillance and strikes. |
| **U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM)** | Leading the direct action and partner force training components of CT. | **Primary Military Actor.** Plans and conducts special operations missions globally. Its sub-component, JSOC, is responsible for the most sensitive missions. |
| **The Intelligence Community (IC)** | Collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence on terrorist threats. | **Finder and Fixer.** The CIA, NSA, and NGA provide the intelligence that drives targeting. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) integrates all-source intelligence. |
| **Department of State** | Leading the diplomatic and foreign policy aspects of CT; designating Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). | **Diplomat.** Builds international coalitions, manages relationships with partner forces, and leads efforts to counter violent extremism (CVE). |
| **Department of the Treasury** | Disrupting terrorist financing. | **Financier.** Imposes sanctions on terrorist groups and their financiers. |
| **Department of Justice (DOJ) / FBI** | Investigating and prosecuting terrorism cases within the U.S. and against U.S. persons abroad. | **Law Enforcement.** Leads domestic CT investigations and prosecutes terrorists in federal court. |
| **Congress (Intelligence & Armed Services Committees)** | Authorizing and funding CT operations; oversight. | **Overseer.** Holds hearings, controls the budget, and is responsible for passing or repealing Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs). |

**Internal Conflicts:**

- **DoD vs. CIA**: A long-standing rivalry over control of drone strike programs. The DoD operates under the laws of war (Title 10), while the CIA operates under intelligence authorities (Title 50), which have different legal and oversight requirements.
- **Executive Branch vs. Congress**: A perpetual struggle over war powers. The executive branch has consistently used a broad interpretation of the 2001 AUMF to maximize its operational flexibility, while many in Congress argue this has sidelined their constitutional duty to declare war.
- **SOCOM vs. "Big Army"**: A budgetary tension. SOCOM's budget grew massively during the post-9/11 era. As the DoD pivots to GPC, there is pressure to shift funds from SOF to conventional forces and platforms.

## External Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **Foreign Partner Forces** (e.g., Syrian Democratic Forces, Somali National Army) | Receiving U.S. training, equipment, and air support to fight terrorist groups in their own countries. | Provide the ground forces that the U.S. is no longer willing to commit. |
| **Private Technology Companies** | Securing lucrative DoD and IC contracts for AI, cloud computing, and data analysis services. | Ownership of the core technologies (AI models, cloud infrastructure) that modern CT depends on. |
| **Human Rights and Civil Liberties Groups** (e.g., ACLU, Amnesty International) | Protecting civil liberties; ensuring U.S. CT operations comply with international law; transparency regarding civilian casualties. | Moral authority; ability to conduct investigations, file lawsuits, and generate negative media attention. |
| **The American Public** | Security from terrorist attacks without sacrificing core values or becoming entangled in "endless wars." | Public opinion, which ultimately shapes the political will for CT operations. |
| **Terrorist Groups** (e.g., ISIS, al-Qaeda) | Survival, recruitment, and carrying out attacks to advance their ideological goals. | Ability to adapt tactics, exploit grievances, and use the internet for propaganda and recruitment. |
