# Counterterrorism

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of United States counterterrorism (CT) policy, strategy, and operations.

## Overview

While the National Defense Strategy has pivoted to great power competition, counterterrorism remains a critical national security mission. The nature of the threat and the methods used to combat it have evolved significantly since 9/11. The era of large-scale ground wars has been replaced by a strategy of "over-the-horizon" operations, relying on intelligence, special operations forces, and a new generation of technology.

This analysis examines the current terrorist threat landscape, from established groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS to the growing challenge of ideologically motivated violent extremists (IMVEs). It focuses on the tools of modern counterterrorism, particularly the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for intelligence analysis, autonomous systems (drones) for surveillance and strikes, and cyber operations to disrupt terrorist financing and propaganda. It also explores the profound legal, ethical, and strategic challenges of conducting CT in the digital age, including the outdated 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).
