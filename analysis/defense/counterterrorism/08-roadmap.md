# Counterterrorism: Reform Roadmap

Reforming U.S. counterterrorism policy requires a deliberate, phased approach that begins with re-establishing a firm legal foundation and then builds new oversight mechanisms for modern technologies.

---

## Phase 1: Reclaiming War Powers and Increasing Transparency (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on passing landmark legislation to reform the legal basis of the war on terror and increase accountability.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Repeal and Replace the 2001 AUMF** | Congress passes a new, narrowly tailored Authorization for Use of Military Force that names specific groups and regions, and includes a 3-year sunset clause. The 2001 and 2002 AUMFs are repealed. | New AUMF is signed into law. |
| **2. Mandate Transparency for Lethal Strikes** | Congress passes a "Targeted Operations and Civilian Protection Act" requiring annual public reports on drone strikes and civilian casualties. | First annual report is published by the Director of National Intelligence. |
| **3. Charter AI Oversight Commission** | Congress passes legislation to charter the independent "National Commission on AI and Security." | Commission members are appointed and hold their first public hearing. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: End the "forever war" legal framework and establish new standards for transparency and accountability in counterterrorism operations.

## Phase 2: Building New Oversight and Rebalancing Resources (Years 3-5)

This phase focuses on implementing the new oversight bodies and ensuring that CT policy is properly aligned with the broader national defense strategy.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Operationalize AI Oversight** | The National Commission on AI and Security conducts its first review of a classified DoD AI targeting program and delivers its findings to Congress. | First classified report is delivered to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. |
| **2. Conduct CT vs. GPC Net Assessment** | The DoD completes its first formal net assessment of resource allocation between counterterrorism and great power competition, as mandated by the NDAA. | Report is delivered to the Armed Services Committees, leading to a public debate on resource allocation. |
| **3. Shift Funding to Non-Kinetic CT** | Congress increases the budget for the State Department's Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs by 25%. | Funding is appropriated and disbursed for new CVE initiatives. |
| **4. First AUMF Sunset Debate** | Congress holds its first debate on re-authorizing the new AUMF as it approaches its 3-year sunset. | The AUMF is successfully re-authorized after a full public debate and vote. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Establish and normalize the new oversight mechanisms. Begin the process of rebalancing resources from military-led CT to a more holistic, whole-of-government approach.

## Phase 3: Institutionalizing a Modern CT Posture (Years 6-10)

This phase focuses on ensuring the reforms are durable and that the U.S. has a sustainable, effective, and legally sound CT posture for the long term.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. A Sustainable CT Footprint** | The DoD's resource allocation reflects the NDS priority of GPC, with CT managed as a sustainable, "economy of force" mission. | ISR assets and SOF deployments previously focused on CT are successfully re-postured to the Indo-Pacific. |
| **2. Ethical AI as a Standard** | Recommendations from the AI Commission are integrated into DoD doctrine and acquisition requirements for all new autonomous systems. | All new autonomous systems are required to pass an "ethical and safety" review before fielding. |
| **3. A New Legal Consensus** | The process of debating and re-authorizing the AUMF every few years becomes a normal and accepted part of Congress's national security responsibilities. | The AUMF is re-authorized for a third time, cementing the new legal and political consensus. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: The U.S. has a counterterrorism posture that is effective against threats, sustainable in cost, and operates within a clear legal and ethical framework approved by the nation's elected representatives.
