# Counterterrorism: History

## Historical Development

U.S. counterterrorism policy has evolved through three distinct phases since the 9/11 attacks, moving from a massive, state-building enterprise to a more focused, sustainable, and technology-driven model.

---

### Phase 1: The "Global War on Terror" (2001-2008)

- **Context**: The immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The U.S. enjoyed broad domestic and international support.
- **Strategy**: A doctrine of **preemption** and a focus on dismantling al-Qaeda's central leadership and denying it state sanctuary. This was coupled with a "freedom agenda" that sought to drain the "swamp" of extremism by promoting democracy in the Middle East.
- **Key Operations**:
    - **Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan, 2001)**: The invasion of Afghanistan to topple the Taliban regime for harboring al-Qaeda.
    - **Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq, 2003)**: The invasion of Iraq, justified in part by erroneous claims of links to al-Qaeda and WMDs.
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Large Footprint**: Involved hundreds of thousands of U.S. ground troops deployed in large-scale nation-building and counter-insurgency (COIN) campaigns.
    - **"Kinetic" Focus**: The primary effort was military-led, focused on killing or capturing terrorists.
    - **Legal Innovation**: Creation of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and the use of "enhanced interrogation techniques."

### Phase 2: The "Light Footprint" and Drone War Era (2009-2017)

- **Context**: Growing war-weariness in the U.S. and the immense financial and human cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
- **Strategy**: A shift away from large-scale COIN toward a "light footprint" approach. The goal was to manage the terrorist threat through targeted strikes and partnerships, without large U.S. ground commitments.
- **Key Operations**:
    - **The Drone Campaign**: A massive expansion of the use of armed drones for targeted killing of terrorist leaders in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The 2011 strike that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, in Yemen was a landmark and highly controversial moment.
    - **The Bin Laden Raid (2011)**: A successful special operations raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, seen as the culmination of the intelligence-driven, targeted approach.
    - **The Rise of ISIS (2014)**: The collapse of order in Iraq and Syria led to the rise of ISIS. The U.S. responded with **Operation Inherent Resolve**, an air campaign combined with a "by, with, and through" strategy of supporting local partner forces (Iraqi Security Forces and Syrian Democratic Forces).
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Small Footprint**: Relied on small teams of Special Operations Forces (SOF) and CIA operatives.
    - **Technology-Dependent**: Centered on the use of drones for persistent surveillance and precision strikes.
    - **Legal Debates**: Intense debate over the legality and ethics of targeted killing, particularly of U.S. citizens, and the civilian casualties caused by drone strikes.

### Phase 3: The "Over-the-Horizon" and GPC Era (2018-Present)

- **Context**: The formal pivot of U.S. defense strategy to great power competition (GPC) with China and Russia. CT is no longer the top priority but remains an "enduring" mission.
- **Strategy**: An "over-the-horizon" (OTH) posture. The goal is to maintain pressure on terrorist groups without any permanent U.S. troop presence in hostile areas. This model relies almost entirely on technology and remote operations.
- **Key Operations**:
    - **Withdrawal from Afghanistan (2021)**: The end of the 20-year U.S. military presence.
    - **The Zawahiri Strike (2022)**: A drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. This was presented by the Biden administration as proof of the viability of the OTH model.
    - **Continued Operations in Syria and Somalia**: Small numbers of U.S. SOF continue to partner with local forces to fight ISIS and al-Shabaab.
- **Characteristics**:
    - **Zero Footprint (in theory)**: Aims to conduct CT from bases and assets located outside the target country.
    - **AI-Enabled**: Increasingly reliant on AI (like Project Maven) to process vast amounts of ISR data to find and track targets.
    - **Legal Status Quo**: Continues to rely on the 2001 AUMF as the primary legal basis for global operations, despite the changing nature of the threat.

This evolution shows a clear trend: from massive, manpower-intensive operations to a smaller, more sustainable, and technology-centric approach. Each phase has reduced the cost in U.S. lives and dollars but has also made the operations more remote, more reliant on technology, and arguably less transparent to the public and Congress.
