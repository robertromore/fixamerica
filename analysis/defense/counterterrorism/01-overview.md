# Counterterrorism: Overview

## Overview

More than two decades after the September 11th attacks, counterterrorism (CT) remains an enduring national security priority for the United States. However, the strategy has shifted dramatically. The era of large-scale, nation-building ground wars in the Middle East has given way to an "over-the-horizon" approach that relies on a smaller footprint, intelligence-driven targeting, and advanced technology. This new model seeks to manage a persistent, dispersed threat from groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda without detracting from the primary strategic focus on great power competition with China and Russia.

This shift is enabled and complicated by emerging technologies. Artificial intelligence (AI) is used to sift through vast amounts of surveillance data to find threats, while autonomous systems (drones) provide persistent surveillance and precision strike capabilities. Cyber operations are used to disrupt terrorist financing and propaganda. This technology-centric approach is more sustainable and less costly in blood and treasure, but it raises profound legal and ethical questions. The entire U.S. CT enterprise continues to operate largely under the legal authority of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), a law passed in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 that critics argue is dangerously outdated and provides a blank check for endless war.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key components of modern U.S. counterterrorism policy:

- **Threat Landscape**: The nature of current threats from Salafi-jihadist groups (ISIS, al-Qaeda), Iran-backed proxies, and ideologically motivated violent extremists (IMVEs).
- **Strategic Approach**: The "over-the-horizon" strategy and its reliance on special operations forces (SOF), intelligence, and partner forces.
- **Technological Tools**: The role of AI, autonomous systems (drones), and cyber capabilities in CT operations.
- **Legal Framework**: The 2001 AUMF and the legal and constitutional debates surrounding its use.
- **Ethical Challenges**: The issues of civilian casualties, targeted killing, and the use of AI in the "kill chain."
- **Resource Allocation**: The balance between funding CT operations and investing in capabilities for great power competition.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Primary Legal Authority | 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) | Public Law 107-40 |
| Lead Military Command | U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) | DoD |
| Lead Intelligence Agency | National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) | DNI |
| Estimated ISIS Core Strength (Syria/Iraq) | 3,000 - 5,000 | NCTC, 2024 |
| Key ISIS Affiliate | ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K) | State Dept. |
| Key al-Qaeda Affiliate | Al-Shabaab (Somalia) | State Dept. |
| U.S. SOF Deployed Globally (Approx.) | ~5,000 in 80+ countries | SOCOM, 2025 |
| Key Technology - ISR/Strike | MQ-9 Reaper Drone | U.S. Air Force |
| Key Technology - AI Analysis | Project Maven | DoD |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Counterterrorism vs. Great Power Competition (GPC)**: Every dollar, intelligence asset, and special operator focused on CT is one not focused on deterring China or Russia. How does the U.S. balance managing a persistent CT threat without being strategically distracted?
- **Security vs. Civil Liberties**: The tools used to track foreign terrorists—such as surveillance of digital communications—can easily sweep up the data of U.S. citizens, creating a fundamental tension with privacy and civil liberties.
- **Effectiveness vs. Legitimacy**: Drone strikes may be effective at eliminating high-value targets, but if they cause significant civilian casualties, they can undermine the legitimacy of the U.S. and serve as a recruiting tool for terrorists.
- **Speed vs. Human Control**: AI can identify targets much faster than human analysts, but relying on it for targeting decisions creates risks of error and removes human moral judgment from the decision to use lethal force.
- **Legal Overreach vs. Operational Flexibility**: The broad interpretation of the 2001 AUMF gives the executive branch maximum flexibility to pursue threats, but critics argue it is an unconstitutional blank check for war that bypasses Congressional oversight.

## Key Questions

1. Is the 2001 AUMF still a legitimate legal basis for current CT operations, or does it need to be repealed and replaced?
2. What ethical and legal "guardrails" are needed for the use of AI and autonomous systems in targeted killing?
3. How can the U.S. effectively counter terrorist propaganda and recruitment online without infringing on free speech?
4. Is the "over-the-horizon" strategy a sustainable and effective model for preventing another major terrorist attack on the U.S. homeland?

## Vision of Success

A successful 21st-century counterterrorism policy would:

- **Be Legally Sound**: Operations are conducted under a clear, narrow, and updated legal authorization from Congress.
- **Be Sustainable**: The CT mission is resourced at a level that effectively manages risk without derailing the larger strategic focus on GPC.
- **Be Technologically and Ethically Advanced**: The U.S. leverages the best technology for intelligence and targeting while adhering to a strict ethical framework that minimizes civilian harm and maintains human control.
- **Be Integrated**: CT is not a separate "war" but is integrated into broader foreign policy, using diplomatic and economic tools to address the root causes of extremism.
