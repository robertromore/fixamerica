# Counterterrorism: What You Can Do

While counterterrorism policy is often shrouded in secrecy, citizens have a vital role to play in demanding that these operations are conducted legally, ethically, and with democratic oversight.

---

## 1. Advocate for Legal and Constitutional Clarity

The most significant action citizens can take is to push for a reform of the legal framework governing the "war on terror."

- **Demand a Vote on the AUMF**: Contact your Representative and Senators and urge them to support a repeal and replacement of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. Argue that any U.S. military action should be conducted under a specific, narrow, and time-limited authorization that is regularly debated and voted on by Congress.
- **Ask Specific Questions**: At town halls, ask your elected officials:
    - "Do you believe the 2001 AUMF provides a legitimate legal basis for military strikes in countries like Somalia or Syria today?"
    - "What is your position on repealing the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs and forcing a new debate on war powers?"

## 2. Demand Transparency and Accountability

- **Support Transparency on Civilian Harm**: Advocate for legislation that mandates public reporting on U.S. drone strikes and credible assessments of civilian casualties. Support the work of independent organizations like Airwars that investigate and document civilian harm.
- **Call for Ethical AI Oversight**: Engage in the public debate about the use of AI in warfare. Urge your representatives to support the creation of independent, civilian-led oversight bodies to ensure that autonomous systems are used ethically and responsibly.

## 3. Understand the Threat and the Tradeoffs

- **Get Informed**: Read beyond government press releases. Follow the work of organizations listed in the [Resources](09-resources.md) section to get a more complete picture of the terrorist threat and the impact of U.S. CT operations.
- **Recognize the Tradeoffs**: Understand the core tensions of CT policy. Acknowledge that there is often a difficult balance between security and liberty, and between effectiveness and legitimacy. Promote a nuanced public conversation that avoids simplistic solutions.

## 4. Support Non-Military Solutions

- **Advocate for a "Whole-of-Government" Approach**: Argue for increased funding for diplomacy, development aid, and programs that counter violent extremism by addressing its root causes. A purely military approach is a strategy of "mowing the grass" that can never achieve a lasting solution.
