# Counterterrorism: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The persistence of the terrorist threat and the evolution of U.S. counterterrorism (CT) strategy are driven by a combination of geopolitical conditions that allow extremism to flourish and technological advances that change how both terrorists and CT forces operate.

## Drivers of Modern Terrorism

### 1. Failed States and Ungoverned Spaces

- **The Core Problem**: Transnational terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda thrive in areas where there is no effective state authority. Failed states and civil wars (e.g., in Syria, Yemen, Somalia, the Sahel) create power vacuums that these groups exploit.
- **Sanctuary**: These ungoverned spaces provide a safe haven where groups can recruit, train, plan, and raise funds without interference. The ability of ISIS to seize territory in Iraq and Syria and establish a "caliphate" is the prime example.

### 2. The Power of Ideology and Online Radicalization

- **Salafi-Jihadism**: The potent ideology of groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, which calls for a global struggle against "infidels" and the establishment of a caliphate, continues to inspire followers worldwide.
- **The Internet as an Accelerant**: The internet has revolutionized radicalization. Terrorist groups no longer need physical training camps to recruit.
    - **Propaganda**: They can produce and disseminate high-quality propaganda (videos, online magazines) globally and at near-zero cost.
    - **Recruitment**: Social media allows them to directly contact and groom potential recruits.
    - **"Virtual Communities"**: Online forums and encrypted chat apps create echo chambers where extremist views are reinforced, accelerating the path from radicalization to violence. This is particularly true for "lone wolf" attackers inspired by, but not directly connected to, a group.

### 3. Geopolitical and Sectarian Conflicts

- **Proxy Wars**: Regional rivalries, particularly between Saudi Arabia and Iran, fuel proxy wars across the Middle East. These conflicts create chaos and sectarian grievances that terrorist groups exploit.
- **Grievances**: The perception of foreign intervention, civilian casualties from drone strikes, and support for authoritarian regimes are powerful sources of grievance that terrorist groups use in their propaganda to justify violence against the West.

## Drivers of U.S. Counterterrorism Strategy Evolution

The shift from large-scale intervention to "over-the-horizon" (OTH) operations is a direct result of the failures of the former and the opportunities of the latter.

### 1. The Failure of Large-Scale Counter-Insurgency (COIN)

- **Unsustainable Costs**: The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan cost trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives. The U.S. public and political class lost the appetite for long-term, large-scale nation-building missions.
- **Limited Success**: Despite two decades of effort, the U.S. failed to create stable, democratic states capable of securing themselves. The rapid collapse of the Afghan government in 2021 was the final, stark demonstration of the limits of this approach.

### 2. The Technological Revolution in Warfare

- **Persistent Surveillance**: The combination of long-endurance drones (like the MQ-9 Reaper) and space-based satellites created the ability to conduct 24/7 surveillance of almost any point on Earth. This made it possible to "find, fix, and finish" targets without needing troops on the ground.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: The sheer volume of data from this surveillance became impossible for human analysts to process. The development of AI tools (like Project Maven) to automatically scan video and other data was a necessary innovation to make the surveillance-strike model work. AI is the engine that makes the OTH strategy possible.
- **Cyber Capabilities**: The ability to penetrate terrorist communications networks and disrupt their online presence provided a powerful, non-kinetic tool to degrade their capabilities.

### 3. The Strategic Pivot to Great Power Competition (GPC)

- **Resource Reallocation**: The 2018 National Defense Strategy formally declared that GPC, not terrorism, was the primary national security challenge. This created immense pressure on the DoD to shift resources (funding, high-end assets, personnel) away from the CT mission and toward deterring China and Russia.
- **The "Economy of Force" Model**: The OTH strategy is an "economy of force" model. It is designed to manage the persistent, low-level threat of terrorism with the minimum possible investment of resources, thereby freeing up the bulk of the U.S. military to focus on the GPC fight.

## The Self-Perpetuating Cycle

These factors can create a self-perpetuating cycle:

```text
Terrorist Group Exploits Ungoverned Space
    ↓
U.S. Conducts OTH Drone Strikes to Degrade the Group
    ↓
Civilian Casualties from Strikes Create Grievances
    ↓
Terrorist Group Uses Grievances for Online Propaganda and Recruitment
    ↓
New Recruits are Inspired, Group Regenerates
    ↓
(Cycle Repeats)
```

This cycle highlights the core challenge of modern CT: a technologically advanced, tactical approach that may be effective at killing individual terrorists but may fail to address the underlying drivers of extremism, and can sometimes even exacerbate them.
