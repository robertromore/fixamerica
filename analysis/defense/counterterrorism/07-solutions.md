# Counterterrorism: Solutions

Reforming U.S. counterterrorism policy for the modern era requires updating its legal foundations, strengthening its ethical guardrails, and rebalancing its strategic priorities.

---

## 1. Reform the Legal Framework

**A. Repeal and Replace the 2001 AUMF**

- **Description**: The cornerstone of CT reform is to replace the outdated and overly broad 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force with a new statute that is narrowly tailored to the current threat.
- **Implementation**: Congress should pass a new AUMF that:
    - **Names Specific Adversaries**: Explicitly names the specific terrorist groups the U.S. is at war with (e.g., ISIS, al-Shabaab).
    - **Includes Geographic Limits**: Defines the specific countries or regions where military force is authorized.
    - **Contains a Sunset Clause**: Requires the authorization to be debated and re-approved by Congress every 3-5 years, forcing a regular review of the war's progress and necessity.
    - **Repeals the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs**: Explicitly repeals the old authorizations to eliminate legal ambiguity.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Restores Congress's constitutional war powers. Provides a clear and legitimate legal basis for current CT operations. Ends the "forever war" legal theory.

## 2. Strengthen Ethical and Technical Guardrails

**A. Legislate a Framework for Targeted Killing**

- **Description**: Create a clear, statutory framework for the use of lethal force outside of traditional battlefields, particularly drone strikes.
- **Implementation**: Pass a "Targeted Operations and Civilian Protection Act" that would:
    - **Codify Standards**: Legislate the standards for targeting, including the requirement for "near certainty" that no civilians will be harmed in a strike.
    - **Mandate Transparency**: Require the executive branch to publish an annual report detailing the number of strikes taken, the countries where they occurred, and an assessment of combatant and non-combatant casualties.
    - **Create an Independent Review Mechanism**: Establish a process for independent investigation of credible claims of civilian harm.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Increases transparency and accountability for the drone program. Provides a stronger basis for legitimacy both at home and abroad.

**B. Establish an Oversight Body for Algorithmic Warfare**

- **Description**: Create an independent, technically proficient body to oversee the DoD's use of artificial intelligence in the CT "kill chain."
- **Implementation**: Charter a "National Commission on AI and Security" (as proposed in the Civil-Military Relations analysis) composed of civilian AI experts, ethicists, and legal scholars. This commission would be granted access to review the algorithms and data used in programs like Project Maven to check for bias, accuracy, and compliance with ethical principles.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Provides meaningful civilian oversight of a highly technical and secret process. Helps ensure that AI is used as a tool to support, not supplant, human judgment and moral responsibility.

## 3. Rebalance Strategic Priorities and Resources

**A. Mandate a Net Assessment of CT vs. GPC**

- **Description**: Require the Secretary of Defense to conduct a formal net assessment of the resources allocated to counterterrorism versus great power competition.
- **Implementation**: The annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) should require a report from the DoD that details:
    - The percentage of the budget, intelligence assets (especially ISR), and Special Operations Forces that are dedicated to CT missions versus GPC-related missions.
    - An assessment of the strategic risk being accepted in the GPC portfolio due to the demands of the CT mission.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Forces an explicit and data-driven conversation about the strategic tradeoffs being made. Creates pressure to ensure the CT mission is right-sized and not consuming a disproportionate share of resources needed for the pacing challenge of China.

**B. Invest in Non-Military CT Tools**

- **Description**: Shift a portion of the vast resources spent on military CT to diplomatic, economic, and development-focused efforts to counter violent extremism (CVE).
- **Implementation**: Increase funding for the State Department and USAID programs that focus on addressing the root causes of terrorism, such as lack of education, poverty, and poor governance. Support programs that build local community resilience to extremist propaganda.
- **Anticipated Impact**: A more balanced "whole-of-government" approach that focuses on prevention rather than just kinetic strikes. Potentially more cost-effective in the long run than a purely military-led strategy.
