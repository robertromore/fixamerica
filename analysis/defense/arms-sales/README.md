# Arms Sales and Security Cooperation

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of United States arms sales policy, a critical instrument of foreign policy and a major component of the U.S. economy.

## Overview

The U.S. is the world's largest arms exporter, using sales and transfers to build the capacity of allies and partners, promote interoperability, and exert foreign policy influence. The process is governed by a complex web of laws and regulations, primarily the Arms Export Control Act, and is implemented through two main channels: Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS).

This analysis examines the strategic and economic drivers of U.S. arms sales, the regulatory framework designed to control them, and the persistent controversies surrounding human rights, regional stability, and technology proliferation. It places a special focus on the unprecedented challenges posed by the sale and transfer of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous systems, and cyber warfare capabilities, which defy traditional arms control paradigms.
