# Arms Sales: Solutions

Reforming U.S. arms sales policy requires a dual approach: streamlining the process to make it more agile for trusted partners, while simultaneously strengthening oversight and creating a new framework for emerging technologies.

---

## 1. Reform the Arms Transfer Process

**A. Create a Tiered, "Risk-Based" FMS Process**

- **Description**: Replace the one-size-fits-all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process with a tiered system that fast-tracks sales to close, trusted allies while applying greater scrutiny to others.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Tier 1 (Trusted Allies)**: Create a "Tier 1" list of allies (e.g., UK, Australia, Japan, key NATO members). Sales to these nations would have a presumption of approval, a 15-day Congressional notification period, and expedited processing.
    - **Tier 2 (Strategic Partners)**: The standard 30-day notification and review process would apply.
    - **Tier 3 (High-Risk Countries)**: Sales to countries with poor human rights records or in unstable regions would require a 45-day notification period and a mandatory public human rights impact assessment.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Dramatically accelerates sales to key allies, strengthening alliances and making the U.S. a more responsive partner, while increasing oversight where it is most needed.

**B. Increase Transparency of Direct Commercial Sales (DCS)**

- **Description**: The DCS process is far more opaque than FMS. Mandate greater transparency for these licensed sales.
- **Implementation**: Require the State Department to publish a public, searchable database of all approved DCS licenses, including the recipient country, the item, and the value, within 90 days of approval.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Allows for greater public and congressional oversight of the vast majority of U.S. arms exports, enabling more informed debate.

## 2. Create a New Framework for Digital and AI Exports

**A. Establish a "Digital Arms Control" Regime**

- **Description**: The current ITAR framework is designed for hardware and is inadequate for software, AI, and cyber. Create a new, separate regulatory category for these "digital arms."
- **Implementation**:
    - **Create a New USML Category**: Add a new category to the U.S. Munitions List specifically for "AI-enabled and autonomous military systems and related software."
    - **License- and Subscription-Based Transfers**: Shift the model from "selling" a copy of software to "licensing" its use. Transfers could be time-limited or require regular re-authorization.
    - **Technical "Guardrails"**: Mandate that any exported military AI system must include technical safeguards (e.g., hardware "keys," geofencing, un-deletable ethical governors) to prevent misuse or modification.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates a regulatory framework that recognizes the unique nature of software and AI, giving the U.S. government greater long-term control over how its technology is used.

**B. Develop Technical End-Use Monitoring**

- **Description**: Create new technical methods to monitor the use of exported software and AI.
- **Implementation**: Require that licensed military software include a secure "heartbeat" function that regularly reports back to a U.S. government or third-party server to confirm its location and operational status. Tampering with this function would render the software inoperable.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Provides a technical means of end-use monitoring for non-physical arms, addressing a critical gap in the current system.

## 3. Strengthen Human Rights and Accountability

**A. Empower the State Department's Human Rights Vetting**

- **Description**: Give the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) a greater formal role in the arms sales process.
- **Implementation**: Require the head of DRL to formally concur on any proposed sale to a country identified as having significant human rights issues in the State Department's own annual Human Rights Reports. If DRL does not concur, the Secretary of State would have to issue a formal waiver with a written justification to Congress.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Elevates human rights concerns within the interagency process, forcing a more explicit tradeoff between strategic goals and values.

**B. Mandate Post-Sale Impact Assessments**

- **Description**: Currently, assessments happen before a sale. Mandate a regular review of how U.S. arms are being used after they are delivered.
- **Implementation**: Require the State Department and DoD to conduct and publish a joint assessment every two years on the use of U.S.-origin weapons by countries involved in active conflicts.
- **Anticipated Impact**: Creates a feedback loop that can inform future sales decisions and increases accountability for how U.S. weapons are used.
