# Arms Sales: Legislation

## Overview

U.S. arms sales are governed primarily by the **Arms Export Control Act (AECA) of 1976** and the **Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961**. These laws establish the framework for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), giving the President broad authority to negotiate sales while reserving a legislative veto for Congress. Additional authorities include the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the Export Control Reform Act of 2018, and various country-specific sanctions statutes.

The scale of U.S. arms exports is enormous. The United States accounts for approximately 42 percent of global arms transfers (SIPRI, 2024), with FMS agreements totaling $80.9 billion in fiscal year 2023 alone. Major recipients include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Japan, and Taiwan. The defense industrial base employs approximately 1.1 million workers across the country, creating powerful economic incentives that shape legislative outcomes.

However, the current oversight system is widely viewed as broken. Congress has *never* successfully blocked a sale via a Joint Resolution of Disapproval due to the requirement for a veto-proof supermajority. Between 1996 and 2024, 18 Resolutions of Disapproval were introduced and none were enacted. Furthermore, the system lacks robust mechanisms for monitoring how U.S. weapons are used after delivery (End-Use Monitoring), leading to documented complicity in human rights abuses in conflicts in Yemen, Gaza, Myanmar, and elsewhere.

The emergence of AI-enabled weapons, autonomous systems, and advanced surveillance technologies creates additional challenges not anticipated by the original AECA framework. These technologies can be transferred digitally, are difficult to track after delivery, and pose novel risks including the erosion of human control over lethal force decisions.

The legislative framework proposed here aims to "flip the script" on arms sales oversight through two complementary bills:

- **The Arms Export Reform and Oversight Act (AERO Act)**: Requires affirmative Congressional approval for major sales, strengthens human rights conditions, and establishes automatic suspension mechanisms for documented abuses.
- **The Emerging Technology Transfer Control Act (ETTCA)**: Creates specific controls for AI, autonomous weapons, and surveillance technology exports, addressing gaps in the existing USML and Commerce Control List.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required. Congress has plenary power over foreign commerce (Article I, Section 8) and the disposition of U.S. property (Article IV, Section 3), which provides ample authority to regulate arms exports.*

---

## Federal Legislation

### The Arms Export Reform and Oversight Act

**Purpose**: To reassert Congressional authority over arms sales by requiring affirmative approval for major sales and enhancing human rights safeguards.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Amendment to the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, reported through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **"Flip the Script"**: Requires a Joint Resolution of Approval for sales exceeding $14 million to most countries (excluding NATO+5), rather than the current system where sales proceed unless blocked.
2. **Human Rights Certification**: Mandates that the State Department certify a recipient country has not committed gross violations of human rights or international humanitarian law in the past year before a sale can proceed.
3. **End-Use Monitoring Reform**: Strengthens the "Leahy Laws" and Blue Lantern program to require on-site inspections and automatic suspension of support if U.S. weapons are used in war crimes.
4. **Offset Transparency**: Requires public disclosure of "offsets" (side deals) attached to arms sales contracts.
5. **Emergency Waiver Reform**: Limits the President's authority to bypass Congress using emergency waivers to true national security emergencies, with a strict time limit.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To reform the Arms Export Control Act to restore Congressional oversight, protect human rights, and ensure arms sales serve the national interest.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Arms Export Reform and Oversight Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States is the world's largest arms exporter, accounting for 42 percent of global arms exports between 2019 and 2023, with deliveries valued at approximately $238,000,000,000 over that period (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI Arms Transfers Database).
(2) Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreements reached $80,900,000,000 in fiscal year 2023, a record high, according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.
(3) The Congressional Research Service has documented that between 1996 and 2024, Congress introduced 18 Joint Resolutions of Disapproval to block proposed arms sales, and not a single one was enacted into law.
(4) Under current law, Congress must pass a veto-proof Joint Resolution of Disapproval to stop a sale, a threshold that has never been met, effectively reducing Congressional oversight to a procedural formality.
(5) U.S. weapons have been used in conflicts in Yemen, Gaza, and elsewhere in ways that implicate the United States in potential violations of international humanitarian law, including documented use of U.S.-supplied precision-guided munitions in strikes that killed civilians.
(6) The Government Accountability Office has identified persistent deficiencies in end-use monitoring, reporting that the Defense Security Cooperation Agency could not account for the disposition of transferred defense articles in multiple recipient countries.
(7) Effective oversight requires affirmative Congressional consent for significant transfers of lethal assistance to ensure democratic accountability over the use of American weapons abroad.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) MAJOR DEFENSE EQUIPMENT.—The term "major defense equipment" has the meaning given in section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2794(6)).
(2) NATO+5.—The term "NATO+5" means member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, plus Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Israel, and New Zealand.
(3) GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS.—The term has the meaning given in section 502B(d)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)).

SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF SALES.

(a) AMENDMENT.—Section 36 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2776) is amended—
    (1) by striking "unless the Congress adopts a joint resolution of disapproval" and inserting "only if the Congress adopts a joint resolution of approval"; and
    (2) by applying this requirement to any letter of offer to sell major defense equipment for $14,000,000 or more, or any defense articles or services for $50,000,000 or more, to any country other than a NATO+5 country.
(b) EXPEDITED PROCEDURES.—The Senate and House of Representatives shall consider such resolutions of approval under expedited procedures to ensure timely consideration.

SEC. 5. HUMAN RIGHTS CERTIFICATION.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—No sale may be approved unless the Secretary of State certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that the government of the recipient country has not, within the preceding 12 months, engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.
(b) REPORT.—The certification must be accompanied by a detailed report on the recipient country's human rights record and the intended use of the weapons.

SEC. 6. END-USE MONITORING AND SUSPENSION.

(a) ENHANCED MONITORING.—The Secretary of Defense shall establish a program of systematic, post-delivery monitoring of all major defense equipment sold to non-NATO+5 countries.
(b) AUTOMATIC SUSPENSION.—If the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense receives credible information that U.S.-origin weapons have been used to commit a gross violation of human rights or a war crime, all deliveries and support to that unit or country shall be automatically suspended pending an investigation.

SEC. 7. EMERGENCY WAIVER LIMITATION.

(a) AUTHORITY.—The President may waive the requirements of Section 4 only if the President certifies in writing to the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate that an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale in the national security interests of the United States.
(b) DURATION.—Such waiver shall be valid for not more than 60 days and may not be renewed for the same sale.
(c) DEFINITION OF EMERGENCY.—For purposes of this section, an "emergency" means an imminent threat to the national security of the United States or a treaty ally that requires an immediate transfer of defense articles to address the threat.
(d) REPORTING.—Within 48 hours of invoking this authority, the President shall provide a classified briefing to the JCAS detailing the nature of the emergency, the specific defense articles to be transferred, and the recipient country.
(e) CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW.—Congress retains the authority to terminate any emergency sale through a joint resolution enacted within the 60-day waiver period.

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) OFFSET REPORTING.—The Secretary of State shall submit an annual report to Congress listing all commercial offset agreements associated with foreign military sales, including the value, nature, and recipient country of such offsets.
(b) HUMAN RIGHTS COMPLIANCE REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the JCAS and the appropriate congressional committees on:
    (1) all instances of documented or alleged misuse of U.S.-origin defense articles;
    (2) all automatic suspensions triggered under Section 6 and their disposition;
    (3) the status of each recipient country's human rights certification; and
    (4) a list of all sales approved under emergency waiver authority and the justification for each.
(c) PUBLIC SUMMARY.—An unclassified summary of the report required under subsection (b) shall be made available to the public.

SEC. 9. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, and the application of the provisions of this Act to any person or circumstance, shall not be affected thereby.

SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department of State and Department of Defense such sums as may be necessary to implement the enhanced monitoring and oversight requirements of this Act.
(b) SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATIONS.—The following amounts are authorized:
    (1) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2027, for initial establishment of the enhanced end-use monitoring program, hiring of additional compliance staff, and development of the classified tracking dashboard.
    (2) $55,000,000 for fiscal year 2028, for expansion of on-site inspection capacity and training of foreign liaison officers.
    (3) $58,000,000 for fiscal year 2029, for full operational capability of the monitoring program and integration with the proposed Joint Committee on Arms Sales.
    (4) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2030, for technology upgrades to tracking systems and expansion to cover legacy sales.
    (5) $62,000,000 for fiscal year 2031, for sustained operations and program evaluation.
(c) AVAILABILITY.—Amounts authorized under this section shall remain available until expended.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual record using SIPRI data, CRS reports, and GAO findings to justify legislative action and survive rational-basis judicial review.
- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Uses existing statutory definitions where possible to avoid litigation over scope while adding the NATO+5 category to preserve alliance flexibility.
- **Section 4 (Congressional Approval)**: This is the core reform. By requiring approval (like a treaty or a bill) rather than disapproval, it restores Congress's Article I power. The $14 million and $50 million thresholds match current AECA notification requirements but flip the procedural default. It exempts close allies (NATO+5) to maintain alliance cohesion and prevent logistical bottlenecks in routine interoperability transfers.
- **Section 5 (Human Rights Certification)**: Codifies what has been discretionary State Department practice. The 12-month look-back window prevents "certification shopping" where a country improves behavior briefly before a sale, then reverts.
- **Section 6 (End-Use Monitoring)**: Moves from "monitoring" to "enforcement." Currently, the Golden Sentry and Blue Lantern programs identify violations but rarely trigger consequences. This creates an automatic trigger for suspension, shifting the burden of proof to the recipient to show they are compliant before transfers resume.
- **Section 7 (Emergency Waiver)**: Closes the loophole used by administrations (e.g., the Trump Administration's 2019 invocation of emergency authority to bypass Congressional review of $8.1 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia) by strictly defining "emergency" and imposing a 60-day time limit.
- **Section 8 (Reporting)**: Addresses the opacity of offset agreements, which can involve technology transfers, co-production deals, and counter-trade arrangements worth billions that currently escape public scrutiny.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish Implementing Regulations (Interim Final Rule) | 60 days after enactment | State Dept DDTC |
| Issue Guidance on Approval Process | 90 days after enactment | State Dept / Congress |
| Establish Enhanced Monitoring Program | 180 days after enactment | DoD DSCA |
| Deploy Classified EUM Dashboard (Initial Operating Capability) | 270 days after enactment | DoD / Intelligence Community |
| Complete Staff Hiring for Compliance Division | 1 year after enactment | State Dept / DoD |
| First Annual Offset Report | 1 year after enactment | State Dept |
| Full Operational Capability for Monitoring | 18 months after enactment | DoD DSCA |
| First Five-Year Review of Approval Mechanism | 5 years after enactment | Congress (JCAS) |

**Challenges**:

- **Executive Resistance**: Every President will oppose this as an infringement on their foreign policy authority. The executive branch will argue that the approval requirement impairs the ability to respond rapidly to shifting security environments and maintain alliance commitments.
- **Defense Industry Lobbying**: Contractors will argue this makes the U.S. an "unreliable partner" and drives customers to China, Russia, France, and Turkey. The Aerospace Industries Association and the National Defense Industrial Association will mobilize significant resources to oppose the legislation, emphasizing job impacts in key Congressional districts.
- **Congressional Capacity**: The volume of arms sales notifications (often exceeding 50 per year) may overwhelm Congressional scheduling. Without adequate staffing and streamlined procedures, the approval requirement could become either a bottleneck or a rubber stamp.
- **Alliance Management**: Close partners such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE may view the new requirements as a signal of reduced U.S. commitment, potentially accelerating their pursuit of alternative suppliers or indigenous production capabilities.
- **Legal Challenge**: The executive branch may challenge the legislation on separation-of-powers grounds, arguing that it unconstitutionally constrains the President's Article II authority over foreign affairs, though the Commerce Clause provides strong Congressional authority.

**Refinements**:

- Include a "fast track" for sales that are unanimously supported by the Foreign Relations committees to prevent procedural delays, with a guaranteed floor vote within 15 legislative days.
- Establish a tiered review system where sales to countries with strong human rights records and existing defense cooperation agreements receive expedited 30-day review, while sales to countries with documented concerns face full 90-day review with mandatory hearings.
- Add a "snap-back" provision allowing any member of the Foreign Relations or Armed Services committees to trigger an expedited floor vote if new information emerges about a recipient country's human rights conduct after initial approval.
- Authorize the JCAS to approve routine spare parts and maintenance sales below a secondary threshold (e.g., $5 million) through a committee vote rather than requiring a full floor vote, reducing the procedural burden while maintaining oversight.

### The Emerging Technology Transfer Control Act

**Purpose**: To establish specific controls on the export of Artificial Intelligence (AI), autonomous weapons systems, and surveillance technology, preventing their proliferation to authoritarian regimes.

**Legislative Vehicle**: New standalone legislation referred jointly to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee, and to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **AI Export Controls**: Adds AI algorithms and training data tailored for military use to the U.S. Munitions List (USML).
2. **Autonomous Weapons Review**: Mandates a specific "Lethal Autonomous Systems Review" for any export of unmanned systems capable of selecting targets without human intervention.
3. **Surveillance Tech Ban**: Prohibits the export of biometric surveillance or cyber-intrusion tools to countries with a record of suppressing dissent.
4. **End-Use Verification for Tech**: Requires digital rights management (DRM) or "kill switches" in exported high-tech software to prevent unauthorized transfer or use.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To regulate the export of emerging defense technologies and prevent the proliferation of digital authoritarianism.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Emerging Technology Transfer Control Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The proliferation of artificial intelligence and autonomous weapons poses unique stability risks not addressed by traditional arms control regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Wassenaar Arrangement.
(2) The global market for military AI applications is projected to exceed $18,000,000,000 by 2028, with the United States as the leading developer and exporter.
(3) U.S. technology has been diverted to authoritarian regimes for use in mass surveillance and repression, including documented cases of U.S.-origin surveillance technology deployed against journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders.
(4) At least 30 countries are developing or have acquired armed unmanned systems, and no binding international framework governs their export or use.
(5) The Department of Commerce Entity List and the State Department U.S. Munitions List have not been updated to adequately address AI-enabled weapons, dual-use algorithms, or cyber-intrusion capabilities.
(6) Maintaining a technological edge requires strict controls on the transfer of foundational AI models and autonomous logic, balanced against the need to support allied interoperability.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) LETHAL AUTONOMOUS WEAPON SYSTEM (LAWS).—A weapon system that, once activated, can select and engage targets without further intervention by a human operator.
(2) BIOMETRIC SURVEILLANCE.—Technology capable of identifying individuals based on physical or behavioral characteristics in real-time.
(3) EMERGING DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY.—Any technology, including artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, quantum computing applications, directed energy systems, or hypersonic systems, that is designed for or readily adaptable to military use and that the Secretary of State determines provides a significant military advantage.
(4) DUAL-USE CAPABILITY.—A technology, system, or component that has both a substantial civilian application and a military or intelligence application, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce in consultation with the Secretary of Defense.

SEC. 4. CONTROLS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

(a) USML UPDATE.—The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall update the United States Munitions List to include military-grade AI software, algorithms, and training datasets.
(b) PRESUMPTION OF DENIAL.—There shall be a presumption of denial for licenses to export covered AI technologies to any country that is not a NATO+5 member.

SEC. 5. LETHAL AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS REVIEW.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—No license may be granted for the export of a LAWS unless the Secretary of State certifies that the recipient country has:
    (1) A doctrine requiring meaningful human control over the use of force; and
    (2) Adequate legal and ethical training for operators.

SEC. 6. SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY PROHIBITION.

It shall be unlawful to export, re-export, or transfer any biometric surveillance system or cyber-intrusion software to any government that the Secretary of State has determined engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights.

SEC. 7. END-USE VERIFICATION FOR TECHNOLOGY.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—All exports of covered emerging defense technology shall include technical safeguards, which may include digital rights management, remote disabling capability, or cryptographic access controls, to prevent unauthorized transfer, reverse engineering, or modification.
(b) REPORTING.—Any licensee who becomes aware of an attempted or actual circumvention of technical safeguards shall report such circumvention to the Secretary of State within 72 hours.
(c) PENALTIES.—Failure to include required technical safeguards, or failure to report known circumvention, shall be grounds for license revocation and debarment.

SEC. 8. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.

(a) MULTILATERAL ENGAGEMENT.—The President shall seek to negotiate multilateral agreements on the export of emerging defense technologies through the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and other appropriate multilateral forums.
(b) BILATERAL AGREEMENTS.—The Secretary of State shall seek to conclude bilateral end-use monitoring agreements with each country receiving emerging defense technology exports valued at more than $10,000,000 in any fiscal year.

SEC. 9. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

The Secretary of State shall report annually on the global proliferation of LAWS and U.S. efforts to establish international norms for their use, including:
(1) An inventory of countries known to possess or be developing LAWS;
(2) Assessment of compliance by recipient countries with human control doctrines;
(3) Status of multilateral negotiations on autonomous weapons norms; and
(4) Recommendations for updates to the control lists established under this Act.

SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—There are authorized to be appropriated to the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, and such other agencies as are necessary, the following amounts for enforcement and implementation of this Act:
    (1) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2027, for hiring technical experts in AI and autonomous systems, developing classification criteria, and establishing interagency coordination mechanisms.
    (2) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2028, for deployment of automated export screening tools, expansion of the Entity List review process, and training of licensing officers.
    (3) $28,000,000 for fiscal year 2029, for full enforcement operations, international engagement on norm-setting, and technology assessment capabilities.
    (4) $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2030, for sustained operations and establishment of a technology forecasting unit to anticipate emerging threats.
    (5) $32,000,000 for fiscal year 2031, for continued operations, program evaluation, and update of control lists based on technological developments.
(b) AVAILABILITY.—Amounts authorized under this section shall remain available until expended.

SEC. 11. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, and the application of the provisions of this Act to any person or circumstance, shall not be affected thereby.

SEC. 12. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual predicate for regulation by documenting the scale of the military AI market, documented diversion cases, and the gap in existing multilateral frameworks. Uses specific figures to support the legislative record.
- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Provides four core definitions, including the novel "emerging defense technology" and "dual-use capability" categories that give agencies flexibility to add technologies through rulemaking without requiring new legislation as the field evolves.
- **Section 4 (AI Controls)**: Treats code like a weapon. Just as we control the export of missiles, we must control the export of the AI "brains" that guide them. The "presumption of denial" for non-NATO+5 countries creates a high bar while preserving executive discretion to approve transfers on a case-by-case basis with adequate safeguards.
- **Section 5 (LAWS Review)**: Creates a distinct certification process for autonomous weapons that goes beyond standard export license review. The requirement for "meaningful human control" doctrine codifies an emerging international norm (endorsed by 70+ countries at the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons) into U.S. export law.
- **Section 6 (Surveillance Prohibition)**: Prevents U.S. tech companies from arming dictators with the tools of digital repression (e.g., facial recognition used against protesters). The prohibition is categorical for countries with documented patterns of repression, eliminating case-by-case discretion that has historically led to approvals despite red flags.
- **Section 7 (Reporting)**: Ensures Congress has ongoing visibility into global LAWS proliferation trends, enabling proactive legislative updates rather than reactive responses to crises.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Publish Interim Final Rule on AI Export Classification | 90 days after enactment | State Dept DDTC / Commerce BIS |
| Convene Interagency Technical Advisory Panel | 120 days after enactment | OSTP / NSC |
| Update USML with AI and Autonomous Systems Categories | 180 days after enactment | State Dept DDTC |
| Publish LAWS Certification Criteria and Review Procedures | 1 year after enactment | State / DoD |
| Complete First Annual Proliferation Report | 1 year after enactment | State Dept |
| Establish Dual-Use Technology Screening Protocol | 18 months after enactment | Commerce BIS |
| First Review of Control List Adequacy | 2 years after enactment | Interagency Committee |

**Challenges**:

- **Definition**: Defining "AI" legally is notoriously difficult; the statute relies on agency rulemaking to keep pace with tech. The broad "emerging defense technology" definition may face industry challenges as vague or overbroad.
- **Dual-Use**: Many AI tools have both civilian and military uses; controls must not stifle commercial innovation or impede academic research collaboration with allied nations.
- **Enforcement Complexity**: Detecting unauthorized transfer of software and algorithms is fundamentally harder than tracking physical weapons systems, requiring new technical capabilities within enforcement agencies.

**Refinements**:

- Establish a standing Technical Advisory Committee comprising industry representatives, academic experts, and civil society organizations to advise on classification decisions and prevent over-classification of commercially available technologies.
- Create a "trusted partner" licensing framework for NATO+5 countries that allows pre-approved transfers of specified AI technologies under streamlined procedures, with annual review of partner compliance.
- Include a "catch-all" provision empowering the Secretary of State to impose ad hoc controls on any emerging technology transfer where there is a reasonable basis to believe the technology will be used for military purposes, even if not yet listed on the USML.

---

## Congressional Oversight Mechanisms

Since state legislation is not applicable to international arms sales (federal preemption under the Foreign Commerce Clause is complete), the following Congressional oversight mechanisms are proposed as alternatives to state-level action:

### The Arms Sales Joint Committee

**Proposal**: Establish a permanent Joint Committee on Arms Sales (JCAS) modeled after the Joint Committee on Taxation.

**Function**: To provide continuous, specialized staff expertise to review technical notifications, conduct classified assessments of end-use monitoring, and advise the Foreign Relations/Armed Services committees.

**Structure**:

- **Membership**: 10 members of the Senate (5 from Foreign Relations, 5 from Armed Services) and 10 members of the House (5 from Foreign Affairs, 5 from Armed Services), with party balance reflecting chamber composition.
- **Staff**: A permanent professional staff of not fewer than 25 analysts with expertise in defense technology, international law, human rights, and regional security, all holding Top Secret/SCI clearances.
- **Authority**: Subpoena power over executive branch agencies and defense contractors regarding arms transfer documentation, end-use reports, and compliance records.
- **Meetings**: Required to meet not fewer than twice monthly when Congress is in session, with additional emergency sessions as needed.
- **Reporting**: Required to publish an unclassified annual report on arms sales trends, human rights compliance, and oversight findings.

**Rationale**: The current system distributes arms sales oversight across at least four committees (Senate Foreign Relations, Senate Armed Services, House Foreign Affairs, House Armed Services), resulting in fragmented attention and duplicative briefings. A dedicated joint committee consolidates expertise and ensures sustained attention to a policy area that involves hundreds of billions of dollars in annual transactions.

### Enhanced End-Use Monitoring (EUM) Dashboard

**Proposal**: Mandate the creation of a classified, Congress-accessible dashboard tracking the location and status of all serial-numbered U.S. weapons in high-risk zones.

**Capabilities**:

- Real-time tracking of major defense equipment using GPS/RFID systems installed as a condition of sale
- Integration with intelligence community reporting on recipient country military operations
- Automated alerts when U.S.-origin weapons are detected in unauthorized locations or in the possession of non-approved end-users
- Historical tracking of all suspension and investigation actions, with outcomes
- Geofencing capability that flags when tracked equipment moves outside authorized deployment areas

**Access**: Available to JCAS members and staff, members of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, and the Government Accountability Office for audit purposes.

### Informal Notification Reform

**Proposal**: Require that all informal pre-notifications of potential arms sales (currently used to gauge Congressional reaction before formal notification) be documented in writing and provided to the JCAS. Under current practice, the executive branch uses informal consultations to withdraw notifications that face opposition, avoiding a formal record of Congressional objection. This reform ensures transparency in the pre-notification process.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agencies**:

- **Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC)**: Licensing authority for USML items, human rights certification, and offset reporting.
- **Department of Defense, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA)**: Administration of FMS cases, end-use monitoring through Golden Sentry and Blue Lantern programs, and management of the classified EUM dashboard.
- **Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)**: Dual-use technology controls, Entity List management, and enforcement of the Emerging Technology Transfer Control Act.
- **National Security Council**: Interagency coordination on policy-level decisions regarding sales to sensitive recipients.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **ITAR Amendment**: Update the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130) to reflect the new AI and autonomous systems controls, including new USML categories for military-grade AI software, training datasets, and autonomous engagement logic.
2. **EAR Amendment**: Update the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Parts 730-774) to add dual-use AI technologies to the Commerce Control List, coordinated with Wassenaar Arrangement updates.
3. **EUM Protocols**: New Golden Sentry (EUM) protocols for "automatic suspension" triggers, including standardized criteria for "credible information" of misuse and a 72-hour response timeline for suspension decisions.
4. **Congressional Notification Procedures**: New regulations establishing the format, timing, and classification level of notifications to the Joint Committee on Arms Sales, including classified annexes on intelligence assessments of recipient country behavior.
5. **LAWS Certification Standards**: Detailed criteria for evaluating a recipient country's doctrine on meaningful human control, operator training requirements, and legal review procedures for autonomous weapons employment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **License Revocation**: State Department authority to revoke export licenses for violations, with expedited procedures for cases involving documented human rights abuses.
- **Criminal Penalties**: Fines up to $1,000,000 and imprisonment up to 20 years for violating the AECA (22 U.S.C. 2778(c)), with enhanced penalties for violations involving autonomous weapons or surveillance technology transfers to human rights abusers.
- **Watchlists**: Enhanced "Blue Lantern" watchlists for entities with a history of diversion, integrated with the Commerce Department Entity List and the Treasury Department OFAC sanctions list.
- **Automatic Debarment**: Entities found to have facilitated unauthorized third-party transfers are automatically debarred from receiving future export licenses for a minimum of 5 years.
- **Whistleblower Protections**: Employees of defense contractors who report violations of end-use conditions or unauthorized transfers are protected under an extension of the existing AECA whistleblower framework.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Separation of Powers**: The core constitutional question is whether Congress can condition arms sales on affirmative legislative approval without unconstitutionally encroaching on the President's foreign affairs power.

**INS v. Chadha (1983)**: The Supreme Court ruled the "legislative veto" unconstitutional. This is why the current system requires a Joint Resolution of Disapproval (which the President can veto). The proposed "Flip the Script" legislation (requiring affirmative approval) avoids the *Chadha* problem because if Congress *doesn't* act, the sale dies--no veto override is needed. Congress is not vetoing an executive action; it is exercising its constitutional authority over foreign commerce and the disposition of government property by requiring affirmative authorization.

**Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952)**: Justice Jackson's concurrence established the three-tier framework for evaluating executive action relative to Congressional authorization. When Congress has expressly prohibited or conditioned an action (Category Three), presidential power is at its "lowest ebb." By requiring affirmative approval, the AERO Act places unauthorized sales in Category Three, the zone of weakest executive authority.

**Dames & Moore v. Regan (1981)**: The Court upheld broad executive action in foreign affairs where Congress had implicitly approved it through a pattern of acquiescence. Arms sale opponents may argue that decades of Congressional failure to block sales constitutes acquiescence to executive primacy. The AERO Act forecloses this argument by explicitly revoking the prior delegation.

**Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: The Court recognized exclusive presidential authority over diplomatic recognition but noted that Congress retains broad power over foreign commerce, immigration, and other domains touching foreign affairs. Arms sales fall within Congress's enumerated commerce power, not the President's exclusive recognition power.

### Preemption

Federal law completely preempts state law on arms exports. The AECA and ITAR establish a comprehensive federal regulatory scheme under the Foreign Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3). States cannot impose additional conditions on international arms transfers, and any state divestment legislation targeting arms manufacturers must avoid conflicting with federal foreign policy as established in *Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council*, 530 U.S. 363 (2000).

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Criminal Penalties**: Violations of the AECA carry penalties of up to $1,000,000 in fines and 20 years imprisonment (22 U.S.C. 2778(c)). The proposed legislation strengthens enforcement by creating additional violations for failure to comply with end-use monitoring requirements and for facilitating unauthorized third-party transfers.

**Administrative Sanctions**: The State Department may debar entities from receiving future export licenses. The proposed legislation adds automatic debarment for any entity found to have facilitated unauthorized re-transfers.

**Judicial Review**: Export license decisions are generally not subject to judicial review under the political question doctrine. However, the proposed legislation preserves judicial review for procedural violations (e.g., failure to follow certification requirements) while maintaining executive discretion over substantive foreign policy judgments.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| **Dollar Thresholds** | Administration splits a large sale into many small sales under the $14M threshold to avoid notification. | High | Aggregate all sales to a country within a fiscal year for threshold calculation. |
| **"Emergency" Declarations** | President declares emergency to bypass Congress (as in 2019). | High | Section 7 strictly limits waivers to 60 days and defines "emergency." |
| **Direct Commercial Sales (DCS)** | Shifting sales from FMS (government-to-government) to DCS (private) to reduce transparency. | Medium | Apply the same notification/approval requirements to DCS as FMS. |
| **Third-Party Transfers** | Recipient country re-transfers U.S. weapons to a third party (e.g., Saudi Arabia transferring U.S. weapons to militia groups in Yemen) without U.S. consent, circumventing human rights conditions. | High | Require GPS/RFID tracking on major defense equipment and mandate real-time notification to Congress of any detected unauthorized transfer, with automatic sanctions triggering. |
| **Maintenance Contract Exemptions** | Arms manufacturers use ongoing maintenance, training, and spare parts contracts to sustain weapons systems in countries that would not qualify for new sales, effectively continuing arms relationships outside the approval framework. | Medium | Include maintenance contracts, spare parts, and technical support above $5,000,000 in the definition of "defense articles and services" subject to Congressional approval. |
| **End-Use Monitoring Gaps** | The Blue Lantern and Golden Sentry programs rely on recipient country cooperation for on-site inspections; countries can deny access or stage inspections to conceal misuse. | High | Authorize unannounced inspections as a condition of sale, and mandate satellite and signals intelligence monitoring as a supplement to on-site visits. Failure to permit inspection triggers automatic suspension. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Partner Alienation** | Buyers may switch to non-US suppliers (France, China) to avoid hassle. | Sovereignty concerns. | Expedited "White List" for trusted allies with good human rights records. |
| **Enforcement Capacity** | State/DoD lack staff to monitor every weapon. | Resource constraints. | Increased appropriations for EUM staff (Section 9). |
| **Technological Obsolescence** | The legislation defines AI and autonomous systems based on current technology; rapid advances may render definitions inadequate within 2-3 years. | Pace of innovation exceeds legislative cycles. | Delegate definitional updates to agency rulemaking with annual review requirement and mandatory Congressional notification. |
| **Multilateral Coordination Gap** | Unilateral U.S. controls push buyers to non-U.S. suppliers (France, Russia, China, Turkey) that impose no human rights conditions, undermining both U.S. influence and human rights goals. | Lack of binding multilateral arms trade norms. | Pursue parallel diplomatic track to strengthen the Arms Trade Treaty and Wassenaar Arrangement controls, with provisions to relax U.S. controls when multilateral alternatives achieve equivalent protections. |
| **Congressional Capacity** | The "Flip the Script" mechanism requires Congress to affirmatively vote on potentially hundreds of sales per year, risking either legislative gridlock or rubber-stamping. | Institutional workload limits. | Establish the Joint Committee on Arms Sales with dedicated staff, classified briefing authority, and delegated authority to approve routine sales below a secondary threshold. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Aggregation Rule**: Amend the AECA to require that all sales of "defense articles" to a single country be aggregated over a 12-month rolling period to prevent threshold evasion through contract splitting.
2. **Third-Party Transfers**: Strengthen requirements for U.S. permission before a buyer can re-transfer weapons to a third party (e.g., Israel to Azerbaijan), with criminal penalties for unauthorized re-transfers and automatic suspension of future sales.
3. **Maintenance Contract Integration**: Amend the definition of "defense articles and services" to explicitly include maintenance, training, spare parts, and technical data packages above a de minimis threshold.
4. **Rolling Technology Review**: Require the Secretary of State to update export control classifications for AI and autonomous systems on a semi-annual basis, with a mandatory report to Congress on any technologies that fall outside existing categories.
5. **Multilateral Engagement Mandate**: Direct the President to pursue amendments to the Wassenaar Arrangement and to negotiate bilateral end-use monitoring agreements with major recipient countries within 2 years of enactment.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Interagency Coordination**: The legislation requires coordination across State, Defense, Commerce, and the Intelligence Community, creating risk of bureaucratic delays and conflicting guidance. | Designate a single senior official (Deputy NSA level) as the Arms Export Coordinator with authority to resolve interagency disputes within 30 days. |
| **Classification Barriers**: Much of the information relevant to arms sales oversight is classified, limiting Congressional staff access and public accountability. | Mandate unclassified summaries of all human rights certifications and end-use monitoring reports, with classified annexes available to cleared staff of the JCAS. |
| **Transition Risk**: Shifting from the current disapproval framework to an approval framework during active sales pipelines could disrupt pending transactions and damage alliance relationships. | Include a 12-month transition period during which sales already notified to Congress proceed under existing rules, with the new framework applying only to new notifications. |
| **Industry Compliance Burden**: Defense contractors must adapt compliance programs, contracts, and supply chains to new requirements, particularly for AI and autonomous systems. | Provide a 180-day implementation period for industry and fund an SBA technical assistance program for small and mid-size defense contractors. |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **AERO Act**: Comprehensive review of the "Flip the Script" mechanism after 5 years to ensure it hasn't paralyzed security cooperation, with metrics including: average time to Congressional action, number of sales approved/denied, and allied partner satisfaction surveys.
- **Emerging Technology Transfer Control Act**: Mandatory 3-year review of all technology classification decisions, with automatic sunset of specific control categories that have not been renewed by agency rulemaking.
- **Joint Committee Review**: The JCAS shall issue a biennial report assessing the overall effectiveness of the reformed oversight framework, including recommendations for legislative adjustments.
