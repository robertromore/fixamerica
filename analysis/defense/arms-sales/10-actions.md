# Arms Sales: What You Can Do

While arms sales policy is set at the federal level, informed citizens can play a significant role in demanding transparency and accountability in the process.

## 1. Get Informed

- **Track the Sales**: Use public resources like the DSCA's press releases on major sales and the Security Assistance Monitor's database to see what weapons the U.S. is selling and to whom.
- **Understand the Law**: Read about the Arms Export Control Act and the Leahy Law. Understand the legal framework that is supposed to govern these sales.
- **Follow the Debate**: Read analysis from think tanks and advocacy groups on both sides of the issue—those who see sales as a vital foreign policy tool and those who see them as a source of instability and human rights abuses.

## 2. Engage with Congress

Congress has the power to block a major arms sale by passing a joint resolution of disapproval within a 30-day review window. This is the most direct point of leverage for citizens.

- **Contact Your Representatives**: When a major, controversial sale is announced (e.g., to a country involved in a conflict or with a poor human rights record), contact your Representative and Senators. Tell them whether you support or oppose the sale and why.
- **Ask Specific Questions**: At town halls, ask specific questions about the tradeoffs:
    - "I support our alliance with [Country X], but I am concerned about their human rights record. How do you weigh those competing interests when considering the sale of advanced weapons to them?"
    - "What is Congress doing to ensure that U.S.-made weapons are not being used against civilians in the [Y Conflict]?"
    - "Do you believe our current laws are adequate to control the export of AI and cyber weapons?"

## 3. Advocate for Transparency and Reform

- **Support Watchdog Groups**: Support and amplify the work of non-partisan organizations that track arms sales and advocate for greater transparency and human rights considerations.
- **Demand Transparency**: Advocate for legislation that would increase the transparency of the Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) process, which currently accounts for the majority of sales value but has the least public oversight.
- **Promote a Modern Framework**: Engage in the debate about the need for a new arms control framework for AI and autonomous systems. This is a new and critical area where public awareness can help drive policy change.
