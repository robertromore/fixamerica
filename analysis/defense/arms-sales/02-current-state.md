# Arms Sales: Current State

## Sales Volume and Key Customers

The United States is the world's dominant arms exporter. Sales are conducted through two primary channels: Foreign Military Sales (FMS), which are government-to-government agreements, and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), which are licensed by the State Department directly between U.S. companies and foreign buyers.

### U.S. Arms Sales Data (FY2023)

| Category | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Foreign Military Sales (FMS)** | $80.9 billion | Government-to-government sales managed by DSCA. |
| **Direct Commercial Sales (DCS)** | $157.5 billion | Commercial sales authorized by the State Department. |
| **Total Authorized Sales** | **$238.4 billion** | |

### Top Recipients of U.S. Arms (2019-2023)

| Rank | Country | Share of U.S. Exports | Key Purchases |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Saudi Arabia | 15% | F-15 fighter jets, missile defense systems |
| 2 | Qatar | 8.2% | F-15 fighter jets, attack helicopters |
| 3 | Japan | 7.5% | F-35 fighter jets, Aegis missile defense |
| 4 | Kuwait | 6.9% | F/A-18 fighter jets, M1A2 tanks |
| 5 | Australia | 6.6% | F-35 fighter jets, P-8 maritime patrol aircraft |

## The Regulatory Process

U.S. arms sales are governed by a complex legal and regulatory framework designed to balance national security, foreign policy, and economic interests.

### Key Laws and Regulations

| Law/Regulation | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Arms Export Control Act (AECA)** | The foundational law authorizing the President to control the import and export of defense articles and services. |
| **International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)** | The detailed regulations, administered by the State Department, that implement the AECA. It includes the U.S. Munitions List (USML), which specifies what items are controlled. |
| **Foreign Assistance Act** | Authorizes security assistance programs and contains key human rights provisions, such as the Leahy Law. |

### The Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Process

1. **Letter of Request (LOR)**: A partner nation submits a formal request to the U.S. government for a specific item or capability.
2. **Case Development**: The relevant U.S. military department and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) develop a case, including pricing, availability, and training.
3. **State Department Review**: The Department of State reviews the proposed sale for foreign policy implications.
4. **Congressional Notification**: For major sales (typically >$25 million for NATO+ allies, >$14 million for others), the State Department must formally notify Congress. Congress has 30 days (15 for NATO+) to pass a joint resolution of disapproval to block the sale.
5. **Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA)**: If Congress does not block the sale, the U.S. government sends a formal LOA to the partner nation.
6. **Implementation**: Once the partner signs the LOA and provides payment, the DoD procures the item from U.S. industry and manages delivery and support.

This process is notoriously slow, often taking 2-5 years from initial request to final delivery.

## End-Use Monitoring (EUM)

The U.S. government has programs to ensure that U.S.-origin defense articles are used only for their intended purposes and are not transferred to third parties without authorization.

- **Golden Sentry Program**: Run by DSCA, this program conducts routine inventories and inspections of sensitive U.S. equipment in foreign countries.
- **Blue Lantern Program**: Run by the State Department, this program conducts pre-license and post-shipment checks on Direct Commercial Sales to verify the bona fides of the parties and confirm receipt of the items.

**Challenge**: EUM is effective for physical hardware like a tank or missile. It is extremely difficult to monitor the use of software, AI algorithms, or cyber capabilities once they have been transferred. There is currently no effective technical or policy framework for "Digital End-Use Monitoring."

## Emerging Technology Sales

The sale of AI-enabled systems, autonomous drones, and cyber tools is a growing but poorly tracked part of U.S. arms transfers.

### Key Categories

- **AI-Enabled ISR**: Systems that use AI to automatically detect and identify targets from drone or satellite footage (e.g., Project Maven derivatives).
- **Autonomous Systems**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned maritime vessels with high degrees of autonomy. The U.S. is currently more restrictive than competitors in selling armed drones.
- **Cyber Defense Tools**: Software and hardware for network defense, intrusion detection, and cyber forensics.

### The Regulatory Gap

- **ITAR's Limitations**: ITAR was designed to control hardware. It is unclear how it applies to a line of code or a trained AI model. An algorithm can be transferred electronically in seconds and is difficult to track.
- **Dual-Use Problem**: Many AI and cyber technologies have both commercial and military applications, blurring the line between the Commerce Department's less restrictive export controls and the State Department's more stringent ITAR controls.
- **Intangible Transfers**: The "transfer" can occur simply by training a foreign partner or allowing them to view the source code, making traditional export controls irrelevant.
