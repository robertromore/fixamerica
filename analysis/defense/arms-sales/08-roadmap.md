# Arms Sales: Reform Roadmap

Reforming the U.S. arms sales process requires a phased approach that prioritizes immediate transparency and process improvements while developing the more complex frameworks needed for emerging technologies.

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Reforms and Transparency (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on immediate legislative and administrative actions to improve transparency, speed up the process for trusted allies, and begin tackling the AI challenge.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Pass the "Arms Export Transparency Act"** | Enact legislation that mandates a public database for Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) and requires post-sale impact assessments for high-risk countries. | DCS database is live and publicly accessible. First post-sale impact assessment is published. |
| **2. Implement Tiered FMS Processing** | The State Department and DoD issue new internal guidance to establish a tiered, risk-based FMS process, fast-tracking sales for Tier 1 allies. | Average FMS case processing time for Tier 1 allies is reduced by 30%. |
| **3. Charter AI Export Control Commission** | Congress charters a bipartisan commission of technical, legal, and ethical experts to design a new regulatory framework for AI and cyber exports. | Commission is fully staffed and holds its first public hearing. |
| **4. Strengthen Human Rights Vetting** | The State Department formally grants the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) concurrence authority on high-risk sales. | DRL provides its first formal non-concurrence, forcing a Secretarial waiver and justification to Congress. |

**Goal of Phase 1**: Increase transparency across the system, make the U.S. a more agile partner for its closest allies, and lay the intellectual groundwork for a 21st-century control regime.

## Phase 2: Building the New Digital Framework (Years 3-5)

This phase focuses on implementing the recommendations of the AI commission and building the technical and legal tools for digital arms control.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Enact the "Digital Arms Control Act"** | Based on the commission's report, Congress passes legislation creating a new regulatory framework for military AI and software exports. | Act is passed and signed into law. State Department begins rulemaking process for the new USML category. |
| **2. Launch Technical EUM Pilots** | The DoD, in partnership with industry, launches pilot programs to test technical end-use monitoring (e.g., "heartbeat" functions) on software sold to Tier 1 allies. | At least three pilot programs are operational. |
| **3. Streamline Interagency Review** | The interagency review process for arms sales is digitized and streamlined to reduce bureaucratic delays. | Average time for interagency staffing of a proposed sale is reduced by 25%. |

**Goal of Phase 2**: Move from an industrial-age to a digital-age arms control paradigm by creating and testing the new rules and technologies needed to manage software-defined weapons.

## Phase 3: Full Implementation and International Norm-Setting (Years 6-10)

This phase focuses on fully operationalizing the new framework and working with allies to establish international standards.

| Priority | Action | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Full Operational Capability of Digital Controls** | The new digital arms control regime is fully implemented. All exports of military AI and cyber tools are conducted under the new licensing and monitoring framework. | 90% of relevant digital exports are processed under the new framework. |
| **2. Establish International Norms** | The U.S. initiates a multilateral dialogue with allies (e.g., through the Atlantic-Pacific Council) to create a common set of principles for the export of military AI. | A formal "Code of Conduct for Military AI Exports" is signed by the U.S. and at least 10 allied nations. |
| **3. A Fully Reformed System** | The tiered FMS system is fully institutionalized, and post-sale impact assessments are a routine part of the policy cycle. | The U.S. is recognized as being both the most capable and the most responsible arms exporter. |

**Goal of Phase 3**: The U.S. arms transfer system is agile, transparent, responsible, and fully equipped to handle the challenges of 21st-century warfare.
