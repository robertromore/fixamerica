# Arms Sales: Overview

## Overview

United States arms sales are a primary instrument of foreign policy, a cornerstone of the defense industrial base, and a subject of intense domestic and international debate. As the world's largest arms exporter, the U.S. transfers tens of billions of dollars in military equipment and services annually to allies and partners. These sales are intended to build partner capacity, enhance interoperability with U.S. forces, and strengthen diplomatic relationships. The system is bifurcated into government-to-government Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and licensed Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), both overseen by the State Department and Department of Defense.

This system faces a dual crisis. First, its bureaucratic slowness is a strategic liability, as partners in need of capabilities quickly can turn to rivals like China or Russia. Second, and more profoundly, the rise of software-defined warfare—particularly artificial intelligence (AI), autonomy, and cyber capabilities—threatens to make the entire industrial-age control regime obsolete. Unlike a fighter jet, an AI algorithm can be copied and repurposed, and a cyber weapon can proliferate globally in an instant. This creates unprecedented risks of unintended escalation and loss of technological advantage, demanding a fundamental rethinking of how America controls its most advanced weapons.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key components of U.S. arms sales and security cooperation policy:

- **Regulatory Framework**: The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).
- **Sales Channels**: Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS).
- **Key Actors**: The roles of the State Department, Department of Defense (DSCA), Congress, and the defense industry.
- **Strategic Rationale**: Building partner capacity, alliance interoperability, and foreign policy influence.
- **Economic Impact**: The effect of arms sales on the U.S. defense industrial base and jobs.
- **Emerging Technologies**: The unique challenges of controlling the export of AI, autonomous systems, and cyber capabilities.

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total Annual Arms Sales (FMS + DCS, FY2023) | ~$238 billion | State Dept., 2024 |
| U.S. Share of Global Arms Market (2019-2023) | ~42% | SIPRI, 2024 |
| Top U.S. Customers (by value, 2019-2023) | Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Japan | SIPRI, 2024 |
| Lead Agency for Policy | State Dept., Bureau of Political-Military Affairs | AECA |
| Lead Agency for FMS Implementation | DoD, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) | DoD Directive 5105.65 |
| Governing Law | Arms Export Control Act (AECA) | U.S. Code |
| Key Regulation | International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) | CFR |
| Jobs Supported by Defense Exports (Estimate) | ~1 million+ | Dept. of Commerce |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Economic Benefits vs. Human Rights**: The economic imperative to export arms and support U.S. jobs often conflicts with foreign policy goals related to promoting human rights and democracy.
- **Strengthening Allies vs. Fueling Arms Races**: Providing arms to one partner can be seen as a threat by its neighbors, potentially sparking regional instability and arms races.
- **Interoperability vs. Technology Proliferation**: Selling advanced systems to allies allows them to fight alongside U.S. forces, but it also increases the risk that sensitive technology could be compromised or transferred to adversaries.
- **Control vs. Speed**: The rigorous, multi-year review process designed to control arms transfers makes the U.S. a slow and frustrating partner compared to rivals who sell systems with fewer restrictions.
- **Hardware vs. Software**: The current control regime is designed to track physical objects (hardware). It is fundamentally unequipped to control software, AI algorithms, and cyber tools that can be replicated and modified after transfer.

## Key Questions

1. How can the U.S. reform its arms sales process to be faster and more responsive without sacrificing oversight?
2. What new legal and technical frameworks are needed to control the export and use of military AI and cyber capabilities?
3. Should human rights considerations be given more weight in arms sales decisions, even if it means ceding market share to rivals?
4. How can the U.S. balance the economic need to export with the strategic risk of proliferating its most advanced technologies?

## Vision of Success

A successful arms sales policy would be:

- **Strategic**: Sales are driven by clear, long-term foreign policy goals, not short-term commercial interests.
- **Agile**: The process is fast and efficient enough to be the preferred choice for U.S. partners.
- **Responsible**: A rigorous and transparent process ensures that sales are consistent with U.S. values and international law, with robust monitoring of how weapons are used.
- **Modern**: A new control regime is in place to manage the unique risks of exporting software, AI, and cyber weapons.
