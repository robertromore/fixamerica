# Arms Sales: Stakeholders

The U.S. arms sales process involves a complex interplay between government agencies, Congress, private industry, and foreign customers, each with its own set of interests and influence.

## U.S. Government Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Role in the Process |
|---|---|---|
| **Department of State (Bureau of Political-Military Affairs)** | **Foreign Policy.** Ensuring sales align with U.S. foreign policy goals, strengthen alliances, and respect human rights. | **Gatekeeper.** Has overall statutory authority for arms transfers. Issues licenses for Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) and provides final approval for Foreign Military Sales (FMS). |
| **Department of Defense (Defense Security Cooperation Agency - DSCA)** | **Military Strategy.** Ensuring sales enhance partner capability, promote interoperability, and meet U.S. security objectives. | **Implementer.** Manages the FMS process from case development to delivery. Assesses military requirements and technology security risks. |
| **Congress (Senate Foreign Relations & House Foreign Affairs Committees)** | **Oversight.** Reviewing major sales to ensure they serve U.S. interests; responding to constituent concerns (both economic and human rights). | **Power to Block.** Can pass a joint resolution of disapproval to block a major sale within a 30-day review period. This power is rarely used but creates significant political leverage. |
| **Department of Commerce (Bureau of Industry and Security)** | **Dual-Use Exports.** Regulating the export of "dual-use" items (commercial items that can also have military applications) through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). | Manages a separate export control system that sometimes overlaps or conflicts with the State Department's ITAR system. |

**Internal Conflicts:**

- **State vs. DoD**: The State Department may prioritize diplomacy or human rights, leading it to oppose a sale that the DoD supports for military reasons.
- **Executive Branch vs. Congress**: Congress may seek to block a sale approved by the President due to concerns about regional stability or the recipient's human rights record.

## Private Sector Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **Prime Defense Contractors** (e.g., Lockheed Martin, RTX, Boeing) | **Revenue and Profit.** Securing large, multi-year foreign sales to sustain production lines and increase shareholder value. | Immense lobbying power in Congress; control of high-skilled jobs in key districts; deep technical expertise. |
| **Subcontractors and Supply Chain** | **Stable Orders.** Receiving subcontracts from the primes that flow from major foreign sales. | Collectively represent a vast number of jobs spread across almost every congressional district. |

## External Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Primary Interest | Source of Power |
|---|---|---|
| **Foreign Governments (Customers)** | Acquiring military capabilities for defense, deterrence, or prestige. | The power to choose which country to buy from (U.S., Russia, China, France, etc.). |
| **U.S. Allies** | Ensuring their own security; maintaining interoperability with U.S. forces. | Their willingness to host U.S. forces and support U.S. foreign policy goals is often linked to their access to U.S. arms. |
| **Human Rights Organizations** (e.g., Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch) | Preventing U.S. weapons from being used to commit human rights abuses. | Moral authority; ability to generate negative media attention and pressure Congress. |
| **Arms Control Advocates** (e.g., Arms Control Association) | Preventing proliferation and regional arms races that could lead to instability and conflict. | Policy expertise; influence in academic and policy debates. |

**Key Conflict Dynamic: The "Iron Triangle" of Exports**

Similar to domestic procurement, arms exports are driven by a powerful triangle of interests:

1. **The Defense Industry** wants to sell products to keep production lines open.
2. **The DoD** wants allies to have interoperable equipment and to lower its own unit costs.
3. **Congress** wants to support jobs in the districts where the weapons are made.

This creates a powerful, built-in "presumption of approval" for most arms sales, which often overrides concerns raised by the State Department's human rights officers or by arms control advocates.
