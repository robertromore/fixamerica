# Arms Sales: History

## Historical Development

U.S. arms sales policy has evolved dramatically since World War II, shifting from a tool for arming allies against the Soviet Union to a complex instrument of global influence, counter-terrorism, and great power competition.

### The Cold War (1949-1991): A Tool of Containment

- **Context**: The primary goal was to contain the Soviet Union by arming and strengthening anti-communist allies.
- **Key Policy**: The **Nixon Doctrine (1969)** explicitly stated that the U.S. would "furnish military and economic assistance" to allies so they could provide for their own defense.
- **Landmark Sales**:
    - **Iran**: Under the Shah, Iran became a pillar of U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf and one of the largest purchasers of advanced U.S. military technology, including F-14 Tomcat fighters. This ended abruptly with the 1979 revolution, which left sensitive U.S. technology in the hands of a hostile regime—a cautionary tale that still shapes policy today.
    - **Saudi Arabia**: The 1981 sale of AWACS surveillance aircraft to Saudi Arabia was highly controversial but cemented a long-term security partnership based on oil and arms.
- **Legacy**: This era established arms sales as a key tool of U.S. foreign policy, but also highlighted the risks of betting on the stability of authoritarian partners.

### The Post-Cold War (1991-2001): Interoperability and Market Share

- **Context**: With the Soviet threat gone, the rationale for arms sales shifted.
- **New Goals**:
    - **Interoperability**: The focus turned to ensuring that NATO allies and other partners used compatible equipment, as demonstrated in the First Gulf War. This drove sales of U.S. systems like the F-16.
    - **Economic Competitiveness**: With domestic defense budgets shrinking, U.S. companies aggressively pursued foreign sales to keep production lines open and maintain market share against growing European competition.
- **Human Rights Concerns**: This era saw increased debate over the human rights implications of arms sales, leading to the codification of the **Leahy Laws**, which prohibit assistance to foreign military units that have committed gross violations of human rights.

### The Post-9/11 Era (2001-2017): The War on Terror

- **Context**: The strategic focus shifted to counter-terrorism (CT).
- **New Goals**: Arms sales were reoriented to equip partner nations to fight terrorist groups. This often involved providing less advanced, "CT-appropriate" equipment like light attack aircraft, helicopters, and surveillance drones.
- **The Rise of Drones**: The U.S. became the world leader in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), but was highly restrictive in exporting armed drones due to concerns about proliferation and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). This created a market opening that competitors, particularly China, eagerly filled.
- **"Train and Equip"**: The U.S. launched massive "train and equip" programs in Iraq and Afghanistan, transferring huge quantities of small arms, vehicles, and other equipment to nascent security forces, with mixed results and significant problems with diversion and misuse.

### The Great Power Competition Era (2018-Present)

- **Context**: The 2018 National Defense Strategy pivoted U.S. focus to competition with China and Russia.
- **New Goals**:
    - **Deterring Adversaries**: Arms sales are now seen as a primary tool for "integrated deterrence." The goal is to arm allies on the front lines—like Taiwan, Japan, Poland, and the Baltic states—with advanced, asymmetric capabilities (e.g., anti-ship missiles, air defense) to raise the cost of aggression.
    - **Strategic Technology Transfer**: The focus has shifted to sharing not just hardware, but high-end technology. The **AUKUS** agreement, which involves sharing nuclear submarine technology with Australia, is the prime example of this new approach.
- **The AI and Cyber Challenge**: This era has introduced the unprecedented challenge of controlling the export of non-physical weapons.
    - **2018 Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy**: The Trump administration's policy prioritized economic benefits and reduced barriers to exports, including for drones.
    - **2023 CAT Policy Revision**: The Biden administration issued a revised policy that placed a greater emphasis on human rights, but still seeks to streamline the process for strategic partners. It has not yet created a comprehensive framework for controlling AI and cyber exports.
