# Defense Policy

This directory contains a comprehensive analysis of United States defense policy, encompassing military readiness, national security strategy, defense spending, personnel, technology, and international alliances.

## Overview

The United States military is the world's most powerful, but it faces a complex and rapidly evolving global security environment. Key challenges include strategic competition with near-peer adversaries like China and Russia, persistent threats from rogue states and terrorist organizations, and emerging domains of conflict in space and cyberspace.

This analysis examines the core tensions in U.S. defense policy: balancing modernization against current readiness, managing a massive budget amid domestic fiscal pressures, and maintaining a global presence while adapting to new strategic realities. It provides a data-driven look at the current state of the armed forces and proposes solutions to ensure the U.S. can deter aggression and protect its national interests in the 21st century.
