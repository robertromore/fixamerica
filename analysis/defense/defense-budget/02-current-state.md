# Defense Budget: Current State

## Budget Topline

The Department of Defense requested $849.8 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2025, representing a nominal increase of approximately 1% over the FY2024 enacted level. When adjusted for inflation, this represents effectively flat or slightly negative real growth. The total national defense budget function (Function 050), which includes the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration and other defense-related activities, exceeded $895 billion.

### Defense Spending in Context

| Metric | FY2023 Enacted | FY2024 Enacted | FY2025 Request |
|---|---|---|---|
| DoD Discretionary Budget Authority | $816.7B | $841.4B | $849.8B |
| Total National Defense (050) | $858B | $886B | $895B |
| Defense as % of GDP | 3.2% | 3.1% | ~3.1% |
| Defense as % of Federal Discretionary | 49% | 49% | ~49% |
| Nominal Growth (Year-over-Year) | +10% | +3% | +1% |
| Real Growth (Inflation-Adjusted) | ~+5% | ~0% | ~-1% |

## Budget Composition by Appropriation Title

The DoD budget is divided into five major appropriation titles, each with different obligation periods and rules.

### FY2025 Budget Request by Appropriation Title

| Appropriation Title | Amount | % of Total | Obligation Period |
|---|---|---|---|
| Operations and Maintenance (O&M) | $339.8B | 40.0% | 1 year |
| Military Personnel (MILPERS) | $182.8B | 21.5% | 1 year |
| Procurement | $167.5B | 19.7% | 3 years |
| Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) | $143.2B | 16.9% | 2 years |
| Military Construction (MILCON) | $14.2B | 1.7% | 5 years |
| Family Housing | $2.3B | 0.3% | 5 years |
| **Total** | **$849.8B** | **100%** | |

*Source: DoD Comptroller, FY2025 Defense Budget Overview.*

### Key Budget Composition Trends

- **O&M dominance**: Operations and Maintenance has grown from approximately 30% of the budget in the 1980s to 40% today, driven by rising health care costs (TRICARE/DHP), base operating costs, and the expense of maintaining an aging equipment fleet
- **Personnel cost growth**: All-in military personnel costs (MILPERS plus the defense health program and military retirement within O&M) consume over 50% of the total budget when fully loaded, up from approximately 25% in the 1970s
- **Procurement compression**: Despite the need for extensive modernization, procurement's share has declined from its Reagan-era peak of ~30% to below 20%
- **RDT&E growth**: Research and development spending has reached historic highs in absolute terms, reflecting investment in next-generation technologies (hypersonics, AI, directed energy, space)

## Budget by Military Service

### FY2025 Request by Component

| Component | Amount | % of Total |
|---|---|---|
| Department of the Air Force (incl. Space Force) | $217.5B | 25.6% |
| Department of the Navy (incl. Marine Corps) | $255.8B | 30.1% |
| Department of the Army | $185.4B | 21.8% |
| Defense-Wide (OSD, Agencies, Combatant Commands) | $141.6B | 16.7% |
| Defense Health Program | $37.7B | 4.4% |
| Other (Special Operations, etc.) | $11.8B | 1.4% |
| **Total** | **$849.8B** | **100%** |

### Service Budget Trends

The Navy/Marine Corps budget has grown as a share of the total in recent years, reflecting the strategic shift toward the Indo-Pacific and the high cost of shipbuilding and submarine programs. The Army's share has declined with the end of large-scale ground operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Air Force has seen growth driven by the B-21 bomber, the Sentinel ICBM replacement, and the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter. The Space Force, while still small in absolute terms (~$30 billion), is the fastest-growing component.

## The Appropriations Process

### The PPBE System

The Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) system is the internal DoD process for translating strategy into a budget request. Established in the 1960s under Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, PPBE operates on an approximately two-year cycle:

1. **Planning Phase**: The Secretary of Defense issues strategic guidance (Defense Planning Guidance)
2. **Programming Phase**: Military departments develop their Program Objective Memoranda (POMs), proposing resource allocation over a five-year Future Years Defense Program (FYDP)
3. **Budgeting Phase**: The Comptroller refines the POMs into a formal budget request submitted to OMB and Congress
4. **Execution Phase**: Enacted funds are obligated and expended

The PPBE Commission, established by Section 1004 of the FY2022 NDAA, concluded in its March 2024 final report that the PPBE process is "not designed for -- and is incapable of meeting -- the needs of a department that must move at speed and scale."

### Congressional Budget Cycle

| Step | Typical Timeline | Key Actors |
|---|---|---|
| President's Budget Request submitted | February | OMB, DoD Comptroller |
| HASC/SASC hearings and markups | March-June | Armed Services Committees |
| NDAA passage (authorization) | June-December | Full House and Senate |
| HAC-D/SAC-D hearings and markups | April-July | Appropriations Subcommittees |
| Defense Appropriations Act (funding) | October (target) | Full House and Senate |
| Fiscal Year begins | October 1 | |

**Authorization vs. Appropriation**: The NDAA authorizes programs and sets policy but does not provide funding. The Defense Appropriations Act provides actual budget authority. Both must pass for the system to work as designed.

### The Continuing Resolution Problem

Congress has failed to enact on-time defense appropriations in the majority of recent fiscal years. When full-year appropriations are not enacted by October 1, the government operates under Continuing Resolutions (CRs) that generally fund agencies at the prior-year level.

**Impact of Continuing Resolutions on DoD**:

- **No new starts**: CRs typically prohibit new programs or production increases, freezing the force at the prior year's posture
- **Inefficient spending**: Funds flow at the prior-year rate regardless of current needs, preventing reallocation
- **Training and maintenance delays**: Units cannot plan multi-month training exercises or maintenance schedules without knowing their full-year budget
- **Industrial base disruption**: Contractors cannot hire, invest, or plan production without stable funding
- **Estimated annual cost**: GAO and CBO have estimated that CRs cost the DoD billions in lost efficiency annually, though precise figures are difficult to isolate

| Fiscal Year | Months Under CR | On-Time Appropriation? |
|---|---|---|
| FY2020 | 4 months | No |
| FY2021 | 3 months | No |
| FY2022 | 6 months | No |
| FY2023 | 6 months | No |
| FY2024 | 5 months | No |
| FY2025 | Ongoing as of Feb 2026 | No |

## Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)

For nearly two decades, the Overseas Contingency Operations account served as a supplemental funding stream for war costs that was exempt from the Budget Control Act spending caps.

- **Peak OCO spending**: FY2008, approximately $187 billion (Iraq and Afghanistan surge)
- **OCO as slush fund**: Beginning around FY2015, increasing amounts of base budget activities were shifted into OCO to circumvent BCA caps. By FY2020, an estimated $30-50 billion of the OCO account funded enduring activities rather than contingency operations
- **OCO elimination**: The FY2022 budget request formally ended the OCO distinction, folding all war costs into the base budget. This improved budget transparency but eliminated a mechanism for supplemental funding

## Financial Accountability and Audit Failures

### The Audit Requirement

The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-576) required all major federal agencies to produce auditable financial statements. The DoD has never achieved a clean (unmodified) audit opinion in more than 30 years of trying.

### Audit History

| Year | Audit Result | Key Findings |
|---|---|---|
| FY2018 | First full audit attempted | Disclaimer of opinion across all components |
| FY2019 | Disclaimer | 25 material weaknesses identified |
| FY2020 | Disclaimer | Minor progress in some areas |
| FY2021 | Disclaimer | DFAS received modified opinion (first component) |
| FY2022 | Disclaimer | 7 of 28 entities received modified/clean opinions |
| FY2023 | Disclaimer | 8 of 28 entities passed; $3.8 trillion in unsupported adjustments |
| FY2024 | Disclaimer | Marginal improvement; system interoperability still major barrier |

### Why the DoD Cannot Pass an Audit

- **Legacy IT systems**: The DoD operates approximately 2,400 financial and business information systems, many dating to the 1970s and 1980s, that cannot share data or be reconciled
- **Journal voucher adjustments**: The DoD routinely makes trillions of dollars in accounting adjustments (journal vouchers) to force its books to balance, many of which cannot be traced to supporting documentation
- **Property accountability**: The DoD cannot reliably account for its physical assets. As of FY2023, the department reported over $3.8 trillion in assets but could not verify ownership, location, or condition for a significant portion
- **Culture**: Financial management has historically been a low-prestige career field within DoD, and there is little institutional incentive to prioritize auditability over operational activity
- **Scale**: The DoD manages more than $3.8 trillion in assets, employs 3.4 million people (military and civilian), and processes millions of transactions daily across global operations

### Cost of Unauditability

While the precise dollar cost of the DoD's financial management failures is unknowable (that is the point -- the money cannot be tracked), indicators of waste include:

- **$35 billion** in improper payments identified by DoD OIG over the past decade
- **Duplicate payments**: GAO has identified systemic duplicate payment issues in DoD contract management
- **Ghost assets and liabilities**: Equipment listed on books that no longer exists; obligations for services never rendered
- **Inability to close old accounts**: Billions of dollars in expired appropriation accounts that cannot be properly closed due to inadequate records

## Budget Priorities and Strategic Alignment

### Modernization Programs (Selected Major Programs)

| Program | Service | FY2025 Request | Program Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Columbia-class SSBN (submarine) | Navy | $9.6B | In production; first boat late |
| B-21 Raider (bomber) | Air Force | $5.3B | In testing |
| Sentinel (GBSD ICBM replacement) | Air Force | $3.7B | Cost growth; Nunn-McCurdy breach |
| DDG(X) (next-gen destroyer) | Navy | $2.1B | Design phase |
| Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) | Air Force | Classified | Under review/restructured |
| Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW) | Army | $1.1B | Testing delays |
| MQ-25 Stingray (carrier drone) | Navy | $1.3B | In development |
| Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) | Air Force | $1.8B | Early development |

### Nuclear Modernization

The simultaneous recapitalization of all three legs of the nuclear triad (Sentinel ICBM, Columbia-class SSBN, B-21 bomber, plus the Long-Range Standoff Weapon) is expected to cost over $1.5 trillion through the 2040s. This modernization "bow wave" will place intense pressure on the procurement and RDT&E accounts throughout the late 2020s and 2030s, potentially crowding out conventional modernization.

### Readiness Indicators

- **Aircraft mission-capable rates**: Average across the fleet remains below the 80% goal; the F-35 fleet averaged approximately 55% mission-capable in FY2023
- **Ship maintenance backlogs**: Navy public shipyards have a maintenance backlog exceeding $2 billion; submarine maintenance delays average 6-12 months
- **Munitions**: The war in Ukraine has highlighted the inadequacy of U.S. munitions production capacity, with 155mm artillery shell production increasing from 14,000/month to a target of 100,000/month by 2028
- **Training**: Army and Marine Corps units report training at less than full readiness levels due to equipment shortages and personnel turbulence

## The End of Sequestration and Current Fiscal Environment

The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed spending caps on both defense and non-defense discretionary spending through FY2021. When the "supercommittee" failed to reach a deficit reduction deal, automatic across-the-board spending reductions (sequestration) took effect in March 2013. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and subsequent budget deals partially restored some defense funding, but defense spending was constrained by approximately $1 trillion below pre-BCA projections over the decade.

The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 set new spending caps for FY2024-FY2025, limiting defense growth to approximately 1% nominally. With those caps expiring after FY2025, the defense budget faces an uncertain fiscal trajectory, with competing pressures from:

- **Rising mandatory spending**: Social Security, Medicare, and interest on the national debt are consuming an ever-larger share of the federal budget, squeezing discretionary accounts
- **National debt**: At over $35 trillion, the national debt and associated interest costs (projected to exceed $1 trillion annually) limit fiscal space for defense increases
- **Bipartisan Commission on Entitlements**: Potential entitlement reform could free discretionary space or could redirect savings to deficit reduction rather than defense
- **China pacing threat**: The bipartisan consensus that China represents the primary strategic challenge creates political pressure to maintain or increase defense spending
