# Defense Budget: Legislation

## Overview

The defense budget is governed by a complex web of statutes rooted in Article I of the Constitution, primarily Title 10 and Title 31 of the U.S. Code, the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and the annual defense appropriations bills. The current budget process -- the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) system established in 1961 -- has been criticized by virtually every independent review as obsolete, rigid, and incapable of supporting the agility required by modern strategic competition. The Department of Defense has never passed a comprehensive financial audit despite a statutory requirement since 1990, and Congress routinely funds the military through continuing resolutions rather than on-time appropriations.

This legislative framework proposes two complementary bills. The first, the Defense Budget Accountability Act, addresses the DoD's persistent financial management failures by establishing binding audit deadlines with automatic budgetary penalties, modernizing financial systems, and creating transparency mechanisms. The second, the Defense Appropriations Reform Act, addresses the structural dysfunction of the appropriations process itself by introducing biennial budgeting for defense, ending the continuing resolution cycle through automatic funding mechanisms, eliminating the OCO slush fund permanently, and piloting portfolio-based budgeting. Together, these bills represent the most comprehensive reform of defense budgeting since McNamara's introduction of PPBS in the 1960s.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for defense budget reform.* Congress possesses clear and well-established authority to structure the defense budgeting process under its existing constitutional powers:

- **Article I, Section 8**: Grants Congress the power to "raise and support Armies," "provide and maintain a Navy," and "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." The two-year Army appropriation limit is preserved by biennial budgeting.
- **Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 (Appropriations Clause)**: "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." All reforms proposed here operate through the appropriations mechanism and preserve Congress's exclusive spending authority.
- **Necessary and Proper Clause**: Provides Congress broad power to structure the administrative processes by which defense funds are allocated, audited, and reported.

The reforms proposed in this framework operate entirely within Congress's existing constitutional authority. Audit requirements, budget format changes, automatic continuing resolution provisions, and transfer authorities are all matters of statutory design that Congress can enact and modify without amending the Constitution. The primary constitutional tension -- the balance between legislative spending power and executive operational flexibility -- is addressed through carefully calibrated notification requirements, transfer caps, and sunset provisions.

## Federal Legislation

### The Defense Budget Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To enforce financial accountability at the Department of Defense by establishing binding audit deadlines with automatic budgetary penalties, funding comprehensive financial system modernization, and creating transparency mechanisms for defense spending.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Audit Enforcement**: Mandates that each military department and defense agency achieve a clean (unmodified) audit opinion by FY2029, with automatic escalating budget withholds for failure
2. **Financial Systems Modernization Fund**: Establishes a dedicated fund to replace the DoD's 2,400+ legacy financial systems with interoperable enterprise platforms
3. **Audit Remediation Investment**: Authorizes dedicated appropriations for audit remediation to ensure that enforcement is paired with the resources needed to succeed
4. **Senior Leader Accountability**: Requires Service Secretaries and agency directors to certify audit progress annually and ties SES performance ratings to audit metrics
5. **Transparency Dashboard**: Mandates a public-facing DoD financial transparency dashboard displaying audit status, accounting adjustments, and improper payments by component
6. **Carryover Authority**: Allows DoD components to carry over up to 5% of unobligated O&M funds to the next fiscal year to eliminate "use it or lose it" spending incentives

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To enforce financial accountability at the Department of Defense,
establish audit deadlines with automatic penalties, and modernize
defense financial management systems.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Defense Budget Accountability Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Department of Defense (DoD) has failed to achieve a
    clean financial audit opinion since the requirement was
    established by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990
    (Pub. L. 101-576), making it the only major Federal agency
    unable to pass a comprehensive financial audit.
(2) In fiscal year 2023, the DoD reported over $3.8 trillion
    in accounting adjustments that could not be adequately
    documented (DoD OIG Report No. DODIG-2024-065).
(3) Only 8 of 28 DoD reporting entities received clean or
    modified audit opinions in fiscal year 2023.
(4) The Government Accountability Office has identified the
    DoD's approximately 2,400 financial and business information
    systems, many dating to the 1970s and 1980s, as the single
    largest barrier to achieving auditability (GAO-23-105536).
(5) The absence of meaningful penalties for audit failure has
    permitted three decades of noncompliance with statutory
    audit requirements.
(6) Wasteful end-of-year spending driven by "use it or lose
    it" budget rules accounts for billions of dollars in
    low-priority obligations, with fourth-quarter spending
    exceeding the quarterly average by approximately 35 percent
    (GAO-13-531).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) CLEAN AUDIT.--The term "clean audit" means an unmodified
    audit opinion from an independent public accountant
    conducted in accordance with generally accepted government
    auditing standards.
(2) COMPONENT.--The term "component" means each military
    department, defense agency, and other DoD reporting entity
    required to submit financial statements under section 3515
    of title 31, United States Code.
(3) MATERIAL WEAKNESS.--The term "material weakness" has the
    meaning given in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 145,
    as issued by the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants.

SEC. 4. AUDIT ENFORCEMENT.

(a) DEADLINE.--Each component shall achieve a clean audit
    opinion not later than the end of fiscal year 2029.
(b) INTERIM MILESTONES.--
    (1) Not later than the end of fiscal year 2027, each
        component shall reduce the number of material
        weaknesses identified in its most recent audit by not
        less than 50 percent.
    (2) Not later than the end of fiscal year 2028, each
        component shall achieve at least a qualified audit
        opinion.
(c) PENALTY FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.--
    (1) If a component fails to meet the deadline under
        subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall withhold
        1 percent of that component's Operation and Maintenance
        appropriation for the subsequent fiscal year.
    (2) The withholding percentage shall increase by 0.5
        percent for each subsequent year of noncompliance, up
        to a maximum of 5 percent.
    (3) Withheld funds shall be deposited in the Financial
        Systems Modernization Fund established under section 5
        and shall remain available to the noncompliant
        component exclusively for audit remediation activities.
(d) GOOD FAITH CREDIT.--The Secretary may reduce the
    withholding by 50 percent for any component that
    demonstrates measurable progress toward auditability, as
    certified by the DoD Inspector General, including reduction
    in material weaknesses, elimination of unsupported journal
    voucher adjustments, or achievement of clean opinions on
    individual financial statement line items.
(e) INTERIM MILESTONE PENALTIES.--If a component fails to meet
    an interim milestone under subsection (b), the Secretary
    shall direct the component to submit a corrective action
    plan to the congressional defense committees within 90 days,
    and the DoD Inspector General shall provide an independent
    assessment of the plan's adequacy.

SEC. 5. FINANCIAL SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established in the Treasury the
    "DoD Financial Systems Modernization Fund" (in this section
    referred to as the "Fund").
(b) PURPOSE.--The Fund shall be used exclusively for--
    (1) replacement or modernization of legacy financial and
        business information systems;
    (2) adoption of common data standards and enterprise
        resource planning platforms;
    (3) training and certification of financial management
        personnel; and
    (4) independent testing and validation of new financial
        systems.
(c) FUND ADMINISTRATION.--The Fund shall be administered by the
    DoD Chief Information Officer, in coordination with the
    DoD Comptroller.
(d) CONSOLIDATION MANDATE.--The Secretary of Defense shall
    reduce the number of DoD financial and business information
    systems from approximately 2,400 to not more than 500
    within 7 years of enactment, with annual progress reports
    to Congress.

SEC. 6. SENIOR LEADER ACCOUNTABILITY.

(a) CERTIFICATION.--Not later than March 1 of each year, each
    Service Secretary and agency director shall certify to the
    congressional defense committees the status of their
    component's audit remediation efforts, including a
    description of material weaknesses resolved and remaining.
(b) PERFORMANCE METRICS.--Audit progress shall be included as a
    critical element in the annual performance evaluations of
    all Senior Executive Service personnel in financial
    management positions within the DoD.
(c) COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW.--The Comptroller General shall
    review the certifications under subsection (a) and report
    to Congress on their accuracy and completeness.

SEC. 7. TRANSPARENCY DASHBOARD.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--The DoD Comptroller shall establish and
    maintain a publicly accessible online dashboard displaying,
    for each component--
    (1) current audit opinion status;
    (2) number and description of material weaknesses;
    (3) total value of unsupported accounting adjustments;
    (4) improper payment rates; and
    (5) progress against audit remediation milestones.
(b) UPDATE FREQUENCY.--The dashboard shall be updated not less
    frequently than quarterly.

SEC. 8. CARRYOVER AUTHORITY.

(a) AUTHORITY.--Notwithstanding section 1552 of title 31,
    United States Code, amounts appropriated for Operation and
    Maintenance that remain unobligated at the end of a fiscal
    year shall remain available for obligation for one
    additional fiscal year.
(b) LIMITATION.--The amount carried over under subsection (a)
    may not exceed 5 percent of the total O&M appropriation for
    that account.
(c) REPORTING.--The DoD Comptroller shall report to the
    congressional defense committees within 30 days of the end
    of each fiscal year on the total amount of O&M funds
    carried over by each component and the purposes for which
    such funds will be used.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Audit Enforcement)**: Creates the first-ever meaningful consequences for DoD audit failure. The escalating penalty structure (1% to 5%) avoids a catastrophic first-year impact while creating increasing pressure over time. The "good faith credit" provision prevents perverse incentives: components making genuine progress should not be penalized at the same rate as those making no effort. Critically, withheld funds are redirected to audit remediation within the same component, not removed from defense entirely, neutralizing the "hollowing the force" objection.
- **Section 5 (Financial Systems Fund)**: Addresses the root technical barrier to auditability. The DoD's 2,400+ legacy systems cannot be reconciled or audited; no amount of policy reform will produce a clean audit without IT modernization. The consolidation mandate (to 500 systems within 7 years) is aggressive but achievable based on the progress of existing ERP implementations.
- **Section 6 (Senior Leader Accountability)**: Addresses the cultural barrier. Financial management has been a low-prestige career field within DoD because there are no personal consequences for poor financial stewardship. Tying SES performance ratings to audit metrics changes this calculus.
- **Section 8 (Carryover Authority)**: Eliminates the "September spending spree" by removing the perverse incentive to spend every dollar before the fiscal year ends. The 5% cap prevents excessive accumulation of unobligated balances while providing meaningful relief from "use it or lose it" pressure.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|---|---|---|
| Act takes effect | October 1, 2026 | -- |
| First annual certifications due | March 1, 2027 | Service Secretaries / Agency Directors |
| Transparency dashboard launched | 180 days after enactment | DoD Comptroller |
| First Financial Systems Fund obligation | FY2027 | DoD CIO |
| Interim milestone: 50% material weakness reduction | End of FY2027 | All components |
| Interim milestone: qualified opinion | End of FY2028 | All components |
| Audit deadline | End of FY2029 | All components |
| First carryover authority reporting | 30 days after FY2027 ends | DoD Comptroller |
| Financial system consolidation target | FY2033 | DoD CIO |

**Challenges**:

- **Technical feasibility**: Some experts argue that a clean audit at DoD's scale may require longer than the FY2029 deadline allows, particularly for property accountability. The interim milestones and good-faith credit provisions address this by rewarding progress, but the deadline may need adjustment
- **IT modernization risk**: Large-scale IT system modernization within DoD has a poor track record (e.g., DIMHRS, EBS). The Financial Systems Modernization Fund must be managed with strong governance and commercial best practices
- **Congressional resistance to carryover**: Appropriators may oppose carryover authority because it reduces their annual influence over spending; framing it as anti-waste is essential

**Refinements**:

- Consider phasing the audit requirement by account type: financial statement line items that are more tractable (e.g., military pay, civilian pay) should face earlier deadlines than the most difficult areas (property and equipment)
- Include a provision requiring the DoD OIG to contract with a single independent audit firm for the enterprise-wide opinion to ensure consistency, rather than the current fragmented approach
- Add whistleblower protections for DoD financial management personnel who report accounting irregularities or pressure to manipulate audit results

### The Defense Appropriations Reform Act

**Purpose**: To modernize the defense appropriations process by introducing biennial budgeting, establishing automatic continuing funding to prevent government shutdowns, permanently eliminating the OCO budget mechanism, and piloting portfolio-based budgeting to increase resource allocation agility.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Biennial Defense Budgeting**: Shifts the defense budget to a two-year authorization and appropriation cycle, with the second year devoted to oversight and midcourse adjustments
2. **Automatic Continuing Funding**: Establishes automatic funding at 99% of the prior-year level if full-year appropriations are not enacted by October 1
3. **OCO Codification**: Permanently prohibits the establishment of any budget category for defense spending that is exempt from statutory spending limits
4. **Portfolio Budgeting Pilots**: Authorizes the Secretary of Defense to pilot portfolio-based budgeting for up to five mission areas
5. **Transfer Authority Enhancement**: Increases intra-portfolio transfer authority to 20% with quarterly congressional notification

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To reform the defense appropriations process, establish biennial
budgeting for defense, provide automatic continuing funding, and
pilot portfolio-based budgeting.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Defense Appropriations Reform Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Congress has failed to enact on-time defense appropriations
    in the majority of recent fiscal years, requiring the
    Department of Defense to operate under continuing
    resolutions that prohibit new program starts, freeze
    spending at prior-year levels, and impose estimated costs
    of $5-10 billion per year in lost efficiency.
(2) The Commission on Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and
    Execution Reform concluded in March 2024 that the PPBE
    process is "not designed for--and is incapable of meeting--
    the needs of a department that must move at speed and
    scale."
(3) The one-year budget cycle is mismatched with the multi-year
    and multi-decade timelines of major defense programs,
    creating instability for both the Department and the
    defense industrial base.
(4) The Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget mechanism
    was used between FY2012 and FY2021 to circumvent Budget
    Control Act spending caps by funding $30-50 billion per
    year in base budget activities through the uncapped OCO
    account.
(5) Approximately 20 States use biennial budgeting, and the
    Congressional Budget Office has found that biennial
    budgeting could reduce budget preparation costs by 20-30
    percent while improving planning stability.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) BIENNIAL PERIOD.--The term "biennial period" means the
    two-fiscal-year period beginning on October 1 of each
    odd-numbered year.
(2) PORTFOLIO.--The term "portfolio" means a grouping of
    defense programs, projects, and activities organized by
    mission area or capability set rather than by individual
    program line item.
(3) AUTOMATIC CONTINUING FUNDING.--The term "automatic
    continuing funding" means the authority for a Federal
    agency to incur obligations at a specified rate in the
    absence of enacted full-year appropriations.

SEC. 4. BIENNIAL DEFENSE BUDGETING.

(a) BIENNIAL BUDGET SUBMISSION.--Beginning with the budget for
    the biennial period starting October 1, 2029, the President
    shall submit a defense budget request covering the full
    biennial period.
(b) BIENNIAL AUTHORIZATION.--The Committee on Armed Services of
    the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House
    of Representatives shall consider and report a biennial
    National Defense Authorization Act covering the biennial
    period.
(c) BIENNIAL APPROPRIATION.--The Subcommittee on Defense of the
    Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the
    Subcommittee on Defense of the Committee on Appropriations
    of the House of Representatives shall consider and report a
    biennial defense appropriations bill covering the biennial
    period.
(d) SECOND-YEAR OVERSIGHT.--During the second fiscal year of
    each biennial period, the committees described in
    subsections (b) and (c) shall conduct intensive oversight
    hearings and may enact supplemental adjustments as needed.
(e) MILITARY END STRENGTH.--Notwithstanding subsection (b),
    authorization of military end strength levels shall be
    enacted annually, consistent with Article I, Section 8 of
    the Constitution.
(f) TRANSITION.--For the biennial period beginning October 1,
    2029, the DoD Comptroller shall submit a transition plan
    to Congress not later than January 1, 2028, detailing how
    the internal PPBE process will be aligned with the biennial
    cycle.

SEC. 5. AUTOMATIC CONTINUING FUNDING.

(a) AUTHORITY.--If an Act making appropriations for the
    Department of Defense for any fiscal year (or biennial
    period after the effective date of section 4) has not been
    enacted before the first day of such fiscal year, the
    Department of Defense is hereby authorized to incur
    obligations for projects and activities at a rate not
    exceeding 99 percent of the rate provided in the most
    recently enacted defense appropriations Act.
(b) NEW STARTS.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), programs and
    activities authorized in the most recently enacted National
    Defense Authorization Act that were not funded in the prior
    fiscal year may be initiated at a rate not exceeding 75
    percent of the authorized level.
(c) DURATION.--The authority under this section shall apply for
    not more than 120 days. If full-year appropriations have
    not been enacted after 120 days, the rate shall be reduced
    to 95 percent.
(d) TERMINATION.--The authority under this section terminates
    upon the enactment of full-year appropriations for the
    Department of Defense.
(e) POLICY NEUTRALITY.--Automatic continuing funding under this
    section shall not include any policy rider, limitation, or
    condition not contained in the most recently enacted
    defense appropriations Act.

SEC. 6. PERMANENT OCO PROHIBITION.

(a) PROHIBITION.--No officer or employee of the executive
    branch may propose, and no Act of Congress may establish,
    a budget category, account, or fund for Department of
    Defense spending that is--
    (1) designated as "Overseas Contingency Operations,"
        "Global War on Terror," or any successor designation;
        and
    (2) exempt from any statutory limit on discretionary
        spending.
(b) SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS.--Nothing in this section
    shall be construed to prohibit supplemental appropriations
    for unforeseen military contingencies, provided that such
    appropriations are--
    (1) subject to any applicable statutory spending limits;
    (2) certified by the Director of the Office of Management
        and Budget as funding activities that were not
        reasonably foreseeable at the time of the most recent
        budget submission; and
    (3) accompanied by an identification of offsetting
        reductions or a statement explaining why offsets are
        not feasible.

SEC. 7. PORTFOLIO BUDGETING PILOT.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.--The Secretary of Defense is authorized to
    organize the budget request for up to 5 mission-area
    portfolios (e.g., "Indo-Pacific Deterrence," "Nuclear
    Enterprise," "Cyber and Space Defense") in the format of
    portfolio budgets rather than individual program line items,
    beginning with the FY2028 budget request.
(b) TRANSFER AUTHORITY.--For programs within a designated
    portfolio, the Secretary may transfer up to 20 percent of
    funds between projects within the portfolio without prior
    congressional approval, subject to the following conditions:

        advance notification to the Committees on Armed
        Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
    (3) Either armed services committee may object to a
        transfer during the notification period, in which case
        the Secretary shall not execute the transfer unless
        the Secretary certifies in writing that the transfer
        is necessary for urgent national security reasons.
(c) PILOT EVALUATION.--The Comptroller General shall conduct an
    assessment of each portfolio pilot not later than 3 years
    after initiation, evaluating--
    (1) whether portfolio budgeting improved resource allocation
        agility;
    (2) whether transparency and oversight were maintained;
    (3) the frequency and justification of intra-portfolio
        transfers; and
    (4) recommendations for expansion, modification, or
        termination of the pilot.
(d) SUNSET.--Portfolio budgeting authority under this section
    shall terminate 5 years after the date of enactment unless
    reauthorized by Congress.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the
transition to biennial budgeting and portfolio budgeting--
    (1) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2028; and
    (3) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2029.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

(a) Sections 5 and 6 shall take effect on October 1, 2026.

    period beginning October 1, 2029.
(c) Section 7 shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Biennial Budgeting)**: Aligns the congressional budget cycle with the DoD's internal programming rhythm, which already operates on a two-year cycle. The annual end-strength authorization preserves the constitutional requirement under Article I, Section 8. The second-year oversight provision ensures that biennial budgeting enhances, rather than reduces, congressional oversight by dedicating the off-year to hearings and performance reviews.
- **Section 5 (Automatic Continuing Funding)**: Eliminates the most damaging consequence of appropriations dysfunction -- the new-start freeze and spending uncertainty of CRs -- while preserving Congress's incentive to pass full-year appropriations (the 1% reduction from prior-year levels). The new-start provision at 75% of authorized levels is a critical innovation that prevents CRs from blocking modernization. The 120-day limit and further reduction to 95% creates increasing pressure to complete the appropriations process.
- **Section 6 (OCO Prohibition)**: Codifies the FY2022 elimination of OCO to prevent future circumvention of budget caps through creative accounting. The supplemental appropriations exception preserves the ability to respond to genuine contingencies while requiring OMB certification that the spending was not foreseeable.
- **Section 7 (Portfolio Budgeting Pilot)**: Implements the PPBE Commission's core recommendation on a pilot basis, with robust safeguards. The 20% transfer authority provides meaningful flexibility while the congressional notification and objection mechanism preserves oversight. The GAO evaluation and 5-year sunset ensure that portfolio budgeting must demonstrate results to continue.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|---|---|---|
| Automatic CR provision takes effect | October 1, 2026 | Automatic |
| OCO prohibition takes effect | October 1, 2026 | Automatic |
| Portfolio pilot designations announced | 180 days after enactment | Secretary of Defense |
| First portfolio budget request submitted | FY2028 budget (Feb 2027) | DoD Comptroller |
| Biennial budgeting transition plan due | January 1, 2028 | DoD Comptroller |
| First biennial budget submitted | Feb 2029 (for FY2030-31) | President / OMB |
| First portfolio pilot GAO assessment | 3 years after pilot initiation | GAO |
| Portfolio authority sunset (unless reauthorized) | 5 years after enactment | Congress |

**Challenges**:

- **Biennial budgeting opposition**: Appropriations committees have opposed biennial budgeting for decades because it halves the frequency of their most significant legislative action. The second-year oversight provision is designed to mitigate this by giving committees a dedicated oversight year, but the loss of annual spending bills remains politically costly
- **Automatic CR constitutional questions**: Some scholars argue that automatic continuing funding mechanisms could face constitutional challenge as an impermissible delegation of the congressional spending power. However, the mechanism preserves congressional authority to override at any time and has been upheld in analogous contexts (e.g., permanent appropriations for entitlement programs)
- **Portfolio pilot gaming**: Services may use transfer authority within portfolios to redirect money to preferred programs rather than to the highest-priority needs. The quarterly reporting and committee objection mechanism addresses this, but vigilant oversight is required

**Refinements**:

- Consider establishing a Joint Portfolio Review Office within CBO to provide independent analytical capacity for congressional oversight of portfolio-based budgets
- Include a provision requiring the DoD to maintain program-level cost and performance data within portfolios to prevent loss of granularity
- Add an explicit prohibition on using intra-portfolio transfer authority to fund programs that Congress has specifically zeroed or prohibited, consistent with the *Youngstown* Zone 3 analysis

## State Model Legislation

### Model State National Guard Budget Transparency Act

**Purpose**: To improve transparency and accountability in state-funded National Guard operations by aligning state reporting requirements with federal financial management reforms.

**Adaptability Notes**: The National Guard operates under dual federal-state authority (Title 32 and state active duty). While the federal government funds most Guard operations through the DoD budget, states fund state active duty missions, facilities maintenance, and some training. This model legislation addresses the state-funded portion.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] National Guard Budget
Transparency Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.
The Legislature finds that:
(a) The [State] National Guard receives both federal and state
    funding, and the state-funded portion lacks the transparency
    and auditability standards applied to federal defense
    spending.
(b) State taxpayers have a right to know how state funds
    allocated to the National Guard are spent, including for
    state active duty missions, facility maintenance, and
    training.

SECTION 3. ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT.
(a) The Adjutant General shall submit an annual financial report
    to the Governor and the Legislature detailing all state-
    funded National Guard expenditures, organized by mission
    category (state active duty, facilities, training, equipment,
    administration).
(b) The report shall include a comparison of budgeted versus
    actual expenditures and an explanation of any variance
    exceeding 10 percent.

SECTION 4. AUDIT REQUIREMENT.
(a) The State Auditor shall conduct a biennial audit of
    state-funded National Guard accounts.
(b) The audit shall be conducted in accordance with generally
    accepted government auditing standards.
(c) Audit findings shall be reported to the Legislature within
    90 days of completion.

SECTION 5. TRANSPARENCY PORTAL.
The Adjutant General shall maintain a publicly accessible online

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) (OUSD(C)).

**Supporting Agencies**:

- **DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO)**: Manages the Financial Systems Modernization Fund and IT consolidation mandate
- **DoD Inspector General (DoD OIG)**: Conducts and oversees annual financial audits; certifies "good faith" progress for audit penalty reductions
- **Office of Management and Budget (OMB)**: Coordinates biennial budget submission process; certifies supplemental appropriations requests
- **Government Accountability Office (GAO)**: Evaluates portfolio budgeting pilots; assesses biennial budgeting transition; provides independent audit oversight

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Audit Remediation Guidance**: OUSD(C) shall issue guidance specifying minimum standards for audit remediation plans, including required milestones, documentation standards, and progress metrics. Deadline: 180 days after enactment.
2. **Carryover Authority Procedures**: OUSD(C) shall issue procedures governing the carryover of unobligated O&M funds, including reporting requirements and approved uses. Deadline: 180 days after enactment.
3. **Portfolio Budget Category Definitions**: OUSD(C) shall publish definitions of portfolio categories, including the programs and activities included in each portfolio and the procedures for intra-portfolio transfers. Deadline: 270 days after enactment.
4. **Financial System Consolidation Standards**: DoD CIO shall issue standards for enterprise financial system interoperability, data migration, and legacy system sunset criteria. Deadline: 1 year after enactment.
5. **Biennial Budget Transition Plan**: OUSD(C) shall develop and publish a detailed transition plan for shifting from annual to biennial defense budget submissions. Deadline: January 1, 2028.

**Regulatory Timeline**:

| Rulemaking | Lead Agency | Deadline | Action Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit remediation guidance | OUSD(C) | 180 days | DoD Instruction |
| Carryover authority procedures | OUSD(C) | 180 days | DoD Directive |
| Portfolio category definitions | OUSD(C) | 270 days | DoD Directive |
| Financial system standards | DoD CIO | 1 year | DoD Instruction |
| Biennial budget transition plan | OUSD(C) | Jan 1, 2028 | Report to Congress |

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Automatic budget withholds**: Escalating O&M withholds for audit failure, administered by the DoD Comptroller based on OIG audit results
- **SES performance consequences**: Financial management SES personnel in noncompliant components face reduced performance ratings
- **Congressional notification**: Quarterly reports on portfolio transfers and carryover authority usage ensure legislative branch oversight
- **GAO independent evaluation**: Portfolio pilots and biennial budgeting transition are independently assessed by GAO with reports to Congress
- **Sunset provisions**: Portfolio budgeting authority terminates after 5 years unless Congress reauthorizes based on demonstrated results

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Appropriations Clause**: The carryover authority provision modifies the standard appropriation life cycle for O&M funds. This is within Congress's power under Article I, Section 9, Clause 7, but requires careful drafting to ensure compliance with the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341). The 5% cap and one-year carryover limit prevent the creation of open-ended appropriations that would undermine congressional spending control.

**Two-Year Army Appropriation Limit**: Article I, Section 8 provides that "no Appropriation of Money" for armies "shall be for a longer Term than two Years." Biennial defense budgeting satisfies this requirement because the biennial period is exactly two years. Annual end-strength authorization provides an additional safeguard. Legal scholars are divided on whether this clause applies narrowly to Army ground forces or broadly to all military spending, but biennial budgeting falls within even the broadest interpretation.

**Automatic Continuing Funding and the Power of the Purse**: The automatic CR mechanism in Section 5 of the Defense Appropriations Reform Act has been challenged on the theory that it constitutes a "permanent appropriation" that bypasses Congress's annual spending power. However, the mechanism: (a) applies only in the absence of enacted appropriations; (b) is set below the prior-year level (99%, declining to 95%); (c) terminates upon enactment of full-year appropriations; and (d) was enacted by Congress itself, meaning Congress is exercising -- not abdicating -- its spending power. Permanent and indefinite appropriations already exist throughout federal law (e.g., Social Security, Medicare, interest on the debt).

**Article I vs. Article II Tensions**: Portfolio budgeting with intra-portfolio transfer authority shifts some discretionary spending power from Congress to the Executive Branch. Under the *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) framework, this operates in Zone 1 (maximum executive authority) because Congress explicitly authorizes the transfers. The legislation includes safeguards -- quarterly reporting, notification requirements, and committee objection authority -- to preserve meaningful congressional control. The explicit prohibition on using transfer authority to fund programs Congress has zeroed ensures compliance with Zone 3 limitations.

### Case Law

- *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952): Framework for evaluating executive spending actions relative to congressional authority. The Jackson concurrence's three-zone analysis governs the constitutionality of transfer authority provisions.
- *Clinton v. City of New York*, 524 U.S. 417 (1998): Invalidated the Line Item Veto Act, establishing that the President cannot unilaterally cancel appropriations. The portfolio transfer authority is distinguishable because it operates within congressionally authorized parameters rather than allowing post-enactment cancellation.
- *Train v. City of New York*, 420 U.S. 35 (1975): Held that the President may not impound funds that Congress has appropriated. Relevant to ensuring that audit enforcement withholds are congressionally authorized (as they are in this legislation) rather than executive impoundments.

### Preemption

Federal defense budgeting and appropriations law fully preempts state authority over federal defense spending under the Supremacy Clause. The state model legislation in this framework addresses only state-funded National Guard activities and does not conflict with federal procurement or appropriations law.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance with the audit enforcement provisions relies on the DoD Inspector General's annual audit process. The DoD OIG currently contracts with independent audit firms to conduct the annual financial statement audit. Increased audit scope (individual line-item opinions) may require additional audit capacity. The Financial Systems Modernization Fund addresses the technical preconditions for auditability, but successful implementation requires sustained leadership attention and adequate staffing of the financial management workforce.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **Audit opinion shopping** | DoD components could pressure contracted audit firms for favorable opinions or switch auditors to find more lenient reviewers | High |
| **Penalty redirection gaming** | Components could classify non-audit spending as "audit remediation" to access withheld funds | Medium |
| **Portfolio transfer abuse** | The Secretary could use intra-portfolio transfer authority to fund programs Congress intended to restrict, circumventing congressional intent | High |
| **"Good faith" credit manipulation** | Components could demonstrate superficial progress (e.g., resolving easy material weaknesses first) while leaving systemic problems unaddressed | Medium |
| **Automatic CR exploitation** | Congress could deliberately avoid enacting appropriations, relying on the automatic CR to fund government at lower levels as a backdoor deficit reduction mechanism | Medium |
| **OCO successor mechanisms** | Future administrations could create new budget categories (e.g., "Strategic Competition Fund") that serve the same cap-evasion function as OCO | High |
| **Biennial budget supplemental creep** | The availability of second-year supplemental adjustments could evolve into de facto annual budgeting through the back door | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| **Audit timeline may be unrealistic** | Components may face penalties for circumstances beyond their control (legacy system limitations) | Technical complexity of DoD financial systems exceeds what policy reform can solve in 3 years |
| **Biennial budgeting reduces responsiveness** | Two-year appropriations may not adapt quickly enough to rapidly changing threats or technologies | Tradeoff between stability and responsiveness inherent in biennial approach |
| **Portfolio budgeting reduces transparency** | Moving from thousands of line items to dozens of portfolios may obscure problematic spending patterns | Aggregation inherently reduces granularity |
| **Automatic CR is a blunt instrument** | 99% of prior-year spending may not align with current-year priorities, particularly for growing or declining programs | Prior-year baseline may be significantly misaligned with current needs |
| **State model legislation has limited scope** | National Guard state-funded activities represent a small fraction of total defense spending | Most defense spending is federal and outside state jurisdiction |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Independent Audit Oversight Board**: Establish a DoD Audit Oversight Board (modeled on the PCAOB for private sector auditing) to oversee contracted audit firms, prevent opinion shopping, and ensure audit quality standards. Board members should include GAO representatives, private-sector audit experts, and congressional appointees.

2. **Audit Remediation Fund Controls**: Require the DoD OIG to certify that expenditures from withheld funds classified as "audit remediation" are genuinely related to resolving audit findings. Publish a detailed quarterly accounting of all remediation fund expenditures.

3. **Transfer Authority Guardrails**: Add an explicit statutory prohibition on using intra-portfolio transfer authority to fund programs that Congress has specifically defunded, reduced below the requested level, or subjected to spending prohibitions. Require the DoD Comptroller to certify compliance with each transfer.

4. **Good Faith Progress Standards**: Direct the DoD OIG to publish objective, quantified criteria for "measurable progress" toward auditability, including minimum thresholds for material weakness reduction, journal voucher elimination, and system interoperability benchmarks. Prevent subjective assessments from enabling gaming.

5. **Anti-Successor OCO Provision**: Strengthen the OCO prohibition by requiring that any new defense budget category created after enactment that is exempt from spending limits must be separately authorized by a two-thirds vote of each chamber.

6. **Biennial Supplemental Limits**: Cap second-year supplemental appropriations at 5% of the biennial amount unless a formal national emergency is declared, preventing supplemental creep from undermining the biennial structure.

7. **Portfolio Data Preservation**: Require the DoD to maintain and report program-level cost, schedule, and performance data within each portfolio, ensuring that aggregation into portfolios does not eliminate the granularity needed for effective oversight.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|---|---|
| **Interagency coordination** | Biennial budgeting and automatic CR provisions require alignment between DoD, OMB, and congressional committees. Establish a joint transition task force with representatives from all three. |
| **Transition risk** | Shifting from annual to biennial budgeting during ongoing operations risks disruption. Use a phased transition beginning with a "dry run" biennial submission alongside the regular annual budget. |
| **Workforce retraining** | The DoD's financial management and comptroller workforce must be retrained for new processes. The Financial Systems Modernization Fund authorizes training expenditures; set specific certification requirements. |
| **Measurement and accountability** | Without clear metrics, reform success will be difficult to evaluate. Require annual benchmarking reports measuring audit pass rates, CR duration, fourth-quarter spending ratios, and portfolio transfer frequency against pre-reform baselines. |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Portfolio budgeting pilot**: Sunsets 5 years after enactment unless reauthorized; GAO assessment required at the 3-year mark
- **Audit enforcement penalties**: Review by Congress at the 5-year mark to assess whether escalating withholds are achieving results or should be adjusted
- **Carryover authority**: Review after 3 years; GAO shall report on whether carryover authority reduced fourth-quarter spending spikes and whether the 5% cap is appropriately calibrated
- **Automatic CR provision**: Review after the first biennial cycle (approximately 4 years after enactment) to assess whether the mechanism is functioning as intended or creating perverse incentives
- **Financial Systems Modernization Fund**: Reauthorization required after 5 years; GAO shall report on systems consolidated, costs incurred, and audit improvement attributable to modernization
