# Defense Budget: Stakeholders

## Overview

The defense budget process involves an exceptionally broad set of stakeholders, from the President and Congress to individual service members and taxpayers. Power in this system is concentrated among a relatively small number of institutional actors -- the armed services committees, the appropriations subcommittees, senior Pentagon leadership, and the defense industry -- while the costs and consequences are distributed across the entire population. Understanding the interests, influence, and interrelationships among these stakeholders is essential to identifying viable reform pathways.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Think Tanks and Policy Organizations

| Organization | Orientation | Focus Area |
|---|---|---|
| Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) | Centrist | Defense strategy; budget analysis; industrial base |

## Affected Populations

### Direct Beneficiaries and Bearers

| Group | Size | How Affected |
|---|---|---|
| Active-duty military personnel | ~1.3 million | Compensation, benefits, training, equipment quality directly determined by budget decisions |
| Military families | ~2.8 million dependents | Housing, healthcare (TRICARE), childcare, spouse employment affected by budget priorities |
| Reserve and National Guard | ~800,000 | Funding for training, equipment, and benefits; often first to see cuts in drawdowns |
| DoD civilian employees | ~950,000 | Subject to hiring freezes, furloughs, and RIFs during budget contractions |
| Defense industry workers | ~2.2 million direct | Employment depends on contract awards; geographic concentration creates vulnerability |
| Veterans | ~16 million | While VA is funded separately, DoD budget decisions on force size and deployment tempo affect the future veteran population |
| Taxpayers | ~330 million | Bear the fiscal cost; receive security benefits |

### Communities with Concentrated Impact

- **Military installation communities**: The 2005 BRAC round demonstrated that base closures can devastate local economies; conversely, base expansions generate windfalls
- **Defense manufacturing regions**: Submarine production (Connecticut, Virginia), aircraft production (Texas, Georgia, Missouri), shipbuilding (Mississippi, Maine, Wisconsin)
- **Federal employee concentrations**: The Washington, D.C. metropolitan area hosts the Pentagon, defense agencies, and thousands of defense contractor offices

## Stakeholder Influence Map

### High Influence, High Interest

- Armed Services Committees (HASC, SASC)
- Defense Appropriations Subcommittees (HAC-D, SAC-D)
- Secretary of Defense and DoD Comptroller
- Service Chiefs and Secretaries
- Top 5 defense contractors

### High Influence, Moderate Interest

- President and OMB (defense is one of many priorities)
- Congressional leadership (Speaker, Majority Leader)
- Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

### Moderate Influence, High Interest

- GAO and DoD OIG (produce findings but lack enforcement power)
- Think tanks and policy organizations (shape debate but do not decide)
- Defense industry associations (NDIA, AIA, PSC)
- Military professional associations (MOAA, VFW, AUSA)

### Low Influence, High Interest

- Individual service members (affected but have no direct voice in budget decisions)
- Military families (organized through advocacy groups but limited political power)
- Taxpayers (diffuse interest; low salience of defense budget specifics)
- Defense reform advocates (small community with limited political constituency)

## Stakeholder Dynamics

### Alliance Patterns

- **Service-Industry-Congress**: Each military service has an informal alliance with its primary contractors and the members of Congress who represent districts with production facilities or bases. The Army-congressional-industry triad around ground vehicles differs from the Navy-shipbuilding triad but both operate on the same logic
- **Bipartisan defense coalition**: A cross-party coalition of defense hawks in both parties reliably supports topline growth, though they may disagree on allocation within the budget
- **Reform coalition**: A smaller, more diffuse coalition of fiscal conservatives, progressives, libertarians, and good-government organizations agrees on audit enforcement and waste reduction but disagrees on whether the topline should go up or down

### Conflict Patterns

- **Inter-service rivalry**: The Army, Navy, and Air Force compete for budget share in a near-zero-sum environment, particularly for procurement and RDT&E dollars
- **Authorization vs. Appropriation**: The armed services committees and appropriations subcommittees have overlapping jurisdiction and sometimes conflicting priorities; appropriators control the money and often override authorizer policy preferences
- **Pentagon vs. Congress**: The DoD seeks flexibility (transfer authority, portfolio budgeting, multi-year funding); Congress seeks control (line items, earmarks, notification requirements)
- **Established industry vs. new entrants**: Traditional defense primes benefit from the complexity of the current system; non-traditional firms (tech startups, commercial companies) find barriers to entry that protect incumbents
