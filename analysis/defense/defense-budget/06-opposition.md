# Defense Budget: Opposition Analysis

## Overview

Opposition to defense budget reform comes not primarily from a single ideological camp but from a constellation of institutional actors whose power, budgets, and political survival depend on the current system's continuation. Defense hawks oppose reforms they perceive as threatening military capability; the defense industry opposes reforms that reduce revenue predictability; military services oppose changes that threaten their budget share; and members of Congress oppose reforms that reduce their control over spending in their districts. Understanding these opposition dynamics is critical because reforms that fail to account for them will be blocked regardless of their policy merit.

## Organized Opposition

### Primary Opposition Groups

| Opposition Actor | Specific Reforms Opposed | Core Motivation | Influence Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defense Hawks (congressional) | Budget cuts; audit penalties that reduce spending | Military strength; deterrence | Floor votes; committee control; media |
| Appropriations Subcommittees | Portfolio budgeting; biennial budgeting; expanded transfer authority | Institutional power; line-item control | Appropriations bills; earmarks; holds |
| Military Services (institutional) | Cross-service consolidation; zero-based reviews; joint budgeting | Budget share preservation; service identity | Testimony; liaison offices; leaks |
| Defense Industry (primes) | Program cancellations; competition mandates; audit requirements on contractors | Revenue stability; profit margins | Lobbying; PAC contributions; political engineering |
| Base-state delegations | BRAC; base consolidation; depot closures | Local economic impact; constituent jobs | Bipartisan coalitions; BRAC prohibition riders |
| Defense workforce unions (AFGE) | Civilian workforce reductions; A-76 competitions | Job preservation; bargaining rights | Grassroots advocacy; Democratic alliance |
| Veterans' organizations | Any reform framed as "cutting support for troops" | Veteran benefits; moral authority | Media campaigns; membership mobilization |

### Opposition by Reform Category

| Reform Proposal | Who Opposes | Why | Strength of Opposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory clean audit by deadline | Service comptrollers; defense agencies | Fear of budget penalties; IT costs | Medium (broad support in principle, resistance in practice) |
| Portfolio budgeting (replacing line items) | Appropriations committees; earmarkers | Loss of granular spending control | Very High (threatens core committee power) |
| Biennial budgeting | Appropriations committees; some authorizers | Reduces oversight frequency; fewer hearings | High |
| Ending CRs (automatic continuing funding) | Parties using CRs as leverage | Removes political bargaining tool | High (structural congressional dysfunction) |
| BRAC/base consolidation | Local delegations; communities | Job losses; economic disruption | Very High (bipartisan local opposition) |
| OCO elimination | Those who used OCO to circumvent caps | Loss of budget flexibility | Medium (already accomplished in FY2022) |
| Zero-based reviews | All services; defense agencies | Threatens baseline budgets; bureaucratic cost | High |
| Cross-service consolidation | Individual services | Institutional identity; turf | Very High |
| Reducing personnel costs | Military associations; families | Compensation; benefits; quality of life | High (politically toxic) |

## Opposition Strategies and Tactics

### "Hollowing the Force" Narrative

The most effective opposition strategy against budget reform or reduction is the "hollow force" narrative:

- **How it works**: Military leaders testify that any budget reduction, efficiency measure, or spending constraint will degrade readiness and put service members at risk. The term "hollow force" -- referencing the late-1970s readiness crisis -- is invoked to generate public concern and congressional action
- **Effectiveness**: Extremely high. No member of Congress wants to be seen as responsible for a military failure. The narrative shifts the burden of proof from "why do you need this money?" to "can you guarantee nothing bad will happen if we cut?"
- **Counter**: Point to specific examples of waste (e.g., the DoD's $3.8 trillion in unsupported accounting adjustments) and argue that reform is about *redirecting* money to readiness, not cutting it

### Political Engineering

Defense contractors deliberately distribute production, employment, and subcontracting across the maximum number of congressional districts:

- **F-35 example**: Lockheed Martin's F-35 program has suppliers in 46 states, creating a political constituency that makes the program effectively untouchable regardless of performance
- **Shipbuilding**: Major shipbuilding programs (Columbia-class submarine, DDG-51 destroyer) are split between two shipyards in different states (Connecticut/Virginia for subs; Mississippi/Maine for destroyers) to double the congressional support base
- **Effect on reform**: Programs with broad geographic distribution are nearly impossible to cancel, restructure, or reduce, even when GAO identifies significant cost growth or performance problems

### Committee Jurisdiction Defense

Congressional committees guard their jurisdiction with intense institutional loyalty:

- **Appropriators vs. authorizers**: The defense appropriations subcommittees resist any reform that would reduce their line-item authority, including portfolio budgeting, expanded transfer authority, or biennial budgeting. Appropriators view detailed spending control as their core constitutional function
- **"Power of the purse"**: Reforms that would give the Pentagon more spending flexibility are framed as eroding Congress's Article I power, even when the purpose is to improve efficiency
- **Earmark restoration**: The restoration of congressional earmarks (rebranded as "community project funding") in FY2022 further reinforced appropriators' attachment to line-item control

### Revolving Door Influence

Senior Pentagon officials who leave government service for defense industry positions create a network of relationships that reinforces the status quo:

- **Scale**: A POGO study found that between 2008 and 2018, over 380 senior DoD officials moved to positions at the top 20 defense contractors
- **Effect**: Former officials bring relationships with current officials and understand the internal advocacy process. They are uniquely positioned to lobby against reforms that would disadvantage their new employers
- **Two-way flow**: Industry executives also move into senior Pentagon positions, bringing industry perspectives and relationships that shape budget priorities from inside the building

### Threat-Based Arguments

Opposition to budget reform or reduction is frequently framed in terms of external threats:

- **China framing**: "Now is not the time to cut/reform defense -- China is building at an unprecedented rate." This argument is effective because it invokes a genuine strategic concern to foreclose discussion of how money is spent
- **Russia framing**: The Ukraine conflict has reinforced arguments for higher munitions spending and European deterrence investments
- **Terrorism framing**: Although the post-9/11 threat environment has evolved, counterterrorism spending remains politically protected
- **"Savings = risk" equivalence**: Any proposed efficiency or savings is characterized as accepting additional military risk, even when the savings come from genuinely wasteful activities

## Counter-Strategies for Reformers

### Reframe Efficiency as Lethality

- Rather than arguing for "cuts" or "savings," frame reforms as *improving military effectiveness*. "Getting more lethality per dollar" is far more politically viable than "reducing waste"
- The PPBE Commission used this framing effectively, arguing that budget process reform is necessary to compete with China at the "speed of relevance"

### Build Bipartisan Audit Coalitions

- Audit enforcement is the one reform that attracts support from both fiscal conservatives (reducing waste) and progressives (accountability). An "Audit the Pentagon" coalition can include members who agree on nothing else
- Key precedent: Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have both championed Pentagon audit accountability, demonstrating the breadth of potential support

### Use CBO and GAO as Validators

- Independent analysis from CBO and GAO provides political cover for members who support reform. Members can cite GAO findings on waste and cost growth as nonpartisan justification for voting for reforms that their constituents' defense employers oppose
- GAO's annual assessment of major defense acquisition programs consistently documents cost growth of 30-50%, providing ammunition for reformers

### Target Specific Waste, Not the Topline

- Reforms that target specific instances of documented waste (duplicative IT systems, unsupported accounting adjustments, sole-source contracts) are more viable than proposals to cut the overall budget level
- This approach sidesteps the "hollowing the force" narrative by accepting the topline while insisting on better allocation within it

### Leverage Industry Competition

- New-entrant defense firms (Anduril, Shield AI, Palantir, SpaceX) have a financial interest in reforms that reduce barriers to entry and break incumbent advantages. These firms can be allies in pushing for acquisition and budget reforms that the traditional primes oppose
- The commercial technology sector broadly benefits from reforms that make it easier for non-traditional firms to work with the DoD

### Create Constituencies for Reform

- Establish visible metrics and scorecards (e.g., an "audit readiness score" for each service) that create public accountability and competitive pressure among military departments
- Use the PPBE Commission recommendations as a bipartisan reform baseline that has already been vetted by a congressionally mandated body
