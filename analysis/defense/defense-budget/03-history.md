# Defense Budget: History

## Overview

The history of the U.S. defense budget is a story of dramatic swings driven by wars, geopolitical shifts, and domestic political economy. From the permanent mobilization of the Cold War to the post-9/11 spending surge to the austerity of sequestration, defense spending has rarely been the product of deliberate strategic calculation. Instead, it has been shaped by crises, inertia, and the institutional interests of a vast military-industrial ecosystem. Understanding this history is essential to diagnosing the structural pathologies that persist in the current budget process.

## Pre-Cold War Foundations

### The Constitutional Framework

The Founders embedded military budgeting in the constitutional structure with deliberate constraints. Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power to "raise and support Armies" with the unique limitation that "no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years." This two-year appropriation limit, rooted in English fears of standing armies, remains the foundation of defense budget law and distinguishes military spending from all other federal appropriations.

### World War II and Demobilization (**1941-1947**)

- **1945**: Defense spending peaked at approximately 37% of GDP during World War II, the highest level in American history
- **1947**: Rapid demobilization reduced the military from 12 million personnel to 1.5 million; defense spending fell to approximately 5% of GDP
- **1947**: The National Security Act created the Department of Defense, the National Security Council, the CIA, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, establishing the institutional architecture that still governs defense budgeting

## The Cold War Era (1947-1991)

### The Korean War Buildup (**1950-1953**)

- **NSC-68 (1950)**: Paul Nitze's classified strategy document called for a massive and sustained military buildup to contain the Soviet Union, arguing that the United States should spend whatever was necessary on defense regardless of fiscal consequences
- **1952**: Defense spending surged to approximately 13% of GDP, the highest peacetime level in American history at that time
- **Korean War costs**: Approximately $30 billion ($341 billion in 2024 dollars) over three years
- The Korean War established the precedent of a large permanent peacetime military establishment, a fundamental break from American tradition

### The Eisenhower "New Look" (**1953-1961**)

- President Eisenhower, drawing on his military experience, sought to constrain defense spending through the "New Look" strategy that relied on nuclear deterrence ("massive retaliation") rather than expensive conventional forces
- **1953-1960**: Defense spending declined from 13% to approximately 9% of GDP
- Eisenhower's **1961 farewell address** warned of the "military-industrial complex" -- the first presidential articulation of the structural incentives that drive defense spending independent of strategic need
- Established the concept that excessive defense spending could undermine national security by weakening the economy

### The McNamara Revolution (**1961-1968**)

- Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara introduced the Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS, later PPBE) in **1961**, applying systems analysis and cost-effectiveness methodology to defense resource allocation
- PPBS was a genuinely revolutionary innovation that gave the Secretary of Defense, rather than the individual military services, centralized control over budget priorities
- **Vietnam War costs**: The war ultimately cost approximately $843 billion (2024 dollars), much of it funded through deficit spending and the "guns and butter" approach that contributed to inflation in the late 1960s and 1970s
- McNamara's analytical approach, while transformative, also introduced pathologies: the quantification of everything led to metrics divorced from reality (body counts in Vietnam) and a technocratic overconfidence that persists in DoD budgeting

### Post-Vietnam Drawdown (**1969-1979**)

- **1969-1975**: Defense spending declined from approximately 8.9% of GDP to 5.2% as the Vietnam War wound down and the draft ended
- **All-Volunteer Force (1973)**: The elimination of conscription dramatically increased per-capita personnel costs, beginning the long-term trend of rising personnel spending that now consumes over half the budget
- **Hollow force**: By the late 1970s, chronic underfunding led to severe readiness problems -- equipment in disrepair, undertrained units, and a recruiting crisis. Army Chief of Staff General Edward Meyer testified in **1980** that the Army was a "hollow force"
- The "hollow force" narrative became a powerful political tool, invoked in every subsequent era by advocates of higher defense spending

### The Reagan Buildup (**1981-1989**)

- **FY1981-FY1985**: President Reagan presided over a 40% real increase in defense spending, the largest peacetime buildup in American history
- **Peak spending (FY1985)**: Approximately $450 billion (2024 dollars), or 6.2% of GDP
- Major programs: B-2 bomber, MX Peacekeeper ICBM, 600-ship Navy, Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars"), M1 Abrams tank, F-15/F-16 fighter procurement
- The buildup was justified by the Soviet threat but also reflected the political economy of defense: the geographic distribution of contracts and bases created powerful congressional constituencies for sustained high spending
- **Procurement fraud**: The "Ill Wind" investigation (**1988**) uncovered widespread fraud, bribery, and bid-rigging in defense procurement, leading to convictions of dozens of officials and contractors

## Post-Cold War Transition (1991-2001)

### The Peace Dividend (**1991-1998**)

- **1989-1997**: Defense spending fell from 5.5% to 3.0% of GDP -- the steepest sustained decline since the post-Korean War drawdown
- **Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)**: Congress authorized BRAC rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995 to close excess military infrastructure. These rounds closed over 350 installations and saved an estimated $12 billion annually, but the political pain was so intense that no BRAC round has been authorized since 2005
- **Procurement holiday**: The services deferred modernization during this period, creating an "aging equipment" problem that persists today. Average aircraft age, ship age, and vehicle age all increased substantially
- **End-strength reductions**: Active-duty military personnel declined from 2.1 million in 1989 to approximately 1.4 million by 1999

### The Quadrennial Defense Review and Transformation (**1997-2001**)

- The first Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) in **1997** introduced the "two major theater wars" sizing construct, arguing the military needed to be capable of fighting two simultaneous regional conflicts
- Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld entered office in **2001** with a "transformation" agenda to reshape the military for the information age, emphasizing precision strike, special operations, and network-centric warfare over traditional heavy forces
- **FY2001 defense budget**: Approximately $316 billion (current dollars), or 3.0% of GDP -- the lowest share since before Pearl Harbor

## The Post-9/11 Era (2001-2011)

### The Global War on Terror Spending Surge

- **September 11, 2001** fundamentally altered the trajectory of defense spending, launching nearly two decades of sustained increases
- Congress immediately appropriated a $40 billion emergency supplemental, followed by regular supplemental appropriations for operations in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom, **2001**) and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom, **2003**)

### OCO and Supplemental Spending

| Fiscal Year | Base Budget | OCO/Supplemental | Total | % of GDP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FY2001 | $316B | -- | $316B | 3.0% |
| FY2003 | $388B | $72B | $460B | 3.6% |
| FY2006 | $441B | $120B | $561B | 3.9% |
| FY2008 | $481B | $187B | $668B | 4.3% |
| FY2010 | $528B | $163B | $691B | 4.7% |

*Source: DoD Comptroller, OMB Historical Tables. Figures in current-year dollars.*

### Key Developments

- **FY2001-FY2010**: Total defense spending nearly doubled in real terms, from approximately $316 billion to $691 billion
- **OCO as a budget mechanism**: Supplemental and OCO funding was initially intended for genuine war costs but gradually became a vehicle for base budget activities. Because OCO was exempt from budget caps, it became a preferred funding mechanism for items that could not fit within the base budget
- **Cumulative post-9/11 costs**: Brown University's Watson Institute estimates total post-9/11 war costs at approximately $8 trillion (including future veterans' care and interest on war-related debt through 2050)
- **Peak year (FY2010)**: Total defense spending reached approximately $691 billion in current dollars, or 4.7% of GDP, the highest level since the Korean War in inflation-adjusted terms

## Austerity and Sequestration (2011-2021)

### The Budget Control Act (**2011**)

- The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) imposed caps on both defense and non-defense discretionary spending through FY2021
- If a congressional "supercommittee" failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan (it did), automatic across-the-board spending cuts (sequestration) would take effect
- **March 2013**: Sequestration took effect, imposing approximately $37 billion in immediate defense cuts for FY2013 through indiscriminate across-the-board reductions to nearly every program, project, and activity

### Impact of Sequestration

- **Civilian furloughs**: 650,000 DoD civilian employees were furloughed for up to 11 days
- **Training cancellations**: The Navy canceled deployments; the Air Force grounded combat squadrons; the Army canceled training rotations at the National Training Center
- **Maintenance deferrals**: Aircraft, ship, and vehicle maintenance was deferred, creating backlogs that persist a decade later
- **"Hollowing" debate**: Military leaders testified that sequestration was returning the force to the "hollow" conditions of the late 1970s

### Budget Deal Relief

| Agreement | Years Covered | Defense Cap Increase |
|---|---|---|
| Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 | FY2014-FY2015 | +$31B over caps |
| Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 | FY2016-FY2017 | +$33B over caps |
| Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 | FY2018-FY2019 | +$80B over caps |
| Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 | FY2020-FY2021 | +$22B over caps |

*Source: Congressional Budget Office analyses of bipartisan budget agreements.*

Each deal required corresponding increases in non-defense spending, creating a political linkage between defense and domestic spending that persists to this day.

### OCO as a Cap-Evasion Mechanism

During the BCA era, OCO became an explicit tool for circumventing spending caps:

- **FY2017-FY2020**: An estimated $30-50 billion per year in base budget activities (such as readiness, depot maintenance, and equipment procurement) were funded through OCO rather than the base budget to stay under the caps
- Critics labeled this the "OCO slush fund"; defenders argued it was a pragmatic response to unrealistically low caps
- **FY2022**: The Biden administration formally ended the OCO distinction, folding all war costs into the base budget

## Recent Trends (2021-Present)

### Post-BCA Budget Growth

With the expiration of BCA caps, defense spending has resumed growth, though at a slower pace than advocates prefer:

| Fiscal Year | DoD Budget (Current $) | Real Growth |
|---|---|---|
| FY2021 | $740.5B | ~flat |
| FY2022 | $782.0B | ~flat (high inflation) |
| FY2023 | $816.7B | ~+5% |
| FY2024 | $841.4B | ~flat |
| FY2025 (request) | $849.8B | ~-1% |

*Source: DoD Comptroller, CBO inflation adjustments.*

### The Fiscal Responsibility Act (**2023**)

- Set new spending caps for FY2024 ($886B for defense, 050 function) and FY2025 (~1% growth)
- After FY2025, caps expire and defense spending is again unconstrained by statute (though subject to annual appropriations politics)

### China as Budget Driver

The bipartisan consensus that China represents the "pacing challenge" has become the primary justification for defense budget growth. The Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI), established in the FY2021 NDAA, authorized dedicated funding for capabilities to deter China in the Indo-Pacific, though its impact on overall resource allocation remains modest relative to the total budget.

## History of Defense Financial Management Reform

### Key Legislative Milestones

| Year | Law/Action | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1949 | National Security Act Amendments | Created the DoD Comptroller position |
| 1961 | PPBS introduced | McNamara's analytical budgeting system |
| 1982 | Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act | Required internal control assessments |
| 1990 | Chief Financial Officers Act | Required audited financial statements |
| 1994 | Government Management Reform Act | Extended audit requirements |
| 1996 | Federal Financial Management Improvement Act | Required compliance with financial systems standards |
| 2010 | NDAA Section 1003 | Required DoD to be "audit ready" by FY2017 |
| 2017 | First DoD-wide audit announced | DoD contracted with independent auditors |
| 2018 | First DoD-wide audit completed | Disclaimer of opinion (failed) |
| 2022 | NDAA Section 1004 | Established PPBE Reform Commission |
| 2024 | PPBE Reform Commission Report | Recommended fundamental process changes |

Despite this 30-year legislative effort, the DoD remains unauditable. The pattern is consistent: Congress mandates reform, sets deadlines, and the DoD misses them without consequence. The absence of meaningful penalties for audit failure is itself a root cause of the problem.

## Recurring Patterns

Several patterns recur across the history of defense budgeting:

- **Crisis-driven spending**: Spending surges follow crises (Korea, Vietnam, 9/11) and then slowly recede, but rarely return to pre-crisis levels due to institutional interests that crystallize around the higher baseline
- **Procurement bow waves**: Deferred modernization during drawdowns creates "bow waves" of procurement demand that arrive simultaneously, forcing impossible budget choices
- **The readiness trap**: During drawdowns, readiness (O&M, training) is cut first because it is politically less visible than canceling a major program, but the resulting "hollow force" then becomes the justification for the next buildup
- **Reform futility**: Major reform efforts (McNamara's PPBS, Goldwater-Nichols, Packard Commission, Section 809 Panel, PPBE Commission) produce sophisticated recommendations that are partially implemented before institutional resistance dilutes or reverses them
- **Budget caps as political tools**: Spending caps (Gramm-Rudman, BCA) are enacted during deficit panics, create perverse incentives (OCO abuse, CRs), and are ultimately circumvented through bipartisan deals that raise both defense and domestic spending
