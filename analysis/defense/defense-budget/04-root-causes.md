# Defense Budget: Root Causes

## Overview

The problems plaguing the defense budget -- audit failures, misallocation, waste, chronic continuing resolutions, and the disconnect between strategy and resources -- are not the result of any single failure or any single actor's incompetence. They are the predictable output of a system whose structural incentives reward the very behaviors that reformers seek to change. Fixing the defense budget requires understanding why the current system persists despite decades of reform efforts and bipartisan criticism.

## Structural Causes

### The PPBE Process Is Obsolete

The Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution system was designed by Robert McNamara in 1961 for a bipolar Cold War threat environment where five-year planning horizons were plausible and the primary challenge was allocating resources among the military services. The system is fundamentally mismatched with a contemporary environment characterized by:

- **Rapid technological change**: The PPBE cycle takes approximately two years from planning to budget submission; commercial technology cycles operate on 12-18 month timelines
- **Multi-domain threats**: The system is organized around service budgets (Army, Navy, Air Force), not cross-cutting mission areas or threat scenarios
- **Rigidity**: Once resources are programmed, changing course requires reprogramming actions that are bureaucratically costly and limited by statute (typically 10 U.S.C. 2214, capping transfers at $40-50 million per action)

### "Color of Money" Rigidity

Federal appropriations law divides DoD funding into distinct appropriation categories (MILPERS, O&M, Procurement, RDT&E, MILCON), each with different rules for obligation periods, transfer authorities, and permissible uses. This "color of money" system means:

- Funds appropriated for research cannot be used for procurement, even if a technology is ready for production mid-year
- Funds appropriated for procurement cannot be used for sustainment, even if maintaining existing systems is more cost-effective than buying new ones
- Program managers must plan spending years in advance across multiple appropriation categories, creating administrative overhead and reducing flexibility
- The software-intensive nature of modern weapons makes this problem acute: software does not fit neatly into the R&D-then-procure model because it requires continuous development, testing, and updating

### The Annual Budget Cycle

The federal government's one-year appropriation cycle is poorly suited to managing a $850 billion enterprise that operates multi-decade programs:

- **"Use it or lose it"**: Funds that are not obligated by the end of the fiscal year expire and are lost. This creates a powerful incentive to spend every dollar before September 30, regardless of whether the spending is optimal. GAO has documented that DoD obligations spike by approximately 35% in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year (GAO-13-531)
- **Short-term thinking**: One-year funding horizons discourage investments that produce long-term savings but require upfront costs
- **Instability**: Annual budgeting means that every program must be justified and funded anew each year, creating uncertainty for both DoD program managers and defense industry partners

## Institutional Causes

### Service Parochialism

The military services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Space Force) are powerful bureaucratic actors with distinct cultures, identities, and institutional interests. Each service fights to protect and grow its share of the budget:

- **Budget share as institutional health**: Within the DoD, a service's budget share is viewed as a proxy for its relevance and institutional power. Losing budget share is treated as an existential threat
- **Requirements inflation**: Services set overly ambitious requirements for new systems to justify large budgets, contributing to cost growth and schedule delays
- **Duplication**: Each service maintains its own logistics systems, financial systems, medical facilities, and administrative infrastructure, creating redundancy that resists consolidation
- **Resistance to jointness**: Despite Goldwater-Nichols Act reforms (1986) mandating joint operations, the services resist joint programs and cross-service resource sharing because joint programs dilute individual service budget control

### The Pentagon Bureaucracy

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), defense agencies, and the joint staff add layers of review and approval that slow decision-making:

- **Staffing layers**: A budget request must navigate through service headquarters, OSD components, OMB, and multiple congressional committees before funds are available, a process that can take 18-24 months from identification of a need to obligation of funds
- **Risk aversion**: The bureaucratic culture penalizes failure far more than it rewards innovation. Program managers who take risks and fail face career consequences; those who follow process and deliver late face none
- **Financial management as afterthought**: Within DoD, the Comptroller and financial management workforce have historically been low-prestige positions. Career incentives favor operational assignments over financial stewardship

### Legacy IT Systems

The DoD operates approximately 2,400 financial and business information systems, many of which date to the 1970s and 1980s:

- These systems cannot share data, requiring manual reconciliation and journal voucher adjustments that run into the trillions of dollars annually
- Modernizing these systems is itself a massive IT program subject to the same acquisition pathologies that afflict weapon systems
- Multiple attempts to build enterprise-wide financial systems (e.g., the Army's GFEBS, the Navy's ERP) have experienced significant cost overruns and delays
- The fragmented IT landscape is the single largest technical barrier to achieving a clean financial audit

## Political Economy Causes

### The Iron Triangle

The mutually reinforcing relationship between Congress, the DoD, and the defense industry creates structural resistance to budget reform:

- **Congress**: Members benefit from defense spending in their districts (bases, production facilities, depots). Cutting a weapons program means cutting jobs and campaign contributions. The defense appropriations subcommittees (HAC-D and SAC-D) are among the most powerful in Congress, and their members have strong incentives to maintain line-item control over spending
- **DoD**: The military services need congressional support for their programs and therefore accommodate congressional preferences, even when those preferences conflict with strategic priorities. The services lobby Congress through their "legislative liaison" offices and benefit from the revolving door of personnel between the Pentagon and Capitol Hill
- **Defense industry**: Contractors strategically distribute production across as many congressional districts as possible ("political engineering") to create a broad political constituency for each program. Industry PACs and lobbying ensure that members hear from their constituents about the importance of defense programs

### Geographic Distribution of Defense Spending

Defense spending is not allocated based solely on strategic need; it is heavily influenced by the geography of political power:

- Major military installations, shipyards, depots, and production facilities are distributed across the country, creating a web of economic dependencies
- Members of Congress from states with significant military presence (Virginia, California, Texas, Maryland, Connecticut, Georgia) have outsized influence on defense budgets
- BRAC rounds demonstrated that closing even redundant bases generates fierce local opposition, which is why no BRAC round has been authorized since 2005

### The Appropriations Committee Power Structure

The defense appropriations subcommittees exercise extraordinary granular control over Pentagon spending:

- The annual defense appropriations bill contains thousands of specific line items, often down to individual procurement quantities and R&D project funding levels
- This line-item control is the source of the committees' institutional power and is fiercely guarded
- Any reform that would reduce congressional line-item control (such as portfolio budgeting) faces opposition not just from the defense community but from Congress itself, which views detailed budget control as a core constitutional prerogative under Article I

### Campaign Finance and Lobbying

The defense industry is among the largest sources of campaign contributions and lobbying expenditure in the federal system:

- Defense sector PACs and individuals contributed over $50 million to federal candidates in the 2024 election cycle (OpenSecrets)
- The top five defense contractors collectively spent over $60 million annually on lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023)
- The "revolving door" between senior Pentagon officials and defense industry positions creates relationships and incentives that reinforce the status quo

## Process Dysfunction Causes

### The CR Cycle

The chronic failure to pass on-time appropriations is not primarily a defense budget problem but a symptom of broader congressional dysfunction:

- **Polarization**: Increasing partisan polarization makes bipartisan budget agreements harder to reach
- **Leverage politics**: Continuing resolutions and government shutdowns are used as leverage in unrelated political disputes (debt ceiling, immigration, social policy)
- **Omnibus packaging**: Defense appropriations are increasingly bundled into omnibus or "minibus" packages with non-defense spending, making them hostage to disputes over domestic spending priorities
- **Institutional decline**: The regular order process of committee markups, floor amendments, and conference committees has largely broken down, replaced by leadership-driven negotiations that produce last-minute deals

### Lack of Consequences for Audit Failure

Perhaps the most direct root cause of the DoD's persistent audit failure is the absence of meaningful penalties:

- The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 required auditable financial statements but imposed no consequence for failure
- Congress has set and missed multiple audit deadlines (FY2017, FY2018) without reducing appropriations or imposing personnel accountability
- Senior DoD leaders face no career consequences for presiding over audit failures
- The DoD's budget continues to grow regardless of its inability to account for how money is spent, eliminating any fiscal incentive to prioritize financial management

### Supplemental and Emergency Funding

The availability of supplemental appropriations and emergency funding mechanisms reduces the discipline of the base budget process:

- During the post-9/11 era, supplemental and OCO funding provided a relief valve that allowed the base budget to avoid hard tradeoffs
- Emergency supplementals for natural disasters, pandemics, and foreign aid (e.g., Ukraine) further expand defense-related spending outside the normal appropriations framework
- The expectation that supplementals will be available reduces the incentive to budget honestly for known requirements

## Cultural Causes

### Threat Inflation

The defense establishment has a structural incentive to emphasize threats, which in turn justifies budget growth:

- Intelligence assessments are filtered through institutional interests that benefit from elevated threat perceptions
- The "pacing threat" framework (currently China) provides a broad justification for virtually any spending increase, from submarines to AI to space
- Historical examples of threat overestimation (the "bomber gap," the "missile gap," Soviet GDP estimates) suggest caution about current threat assessments, but the political cost of underestimating a threat is far greater than the cost of overestimating one

### The Sunk Cost Fallacy

Once a major program has consumed billions of dollars, canceling it becomes politically and bureaucratically impossible even if it is performing poorly:

- The F-35 program has experienced over 80% cost growth and years of delays, yet cancellation has never been seriously considered because of the sunk investment and the political constituencies built around its production
- The Sentinel ICBM replacement breached Nunn-McCurdy cost thresholds in 2024, triggering a review, but the program continued because of the perceived absence of alternatives
- This dynamic means that the budget is increasingly consumed by legacy decisions rather than forward-looking strategic choices
