# Defense Budget: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

The defense budget debate cuts across the traditional left-right spectrum in complex ways. It is not a simple "more vs. less" argument. Defense hawks want higher toplines; fiscal hawks want audits and efficiency; progressives want deep cuts to fund social programs; libertarians want audits *and* cuts; constitutionalists want strict congressional control; populists want to decouple from China and rebuild American industry; and centrists want process reform to make the money work better. The most productive reform pathways require understanding where these perspectives overlap and where they irreconcilably diverge.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|---|---|---|
| Conservative | Military strength, fiscal discipline (selective), sovereignty | Higher topline; audit support; readiness investment |
| Liberal | Oversight, domestic priorities, diplomacy | Moderate cuts; strong audit enforcement; waste reduction |
| Progressive | Anti-militarism, social investment, human rights | Deep cuts (10-50%); defund to fund social programs |
| Libertarian | Fiscal restraint, non-intervention, free markets | Substantial cuts; strict audit; end subsidies |
| Constitutionalist | Congressional authority, enumerated powers, originalism | Strict line-item control; oppose transfer authority |
| Populist | America First, anti-elite, domestic industry | Strong military but skeptical of Pentagon waste; Buy American |
| Centrist | Efficiency, stability, evidence-based reform | Process reform; portfolio budgeting; bipartisan deals |
| Religious Right | Moral clarity, strength, tradition | Strong defense as moral duty; support troops/families |
| Democratic Socialist | Anti-imperialism, public ownership, demilitarization | Radical cuts; convert defense industry; global disarmament |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Tension between "fiscal hawk" (cut waste) and "defense hawk" (increase spending). Fiscal discipline is selectively applied. |
| Principle consistency | Conservatives regularly abandon deficit concerns when it comes to defense spending, voting for topline increases without demanding audit accountability. |
| Goalpost stability | The definition of "adequate" defense spending shifts upward with each budget cycle; 3% of GDP was sufficient a decade ago, now 5% is demanded. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Defense spending increases are treated as non-negotiable; domestic spending is the variable that must adjust. |

**Justification:** The conservative movement is internally divided between fiscal conservatives who demand accountability (Freedom Caucus, Heritage Action) and defense hawks who prioritize topline growth (traditional GOP defense establishment). This split creates genuine incoherence on budget votes: the same members who demand spending cuts across government routinely vote for defense budgets that exceed the President's request.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Freedom Caucus opposition to FY2024 and FY2025 NDAAs on both spending and policy grounds
- Senate Republican leadership consistently pushing for defense supplementals beyond requested levels
- Heritage Foundation's "Index of U.S. Military Strength" calls for spending above 5% of GDP while Heritage Action scores votes to cut spending

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree the budget is poorly managed; disagree that spending levels are adequate (believe they are too low) |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agree on PPBE dysfunction and bureaucratic waste; reluctant to acknowledge that the iron triangle or defense industry consolidation are root causes |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation, "Index of U.S. Military Strength" (2024)
- American Enterprise Institute defense budget analyses
- Congressional testimony by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) on defense spending adequacy

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit Enforcement | 6/10 | Support in principle; concerned about penalties weakening readiness | "Hollowing the force" risk |
| Portfolio Budgeting | 7/10 | Support flexibility for military; wary of oversight reduction | Want more money spent effectively |
| Biennial Budgeting | 7/10 | Support stability for defense planning | Predictability for programs |
| Ending CRs | 9/10 | Strong support; CRs hurt military readiness | Readiness and modernization delays |
| Zero-Based Reviews | 4/10 | Suspicious; could become vehicle for cuts | Fear of topline reduction |
| Financial System Modernization | 7/10 | Support as efficiency measure | Prefer spending on weapons over IT |
| Personnel Cost Management | 3/10 | Oppose any perception of cutting troop support | Recruiting crisis; troop welfare |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defense Budget Accountability Act | 6/10 | Support audit enforcement; oppose penalties that reduce military spending | Readiness impact of withholds |
| Defense Appropriations Reform Act | 7/10 | Support biennial budgeting and ending CRs; cautious on portfolio budgeting | Want flexibility but fear losing earmarks |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Increase defense topline to 5% of GDP (~$1.4 trillion) to match threat level
- Exempt defense from any government-wide spending caps or sequestration
- Prioritize readiness and modernization funding over process reform

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Centrists (on process reform), Populists (on strong military)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarians (on audit enforcement, if framed as efficiency)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives, Democratic Socialists

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent desire to redirect defense spending to domestic priorities while maintaining adequate security |
| Principle consistency | Generally support oversight, accountability, and waste reduction; occasional inconsistency when defense spending creates jobs in Democratic districts |
| Goalpost stability | Stable preference for moderate defense budget levels with strong accountability mechanisms |
| Zero-sum behavior | Frame defense spending as a tradeoff with domestic investment ("guns vs. butter") |

**Justification:** Liberals are among the most consistent advocates for defense budget accountability. They have championed audit requirements, whistleblower protections, and oversight mechanisms for decades. Their primary tension is between wanting to cut defense spending and representing districts where defense is a major employer, creating occasional breaks from their stated fiscal priorities.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Center for American Progress defense budget publications consistently advocate for moderate reductions with reinvestment in diplomacy and domestic programs
- Democratic platform language supporting "responsible defense budgets" with strong oversight
- POGO and allied organizations receive broad liberal support for accountability campaigns

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement that the budget is poorly managed, wasteful, and lacks accountability; may disagree on specific threat assessments |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree on iron triangle, defense industry influence, revolving door, and lack of consequences as root causes |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress defense and budget publications
- Project on Government Oversight (POGO) audit campaigns
- Congressional Progressive Caucus and New Democrat Coalition budget positions

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit Enforcement | 10/10 | Strong support; the centerpiece of liberal defense budget advocacy | Accountability; waste reduction |
| Portfolio Budgeting | 5/10 | Cautious; concerned about reducing congressional oversight | Fear of giving Pentagon a "blank check" |
| Biennial Budgeting | 6/10 | Moderate support; want more oversight, not less | Reduced hearing frequency |
| Ending CRs | 7/10 | Support in principle; worry about losing leverage on domestic spending | Domestic spending linkage |
| Zero-Based Reviews | 8/10 | Strong support; want programs to justify their existence | Identify waste and low-priority spending |
| Financial System Modernization | 8/10 | Support; necessary precondition for accountability | Want to know where money goes |
| Personnel Cost Management | 4/10 | Cautious; support troop welfare but recognize unsustainable cost growth | Don't want to harm service members |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defense Budget Accountability Act | 9/10 | Strong support for audit enforcement, transparency dashboard, and carryover authority | Core oversight priorities |
| Defense Appropriations Reform Act | 6/10 | Support ending CRs and OCO prohibition; cautious on portfolio budgeting and biennial budgeting | Fear of reduced oversight |

#### Alternative Proposals

- 10% reduction in defense topline with reinvestment in diplomacy, climate, and domestic infrastructure
- Strict revolving door bans between Pentagon and defense industry
- Independent commission to identify $50+ billion in specific cuts

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives (on accountability and cuts), Centrists (on process reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Fiscal Conservatives (on waste reduction and audit)
- **Unlikely partners:** Defense Hawks

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Highly consistent anti-militarism; view defense budget as the primary obstacle to social investment |
| Principle consistency | Consistently vote against NDAA; consistently propose amendments to cut defense spending |
| Goalpost stability | Stable demand for deep cuts; clear alternative vision (social spending, climate investment) |
| Zero-sum behavior | Every dollar spent on defense is a dollar taken from healthcare, education, or climate |

**Justification:** Progressives are the most ideologically coherent critics of the defense budget. They view the military-industrial complex as fundamentally corrupt and believe that American security would be better served by diplomatic and economic investments than by military spending. Their consistency makes them reliable coalition partners on specific issues (audit enforcement) but unreliable on reforms that could make the Pentagon *more effective* (which they view as making war easier).

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus "People's Budget" consistently proposes $100+ billion in defense cuts
- Votes against NDAA by Reps. Barbara Lee, Pramila Jayapal, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
- Win Without War advocacy against defense topline increases

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement that the system is broken, wasteful, and unaccountable; disagree that the "pacing threat" justifies current spending |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Full agreement on iron triangle, defense industry influence, and political economy causes |

**Source references:**

- Win Without War policy positions
- Congressional Progressive Caucus "People's Budget"
- National Priorities Project budget analysis

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit Enforcement | 10/10 | Strong support; want to expose waste as a precursor to cuts | Defunding the Pentagon |
| Portfolio Budgeting | 2/10 | Oppose; gives Pentagon more flexibility to spend efficiently on war | Makes militarism more effective |
| Biennial Budgeting | 3/10 | Oppose; reduces opportunities for annual challenges to defense spending | Less frequent oversight hearings |
| Ending CRs | 4/10 | Mixed; CRs at least constrain spending growth | Prefer lower spending |
| Zero-Based Reviews | 9/10 | Strong support; want every program to justify its existence | Expose unnecessary programs |
| Financial System Modernization | 6/10 | Support transparency but not if it makes Pentagon more effective | Want accountability, not efficiency |
| Personnel Cost Management | 3/10 | Oppose cutting troop benefits; prefer cutting weapons and operations | Protect people, cut hardware |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defense Budget Accountability Act | 8/10 | Support audit enforcement and transparency; want harsher penalties | Want penalties to actually reduce spending |
| Defense Appropriations Reform Act | 3/10 | Oppose portfolio budgeting and biennial budgeting (reduce oversight); support OCO prohibition | Don't want to make Pentagon more agile |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Cut defense budget by $100-200 billion and redirect to healthcare, education, and climate
- Close overseas military bases
- Cancel nuclear modernization (Sentinel, Columbia-class)

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialists, Liberals (on accountability)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarians (on cuts and audit)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservatives, Centrists, Religious Right

---

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistently apply fiscal discipline and anti-statism to defense spending, unlike conservatives who exempt defense |
| Principle consistency | Treat the Pentagon as the largest government bureaucracy and apply the same skepticism as to any other agency |
| Goalpost stability | Stable demand for significant cuts, audit enforcement, and market-based reforms |
| Zero-sum behavior | Defense spending is government spending; all government spending is suspect |

**Justification:** Libertarians are the most philosophically consistent fiscal hawks on defense. They do not exempt the Pentagon from their general opposition to government spending, making them natural allies for audit enforcement and waste reduction. However, their opposition to government-directed industrial policy (like portfolio budgeting or supply chain mandates) limits their support for some reform proposals.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute defense budget analysis consistently advocates for significant spending reductions
- Reason Foundation reporting on Pentagon waste
- Taxpayers for Common Sense earmark and waste tracking

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement on waste, inefficiency, and lack of accountability; less focused on strategic threat assessment |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strong agreement on government monopoly, perverse incentives, and iron triangle; emphasize government failure rather than market failure |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute, "Defense Budget Analysis" series
- Reason Foundation
- Taxpayers for Common Sense

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit Enforcement | 10/10 | Strong support; centerpiece of fiscal accountability | Waste reduction; taxpayer protection |
| Portfolio Budgeting | 4/10 | Skeptical; reduces transparency and congressional control | Government discretion is inherently suspect |
| Biennial Budgeting | 6/10 | Moderate support for stability; prefer less spending to more stable spending | Fewer opportunities for oversight |
| Ending CRs | 5/10 | Mixed; CRs at least constrain spending growth | Prefer lower spending to more efficient spending |
| Zero-Based Reviews | 9/10 | Strong support; want massive cuts based on genuine review | Every program must prove its worth |
| Financial System Modernization | 7/10 | Support transparency; skeptical of large government IT programs | Want to know where money goes but wary of IT boondoggles |
| Personnel Cost Management | 7/10 | Support market-based compensation reform; reduce military footprint | Smaller government, including smaller military |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defense Budget Accountability Act | 9/10 | Strong support for audit enforcement and transparency | Fiscal accountability |
| Defense Appropriations Reform Act | 4/10 | Support OCO prohibition; oppose portfolio budgeting (executive discretion) and automatic CRs (reduce pressure to cut) | Don't want to make spending easier |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Audit the Pentagon and return savings to taxpayers through deficit reduction
- Reduce defense spending to 2% of GDP (homeland defense only)
- Privatize non-combat functions (base operations, logistics, maintenance)

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives (on cuts and audit), Fiscal Conservatives (on audit)
- **Potential bridges:** Constitutionalists (on congressional control)
- **Unlikely partners:** Defense Hawks, Centrists (who support the system)

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to congressional authority over military spending; sometimes aligns with defense hawks on substance |
| Principle consistency | Consistently defend Article I spending power; oppose delegation to executive branch |
| Goalpost stability | Stable commitment to congressional prerogatives; less stable on topline questions |
| Zero-sum behavior | Congressional power vs. executive flexibility |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists bring a unique perspective focused on the structural allocation of power between Congress and the Executive. They support audit enforcement (Congress's right to know where money goes) and strict line-item budgeting (Congress's right to direct spending) but oppose portfolio budgeting and expanded transfer authority (delegation of spending power to the Pentagon). Their positions are principled but can create strange bedfellows when they align with appropriators to protect line-item control.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional constitutionalist caucus emphasis on Article I, Section 8 and Section 9
- Opposition to executive reprogramming and transfer authority expansions
- Support for the Holman Rule and other mechanisms to enforce congressional spending control

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agree the system has problems but focus on constitutional structure rather than budget outcomes |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | View the root cause as congressional abdication of spending power to the executive, not the causes emphasized in this analysis |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society publications on Article I spending power
- Congressional constitutionalist caucus statements
- Scholarly analysis of the two-year appropriation clause

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit Enforcement | 8/10 | Support; Congress has a right to know how money is spent | Congressional oversight power |
| Portfolio Budgeting | 2/10 | Strongly oppose; unconstitutional delegation of spending power | Article I, Section 9 |
| Biennial Budgeting | 3/10 | Skeptical; may conflict with two-year Army appropriation clause | Constitutional fidelity |
| Ending CRs | 5/10 | Mixed; prefer Congress to do its job (pass appropriations) rather than automated mechanisms | Congressional responsibility |
| Zero-Based Reviews | 6/10 | Support if conducted by Congress, not the executive | Congressional prerogative |
| Financial System Modernization | 5/10 | Support transparency but skeptical of large executive branch programs | Executive overreach |
| Personnel Cost Management | 5/10 | No strong position; defer to congressional judgment | Not a constitutional issue |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defense Budget Accountability Act | 7/10 | Support audit enforcement and transparency; skeptical of carryover authority (executive discretion over spending timing) | Congressional spending control |
| Defense Appropriations Reform Act | 3/10 | Oppose portfolio budgeting and automatic CRs (delegation); skeptical of biennial budgeting (two-year clause) | Article I fidelity |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Strengthen line-item congressional control over defense spending
- Require annual appropriations with strict enforcement of the two-year Army clause
- Revive the Holman Rule to allow Congress to directly cut specific DoD positions and salaries

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarians (on congressional control), Appropriators (on line-item authority)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservatives (on constitutional principles)
- **Unlikely partners:** Centrists (who support executive flexibility), Progressives

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine anti-elite sentiment applied to Pentagon bureaucracy and defense contractors; sometimes inconsistent when defense spending benefits "heartland" communities |
| Principle consistency | Consistently skeptical of Pentagon waste and contractor profits; consistently supportive of "the troops" |
| Goalpost stability | Stable demand for accountability and Buy American; variable on topline (depends on threat framing) |
| Zero-sum behavior | Elites (Pentagon bureaucrats, defense contractors) vs. ordinary Americans (troops, taxpayers) |

**Justification:** Populists bring a distinctive "for the troops, against the brass" perspective to defense budget debates. They support a strong military but are deeply suspicious of how money is spent by Pentagon bureaucrats and defense contractors. Their support for audit enforcement, anti-waste measures, and "Buy American" mandates makes them natural allies on accountability reforms, though their skepticism of expertise and process reform limits their engagement with technical proposals like portfolio budgeting.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Populist criticism of $640 toilet seats and $7,600 coffee makers (recurring Pentagon waste narratives)
- Support for defense spending paired with hostility toward Pentagon leadership
- "Drain the swamp" rhetoric applied to defense bureaucracy

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement that the system is corrupt, wasteful, and serves elites rather than the troops or taxpayers |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree on iron triangle and elite capture; less interested in structural/institutional analysis |

**Source references:**

- Populist media coverage of Pentagon waste (Tucker Carlson, etc.)
- Congressional populist caucus positions on defense spending
- Public opinion polling on defense spending and waste

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit Enforcement | 9/10 | Strong support; expose the waste | Anti-corruption; taxpayer protection |
| Portfolio Budgeting | 4/10 | Skeptical; sounds like giving the elites more power | Distrust of Pentagon leadership |
| Biennial Budgeting | 5/10 | Indifferent; process reform is technocratic | Not a populist issue |
| Ending CRs | 7/10 | Support; CRs hurt the troops | Troop welfare |
| Zero-Based Reviews | 8/10 | Strong support; make the Pentagon justify every dollar | Anti-establishment |
| Financial System Modernization | 6/10 | Support the goal; skeptical of another expensive IT program | Wary of new boondoggles |
| Personnel Cost Management | 2/10 | Strongly oppose anything that looks like cutting troop pay or benefits | "Support the troops" ethos |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defense Budget Accountability Act | 8/10 | Strong support for audit enforcement; love the transparency dashboard | Anti-corruption; public accountability |
| Defense Appropriations Reform Act | 5/10 | Support OCO prohibition and ending CRs; skeptical of portfolio budgeting (elite empowerment) | Distrust of technocratic reforms |

#### Alternative Proposals

- "Audit the Pentagon" as a standalone, high-profile campaign
- Fire senior Pentagon officials who fail audits
- Redirect savings from waste to troop pay and veterans' benefits

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (on strong military), Libertarians (on audit)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressives (on anti-corruption), Liberals (on waste reduction)
- **Unlikely partners:** Centrists (seen as part of the establishment)

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to evidence-based reform and process improvement |
| Principle consistency | Consistently support bipartisan, incremental reform over ideological purity |
| Goalpost stability | Stable commitment to process reform, portfolio budgeting, and PPBE modernization |
| Zero-sum behavior | Process vs. ideology; pragmatism vs. purity |

**Justification:** Centrists are the natural home for defense budget *process* reform. They are not primarily motivated by cutting or increasing the topline but by making whatever amount is spent more effective. They champion the PPBE Commission recommendations, portfolio budgeting, biennial budgeting, and other technocratic reforms. Their consistency is high because their positions are driven by evidence and expert consensus rather than political ideology, but their lack of a passionate constituency limits their political power.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- CSIS defense budget analysis (centrist, evidence-based)
- PPBE Reform Commission composition and recommendations (bipartisan, technocratic)
- Bipartisan Policy Center defense budget publications

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with the analysis of budget process dysfunction, audit failures, and misallocation |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strong agreement on structural, institutional, and political economy causes |

**Source references:**

- Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) defense budget analysis
- PPBE Reform Commission final report (March 2024)
- Bipartisan Policy Center defense publications

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit Enforcement | 7/10 | Support; necessary but not sufficient | Want enforcement paired with IT investment |
| Portfolio Budgeting | 10/10 | Centerpiece reform; PPBE Commission recommendation | Agility; strategy-budget alignment |
| Biennial Budgeting | 9/10 | Strong support; improves stability and planning | Stability for programs and industry |
| Ending CRs | 9/10 | Strong support; CRs are the most damaging budget dysfunction | Readiness and modernization |
| Zero-Based Reviews | 6/10 | Support in principle; cautious about implementation burden | Disruption to ongoing operations |
| Financial System Modernization | 9/10 | Foundational reform; enables everything else | Technical precondition for accountability |
| Personnel Cost Management | 6/10 | Support data-driven reform; sensitive to political risk | Long-term fiscal sustainability |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defense Budget Accountability Act | 9/10 | Strong support for all provisions | Core reform agenda |
| Defense Appropriations Reform Act | 10/10 | Strong support; this IS their agenda | Process modernization |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Full implementation of PPBE Commission recommendations
- Establish a permanent DoD Management Reform Office with independent authority
- Annual "Budget-Strategy Alignment Report" published by CBO and GAO

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberals (on oversight), Moderate Conservatives (on efficiency)
- **Potential bridges:** Populists (on waste reduction), Defense industry (on stability)
- **Unlikely partners:** Constitutionalists (oppose flexibility), Progressives (oppose efficiency)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine belief in strong defense as moral obligation; concern for troops and families is principled |
| Principle consistency | Consistently support military strength and troop welfare; less engaged on budget process details |
| Goalpost stability | Stable support for strong defense; focus on cultural issues within the military (DEI, transgender policy) more than budget technicalities |
| Zero-sum behavior | Good vs. evil framing of defense; cultural issues dominate budget concerns |

**Justification:** The Religious Right supports a strong military as part of a broader worldview that emphasizes American moral leadership, support for Israel, and defense of "Western civilization." They are less engaged on the technical details of budget process reform than on cultural issues within the military. Their support for defense spending is reliable but not driven by strategic analysis or fiscal concern.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Family Research Council defense publications
- Christian Broadcasting Network coverage of military issues
- Congressional caucus positions linking defense spending to values

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agree the military needs more resources; less focused on waste and process dysfunction; more concerned about "woke" military policies |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Focus on cultural rot and leadership failures rather than structural or political economy causes |

**Source references:**

- Family Research Council military policy publications
- Heritage Foundation (social/cultural dimension of military policy)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit Enforcement | 6/10 | Support accountability as stewardship principle | Biblical stewardship; responsible use of resources |
| Portfolio Budgeting | 5/10 | Indifferent; technical issue outside core concerns | Not a values issue |
| Biennial Budgeting | 5/10 | Indifferent | Not a values issue |
| Ending CRs | 7/10 | Support; CRs hurt military families and readiness | Troop and family welfare |
| Zero-Based Reviews | 4/10 | Cautious; fear reviews could target chaplain programs or religious liberty protections | Cultural priorities |
| Financial System Modernization | 5/10 | Support good stewardship; not a priority | Stewardship principle |
| Personnel Cost Management | 2/10 | Oppose; military families are already stretched thin | Family values; troop welfare |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defense Budget Accountability Act | 6/10 | Support stewardship provisions; neutral on technical details | Biblical stewardship |
| Defense Appropriations Reform Act | 5/10 | Support ending CRs; indifferent on process reform | Family stability |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Increase military family support funding (childcare, housing, spouse employment)
- Protect chaplain programs and religious liberty in any budget reform
- Eliminate DEI programs and redirect funds to readiness

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives, Populists (on strong military and troop support)
- **Potential bridges:** None on budget process issues
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives, Democratic Socialists

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent anti-imperialism and opposition to the military-industrial complex |
| Principle consistency | Consistently oppose NDAA; consistently propose radical cuts and conversion |
| Goalpost stability | Stable demand for 50%+ cuts and defense industrial conversion |
| Zero-sum behavior | Military spending vs. social good; imperialism vs. human needs |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists view the defense budget as the financial engine of American imperialism and corporate enrichment. They want not just to cut the budget but to fundamentally transform the defense-industrial relationship, including nationalizing defense companies and converting military production to civilian purposes. Their consistency is high because their positions flow directly from deeply held ideological commitments.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- DSA International Committee position on defense spending
- Jacobin magazine defense budget analysis
- In These Times coverage of military-industrial complex

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement that the system is corrupt and unaccountable; disagree that "threats" justify current spending (view U.S. as the primary global military threat) |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Full agreement on iron triangle, defense industry capture, and political economy causes; add capitalism as the ultimate root cause |

**Source references:**

- Jacobin defense budget analysis
- DSA International Committee statements
- In These Times military-industrial complex reporting

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Audit Enforcement | 10/10 | Strong support; expose corruption to build case for cuts | Defunding; anti-corruption |
| Portfolio Budgeting | 1/10 | Oppose; makes the war machine more efficient | Efficiency enables imperialism |
| Biennial Budgeting | 2/10 | Oppose; reduces opportunities to challenge spending | Fewer chances to cut |
| Ending CRs | 3/10 | Mixed; CRs at least constrain spending | Lower spending preferable |
| Zero-Based Reviews | 9/10 | Strong support; expose unnecessary programs | Build case for radical cuts |
| Financial System Modernization | 4/10 | Support transparency; oppose making Pentagon more effective | Transparency good; efficiency bad |
| Personnel Cost Management | 3/10 | Protect enlisted; cut officer corps and civilian leadership | Class-based analysis |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|---|---|---|---|
| Defense Budget Accountability Act | 8/10 | Support audit enforcement; want harsher penalties (10%+ withholds) | Want penalties to actually defund |
| Defense Appropriations Reform Act | 2/10 | Oppose portfolio budgeting, biennial budgeting (make Pentagon more effective); support only OCO prohibition | Don't improve the war machine |

#### Alternative Proposals

### Common Ground Synthesis

| **Biennial Budgeting** | Con, Libt, Cent | Lib, Pop, RelR | Prog, Const, DemSoc |
| **Personnel Cost Management** | Libt, Cent | Const | Con, Lib, Prog, Pop, RelR, DemSoc |

**Key insight:** Audit enforcement is the only truly universal reform, commanding support across all nine perspectives. Zero-based reviews have the second-broadest coalition. Portfolio budgeting and biennial budgeting -- the technocratic centerpiece of process reform -- have the narrowest support base, uniting only centrists and (selectively) conservatives. Personnel cost management is politically radioactive across almost all perspectives.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: The "Audit the Pentagon" Act

**Bridges:** Progressive + Libertarian + Populist + Liberal + Conservative (Fiscal Hawks)

**Core Agreement:** The Pentagon has failed every audit for 30+ years. This is unacceptable regardless of whether you want to spend more or less on defense.

**Policy Description:**

Enacts the **Defense Budget Accountability Act** (audit enforcement with escalating penalties, transparency dashboard, financial system modernization fund) as a standalone bill, stripped of any provisions that could be characterized as "making the Pentagon more efficient" (which progressives oppose) or "cutting the topline" (which conservatives oppose).

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|---|---|---|
| Progressive | Exposes waste; builds the case for future cuts |
| Libertarian | Fiscal accountability; taxpayer protection |
| Populist | Anti-corruption; anti-elite accountability |
| Liberal | Oversight; waste reduction |
| Conservative (Fiscal) | Fiscal discipline; stewardship |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|---|---|
| Progressive | Accepts audit reform without topline cuts (for now) |
| Libertarian | Accepts continued high defense spending while audit is enforced |
| Populist | Accepts technocratic reform mechanisms (IT modernization) |
| Liberal | Accepts incremental approach rather than comprehensive reform |
| Conservative (Fiscal) | Accepts risk of budget withholds for military components |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (potentially 6/9 with Religious Right on stewardship)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Very high; audit is a motherhood-and-apple-pie issue
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone bill or NDAA amendment; could attract 70+ Senate votes

### Compromise 2: The "Defense Stability" Pact

**Bridges:** Conservative + Centrist + Liberal + Populist

**Core Agreement:** Continuing resolutions are the most damaging budget dysfunction. They hurt readiness, waste money, and disrupt the defense industrial base. We should stop using defense as a hostage in unrelated political disputes.

**Policy Description:**

Enacts the automatic continuing funding provisions and OCO prohibition from the **Defense Appropriations Reform Act**, paired with enhanced congressional oversight mechanisms (quarterly reports, second-year oversight hearings). Does NOT include portfolio budgeting or biennial budgeting, which are the most contentious provisions.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|---|---|
| Conservative | Protects military readiness from CR damage; ends OCO gimmick |
| Centrist | Addresses the most damaging process dysfunction; creates stable planning |
| Liberal | Ends OCO slush fund; maintains oversight through reporting requirements |
| Populist | Protects the troops from budget games; ends elite budget tricks (OCO) |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|---|---|
| Conservative | Accepts that defense cannot be used as leverage in budget negotiations |
| Centrist | Delays portfolio budgeting and biennial budgeting for a future bill |
| Liberal | Accepts automatic funding that makes defense cuts harder |
| Populist | Accepts technocratic mechanism rather than populist accountability measures |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives (the governing center)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High; anti-CR sentiment is genuinely bipartisan
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone bill or omnibus attachment

### Compromise 3: The "Accountable Modernization" Deal

**Bridges:** Centrist + Conservative + Liberal

**Core Agreement:** We can modernize the budget process AND enforce accountability if we pair portfolio budgeting with strict audit requirements.

**Policy Description:**

Enacts both the **Defense Budget Accountability Act** and the full **Defense Appropriations Reform Act** as a comprehensive package, with the understanding that accountability measures (audit enforcement) are the price for flexibility measures (portfolio budgeting, biennial budgeting). This is the most ambitious compromise but also the most transformative.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|---|---|
| Centrist | Gets the full PPBE Commission reform agenda: portfolio budgeting, biennial budgeting, process modernization |
| Conservative | Gets defense planning stability, military flexibility, and modernization agility |
| Liberal | Gets the strongest audit enforcement, transparency, and oversight mechanisms |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|---|---|
| Centrist | Accepts that reforms must be paired with accountability (not just efficiency) |
| Conservative | Accepts audit penalties that could reduce military spending for noncompliant components |
| Liberal | Accepts portfolio budgeting that gives the Pentagon more flexibility |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 3/9 perspectives (but the governing majority)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 2/3 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High if early results demonstrate success; vulnerable if audit penalties bite during a security crisis
- **Implementation Path:** NDAA package (requires leadership buy-in from both armed services and appropriations committees)

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The **"Audit the Pentagon" coalition** (Compromise 1) is the most politically viable because it commands the broadest support across the ideological spectrum. Audit enforcement is the one reform that progressives, libertarians, populists, liberals, and fiscal conservatives can all support without compromising their core principles. It should be pursued first as a foundation for more ambitious reforms.

### Second Priority

The **"Defense Stability" pact** (Compromise 2) addresses the most operationally damaging dysfunction (continuing resolutions) and has strong support from the center-right to center-left. It should be pursued concurrently with or immediately after audit reform.

### Long-Term Goal

The **"Accountable Modernization" deal** (Compromise 3) represents the comprehensive reform vision but requires demonstrated success from Compromises 1 and 2 to build the political capital needed for portfolio budgeting and biennial budgeting.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Appropriations committee power**: The single greatest obstacle to defense budget reform is the appropriations subcommittees' attachment to line-item control. Portfolio budgeting directly threatens their institutional power, and no reform package will succeed without their acquiescence or circumvention.
2. **Attention scarcity**: Defense budget process reform is technical and boring relative to the culture-war issues (DEI, transgender policy) that dominate defense debates. Reformers must find ways to make budget process reform politically salient.
3. **Audit difficulty**: The DoD may genuinely not be able to pass a clean audit by any reasonable deadline given the state of its IT systems. Setting unrealistic deadlines and then imposing punitive penalties could create a backlash that undermines the entire reform agenda.

### Low Consistency Partners

**Conservatives** are the key swing vote. They talk about fiscal discipline but regularly vote for defense spending increases without accountability conditions. To keep them in the audit enforcement coalition, frame it as "getting more lethality per dollar" rather than "cutting waste." The Freedom Caucus wing can be engaged on fiscal grounds; the defense hawk wing must be reassured that audit penalties will not "hollow the force."

### Recommended Sequencing

1. **First**: Pass standalone audit enforcement legislation ("Audit the Pentagon Act") to establish the principle of financial accountability and build the universal coalition
2. **Second**: End the CR cycle through automatic continuing funding, paired with OCO prohibition, to address the most operationally damaging dysfunction
3. **Third**: Launch portfolio budgeting pilots, demonstrating results before seeking full expansion
4. **Fourth**: Enact biennial budgeting once the piloted portfolio approach has gained credibility and congressional buy-in
5. **Ongoing**: Fund and execute financial system modernization throughout all phases as the technical foundation for everything else
