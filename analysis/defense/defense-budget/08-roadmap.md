# Defense Budget: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Reforming the defense budget requires a phased approach that builds political support incrementally, demonstrates results early to sustain momentum, and sequences reforms so that foundational changes enable more ambitious ones. The roadmap below organizes reforms into three phases, recognizing that some changes can be achieved through administrative action while others require legislation, and that political windows for major reform are unpredictable and must be seized when they arise.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-3)

### Objectives

- Establish audit enforcement with real consequences
- Implement quick-win financial management reforms
- Launch PPBE reform pilots
- End the continuing resolution cycle for defense

### Key Actions

| Action | Timeline | Lead Actor | Legislative Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enact audit enforcement with escalating penalties | Year 1 NDAA | Congress (HASC/SASC) | Yes - NDAA provision |
| Fund audit remediation and IT modernization | Year 1 Appropriations | Congress (HAC-D/SAC-D) | Yes - appropriations |
| Launch 2-3 portfolio budgeting pilots | Year 1-2 | DoD Comptroller | Administrative (NDAA authorization helpful) |
| Enact automatic CR provision for defense | Year 1-2 | Congress | Yes - standalone or NDAA |
| Repeal "use it or lose it" for O&M (5% carryover authority) | Year 1 NDAA | Congress | Yes - NDAA provision |
| Publish component-level audit scorecards | Year 1 | DoD OIG | Administrative |
| Establish DoD Financial Systems Modernization Fund | Year 1-2 | Congress | Yes - authorization + appropriation |
| Begin zero-based review of defense agencies | Year 2-3 | Secretary of Defense | Administrative |

### Phase 1 Success Criteria

| Metric | Baseline (FY2024) | Target (End of Phase 1) |
|---|---|---|
| Components passing audit | 8 of 28 | 14 of 28 |
| Unsupported accounting adjustments | $3.8 trillion | Reduce by 25% |
| Legacy financial systems | ~2,400 | Begin consolidation plan |
| Portfolio budget pilots | 0 | 2-3 active pilots |
| Months under CR (annual average) | 4-6 | 0 (if automatic CR enacted) |
| End-of-year spending spike (Q4 vs. average) | +35% | +20% (with carryover authority) |

## Phase 2: Building Momentum (Years 3-6)

### Objectives

- Expand portfolio budgeting based on pilot results
- Achieve clean audits across a majority of DoD components
- Implement biennial budgeting for defense
- Modernize financial IT systems
- Conduct first comprehensive zero-based review

### Key Actions

| Action | Timeline | Lead Actor | Legislative Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Expand portfolio budgeting from pilots to all major mission areas | Year 3-4 | DoD Comptroller / Congress | Yes - NDAA authorization |
| Increase audit enforcement penalties for non-compliant components | Year 3 | Congress | Yes - NDAA amendment |
| Enact biennial defense budgeting | Year 4 NDAA | Congress | Yes - NDAA + Budget Act amendment |
| Complete first zero-based strategic review | Year 3-4 | Independent review panel | Yes - enabling legislation |
| Sunset at least 500 legacy financial systems | Year 3-6 | DoD CIO | Administrative (with funded mandate) |
| Implement BRAC-style commission for defense agencies | Year 4-5 | Congress | Yes - standalone legislation |
| Codify OCO elimination permanently | Year 3 | Congress | Yes - standalone or NDAA |
| Establish portfolio oversight procedures for appropriations committees | Year 3-4 | Congress (rules changes) | Internal congressional reform |

### Phase 2 Success Criteria

| Metric | Phase 1 End | Target (End of Phase 2) |
|---|---|---|
| Components passing audit | 14 of 28 | 22 of 28 |
| Budget organized by portfolio | 2-3 pilots | All major mission areas |
| Financial systems | Plan initiated | 1,500 (from 2,400) |
| Biennial budgeting | Not enacted | Enacted; first 2-year cycle complete |
| Zero-based review | Initiated | First review completed with recommendations |
| Fourth-quarter spending spike | +20% | +10% |

## Phase 3: Major Reform (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Full transition to Strategy-Driven Resource Allocation (SDRA)
- Achieve and sustain clean audit across all DoD components
- Complete financial system modernization
- Institutionalize periodic strategic reviews
- Achieve measurable improvement in budget-to-strategy alignment

### Key Actions

| Action | Timeline | Lead Actor | Legislative Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Complete SDRA transition | Year 6-7 | DoD / OMB / Congress | Yes - comprehensive legislation |
| Achieve enterprise-wide clean audit opinion | Year 7-8 | DoD Comptroller / OIG | No (if enforcement mechanisms work) |
| Complete legacy system sunset | Year 8-10 | DoD CIO | Administrative |
| Institutionalize 4-year zero-based reviews | Year 6+ | Congress / Independent commission | Yes - permanent enabling legislation |
| Implement cross-service consolidation recommendations | Year 7-10 | Secretary of Defense | Administrative (with congressional support) |
| Evaluate and adjust audit penalties | Year 8 | Congress | Yes - reauthorization |
| Publish annual "Budget-Strategy Alignment Report" | Year 6+ | CBO/GAO | Administrative (with congressional request) |

### Phase 3 Success Criteria

| Metric | Phase 2 End | Target (End of Phase 3) |
|---|---|---|
| Components passing audit | 22 of 28 | 28 of 28 (enterprise-wide clean opinion) |
| Budget format | Portfolio for major areas | Full SDRA |
| Financial systems | 1,500 | <500 interoperable systems |
| CR frequency | Rare (if automatic CR in place) | Zero (biennial budgeting + automatic CR) |
| Strategic review cycle | First completed | Second review completed; process institutionalized |
| Defense budget-to-NDS alignment (independent assessment) | Moderate | High (as assessed by GAO/CBO) |

## Risk Mitigation

### Political Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Congressional opposition to portfolio budgeting | High | High | Start with limited pilots; demonstrate results before seeking expansion; include robust reporting mechanisms |
| Appropriators block biennial budgeting | High | Medium | Pair with enhanced oversight powers in the off-year; demonstrate that biennial budgeting improves (not reduces) oversight quality |
| New crisis diverts attention from reform | Medium | High | Build reform into NDAA (automatic vehicle) rather than relying on standalone legislation; make reforms self-executing |
| Change of administration reverses administrative reforms | Medium | Medium | Codify reforms in statute where possible; make reforms bipartisan from the start |
| Defense industry lobbying against transparency measures | High | Medium | Frame reforms as "improving warfighter outcomes"; enlist new-entrant firms as reform allies |

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| IT modernization cost overruns | High | Medium | Use commercial cloud and ERP solutions rather than custom development; implement in modules |
| Audit remains technically infeasible at DoD scale | Medium | High | Fund independent technical assessment of audit barriers; consider phased audit opinions by account type |
| Portfolio budgeting reduces transparency | Medium | Medium | Require detailed quarterly reporting; maintain program-level data within portfolios |
| Data migration from legacy systems fails | Medium | High | Run parallel systems during transition; maintain fallback capability |

### Institutional Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Services game portfolio system to protect preferred programs | High | Medium | Require portfolio managers to be joint (not single-service) officials; external oversight by GAO |
| Reform fatigue (another failed attempt) | Medium | High | Demonstrate early wins (audit scorecards, carryover savings); publicize results |
| Workforce lacks skills for new processes | Medium | Medium | Invest in retraining; recruit financial talent from private sector |

## Dependencies and Sequencing

The reforms are interdependent. The following sequencing logic is critical:

1. **Audit enforcement must come first**: Without the ability to track money, portfolio budgeting and zero-based reviews are impossible because decision-makers lack reliable data on current spending
2. **IT modernization enables auditing**: Clean audits require interoperable financial systems; therefore, IT investment must be funded early even though results take years
3. **Pilots precede full implementation**: Portfolio budgeting pilots must demonstrate results before Congress will accept a full transition, which is why Phase 1 launches pilots and Phase 2 expands them
4. **Automatic CRs enable biennial budgeting**: Biennial budgeting is only viable if there is a fallback mechanism (automatic CR) that prevents government shutdowns during the longer appropriations cycle
5. **Zero-based reviews require audit data**: A meaningful zero-based review requires knowing what is currently being spent and on what, which loops back to audit and financial system requirements

## Political Strategy

### Coalition Building

- **Phase 1 coalition**: Fiscal conservatives + progressives + good-government groups (united on audit enforcement); defense modernizers (united on PPBE pilots)
- **Phase 2 coalition**: Add centrist reformers and new-entrant defense firms (portfolio budgeting benefits non-traditional companies); defense think tanks provide intellectual cover
- **Phase 3 coalition**: Institutional momentum from demonstrated success; broad bipartisan support if early phases deliver measurable results

### Messaging

- **To defense hawks**: "Reform makes the military more lethal, not less funded. Every dollar saved from waste is a dollar available for warfighting."
- **To fiscal conservatives**: "The Pentagon cannot account for where $850 billion per year goes. Audit enforcement is the bare minimum of fiscal responsibility."
- **To progressives**: "Accountability before appropriations. No more blank checks for a department that has never passed an audit."
- **To the defense industry**: "Predictable, multi-year funding and streamlined processes benefit industry. Portfolio budgeting reduces bureaucratic overhead for everyone."
