# Defense Budget: Citizen Actions

## Overview

The defense budget is often perceived as too technical or too politically entrenched for ordinary citizens to influence. This perception is understandable but incorrect. Congressional defense budget decisions are ultimately responsive to constituent pressure, particularly when that pressure is informed, specific, and sustained. The following actions are organized by level of engagement, from individual education to organized political advocacy.

## Individual Actions

### Educate Yourself

- **Read the DoD Budget Overview**: The DoD Comptroller publishes an accessible overview of the annual budget request. Understanding the basic structure (MILPERS, O&M, Procurement, RDT&E, MILCON) is the foundation for informed engagement
- **Follow CBO and GAO reports**: Both agencies produce nonpartisan analysis in accessible language. CBO's "Long-Term Implications of the Future Years Defense Program" and GAO's annual weapon systems assessment are particularly valuable
- **Understand the NDAA**: The National Defense Authorization Act is the primary legislative vehicle for defense policy. Track its progress through Congress using congress.gov
- **Learn your district's defense footprint**: Identify military installations, defense contractors, and defense-related employment in your congressional district using USASpending.gov and DoD base listings

### Engage Your Representatives

- **Contact your members of Congress**: Constituent communication -- especially on specific issues like audit enforcement, CR impacts, or particular programs -- is tracked and tallied by congressional offices. Phone calls and personalized letters carry more weight than form emails
- **Attend town halls**: Ask your representatives specific questions about defense budget priorities. "Do you support imposing penalties on the DoD for failing its audit?" is more effective than general statements about spending
- **Submit written testimony**: Many congressional committees accept written public testimony during authorization and appropriations markups. HASC and SASC occasionally hold public input sessions
- **Use the appropriations process**: The defense appropriations subcommittees are among the most powerful in Congress. Identify your representatives' committee assignments and focus engagement where it has the most leverage

### Stay Informed

- **Track the federal budget calendar**: Know when the President's budget is submitted (February), when committee markups occur (spring-summer), and when the fiscal year starts (October 1). Budget decisions are made on a schedule, and engagement is most effective when timed to the decision cycle
- **Monitor audit progress**: The DoD OIG publishes annual audit results. Track whether components are improving, stagnating, or regressing
- **Follow defense trade media**: Defense News, Breaking Defense, and Military Times provide accessible coverage of budget issues that mainstream media often ignores

## Community Actions

### Local Advocacy

- **Organize budget literacy workshops**: Partner with local libraries, civic organizations, or veterans' groups to host sessions explaining the defense budget and its local impact
- **Engage local media**: Write letters to the editor or op-eds connecting defense budget issues to local concerns (e.g., the impact of CRs on a local military installation, the audit status of a local defense agency)
- **Connect with military-community organizations**: Military installations often have community liaison offices; build relationships that create two-way communication about budget impacts

### Coalition Building

- **Cross-partisan coalitions**: Defense budget reform is one of the few issues where progressive, libertarian, and fiscal conservative organizations share common ground. Build coalitions around specific reforms (audit enforcement, waste reduction) rather than topline debates
- **Veterans as advocates**: Veterans bring credibility and moral authority to defense budget discussions. Organizations like Vietnam Veterans of America, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), and the Truman National Security Project engage veterans in policy advocacy
- **Academic partnerships**: University programs in public policy, national security, and public administration can provide analytical support for community advocacy efforts

## Political Actions

### Electoral Engagement

- **Evaluate candidates on defense budget positions**: During election seasons, ask candidates specific questions about defense spending priorities, audit enforcement, and budget process reform. Compile and publicize their answers
- **Support reform-minded candidates**: Identify and support candidates who prioritize fiscal accountability in defense spending, regardless of whether they favor higher or lower toplines
- **Engage in primaries**: Primary elections often determine the most consequential choices for congressional seats; candidates who win primaries with reform agendas carry those commitments into office

### Direct Advocacy

- **Support organizations working on defense budget reform**: Organizations like POGO, Taxpayers for Common Sense, and the National Priorities Project conduct sustained advocacy on defense budget issues and amplify individual voices
- **Participate in "Audit the Pentagon" campaigns**: Several organizations have organized campaigns specifically around DoD audit accountability; joining these efforts adds to their political weight
- **Engage with the NDAA process**: The annual NDAA is the most important defense legislation. Track amendments, contact your representatives about specific provisions, and submit public comments during the legislative process

### Policy Entrepreneurship

- **Develop and promote specific reform proposals**: Citizens with policy expertise can draft and circulate reform proposals, working with think tanks, congressional staff, or advocacy organizations to build support
- **Testify before Congress**: Congressional committees occasionally invite members of the public, including subject-matter experts, veterans, and affected citizens, to testify on defense budget issues
- **Run for office**: The most direct way to influence defense budget decisions is to serve on the committees that make them. Citizens with defense budget expertise are underrepresented in Congress
