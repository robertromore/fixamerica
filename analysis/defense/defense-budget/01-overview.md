# Defense Budget: Overview

## Overview

The United States defense budget is the single largest category of federal discretionary spending, consuming roughly half of all discretionary appropriations each year. For fiscal year 2025, the Department of Defense requested approximately $849.8 billion in discretionary budget authority, with the total national defense budget function (Function 050, which includes Department of Energy nuclear weapons programs and other defense-related activities) exceeding $895 billion. This level of spending -- more than the next ten nations combined -- reflects both the scale of America's global military commitments and the political economy of defense spending that has grown largely independent of any coherent strategy-to-budget linkage.

The defense budget is not a single number but rather a complex architecture of appropriation titles, funding accounts, and budget activities spread across the military departments (Army, Navy, Air Force), defense agencies (DARPA, DISA, DLA, MDA), and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Resources flow through five major appropriation categories -- Military Personnel, Operations and Maintenance, Procurement, Research Development Test and Evaluation, and Military Construction -- each with distinct rules governing obligation periods, transfer authorities, and reprogramming flexibility. Understanding how money moves through this system is essential to understanding why reform is so difficult.

Despite its enormous size, the defense budget faces persistent structural challenges: the Department of Defense has never passed a comprehensive financial audit since audits were first required by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990; Congress routinely funds the military through continuing resolutions rather than on-time appropriations; and the allocation of resources across services and mission areas is driven as much by institutional inertia and political geography as by strategic analysis. These challenges mean that even as the topline grows, there is no assurance that money is being spent where it matters most or that taxpayers are getting value for their investment.

## Scope

This analysis covers the following dimensions of defense budgeting:

- **Budget toplines and trends**: Overall DoD spending levels, defense as a share of GDP and the federal budget, and historical spending trajectories
- **Budget composition**: How resources are allocated across the five major appropriation titles (MILPERS, O&M, Procurement, RDT&E, MILCON)
- **Service budgets**: Resource distribution among the Army, Navy/Marine Corps, Air Force, Space Force, and defense-wide agencies
- **The appropriations process**: The Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) system, the NDAA, defense appropriations bills, and the role of CRs
- **Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO)**: The use and misuse of OCO as a budget mechanism
- **Financial accountability**: DoD audit failures, accounting system deficiencies, and financial management reform
- **Budget debates**: Arguments over spending adequacy, readiness-modernization tradeoffs, and strategic priorities
- **Sequestration and budget caps**: The Budget Control Act era and its aftermath

**Note**: Acquisition and procurement processes are covered in [Budget and Procurement](../budget-and-procurement/01-overview.md). Defense contractor influence and industrial base consolidation are covered in [Military-Industrial Complex](../military-industrial-complex/01-overview.md).

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Spending adequacy vs. fiscal discipline**: Hawks argue the budget is too small relative to the threat from China and Russia; fiscal conservatives and progressives argue that waste and misallocation mean throwing more money at a broken system will not improve outcomes
- **Readiness vs. modernization**: Operations and Maintenance (current readiness) consumes 40% of the budget, leaving less for Research and Development and Procurement (future capability); prioritizing one inevitably degrades the other absent topline growth
- **Strategy-driven budgets vs. budget-driven strategy**: In theory, the National Defense Strategy should drive resource allocation; in practice, budget constraints often dictate what the strategy can aspire to accomplish
- **Congressional oversight vs. executive flexibility**: Line-item budgeting gives Congress granular control but reduces DoD's ability to shift resources quickly; portfolio budgeting would grant flexibility but surrender congressional leverage
- **Topline debates vs. composition debates**: Political attention focuses on whether the budget goes up or down, while the more consequential question -- whether resources are allocated correctly within the budget -- receives far less scrutiny
- **Base budget vs. OCO/supplementals**: The use of Overseas Contingency Operations funding as a "slush fund" to circumvent budget caps obscured the true cost of military operations and enabled spending that could not survive normal scrutiny
- **Annual budgeting vs. long-term planning**: The one-year appropriation cycle is mismatched with multi-year and multi-decade weapon programs, creating instability, inefficiency, and the perverse incentive to spend all funds before the fiscal year ends

## Key Questions

1. Is the current level of defense spending adequate for the strategic challenges the United States faces, or would the same security objectives be achievable at lower cost with better allocation?
2. Why has the Department of Defense failed every comprehensive financial audit since they were first required over three decades ago, and what would it take to achieve a clean opinion?
3. How should resources be balanced between current readiness (personnel, operations, maintenance) and future modernization (R&D, procurement) in an era of great power competition?
4. What structural reforms to the PPBE process and congressional appropriations cycle would most improve the alignment between strategy, budgets, and outcomes?
5. How can the defense budget be insulated from the dysfunction of the broader federal appropriations process, including chronic continuing resolutions and government shutdowns?
6. To what extent does the geographic distribution of defense spending -- bases, depots, production facilities in specific congressional districts -- distort budget priorities away from strategic needs?

## Vision of Success

A well-functioning defense budget system would:

- **Align resources with strategy**: Budget decisions would flow directly from an honest assessment of threats, priorities, and acceptable risks, rather than from institutional inertia or political logrolling
- **Pass a clean financial audit**: The Department of Defense would achieve and sustain an unmodified audit opinion, demonstrating that it can account for where taxpayer money goes
- **Receive on-time appropriations**: Congress would consistently enact defense appropriations before the start of the fiscal year, ending the corrosive cycle of continuing resolutions
- **Optimize composition, not just topline**: Public debate would focus as much on the allocation of resources within the budget as on the total amount
- **Incentivize efficiency**: Budget rules would reward components that save money and innovate, rather than punishing them by reducing their next-year allocation
- **Provide stability and predictability**: Multi-year budgeting and planning horizons would enable the military services and defense industry to make rational long-term investments
- **Maintain democratic accountability**: Congress would retain meaningful oversight over how defense dollars are spent, while granting sufficient flexibility for effective management
