# Defense Budget: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming the defense budget requires addressing multiple interdependent problems: the obsolete PPBE process, chronic audit failures, the appropriations dysfunction that produces continuing resolutions, misaligned incentives within the services and Congress, and the opacity of a system that cannot account for where $850 billion per year actually goes. The solutions presented here range from politically achievable incremental reforms to structural changes that would require sustained political will. Each is evaluated for its evidence base, implementation challenges, and likelihood of adoption.

## Solution 1: Achieve and Enforce Clean Financial Audits

### Description

Establish binding deadlines for DoD components to achieve clean (unmodified) audit opinions, with automatic, escalating budgetary penalties for failure. The current system imposes no meaningful consequences for audit failure, which is why the DoD has failed every audit for over 30 years despite a statutory requirement since 1990.

### Key Elements

- Set a hard deadline (e.g., FY2028) for each military department and defense agency to achieve a clean audit opinion
- Impose automatic budget withholds (starting at 1% of O&M, escalating 0.5% per year to a maximum of 5%) for components that fail
- Provide partial credit for demonstrated measurable progress (e.g., reducing material weaknesses) to avoid perverse incentives to abandon reform efforts
- Fund audit remediation and IT system modernization as a dedicated investment
- Require senior leaders (Service Secretaries, agency directors) to certify audit progress annually to Congress

### Evidence

- **The threat of consequences works**: The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) received a modified audit opinion in FY2021, partly because it was the first entity to face meaningful leadership accountability for audit progress
- **State-level precedents**: All 50 states achieve annual financial audits, as do most large private corporations. The DoD's claim that its complexity makes auditing impossible is contradicted by the fact that entities of comparable complexity (e.g., multinational corporations, the entire Medicare program) are audited successfully
- **GAO recommendations**: GAO has repeatedly recommended that Congress impose consequences for audit failure (GAO-23-105536), noting that the absence of penalties is a primary reason for lack of progress
- **PPBE Commission**: The 2024 PPBE Reform Commission recommended financial accountability measures as foundational to budget process reform

### Challenges

- **Technical barriers**: The DoD's 2,400+ legacy financial systems genuinely cannot produce auditable data without major IT investment. Penalties must be paired with investment
- **"Hollowing" objection**: Critics argue that withholding O&M funds degrades readiness. Response: withholds can be redirected to audit remediation within the same component, not removed from defense entirely
- **Scale**: The DoD manages $3.8 trillion in assets across global operations; achieving a clean opinion at this scale is genuinely unprecedented for a government entity
- **Cultural resistance**: Financial management is not valued in military career paths; changing this requires both incentives and leadership commitment

## Solution 2: PPBE Reform and Portfolio Budgeting

### Description

Replace the 1960s-era PPBE process with a Strategy-Driven Resource Allocation (SDRA) framework that organizes budgets around capability portfolios (e.g., "Indo-Pacific Deterrence," "Nuclear Enterprise," "Cyber and Space") rather than service-specific line items. This recommendation is the centerpiece of the 2024 PPBE Reform Commission report.

### Key Elements

- Organize budget requests by mission-area portfolios rather than by individual programs
- Grant program managers authority to transfer up to 15-20% of funds between projects within a portfolio, subject to quarterly congressional reporting
- Replace the current two-year PPBE planning cycle with a continuous, iterative process that can respond to emerging threats and technology opportunities
- Maintain congressional notification requirements for large transfers (e.g., exceeding $50 million)

### Evidence

- **PPBE Commission (2024)**: The congressionally mandated commission found the current PPBE process "not designed for -- and is incapable of meeting -- the needs of a department that must move at speed and scale" and recommended portfolio-based budgeting
- **International models**: The United Kingdom and Australia have adopted versions of portfolio or outcome-based defense budgeting with positive results in flexibility and strategic alignment
- **Commercial analogy**: No Fortune 500 company manages its budget at the line-item granularity that Congress imposes on the DoD; portfolio management is standard practice in the private sector
- **Historical precedent**: The Defense Emergency Fund concept and existing transfer authorities (10 U.S.C. 2214) demonstrate that limited flexibility mechanisms already exist and function within the system

### Challenges

- **Congressional resistance**: Appropriators view line-item control as both a constitutional prerogative and the source of their institutional power. Portfolio budgeting directly threatens this power
- **Oversight gaps**: Moving from thousands of line items to dozens of portfolios could reduce transparency if not paired with robust reporting mechanisms
- **Service gaming**: Services could use portfolio flexibility to redirect money to preferred programs rather than to the highest-priority needs
- **Transition complexity**: Shifting the entire DoD budget structure requires retraining the acquisition and comptroller workforce, rebuilding IT systems, and redesigning congressional committee processes

## Solution 3: Biennial Budgeting for Defense

### Description

Shift the defense budget to a two-year cycle in which Congress authorizes and appropriates defense funds biennially, with the "off year" devoted to oversight hearings and midcourse corrections. This would reduce the administrative burden of annual budget preparation and provide greater funding stability.

### Key Elements

- Enact two-year defense authorization and appropriations bills
- In the second year, conduct intensive oversight hearings and allow supplemental adjustments
- Align the biennial cycle with the DoD's internal programming cycle, which already operates on a two-year rhythm
- Maintain annual authorization of military end strength (as constitutionally required by the two-year Army appropriation limit)

### Evidence

- **Congressional research**: CRS and CBO have studied biennial budgeting extensively. CBO found that biennial budgeting could reduce the administrative costs of budget preparation by 20-30%, freeing DoD staff for program execution rather than justification (CBO, 2008)
- **State precedents**: Approximately 20 states use biennial budgeting, and the evidence suggests it produces more stable and predictable budgets
- **PPBE Commission**: The 2024 Commission recommended a biennial approach to align the budget cycle with the DoD's internal planning horizon
- **Reduced CR risk**: Biennial appropriations would halve the number of opportunities for CRs to take effect

### Challenges

- **Congressional reluctance**: The annual budget cycle gives Congress an annual venue for oversight; biennial budgeting would reduce hearing schedules and members' opportunities for public engagement with defense issues
- **Forecasting difficulty**: Two-year appropriations require more accurate forecasting; unexpected events (wars, crises, economic changes) may require more frequent supplementals
- **Constitutional concern**: The two-year appropriation limit for armies in Article I, Section 8 is satisfied by biennial budgeting, but some scholars argue it reflects a preference for frequent legislative review of military spending
- **Inertia**: Biennial budgeting has been proposed repeatedly since the 1980s and has never gained sufficient congressional support; the political barriers are well-understood and enduring

## Solution 4: End the Continuing Resolution Cycle

### Description

Implement automatic continuing funding mechanisms that prevent the defense budget from operating under ad hoc continuing resolutions when Congress fails to pass appropriations on time. CRs cost the DoD billions in inefficiency and prevent new program starts.

### Key Elements

- Enact a "Full-Year Automatic CR" provision: if appropriations are not enacted by October 1, the prior-year level automatically continues at 99% (with a 1% efficiency incentive to enact new appropriations)
- Allow specific provisions for new starts and production rate increases that are authorized in the NDAA, even under an automatic CR
- Include a "clean" automatic CR (no policy riders) to prevent CRs from being used as leverage for unrelated political disputes
- Alternatively, enact a "government funding assurance" mechanism that funds the government at the lower of the House or Senate mark if full-year appropriations are not enacted

### Evidence

- **CBO estimates**: CBO has estimated that CRs cost the DoD between $5-10 billion per year in lost efficiency through delayed new starts, suboptimal obligation patterns, and industrial base disruption
- **GAO reports**: GAO has documented the specific operational impacts of CRs on training, maintenance, and hiring (GAO-18-368)
- **National Commission on the Future of the Army (2016)**: Recommended automatic continuing funding as a minimal safeguard against appropriations dysfunction
- **International precedents**: Many countries have automatic continuing authority mechanisms that prevent government shutdowns

### Challenges

- **Leverage loss**: Both parties use the threat of CRs and government shutdowns as leverage for political negotiations. Automatic funding removes this leverage, which is precisely why it is hard to enact
- **Moral hazard**: Some argue that automatic CRs reduce the incentive for Congress to pass regular appropriations at all
- **Constitutional concerns**: Some scholars argue that automatic appropriations could be challenged as an impermissible delegation of the congressional power of the purse, though the mechanism preserves congressional authority to override at any time

## Solution 5: Zero-Based Strategic Reviews

### Description

Conduct periodic (every 4-8 years) comprehensive reviews of the entire defense budget starting from zero, requiring every program, base, and activity to justify its continued existence against current strategic priorities rather than relying on historical baseline budgets.

### Key Elements

- Mandate a comprehensive zero-based review within 18 months of each new presidential administration, aligned with the National Defense Strategy
- Require each military service and defense agency to justify every major program and activity against the NDS priorities
- Empower an independent review panel (modeled on BRAC) to recommend program cancellations, consolidations, and reallocations, with expedited congressional consideration
- Publish review findings for public and congressional examination

### Evidence

- **Commercial practice**: Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is used in the private sector by firms facing budget pressure, though it is resource-intensive. Companies like 3G Capital have used ZBB to identify 15-20% savings in overhead costs
- **BRAC model**: The BRAC process demonstrated that independent commissions can make politically difficult recommendations that Congress is willing to accept through an up-or-down vote mechanism
- **GAO fragmentation/duplication reports**: GAO's annual reports on federal program duplication consistently identify billions in potential savings from consolidating duplicative defense activities

### Challenges

- **Bureaucratic burden**: A true zero-based review of an $850 billion enterprise would require enormous analytical resources and could paralyze normal operations during the review period
- **Political unrealism**: Every program has a constituency; zero-based reviews that recommend cancellations face the same political opposition as any other cut
- **Service gaming**: Services are adept at "gold-plating" justifications to survive reviews, potentially making the exercise performative rather than genuinely analytical
- **Implementation gap**: Even well-designed reviews produce recommendations that are watered down or ignored during implementation

## Solution 6: OCO/Supplemental Reform

### Description

Ensure that the elimination of the OCO "slush fund" is permanent and that future supplemental appropriations are genuinely limited to unforeseen contingency operations rather than used to circumvent budget caps or fund base budget activities.

### Key Elements

- Codify the FY2022 elimination of the OCO distinction so that it cannot be revived without new legislation
- Define strict criteria for emergency and supplemental defense appropriations: funding must be for activities that were not foreseeable at the time of the regular budget submission
- Require OMB certification that supplemental requests meet the emergency/unforeseen criteria
- Mandate that any supplemental exceeding a threshold (e.g., $10 billion) include an offset proposal

### Evidence

- **CBO analysis**: CBO documented that $30-50 billion per year of OCO funding during the BCA era was used for enduring activities rather than genuine contingency operations (CBO, 2019)
- **Bipartisan criticism**: Both Republican budget hawks and Democratic oversight advocates criticized OCO abuse during the BCA era
- **FY2022 precedent**: The successful elimination of OCO in the FY2022 budget demonstrates that reform is achievable when political conditions align

### Challenges

- **Future crises**: Genuine contingencies (new wars, natural disasters) will require supplemental funding; overly strict criteria could hamper rapid response
- **Cap evasion incentives**: If future budget caps are enacted, the pressure to create new off-budget mechanisms will return regardless of OCO reform
- **Definition disputes**: Distinguishing "unforeseen" from "foreseeable but not budgeted" is inherently subjective and will generate disputes

## Solution 7: Financial System Modernization

### Description

Fund and mandate a comprehensive modernization of the DoD's 2,400+ financial and business information systems, consolidating them into a smaller number of interoperable enterprise systems capable of producing auditable data.

### Key Elements

- Establish a dedicated DoD Financial Systems Modernization Fund with mandatory multi-year funding ($500 million - $1 billion annually for 5-7 years)
- Mandate adoption of common data standards and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems across all military departments
- Set milestones for sunsetting legacy systems that cannot produce auditable data
- Appoint a single accountable official (DoD Chief Information Officer or a new position) with authority to enforce compliance across the services

### Evidence

- **GAO findings**: GAO has repeatedly identified the fragmented IT landscape as the single largest barrier to DoD audit readiness (GAO-23-105536)
- **Commercial ERP success**: Large corporations have successfully consolidated financial systems onto common ERP platforms (SAP, Oracle), though these transitions are costly and time-consuming
- **Partial DoD successes**: The Army's GFEBS and the Navy's ERP systems, despite initial problems, have improved financial data quality for the components that adopted them
- **DoD OIG**: The DoD Inspector General has identified IT system modernization as critical to resolving the material weaknesses that prevent clean audit opinions

### Challenges

- **Cost**: Comprehensive IT modernization could cost $5-10 billion over a decade, and past DoD IT programs have experienced significant cost growth
- **Resistance**: Each military service is attached to its own systems and resists centrally mandated standards
- **Transition risk**: Migrating financial data from legacy systems to new platforms during ongoing operations is technically complex and operationally risky
- **Cybersecurity**: Consolidating financial systems creates a more concentrated target for adversary cyber operations

## Solution 8: Personnel Cost Management

### Description

Address the long-term growth in military personnel costs -- which consume over 50% of the defense budget when fully loaded (including health care, retirement, housing) -- through targeted reforms that maintain quality of life while bending the cost curve.

### Key Elements

- Implement the recommendations of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (2015), which proposed a blended retirement system (since partially adopted) and TRICARE reforms
- Conduct a comprehensive review of military compensation to identify areas where benefits exceed comparable civilian sector equivalents
- Modernize the military health system, including consolidation of military treatment facilities and increased use of the TRICARE network
- Explore targeted force structure adjustments that substitute technology for manpower in appropriate roles

### Evidence

- **CBO analysis**: CBO has found that military compensation (pay, benefits, health care, retirement) has grown 50% faster than inflation since 2000, outpacing comparable civilian compensation growth (CBO, 2020)
- **TRICARE costs**: The Defense Health Program costs approximately $50 billion annually, roughly equivalent to the entire budget of the Department of Homeland Security
- **International comparisons**: Allied militaries (UK, Australia) spend a significantly lower share of their defense budgets on personnel, achieving comparable readiness with different compensation structures

### Challenges

- **Political toxicity**: Any proposal to modify military pay or benefits is characterized as "cutting support for the troops," making it politically poisonous
- **Recruiting crisis**: With all services struggling to meet recruiting goals, reducing compensation is counterproductive in the near term
- **Quality of life**: Military families already face significant sacrifices (frequent moves, deployments, childcare challenges); reducing benefits exacerbates these burdens
- **Retiree lobby**: Military retirees and their organizations (MOAA, VFW, American Legion) are a powerful political constituency that vigorously opposes any benefit modifications
