# Social Security

Social Security is the foundation of retirement security for most Americans, providing monthly benefits to 67 million people including retirees, disabled workers, and survivors. Created in 1935, the program has become the nation's most successful anti-poverty initiative, lifting 27 million people above the poverty line annually. However, demographic shifts mean the program faces projected shortfalls that require legislative action to ensure continued benefit payments for future generations.
