# Social Security: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- **Preserve social insurance structure**: Maintain earned benefits, universal coverage, progressive formula
- **Achieve long-term solvency**: Close 75-year actuarial gap
- **Improve adequacy**: Reduce senior poverty, address coverage gaps
- **Share sacrifice fairly**: Balance revenue and benefit adjustments
- **Protect vulnerable populations**: Low earners, disabled, caregivers
- **Phase in changes gradually**: Allow workers to adjust plans
- **Build bipartisan support**: Avoid partisan winner-take-all outcomes

### Reform Categories

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Revenue measures** | Increase income to trust funds |
| **Benefit adjustments** | Modify benefit calculations |
| **Structural reforms** | Change program architecture |
| **Administrative improvements** | Enhance service delivery |
| **Benefit improvements** | Address adequacy concerns |

## Revenue Solutions

### Solution 1: Lift the Payroll Tax Cap

**Description**: Apply payroll tax to all earnings, not just the first $168,600 (2024).

**Options**:

| Approach | How It Works | Solvency Impact |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Full elimination** | Tax all wages at 12.4% | Closes ~70% of shortfall |
| **Partial lift** | Tax wages above $400,000 (donut hole) | Closes ~35% of shortfall |
| **Phased increase** | Raise cap faster than inflation | Gradual closure |
| **90% coverage** | Restore cap covering 90% of wages | Closes ~25% of shortfall |

**Evidence**:

- In 1983, cap covered 90% of wages; now covers ~82%
- Medicare HI tax has no cap (since 1994)
- High earners' life expectancy gains justify higher contribution

**Challenges**:

- Opposition from high earners and business groups
- Debate over whether higher contributions merit higher benefits
- Would be largest payroll tax increase since 1983

### Solution 2: Apply Payroll Tax to Investment Income

**Description**: Extend 12.4% tax to net investment income above threshold.

**Evidence**:

- ACA already taxes investment income at 3.8% for Medicare
- Capital income increasingly important; wages declining as share
- Improves tax progressivity

**Challenges**:

- No precedent for Social Security taxation of non-wage income
- Complex implementation and enforcement
- Would face intense opposition from investors

### Solution 3: Increase the Payroll Tax Rate

**Description**: Raise the combined employer-employee rate from 12.4% to higher level.

| Increase | Solvency Impact |
|----------|-----------------|
| +0.5% (to 12.9%) | Closes ~15% of shortfall |
| +1.0% (to 13.4%) | Closes ~30% of shortfall |
| +2.0% (to 14.4%) | Closes ~60% of shortfall |
| +3.5% (to 15.9%) | Closes 100% of shortfall |

**Evidence**:

- Rate was increased 9 times between 1950 and 1990
- Gradual increases minimize economic disruption
- International comparisons show higher rates are feasible

**Challenges**:

- Regressive impact on low and moderate earners
- Increases labor costs for employers
- Politically difficult tax increase

### Solution 4: Dedicate Other Revenue Sources

**Description**: Direct other tax revenues to Social Security trust funds.

| Source | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Estate tax** | Dedicate portion of estate tax revenue |
| **Financial transaction tax** | Small tax on stock trades |
| **Carbon tax** | Portion of carbon pricing revenue |
| **General fund transfer** | Break self-financing principle |

**Evidence**:

- Some countries use mixed financing
- Could address trust fund shortfall without payroll tax increase
- Financial transaction taxes raise substantial revenue in other countries

**Challenges**:

- Breaks "earned benefit" principle
- Competes with other priorities for revenue
- May weaken political protection of program

## Benefit Adjustment Solutions

### Solution 5: Adjust the Benefit Formula

**Description**: Modify the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) calculation.

| Adjustment | How It Works | Effect |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **Reduce bend points** | Lower percentages at 90%, 32%, 15% | Across-the-board cut |
| **Add fourth bend point** | New bracket for highest earners | Progressive cut |
| **Extend calculation period** | 38 or 40 highest years instead of 35 | Modest cut |
| **Change indexing** | Use different wage index | Varies |

**Evidence**:

- Graduated formula already progressive
- Adding bend point targets high earners
- Extending calculation period affects those with career gaps

**Challenges**:

- Any benefit formula change is perceived as cut
- Difficult to explain to public
- Disproportionately affects those with irregular work histories

### Solution 6: Modify Cost-of-Living Adjustments

**Description**: Change how annual COLAs are calculated.

| Approach | How It Works | Effect |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Chained CPI** | Use chained CPI-U instead of CPI-W | ~0.3% lower annual increase |
| **CPI-E** | Use elderly-specific index | Slightly higher increases |
| **COLA cap** | Limit COLA for high earners | Progressive adjustment |
| **COLA floor** | Guarantee minimum increase | Protect low earners |

**Evidence**:

- Chained CPI better measures consumer behavior
- CPI-E reflects seniors' higher healthcare spending
- Current CPI-W designed for urban wage earners

**Challenges**:

- Even small COLA reductions compound over time
- Seniors already struggle with healthcare costs
- COLA changes are unpopular with beneficiaries

### Solution 7: Increase the Full Retirement Age

**Description**: Raise FRA beyond current 67 to reflect longer lifespans.

| Change | Implementation | Solvency Impact |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **FRA to 68** | Phase in 2035-2047 | Closes ~10% of shortfall |
| **FRA to 69** | Phase in 2035-2059 | Closes ~20% of shortfall |
| **FRA to 70** | Phase in 2035-2071 | Closes ~30% of shortfall |
| **Index to longevity** | Automatic adjustment | Varies with projections |

**Evidence**:

- Life expectancy at 65 has increased ~6 years since 1940
- 1983 reforms already raised FRA from 65 to 67
- Most OECD countries have similar provisions

**Challenges**:

- Longevity gains unequal across income levels
- Many workers cannot work longer (health, physical demands)
- Amounts to 7% benefit cut per year of increase
- Increases disability claims as workers wait for retirement

### Solution 8: Means-Testing Benefits

**Description**: Reduce benefits for high-income retirees.

| Approach | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Income-based reduction** | Phase out benefits above income threshold |
| **Wealth-based reduction** | Consider assets in benefit calculation |
| **Progressive taxation** | Increase benefit taxation for high earners |

**Evidence**:

- 85% taxation threshold unchanged since 1993
- Some high-income retirees don't need Social Security
- Could target savings to those who need it most

**Challenges**:

- Converts social insurance to welfare
- Administrative complexity and cost
- Discourages savings behavior
- Undermines political support from universal participation

## Benefit Improvement Solutions

### Solution 9: Establish Minimum Benefit

**Description**: Ensure long-term workers receive benefits above poverty.

| Design | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **125% FPL minimum** | No worker with 30+ years below 125% poverty |
| **Career-adjusted minimum** | Scaled to years worked |
| **Refurbish special minimum** | Update existing provision |

**Evidence**:

- Current special minimum has eroded, covers few workers
- 10% of elderly beneficiaries below poverty line
- Social Security should prevent poverty for lifetime workers

**Challenges**:

- Costs money in already underfunded system
- Must be paired with revenue measures
- Defining "years worked" for gig economy

### Solution 10: Credit Caregiving Years

**Description**: Provide earnings credits for periods of family caregiving.

| Design | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Child caregiving credit** | Credit for years caring for children under 6 |
| **Elder caregiving credit** | Credit for years caring for disabled family members |
| **Capped credits** | Up to 5-10 years of credit |
| **Wage equivalent** | Credit at 50% of average wage |

**Evidence**:

- Women's lower benefits largely due to caregiving interruptions
- Many countries (Germany, UK, France) provide caregiving credits
- Would improve adequacy for 53 million family caregivers

**Challenges**:

- Verification of caregiving is difficult
- Costs money; must be paired with revenue
- Some see as weakening contributory principle

### Solution 11: Improve Survivor Benefits

**Description**: Enhance benefits for surviving spouses.

| Option | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **75% of combined** | Survivor receives 75% of couple's combined benefit |
| **Inheritance credit** | Surviving spouse inherits portion of deceased's earnings record |
| **Minimum survivor benefit** | Guarantee above poverty |

**Evidence**:

- Widow(er)s face 30-50% income drop at spouse's death
- Current 100% of higher benefit inadequate for many
- Disproportionately affects women

**Challenges**:

- Significant cost
- Benefits married couples over never-married
- Must be paired with revenue increases

### Solution 12: Reform SSI

**Description**: Modernize Supplemental Security Income for aged, blind, and disabled.

| Reform | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Increase asset limits** | Raise from $2,000/$3,000 to $10,000/$20,000 |
| **Increase benefit level** | Raise to 100% FPL (from 75%) |
| **Simplify rules** | Reduce complexity of in-kind support rules |
| **Index thresholds** | Automatic inflation adjustment |

**Evidence**:

- Asset limits unchanged since 1989; would be $5,700 today
- SSI benefit leaves recipients in poverty
- Complex rules create administrative burden

**Challenges**:

- SSI funded from general revenue, not payroll tax
- Separate political dynamics from OASDI
- State supplementation varies widely

## Structural Solutions

### Solution 13: Automatic Stabilizers

**Description**: Build automatic adjustments into program to maintain solvency.

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Longevity indexing** | Adjust FRA or benefits to life expectancy |
| **Revenue triggers** | Raise taxes when shortfall exceeds threshold |
| **Benefit triggers** | Adjust benefits when shortfall exceeds threshold |
| **Combined approach** | Balance automatic tax and benefit changes |

**Evidence**:

- Sweden's system adjusts automatically to demographics
- Germany uses sustainability factor in benefit formula
- Removes politics from annual adjustments

**Challenges**:

- Reduces congressional control
- May lock in undesirable policy during unusual circumstances
- Difficult to design fair triggers

### Solution 14: Invest Trust Fund in Markets

**Description**: Allow trust fund to invest in diversified portfolio, not just Treasury bonds.

| Approach | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Index fund investment** | Portion of trust fund in broad stock index |
| **Independent board** | Remove investment from political control |
| **Gradual phase-in** | Slowly shift allocation over decades |

**Evidence**:

- Canada Pension Plan successfully invests in markets
- Higher returns could improve solvency
- Current Treasury-only investment earns lower returns

**Challenges**:

- Government ownership of private companies raises concerns
- Market risk; trust fund could lose value
- Political interference in investment decisions

### Solution 15: Individual Account Supplement

**Description**: Create supplementary personal accounts without changing basic Social Security.

| Design | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Add-on accounts** | Additional contribution to personal account |
| **Carve-out accounts** | Redirect portion of payroll tax to account |
| **Auto-enrollment IRA** | Encourage private savings alongside SS |

**Evidence**:

- Many workers have inadequate private savings
- Personal accounts could supplement (not replace) benefits
- Multiple countries combine social insurance with individual accounts

**Challenges**:

- Carve-out worsens trust fund financing
- Administrative costs reduce returns
- Market risk for individual workers
- 2005 privatization effort failed politically

## International Models
