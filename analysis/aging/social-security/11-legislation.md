# Social Security: Legislation

## Overview

Social Security reform requires federal legislation to modify the program's revenue structure, benefit formula, or administration. Because Social Security is exclusively federal, state legislation plays no direct role, though states can affect related programs like SSI supplementation. This document presents draft legislation for key reforms, with analysis of legal considerations and implementation challenges.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for Social Security reform. Congress has broad authority under the Taxing and Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to modify Social Security benefits and taxes. The Supreme Court has held that Social Security benefits are not contractual rights and can be modified by Congress (*Flemming v. Nestor*, 363 U.S. 603 (1960)).

However, some advocates propose constitutional protections:

### Proposed: Social Security Protection Amendment

```text
Section 1. The right of eligible persons to receive Social Security
benefits, as provided by law, shall not be diminished for any person
who has contributed to the Social Security system.

Section 2. Congress shall maintain the solvency of the Social Security
trust funds through timely legislative action.

Section 3. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by
appropriate legislation.

Section 4. This article shall take effect two years after ratification.
```

**Analysis**: This amendment would create a constitutional right to benefits, fundamentally changing the legal framework. It would complicate future reforms and likely face significant opposition. Not recommended as necessary for reform.

## Federal Legislation

### Social Security Solvency and Benefit Adequacy Act

**Purpose**: Comprehensive reform to achieve 75-year solvency while improving benefit adequacy for vulnerable populations.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Social Security Solvency and Benefit
Adequacy Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) the Social Security trust funds face projected depletion by 2032
    under current law;
(2) without legislative action, beneficiaries would face an automatic
    benefit reduction of approximately 23 percent;
(3) Social Security provides essential income for 68 million Americans,
    including 51 million retired workers;
(4) approximately 40 percent of elderly Americans rely on Social
    Security for 90 percent or more of their income;
(5) the current payroll tax cap covers only 82 percent of covered wages,
    down from 90 percent in 1983; and
(6) timely, balanced reform is necessary to ensure the program's
    long-term sustainability while protecting benefit adequacy.

SEC. 3. PAYROLL TAX CAP ADJUSTMENT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 230 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 430)
    is amended—
    (1) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (e); and
    (2) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new subsection:
    "(d) ADDITIONAL WAGES SUBJECT TO TAX.—
        "(1) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of section 3101(a) and 3111(a)
            of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, wages paid to an
            individual in excess of $250,000 for any calendar year
            shall be treated as wages subject to tax.
        "(2) NO ADDITIONAL BENEFIT ACCRUAL.—Wages subject to tax
            solely by reason of paragraph (1) shall not be taken into
            account for purposes of computing benefits under this title.
        "(3) INFLATION ADJUSTMENT.—The $250,000 amount in paragraph
            (1) shall be adjusted annually beginning in 2026 to reflect
            changes in the national average wage index.".

SEC. 4. MINIMUM BENEFIT IMPROVEMENT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended
    by adding at the end the following:
    "(9) ENHANCED MINIMUM BENEFIT.—
        "(A) IN GENERAL.—The primary insurance amount of any individual
            who has not less than 30 years of coverage shall not be less
            than 125 percent of the poverty line for a single individual.
        "(B) REDUCED MINIMUM FOR FEWER YEARS.—For individuals with
            between 10 and 29 years of coverage, the minimum benefit
            shall be prorated based on years of coverage.
        "(C) INFLATION ADJUSTMENT.—The minimum benefit amount shall
            be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the poverty line.
        "(D) YEARS OF COVERAGE DEFINED.—For purposes of this
            paragraph, a year of coverage is a year in which the
            individual has wages at least equal to 25 percent of the
            contribution and benefit base.".

SEC. 5. CAREGIVER CREDITS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended
    by adding at the end the following:
    "(10) CAREGIVER CREDITS.—
        "(A) IN GENERAL.—In computing an individual's average indexed
            monthly earnings, the Commissioner shall impute earnings
            equal to 50 percent of the national average wage index for
            any month in which the individual was engaged in caregiving
            activities, as defined in subparagraph (C).
        "(B) MAXIMUM CREDITS.—Credits under this paragraph shall not
            exceed a total of 60 months (5 years) per individual.
        "(C) CAREGIVING ACTIVITIES DEFINED.—For purposes of this
            paragraph, caregiving activities means—
            "(i) caring for a child under 6 years of age; or
            "(ii) caring for a dependent relative with a disability
                 as defined in section 223(d).
        "(D) DOCUMENTATION.—The Commissioner shall establish procedures
            for documenting eligibility for caregiver credits.".

SEC. 6. SURVIVOR BENEFIT ENHANCEMENT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 202(e) and (f) of the Social Security Act are
    amended to provide that the surviving spouse benefit shall equal
    not less than 75 percent of the combined benefits of the deceased
    worker and surviving spouse, calculated as if both were alive.

SEC. 7. COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT PROTECTION.
(a) MINIMUM COLA.—Section 215(i) of the Social Security Act is amended
    to provide that the annual cost-of-living adjustment shall not be
    less than 2 percent in any year.
(b) PROTECTED POPULATION.—Benefits of individuals receiving less than
    150 percent of the federal poverty level shall be adjusted using
    the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E), if higher than
    the standard CPI-W adjustment.

SEC. 8. AUTOMATIC STABILIZERS.
(a) TRIGGER MECHANISM.—If the Board of Trustees projects that the
    combined OASDI trust funds will be depleted within 15 years,
    the following automatic adjustments shall take effect:
    (1) The contribution and benefit base shall increase by an
        additional 2 percent per year until the projected depletion
        date exceeds 30 years.
    (2) If the projected depletion date falls below 10 years, the
        employee and employer tax rates shall each increase by 0.1
        percentage point per year until the projected depletion date
        exceeds 20 years.
(b) CONGRESSIONAL OVERRIDE.—Congress may suspend automatic adjustments
    by enacting alternative legislation achieving equivalent actuarial
    balance.

SEC. 9. SSI MODERNIZATION.
(a) ASSET LIMITS.—Section 1611(a)(3) of the Social Security Act is
    amended by striking "$2,000" and "$3,000" and inserting "$10,000"
    and "$15,000", respectively, with annual inflation adjustments.
(b) BENEFIT LEVEL.—The federal benefit rate under title XVI shall be
    increased to equal 100 percent of the federal poverty level for
    individuals and 150 percent for couples.

SEC. 10. ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING.
(a) DEDICATED FUNDING.—The limitation on administrative expenses under
    section 201(g) of the Social Security Act is amended to provide that
    not less than 1.5 percent of benefit payments shall be available for
    administrative expenses without further appropriation.
(b) MODERNIZATION.—The Commissioner shall implement a comprehensive
    information technology modernization program within 5 years of
    enactment.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATES.
(a) TAX PROVISIONS.—The amendments made by section 3 shall apply to
    wages paid after December 31, 2025.
(b) BENEFIT PROVISIONS.—The amendments made by sections 4, 5, 6, and 7
    shall apply to benefits payable for months after December 31, 2026.
(c) SSI PROVISIONS.—The amendments made by section 9 shall take effect
    January 1, 2026.
(d) AUTOMATIC STABILIZERS.—Section 8 shall take effect upon enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This comprehensive bill combines revenue increases (expanded payroll tax base), benefit improvements (minimum benefit, caregiver credits, survivor enhancement), and automatic stabilizers to achieve long-term solvency while addressing adequacy concerns.

**Challenges**:

- Opposition from high earners to tax increase above $250,000
- Cost of benefit improvements must be offset by revenue
- Automatic stabilizers may face opposition from both parties
- CBO scoring will determine political feasibility

**Refinements**:

- Consider phasing in tax cap increase over multiple years
- May need to adjust minimum benefit level based on cost estimates
- Caregiver credit documentation requirements need administrative feasibility review

### Social Security Fairness Act

**Purpose**: Repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO) that reduce benefits for public employees.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Social Security Fairness Act".

SEC. 2. REPEAL OF WINDFALL ELIMINATION PROVISION.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
    415(a)) is amended by striking paragraph (7).
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.—[Technical conforming amendments to remove
    references to WEP throughout Title II]

SEC. 3. REPEAL OF GOVERNMENT PENSION OFFSET.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 202(b)(4), (c)(2), (e)(7), (f)(2), and (g)(4)
    of the Social Security Act are each amended by striking
    subparagraph (A) and redesignating subsequent subparagraphs.
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.—[Technical conforming amendments]

SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.
The amendments made by this Act shall apply to benefits payable for
months after December 31, 2025.

SEC. 5. BENEFIT RECOMPUTATION.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Commissioner of Social Security shall recompute
    benefits for all individuals affected by the repeal under sections
    2 and 3.
(b) RETROACTIVITY.—Recomputed benefits shall be paid prospectively
    only; no lump sum payment for prior months shall be required.
```

**Explanation**: WEP reduces Social Security benefits for workers who also receive pensions from employment not covered by Social Security (primarily state and local government workers). GPO reduces spousal/survivor benefits for the same population. Both provisions affect approximately 2 million beneficiaries.

**Challenges**:

- Cost estimated at $150+ billion over 10 years
- Opponents argue provisions prevent "double-dipping"
- No offset proposed in most versions
- May require revenue offset to pass under budget rules

**Refinements**:

- Could phase out rather than immediate repeal
- Could replace with more targeted formula adjustment
- Could pair with revenue measure as offset

---

### Social Security Administration Independence and Funding Act

**Purpose**: Establish SSA as fully independent agency with dedicated administrative funding.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Social Security Administration
Independence and Funding Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) the Social Security Administration serves 67 million beneficiaries;
(2) SSA staffing is at its lowest level since 1972;
(3) disability claim processing times exceed 200 days on average;
(4) phone wait times average over 30 minutes;
(5) 64 field offices have closed since 2010; and
(6) adequate administrative funding is essential for program integrity
    and customer service.

SEC. 3. COMMISSIONER APPOINTMENT AND TERM.
(a) TERM.—Section 702(a)(3) of the Social Security Act is amended by
    striking "6 years" and inserting "7 years".
(b) REMOVAL.—The Commissioner may be removed by the President only
    for cause, including neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.
(c) BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP.—The positions of Commissioner and Deputy
    Commissioner shall not be held simultaneously by members of the
    same political party.

SEC. 4. DEDICATED ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING.
(a) AUTHORIZATION.—There is authorized to be appropriated from the
    Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal
    Disability Insurance Trust Fund amounts equal to—
    (1) 1.5 percent of benefit payments in fiscal year 2026;
    (2) 1.6 percent of benefit payments in fiscal year 2027; and
    (3) 1.7 percent of benefit payments in fiscal year 2028 and
        thereafter.
(b) AUTOMATIC APPROPRIATION.—Amounts authorized under subsection (a)
    shall be automatically appropriated without further action by
    Congress.

SEC. 5. SERVICE STANDARDS.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Commissioner shall establish service standards
    including—
    (1) disability claim initial determination within 90 days;
    (2) hearing decision within 180 days;
    (3) telephone wait time not exceeding 15 minutes; and
    (4) field office appointment availability within 2 weeks.
(b) REPORTING.—The Commissioner shall report annually to Congress on
    compliance with service standards.

SEC. 6. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION.
(a) PLAN.—Within 180 days of enactment, the Commissioner shall submit
    to Congress a comprehensive plan for modernizing SSA information
    systems.
(b) FUNDING.—There is authorized to be appropriated $1,000,000,000
    over 5 years for IT modernization.
```

**Explanation**: SSA has been chronically underfunded, with staffing at 1970s levels despite serving many more beneficiaries. This bill provides dedicated funding from trust funds and strengthens agency independence.

**Challenges**:

- Automatic appropriations face congressional resistance
- Some oppose strengthening for-cause removal protections
- IT modernization has historically faced cost overruns
- May be seen as circumventing appropriations process

### Disability Insurance Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Modernize SSDI to improve processing, support work attempts, and update medical criteria.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Disability Insurance Modernization Act".

SEC. 2. UPDATED MEDICAL-VOCATIONAL GUIDELINES.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Commissioner shall update the medical-vocational
    guidelines (Listings of Impairments) within 3 years of enactment
    to reflect—
    (1) advances in medical treatment and technology;
    (2) changes in the nature of work in the economy; and
    (3) updated occupational information.
(b) REGULAR UPDATES.—The Commissioner shall update the guidelines at
    least every 5 years thereafter.

SEC. 3. WORK INCENTIVE IMPROVEMENTS.
(a) EXTENDED TRIAL WORK PERIOD.—Section 222(c) of the Social Security
    Act is amended by striking "9 months" and inserting "24 months".
(b) EXPEDITED REINSTATEMENT.—The expedited reinstatement period under
    section 223(i) is extended from 60 months to 120 months.
(c) BENEFIT OFFSET.—The Commissioner shall implement a $1 for $2
    benefit offset for earnings above the substantial gainful activity
    level, rather than the current benefit cliff.

SEC. 4. HEARING BACKLOG REDUCTION.
(a) ADDITIONAL ALJs.—The Commissioner shall hire not fewer than 200
    additional administrative law judges within 2 years of enactment.
(b) DECISION WRITERS.—The Commissioner shall hire sufficient
    decision writers to support increased ALJ capacity.
(c) VIDEO HEARINGS.—The Commissioner shall expand video hearing
    capacity to reduce travel barriers and processing times.

SEC. 5. REPRESENTATIVE PAYEE REFORM.
(a) OVERSIGHT.—The Commissioner shall conduct annual reviews of all
    organizational representative payees.
(b) ACCOUNTING.—Representative payees shall submit detailed annual
    accountings of benefit expenditures.
(c) BENEFICIARY RIGHTS.—Beneficiaries shall have the right to request
    a different representative payee and to receive an accounting.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall take effect 180 days after enactment.
```

**Explanation**: SSDI faces long processing times, outdated medical criteria, and work disincentives that trap beneficiaries in dependency. This bill modernizes the program while maintaining its core protective function.

**Challenges**:

- ALJ hiring requires adequate funding
- Medical criteria updates face stakeholder pressure
- Work incentives may be seen as benefit cuts by some advocates

## State Legislation

Social Security is entirely federal, but states can affect related programs:

### State SSI Supplementation Enhancement Act (Model)

**Purpose**: Increase state supplement to SSI to bring total benefits to poverty level.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] SSI Supplementation Enhancement
Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.
The Legislature finds that—
(1) Federal SSI benefits equal approximately 75 percent of the federal
    poverty level;
(2) Many aged, blind, and disabled residents of this state live in
    poverty despite receiving SSI; and
(3) State supplementation can bring total benefits to an adequate
    level.

SECTION 3. STATE SUPPLEMENT.
(a) AMOUNT.—The state supplement for eligible SSI recipients shall
    equal the difference between—
    (1) 100 percent of the federal poverty level for the recipient's
        household size; and
    (2) the federal SSI benefit amount plus any other countable income.
(b) CATEGORIES.—The supplement shall apply to all categories of SSI
    recipients: aged, blind, and disabled.
(c) LIVING ARRANGEMENTS.—Supplemental amounts may vary based on living
    arrangements in accordance with federal SSI rules.

SECTION 4. ADMINISTRATION.
(a) STATE ADMINISTRATION.—The [Department of Social Services] shall
    administer the state supplement.
(b) FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION OPTION.—The [Department] may contract with
    the Social Security Administration to administer the state
    supplement if cost-effective.

SECTION 5. APPROPRIATION.
There is appropriated from the General Fund the amount necessary to
carry out this Act.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

**Explanation**: 43 states currently provide some SSI supplementation, but amounts vary widely. This model legislation would bring total SSI benefits to the poverty level.

**Challenges**:

- Significant cost to state budgets
- Some states have reduced supplementation over time
- Federal administration option may not be available in all states

## Regulatory Framework

### SSA Administrative Actions

The Commissioner can take significant action without legislation:

| Action | Authority | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Update medical listings** | 42 U.S.C. § 423(d) | Modernize disability criteria |
| **Improve online services** | Administrative | Reduce processing times |
| **Hire staff** | Within appropriations | Improve customer service |
| **Simplify procedures** | Administrative | Reduce burden on claimants |
| **Update representative payee rules** | 42 U.S.C. § 405(j) | Protect beneficiaries |

### Regulatory Priorities

| Regulation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **CDR scheduling** | Ensure continuing disability reviews are timely |
| **Earnings reporting** | Simplify requirements for working beneficiaries |
| **SSN verification** | Strengthen protections against fraud |
| **Online account security** | Protect beneficiary information |

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Taxing authority** | Congress has broad power; payroll tax increases constitutional |
| **Benefit modification** | *Flemming v. Nestor*: Benefits not contractual; can be modified |
| **Due process** | Procedural protections required for benefit denial/termination |
| **Equal protection** | Benefit distinctions must be rationally related to legitimate purpose |

### Judicial Precedents

| Case | Holding | Relevance |
|------|---------|-----------|
| *Flemming v. Nestor* (1960) | Social Security benefits not property rights | Congress can modify benefits |
| *Helvering v. Davis* (1937) | Social Security constitutional | Taxing power, general welfare |
| *Mathews v. Eldridge* (1976) | Due process in disability termination | Procedural requirements |
| *Califano v. Goldfarb* (1977) | Gender distinctions in survivor benefits | Equal protection limits |

### Preemption Issues

Social Security fully preempts state regulation. States cannot:

- Modify Social Security benefits
- Impose additional requirements on SSA
- Tax Social Security benefits differently than federal law allows
- Override federal administrative determinations

States retain authority over:

- State SSI supplementation
- State income tax treatment of benefits
- State programs that interact with Social Security

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **"Donut hole" gaming** | If cap has gap, income could be shifted to gap range | Medium |
| **Caregiver credit fraud** | False claims of caregiving to increase benefits | Medium |
| **Benefit timing** | Strategic claiming to maximize household benefits | Low (intended) |
| **Earnings test avoidance** | Defer compensation until after FRA | Low |
| **Disability work incentive abuse** | Cycling through trial work periods | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Incomplete solvency** | May not close full 75-year gap | Revenue/benefit balance |
| **Delayed implementation** | Years before provisions fully effective | Political reality |
| **SSI integration** | SSI funded separately, political dynamics differ | Program structure |
| **Enforcement capacity** | SSA understaffed for new requirements | Funding constraints |
| **Automatic stabilizer politics** | May be suspended by future Congress | Congressional prerogatives |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Gap coverage monitoring**: Include CBO scoring requirement before any "donut hole" approach
2. **Caregiver verification**: Require independent verification (pediatrician records, disability determination, etc.)
3. **SSI alignment**: Include SSI provisions in comprehensive bill rather than separate legislation
4. **Enforcement funding**: Tie administrative funding to trust fund percentage
5. **Stabilizer protection**: Require supermajority to suspend automatic adjustments
6. **Regular review**: Mandate 5-year actuarial review of reform effectiveness

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **IT system capacity** | Phased implementation; dedicated modernization funding |
| **ALJ shortage** | Multi-year hiring ramp-up; video hearing expansion |
| **Public understanding** | Outreach campaign; clear SSA communications |
| **Transition complexity** | Long phase-ins; grandfather provisions |
| **Political reversal** | Build broad coalition support; automatic mechanisms |
