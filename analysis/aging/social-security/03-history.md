# Social Security: History

## Pre-Social Security Era (Before 1935)

### Old-Age Dependency

| Period | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| Colonial era | Family responsibility; almshouses for destitute |
| 1800s | Industrialization weakened extended family networks |
| 1880s | First Civil War pensions (precursor to social insurance) |
| Early 1900s | Private pensions rare; most workers had no retirement income |
| 1920s | State old-age assistance programs in 28 states (inadequate) |
| Great Depression | 50% of elderly were dependent on family or charity |

### International Context

By 1935, most industrialized nations had already enacted old-age insurance:

| Country | Year | Model |
|---------|------|-------|
| Germany | 1889 | Bismarckian social insurance |
| Austria | 1906 | Contributory system |
| United Kingdom | 1908 | Non-contributory pension |
| France | 1910 | Contributory system |
| Sweden | 1913 | Universal pension |

The U.S. was a latecomer to social insurance, reflecting a stronger tradition of individualism and distrust of federal programs.

## Creation of Social Security (1935)

### Economic and Political Context

- **Great Depression**: Unemployment reached 25%; banks failed; private pensions collapsed
- **Townsend Movement**: Dr. Francis Townsend proposed $200/month for all over 60 (funded by sales tax)
- **Huey Long**: "Share Our Wealth" program promised $30/month pensions
- **Political pressure**: FDR needed alternatives to radical redistribution schemes

### Committee on Economic Security (1934)

FDR created the Committee on Economic Security, chaired by Labor Secretary Frances Perkins, to design a comprehensive social insurance system.

Key design decisions:

| Issue | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Funding** | Payroll tax, not general revenue | Create "earned right" psychology |
| **Coverage** | Employed workers only | Exclude agricultural, domestic workers (political compromise) |
| **Age** | 65 for retirement | Actuarial and fiscal constraints |
| **Philosophy** | Insurance, not welfare | Build political support; avoid means testing |

### Social Security Act of 1935

Signed August 14, 1935. Original provisions:

| Title | Program |
|-------|---------|
| Title I | Old-Age Assistance (state grants for needy elderly) |
| Title II | Old-Age Insurance (contributory retirement benefits) |
| Title III | Unemployment Insurance |
| Title IV | Aid to Dependent Children |
| Title V | Maternal and Child Welfare |
| Title X | Aid to the Blind |

The payroll tax was set at 1% each for employers and employees (2% total), on the first $3,000 of wages.

### Initial Exclusions

The 1935 Act excluded:

- Agricultural workers (disproportionately Black and Hispanic)
- Domestic workers (disproportionately Black women)
- Self-employed individuals
- Federal, state, and local government employees
- Employees of nonprofit organizations

These exclusions were both administrative (difficulty collecting taxes) and political (Southern Democrats demanded exclusion of predominantly Black occupations).

## Early Expansion (1939-1956)

### 1939 Amendments

Major restructuring before first benefits paid:

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Survivors benefits** | Widows, children of deceased workers covered |
| **Spousal benefits** | Wives of retired workers eligible |
| **Earlier benefits** | First payments moved to 1940 (from 1942) |
| **Benefit formula** | Changed from individual equity to social adequacy |

Ida May Fuller received the first Social Security check ($22.54) on January 31, 1940.

### Coverage Expansions

| Year | Groups Added |
|------|--------------|
| 1950 | Domestic and farm workers (most), self-employed |
| 1950 | Non-profit employees |
| 1954 | Farm self-employed, additional self-employed |
| 1956 | Uniformed military, remaining self-employed |
| 1956 | Disability Insurance (DI) created |
| 1956 | Women eligible for reduced benefits at 62 |

### Disability Insurance (1956)

Created as separate trust fund within Social Security:

- Initial eligibility: Age 50-64, total disability
- 1960: Age restriction removed
- Strict definition: Unable to engage in substantial gainful activity

## Great Society Era (1965-1972)

### Medicare Creation (1965)

Social Security Amendments of 1965:

| Program | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Medicare Part A | Hospital insurance for 65+ |
| Medicare Part B | Supplementary medical insurance |
| Medicaid | Medical assistance for low-income |

Medicare was built on the Social Security framework: same age threshold, financed partly by payroll taxes, administered by SSA.

### 1972 Amendments

Landmark changes under Nixon administration:

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **20% benefit increase** | Largest one-year increase |
| **Automatic COLAs** | Benefits indexed to CPI starting 1975 |
| **SSI creation** | Supplemental Security Income federalized old-age assistance |
| **Indexing error** | Formula flaw would later cause solvency crisis |

The 1972 indexing formula contained a technical error ("double indexing") that would have caused benefits to grow faster than wages indefinitely.

## Financial Crisis and Reform (1977-1983)

### 1977 Crisis

The double-indexing error plus stagflation threatened trust fund exhaustion by early 1980s.

1977 Amendments:

- Fixed indexing formula (wage-indexed benefit formula)
- Raised payroll tax rates gradually
- Created "notch" that reduced benefits for those born 1917-1921

### 1983 Greenspan Commission

Trust fund projected to be exhausted by mid-1983. President Reagan and Speaker O'Neill appointed the National Commission on Social Security Reform (Greenspan Commission).

April 1983 Amendments (bipartisan package):

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Raise retirement age** | Gradually from 65 to 67 (phased in 2003-2027) |
| **Tax benefits** | Up to 50% of benefits taxable above income thresholds |
| **Accelerate payroll tax increases** | Pre-fund Baby Boomer retirement |
| **Cover federal employees** | New federal hires after 1984 |
| **Delay COLA** | 6-month delay (one-time) |

This created the large trust fund surpluses of the 1990s-2000s.

## Modern Era (1994-Present)

### Disability Reforms

| Year | Change |
|------|--------|
| 1996 | Welfare reform removed addiction as qualifying condition |
| 1999 | Ticket to Work program encouraged return to employment |
| 2015 | Bipartisan Budget Act reallocated revenue to DI trust fund |

### Benefit Taxation Expansion (1993)

Clinton-era change: Up to 85% of benefits subject to income tax for higher-income beneficiaries.

### Failed Reform Attempts

| Year | Proposal | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1998-1999 | Clinton modernization | Monica Lewinsky scandal derailed effort |
| 2005 | Bush privatization | Personal accounts proposal failed in Congress |
| 2010 | Simpson-Bowles | Commission recommendations not adopted |
| 2011 | Super Committee | Failed to reach agreement |

### Administrative Challenges

| Development | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Budget cuts | SSA budget cut 10% in real terms (2010-2020) |
| Field office closures | 64 offices closed since 2010 |
| Disability backlog | Hearing wait times exceeded 600 days (2016) |
| COVID response | Processing disruptions, increased claims |

### Recent Legislative Activity

| Year | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2015 | Bipartisan Budget Act: DI trust fund reallocation |
| 2020 | CARES Act: Some administrative flexibilities |
| 2022 | Inflation Reduction Act: SSA funding increase |
| 2023 | Social Security Fairness Act (pending) |
| 2024 | Multiple reform bills introduced (none enacted) |

## Key Historical Patterns

### Expansion Pattern

Social Security has followed a consistent pattern:

1. **Initial exclusions** for administrative or political reasons
2. **Gradual coverage expansion** as capacity increases
3. **Benefit improvements** during prosperous periods
4. **Resistance to cuts** once benefits become established

### Crisis-Driven Reform

Major changes have only occurred during fiscal crises:

| Crisis | Year | Result |
|--------|------|--------|
| Trust fund depletion threat | 1977 | Tax increases, formula fix |
| Imminent insolvency | 1983 | Bipartisan compromise |
| DI depletion | 2015 | Reallocation from OASI |
| 2032 projected depletion | 2025-? | Pending legislative action |

### Bipartisan Tradition

Historically, Social Security has commanded bipartisan support:

- 1935: Passed 371-33 in House, 77-6 in Senate
- 1950: Passed voice vote in both chambers
- 1983: Passed 243-102 in House, 58-14 in Senate
- 2015: Passed as part of bipartisan budget deal

Recent polarization has made bipartisan agreement more difficult.

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

| Lesson | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Social insurance framing** | "Earned benefit" creates political durability |
| **Universal coverage** | Broad inclusion builds broad support |
| **Automatic adjustments** | COLAs protect against inflation without annual legislation |
| **Trust fund accounting** | Creates fiscal discipline and transparency |

### Persistent Challenges

| Challenge | Historical Pattern |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Fiscal sustainability** | Repeated solvency crises requiring legislation |
| **Adequacy vs. affordability** | Tension between benefit levels and tax rates |
| **Coverage gaps** | Some workers remain poorly covered |
| **Disability determination** | Consistently difficult to administer fairly |

### Political Realities

| Reality | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| **"Third rail" status** | Both parties avoid proposing cuts |
| **Crisis required for action** | Advance planning politically difficult |
| **Grandparent protections** | Changes typically phase in slowly |
| **Blame avoidance** | Bipartisan commissions provide political cover |
