# Social Security: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Social Security reform requires a politically viable path that builds momentum, creates bipartisan cover, and achieves meaningful change before the 2032 trust fund depletion deadline. The roadmap sequences administrative actions, coalition building, and legislative strategy while recognizing the "third rail" political constraints.

## Phase 1: Foundation (2025-2027)

### Administrative Actions (No Legislation Required)

| Action | Agency | Timeline | Impact |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Improve disability processing** | SSA | Ongoing | Reduce backlog, improve service |
| **Expand online services** | SSA | 2025-2026 | Better access, reduced costs |
| **Modernize IT systems** | SSA | 2025-2027 | Efficiency, security |
| **Enhance fraud prevention** | SSA/IG | Ongoing | Protect program integrity |
| **Improve COLA communication** | SSA | Annual | Public understanding |
| **Public trustees appointment** | President | 2025 | Restore independent oversight |

### Congressional Groundwork

| Action | Purpose | Timeline |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **SSA funding increase** | Restore administrative capacity | Annual appropriations |
| **Commission authorization** | Create bipartisan reform vehicle | 2025-2026 |
| **Hearings on solvency** | Build public awareness | 2025-2026 |
| **CBO alternative scenarios** | Provide analysis of options | 2025 |
| **Social Security Fairness Act** | Address WEP/GPO (narrow bipartisan issue) | 2025 |

### Coalition Building

| Coalition | Members | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Protect and Expand** | AARP, labor, senior groups | Unified messaging on adequacy |
| **Fiscal Responsibility** | CRFB, Concord, deficit hawks | Emphasis on sustainable solutions |
| **Caregiver Focus** | Women's groups, family advocates | Highlight benefit gaps |
| **Business Coalition** | Chamber, HR associations | Predictability, workforce planning |

### Public Education

| Initiative | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **"Know Your Social Security" campaign** | Counter misinformation about "bankruptcy" |
| **Generational dialogue** | Bridge young-old divide |
| **Trust fund explainers** | Help public understand financing |
| **Reform options toolkit** | Present trade-offs clearly |

## Phase 2: Building Momentum (2028-2030)

### Bipartisan Commission

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| **Structure** | Co-chairs from each party; balanced membership |
| **Mandate** | Propose package closing 75-year shortfall |
| **Process** | Public hearings, expert testimony |
| **Report** | Specific legislative text |
| **Fast-track** | Expedited congressional consideration |

### Initial Legislative Package

| Element | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Lift payroll tax cap (partial)** | Restore 1983 coverage ratio |
| **Minimum benefit improvement** | Address senior poverty |
| **Caregiver credits (limited)** | Begin addressing gender gap |
| **Administrative funding** | Dedicated stream for SSA |
| **SSI modernization** | Update asset limits, benefit level |

### Solvency Pathway

| Mechanism | Contribution |
|-----------|--------------|
| Revenue measures | Close 50-60% of shortfall |
| Benefit adjustments | Close 20-30% of shortfall |
| Automatic stabilizers | Close remaining gap |

### Political Strategy

| Approach | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Bipartisan cover** | Both parties vote together |
| **Protect current beneficiaries** | No changes for those 55+ |
| **Phase in gradually** | Long transition periods |
| **Balance revenue and benefits** | Shared sacrifice messaging |
| **Frame as strengthening** | Not "cutting" or "raising taxes" |

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Reform (2029-2032)

### Major Legislative Package

If Phase 2 package falls short, pursue comprehensive reform:

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Full cap elimination** | Tax all wages (or donut hole to $400k+) |
| **Benefit formula adjustment** | Add fourth bend point for high earners |
| **FRA adjustment** | Longevity indexing (prospective only) |
| **Automatic stabilizers** | Built-in adjustments for future shortfalls |
| **Benefit improvements** | Minimum benefit, caregiving credits, survivor enhancement |

### Deadline Pressure

| Year | Trust Fund Status | Political Pressure |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2028 | 6 years to depletion | Moderate urgency |
| 2030 | 4 years to depletion | High urgency |
| 2032 | 2 years to depletion | Crisis mode |
| 2032 | Depletion | Automatic 23% cut without action |

### Alternative Pathways

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| **Bipartisan success** | Comprehensive package passes |
| **Partisan window** | One party acts with narrow majority |
| **Continuing stalemate** | Automatic benefit cut at depletion |
| **Last-minute deal** | Crisis-driven compromise (1983 model) |

## Success Metrics

### Solvency Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | 2030 Target | 2035 Target |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **75-year actuarial balance** | -3.82% of payroll | -1.50% | 0% (solvent) |
| **Trust fund depletion date** | 2032 | 2050+ | Never |
| **Annual cash flow** | -$100B | Balanced | Positive |

### Adequacy Metrics
