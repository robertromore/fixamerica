# Social Security

## Overview

Social Security is the foundation of retirement security for most Americans, providing monthly benefits to 67 million people including retirees, disabled workers, and survivors. Created in 1935, the program has become the nation's most successful anti-poverty initiative, lifting 27 million people above the poverty line annually. However, demographic shifts mean the program faces projected shortfalls that require legislative action to ensure continued benefit payments for future generations.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI)**: Retirement and survivor benefits
- **Disability Insurance (DI)**: Benefits for workers with qualifying disabilities
- **Supplemental Security Income (SSI)**: Means-tested benefits for aged, blind, and disabled
- **Program financing**: Payroll taxes, trust funds, and projected solvency
- **Benefit adequacy**: Replacement rates, special minimum benefit, COLA
- **Reform debates**: Revenue options, benefit adjustments, structural changes

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total beneficiaries | 67 million | SSA, 2024 |
| Retired workers receiving benefits | 51 million | SSA, 2024 |
| Disabled workers receiving benefits | 7.5 million | SSA, 2024 |
| Average retirement benefit | $1,907/month | SSA, 2024 |
| Maximum retirement benefit (2024) | $4,873/month | SSA, 2024 |
| Seniors lifted above poverty | 27 million | CBPP, 2024 |
| Trust fund depletion projected | 2034 | SSA Trustees, 2024 |
| Shortfall after depletion | 21% benefit reduction | SSA Trustees, 2024 |

## Program Structure

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **OASI** | Retirement benefits for workers 62+; survivor benefits for spouses and children |
| **DI** | Benefits for workers under FRA with severe, long-term disabilities |
| **SSI** | Federal-state program for aged, blind, disabled with limited income/assets |
| **Financing** | 12.4% payroll tax (6.2% employer, 6.2% employee) on earnings up to $168,600 (2024) |
| **Trust funds** | OASI and DI trust funds hold Treasury securities; pay-as-you-go with reserve |

## Why This Matters

**Scale of impact**: Social Security is the largest federal program, providing $1.4 trillion in annual benefits. For 52% of elderly beneficiaries, it provides at least half their income; for 25%, it provides 90% or more.

**Poverty prevention**: Without Social Security, the elderly poverty rate would rise from 10% to 38%. The program is particularly important for women, minorities, and those without employer pensions.

**Economic security**: Benefits are guaranteed, inflation-adjusted, and last for life, providing protection that private savings cannot match against longevity risk and market volatility.

**Political stakes**: Social Security enjoys broad, bipartisan public support. Any reforms will be among the most consequential policy decisions of the coming decade, affecting every working American and retiree.

## Key Challenges

### Demographic Pressure

| Challenge | Data |
|-----------|------|
| **Declining worker-to-beneficiary ratio** | 2.8:1 today; 2.2:1 by 2040 |
| **Increasing life expectancy** | Average 65-year-old lives 19+ more years |
| **Baby Boom retirement** | 10,000 Americans turn 65 daily |
| **Birth rate decline** | Fertility rate at historic low (1.6) |

### Benefit Adequacy

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **COLA understates senior inflation** | CPI-W weights health/housing lower than CPI-E |
| **Declining replacement rates** | Tax increases and Medicare premium growth erode net benefits |
| **Women's lower benefits** | Reflect lifetime earnings gaps and caregiving interruptions |
| **Minimum benefit erosion** | Special minimum benefit no longer reaches poverty line |

### Political Gridlock

- Both parties pledge to protect Social Security but disagree on solutions
- Revenue increases versus benefit cuts create partisan divide
- Near-term political costs deter action despite long-term consequences
- Misinformation complicates public understanding

## Relationship to Parent Topic

Social Security is the most significant program within aging policy, accounting for more federal spending than any other single program. Reforms to Social Security interact with:

- **Medicare**: Both programs face demographic pressures; coordinated solutions may be needed
- **Retirement savings**: Social Security's adequacy affects need for private savings
- **Poverty policy**: SSI and Social Security together form the floor of retirement security
- **Labor policy**: Payroll taxes affect employment decisions; retirement ages affect workforce participation
