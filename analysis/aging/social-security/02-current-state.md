# Social Security: Current State

## Present Conditions

Social Security operates as designed: collecting payroll taxes from current workers to pay benefits to current retirees. The program currently runs a small annual deficit that draws down accumulated trust fund reserves. Without legislative changes, the combined OASI and DI trust funds will be depleted by 2032 (as accelerated by the 2025 "One Big Beautiful Bill Act"), at which point incoming revenue will cover only about 77% of scheduled benefits.

## Beneficiary Population

### By Benefit Type

| Category | Beneficiaries | Average Monthly Benefit |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Retired workers | 51.3 million | $1,907 |
| Spouses of retired workers | 2.0 million | $919 |
| Children of retired workers | 0.6 million | $922 |
| Survivors | 5.9 million | $1,506 |
| Disabled workers | 7.5 million | $1,537 |
| Spouses of disabled workers | 0.1 million | $364 |
| Children of disabled workers | 1.3 million | $503 |
| **Total** | **68.7 million** | — |

### Demographic Profile

| Characteristic | Share of Beneficiaries |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Female | 55% |
| Age 65+ | 77% |
| Age 85+ | 13% |
| Non-Hispanic White | 78% |
| Black | 11% |
| Hispanic | 8% |
| Asian | 3% |

## Financial Status

### Trust Fund Balances (End of 2023)

| Fund | Assets | Year of Depletion (2025 Report) |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| OASI (retirement/survivors) | $2.7 trillion | 2033 |
| DI (disability) | $68 billion | 2065 |
| Combined (per 2025 Trustees) | $2.8 trillion | 2034 |
| Combined (after July 2025 legislation) | — | 2032 |

### Annual Cash Flow

| Item | 2024 (Billions) |
|------|-----------------|
| **Revenues** | |
| Payroll taxes | $1,162 |
| Taxation of benefits | $55 |
| Interest on trust funds | $68 |
| **Total Revenue** | **$1,285** |
| **Expenditures** | |
| Benefit payments | $1,378 |
| Administrative costs | $7 |
| **Total Expenditures** | **$1,385** |
| **Net Cash Flow** | **-$100** |

### Long-Term Projections

| Period | Actuarial Balance (% of taxable payroll) |
|--------|----------------------------------------|
| 2024-2033 (10 years) | -1.25% |
| 2024-2048 (25 years) | -2.78% |
| 2024-2098 (75 years) | -3.82% |

The 75-year actuarial deficit of 3.82% of taxable payroll means that an immediate and permanent payroll tax increase of 3.82 percentage points (from 12.4% to 16.22%) would close the gap.

## Benefit Adequacy

### Replacement Rates

| Earnings Level | Replacement Rate |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Low earner (45% of average wage) | 57% |
| Medium earner (average wage) | 41% |
| Maximum earner (at or above cap) | 27% |
| Scaled medium earner (career average) | 37% |

Replacement rates have declined over time due to:

- Increasing Full Retirement Age (65 → 67)
- Growth in Medicare premiums deducted from benefits
- Taxation of benefits at unchanged thresholds

### Benefit Adequacy by Group

| Group | Median Annual Benefit | Poverty Concern |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------|
| All retired workers | $22,884 | 8% below poverty |
| Women | $19,992 | 10% below poverty |
| Men | $26,388 | 6% below poverty |
| Black beneficiaries | $19,800 | 17% below poverty |
| Hispanic beneficiaries | $17,400 | 18% below poverty |

## Geographic Variation

### Regional Differences

| Connecticut | $2,089 | 18.5% |
| Mississippi | $1,571 | 23.7% |
| West Virginia | $1,678 | 27.1% |

Higher-benefit states reflect higher lifetime earnings; states with more beneficiaries as share of population are older and have more retirees.
