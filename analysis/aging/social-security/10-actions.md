## Civic Engagement

### Stay Informed

| Topic | Sources |
|-------|---------|
| **Trust fund status** | Annual Trustees Report |
| **Reform proposals** | CBO, CRS reports |
| **Legislative activity** | Congress.gov, committee websites |
| **Benefit changes** | SSA announcements, COLA updates |
| **Administrative issues** | GAO reports, news coverage |

### Vote and Participate

| Opportunity | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| **Federal elections** | Research candidates' Social Security positions |
| **Primaries** | Support candidates committed to solvency |
| **State elections** | State officials influence SSI supplementation |
| **Public comments** | Respond to SSA rulemaking |

### Contact Representatives

| Target | Topics |
|--------|--------|
| **US Senators** | Social Security legislation, solvency |
| **US Representatives** | Ways and Means jurisdiction; appropriations |
| **President** | Executive priorities, commission appointments |

### Effective Communication

| Method | Tips |
|--------|------|
| **Phone calls** | Most effective for Congress; brief, specific |
| **Personal stories** | How Social Security affects you and family |
| **Specific asks** | Name bills, specific reforms |
| **Follow-up** | Multiple contacts on same issue |
| **Town halls** | In-person engagement with legislators |

## Advocacy Actions

### Sample Messages

**On Solvency:**

> "I urge you to act now to strengthen Social Security before the 2032 trust fund depletion. A balanced approach with revenue increases and targeted benefit adjustments is preferable to waiting for an automatic 23% benefit cut. Please support bipartisan action."

**On Lifting the Cap:**

> "I support lifting the payroll tax cap to help fund Social Security. High earners should contribute on all their wages, just as workers below the cap do. In 1983, the cap covered 90% of wages; now it covers only 82%. Restoring fairness would close most of the funding gap."

**On Benefit Adequacy:**

> "Please support a minimum Social Security benefit that keeps long-term workers out of poverty. Too many seniors who worked their entire lives still face poverty in retirement. Social Security should guarantee dignity for lifetime workers."

**On WEP/GPO Repeal:**

> "I support the Social Security Fairness Act to repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset. These provisions unfairly reduce benefits for public servants like teachers and firefighters. Please support H.R. XXX / S. XXX."

**On Administrative Funding:**

> "The Social Security Administration needs adequate funding to serve beneficiaries. Wait times are unacceptable, offices are closing, and staff is at 1970s levels. Please support increased SSA appropriations."

**On Protecting Benefits:**

> "Please oppose any plan that would cut Social Security benefits or raise the retirement age without corresponding revenue increases. Workers have paid into this system their entire careers. Any reform must be balanced and protect those who depend on these benefits."
