## Opposition Arguments

### Argument 1: "Social Security Is Going Bankrupt"

**Claim**: The program is insolvent and cannot be saved; benefits will never be paid.

**Reality**:

- Trust fund depletion means 77% of scheduled benefits payable, not $0
- Program can always pay benefits from ongoing payroll taxes
- "Bankruptcy" framing is technically incorrect; creates unnecessary fear
- Modest changes can close the gap; actuarial shortfall is 3.82% of payroll

**Who Uses This**: Those wanting to undermine confidence in social insurance; privatization advocates.

### Argument 2: "Raising Taxes Will Kill Jobs"

**Claim**: Higher payroll taxes will reduce employment and economic growth.

**Reality**:

- Past payroll tax increases (1977, 1983) did not cause recessions
- Payroll tax holiday ended in 2013 without employment effects
- Tax on wages above cap affects very few workers
- Economic research shows modest effects from payroll tax changes

**Who Uses This**: Business groups, anti-tax advocates, employers of high earners.

### Argument 3: "Young People Will Never See Benefits"

**Claim**: Millennials and Gen Z are paying into a system that won't exist for them.

**Reality**:

- Even with no changes, system pays 77% of scheduled benefits indefinitely
- Political support remains overwhelming; reforms more likely than elimination
- Modest changes would restore full solvency
- Statement often used to justify eliminating program entirely

**Who Uses This**: Privatization advocates, those wanting generational conflict.

### Argument 4: "Private Accounts Would Provide Better Returns"

**Claim**: Workers would be better off investing their payroll taxes in the stock market.

**Reality**:

- Social Security provides insurance (disability, survivors) not just retirement savings
- Market returns vary; workers retiring in 2008-2009 would have faced losses
- Administrative costs of individual accounts reduce returns
- Chile's privatized system showed significant downsides
- Transition costs would require decades of double-payment

**Who Uses This**: Financial industry, libertarian economists, some conservatives.

### Argument 5: "Means-Testing Would Make It More Efficient"

**Claim**: Benefits should go only to those who need them; wealthy retirees don't need Social Security.

**Reality**:

- Means-testing would convert social insurance to welfare
- Administrative costs of verification are substantial
- Political support depends on universal participation
- High earners already get lower replacement rates
- Means-tested programs (like SSI) are consistently underfunded

**Who Uses This**: Some fiscal conservatives, efficiency-focused reformers.

### Argument 6: "Raising the Retirement Age Is Fair Given Longer Lifespans"

**Claim**: Life expectancy has increased; retirement age should keep pace.

**Reality**:

- Life expectancy gains unequal; low earners gained little
- Many workers physically cannot work longer
- Effective benefit cut of 7% per year of increase
- Workers in physically demanding jobs disproportionately harmed
- Disability claims increase when retirement age rises

**Who Uses This**: Those preferring benefit cuts to tax increases.

### Argument 7: "Social Security Was Never Meant to Be a Full Retirement"

**Claim**: Benefits were designed as supplement; people should save more privately.

**Reality**:

- 40% of elderly rely on Social Security for 90%+ of income
- Private pension coverage has declined dramatically
- 401(k) system leaves many without adequate savings
- Wages have stagnated, limiting savings capacity
- Original program assumptions no longer hold

**Who Uses This**: Those minimizing Social Security's role in retirement security.

### Argument 8: "Expanding Benefits Is Unaffordable"

**Claim**: We can't afford to improve benefits when the system is already underfunded.

**Reality**:

- Revenue increases can fund both solvency and improvements
- Other nations provide more generous benefits at similar cost
- Current benefit levels leave many seniors in poverty
- Cost depends on policy choices, not fixed constraints
- Expansion and solvency packages can be combined

**Who Uses This**: Fiscal conservatives, opponents of revenue increases.
