# End-of-Life Care

End-of-life care encompasses the medical, social, and personal support provided to individuals in the final stages of life, typically the last months or year. In the United States, most people die in hospitals or nursing homes rather than at home as they prefer, often receiving aggressive treatments that may prolong suffering without improving quality of life. Despite significant advances in hospice and palliative care, these services remain underutilized due to late referrals, cultural barriers, inadequate payment systems, and insufficient conversations about patient preferences. Improving end-of-life care requires addressing systemic failures in advance care planning, expanding access to hospice and palliative care, and aligning healthcare incentives with patient-centered goals.
