# End-of-Life Care: Current State

## Present Conditions

### Death in America

Most Americans die from chronic conditions after extended illness, yet healthcare systems remain oriented toward acute, curative care. The medicalization of death concentrates dying in institutions despite patient preferences for home death.

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Annual deaths | 3.4 million |
| Deaths age 65+ | 75% of all deaths |
| Leading causes | Heart disease, cancer, COVID-19, accidents, stroke |
| Average age at death | 77.4 years (2021) |
| Deaths from chronic illness | 70%+ |

### Where Americans Die

| Location | Percentage | Trend |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Hospital | 36% | Declining slowly |
| Home | 30% | Increasing |
| Nursing home | 21% | Declining |
| Hospice facility | 6% | Increasing |
| Other (emergency, other institution) | 7% | Stable |

**Preference vs. reality**: 80% of Americans express preference to die at home, but only 30% do so. The gap reflects system barriers, late hospice enrollment, and inadequate home support.

## Hospice Care

### Utilization

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Medicare hospice beneficiaries | 1.7 million annually |
| Percent of Medicare decedents | 57% |
| Primary diagnoses | Cancer (29%), dementia (18%), heart disease (16%) |
| Hospice locations | 90% home, 10% inpatient/residential |
| Number of hospice providers | 5,800+ |

### Timing Problems

| Issue | Data |
|-------|------|
| Median length of stay | 18 days |
| Average length of stay | 90 days (skewed by long stays) |

## Palliative Care

### Hospital Palliative Care

| Metric | Value |
