# End-of-Life Care: Legislation

## Overview

End-of-life care reform requires coordinated federal and state action. Federal legislation focuses on Medicare benefit reform (palliative care benefit, hospice modernization), advance care planning infrastructure, and workforce development. State legislation addresses advance directives, POLST programs, and medical aid in dying. Constitutional amendments are generally not required, though medical aid in dying raises complex constitutional questions that vary by framing.

**Legislative priorities:**

1. Create Medicare palliative care benefit for serious illness
2. Modernize hospice benefit to allow concurrent care
3. Establish national advance care planning infrastructure
4. Fund end-of-life communication training
5. Improve hospice quality and accountability
6. Support state POLST and advance directive modernization

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments required for most end-of-life care reforms. The Medicare program has clear authority to create new benefits and modify existing coverage. States have broad authority over advance directives and medical practice.

**Constitutional considerations for medical aid in dying:**

The Supreme Court ruled in *Washington v. Glucksberg* (1997) and *Vacco v. Quill* (1997) that there is no constitutional right to assisted suicide, leaving the issue to states. A constitutional amendment affirming or prohibiting medical aid in dying would be politically divisive and is not currently viable. State-by-state legislative action remains the appropriate venue.

## Federal Legislation

### Medicare Palliative Care and Hospice Improvement Act

**Purpose**: Create Medicare palliative care benefit for serious illness and modernize hospice benefit to allow concurrent care.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Medicare Palliative Care and Hospice Improvement Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Approximately 3.4 million Americans die each year, and many experience
    inadequate access to palliative and end-of-life care.
(2) The Medicare hospice benefit requires patients to forgo curative treatment,
    creating a barrier to timely enrollment.
(3) Thirty percent of hospice patients enroll within 7 days of death, limiting
    the benefit's effectiveness.
(4) Palliative care improves quality of life, reduces costs, and in some cases
    extends survival, but is not a covered Medicare benefit.
(5) Early integration of palliative care with curative treatment improves
    outcomes for patients with serious illness.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
(a) SERIOUS ILLNESS.—The term "serious illness" means a health condition
    that carries a high risk of mortality, negatively impacts quality of life
    and daily function, or is burdensome in symptoms, treatments, or caregiver
    stress.
(b) PALLIATIVE CARE.—The term "palliative care" means patient and family-
    centered care that optimizes quality of life by anticipating, preventing,
    and treating suffering throughout the continuum of illness. Palliative care
    involves addressing physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual
    needs and facilitates patient autonomy, access to information, and choice.
(c) CONCURRENT CARE.—The term "concurrent care" means the provision of
    hospice services simultaneously with curative or disease-modifying treatment.

SEC. 4. MEDICARE PALLIATIVE CARE BENEFIT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.

            for patient acuity and care needs.
        "(3) QUALITY ADJUSTMENT.—Beginning 3 years after enactment, payment
            under this section shall incorporate quality performance measures."

(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.—Section 1812 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
    1395d) is amended to include reference to the new palliative care benefit.

SEC. 5. HOSPICE CONCURRENT CARE.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1812(d)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
    1395d(d)(2)(A)) is amended—

```

**Explanation**: This bill creates two major reforms: a new Medicare palliative care benefit for seriously ill patients who are not yet hospice-eligible, and a concurrent care option allowing hospice patients to continue curative treatment. The palliative care benefit covers interdisciplinary team services paid on a per-member-per-month basis. Concurrent care removes the curative treatment forfeiture requirement that delays hospice enrollment.

**Challenges**:

- Cost estimates uncertain due to new benefit
- Medical eligibility criteria may be gamed
- Hospice industry may oppose concurrent care (threatens business model)
- Quality measures still in development

**Refinements**:

- Phase in concurrent care with demonstration period
- Establish clear serious illness criteria based on validated tools
- Tie payment to documented care plans
- Include anti-fraud provisions

        authorization;
    (4) interoperate with electronic health record systems; and
    (5) maintain audit logs of all document access.

(c) STATE INTEROPERABILITY.—The Registry shall be designed to interoperate
    with existing state registries and POLST programs.

(d) PRIVACY PROTECTIONS.—The Registry shall comply with HIPAA privacy
    requirements and implement additional protections including—
    (1) patient control over access;
    (2) encryption of stored documents;

(a) ADVANCE CARE PLANNING ELEMENT.—Section 1861(hhh)(2) of the Social Security
    Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(hhh)(2)) is amended by adding at the end:
    "(M) A discussion of the beneficiary's advance care planning status,
        including whether the beneficiary has—
            "(i) designated a healthcare proxy;
            "(ii) completed an advance directive;
            "(iii) discussed end-of-life preferences with family members; and

    for Medicaid administrative costs related to end-of-life care.
```

**Explanation**: This bill addresses the advance care planning infrastructure gap through a national registry, Medicare integration, public education, and provider training. The registry enables document portability so that advance directives follow patients across care settings. Medicare Annual Wellness Visit integration ensures regular conversations with beneficiaries.

**Challenges**:

- Privacy concerns with centralized registry
- State resistance to federal POLST standardization
- Funding competition
- Implementation complexity

**Refinements**:

| LCME | Integrate communication training into medical school standards |
| ACGME | Establish residency competencies in serious illness communication |
| Joint Commission | Include palliative care and ACP in hospital standards |
| NCQA | Incorporate ACP measures in health plan accreditation |

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Medical aid in dying** | *Glucksberg* (1997) found no constitutional right; states may prohibit or permit |
| **Right to refuse treatment** | Established in *Cruzan* (1990); states may require clear evidence |
| **Due process** | State MAID safeguards (waiting periods, witnesses) generally upheld |
| **Equal protection** | No differentiation based on protected class status |
| **Commerce Clause** | Federal Medicare reform clearly within authority |

### Federalism

| Level | Authority |
|-------|-----------|
| **Federal** | Medicare/Medicaid benefits, provider conditions of participation, research funding |
| **State** | Medical practice, advance directives, MAID, professional licensure |
| **Preemption** | Federal Medicare rules preempt conflicting state laws for Medicare providers |

### ERISA Considerations

ERISA preemption does not apply to state advance directive laws or MAID laws as they regulate healthcare delivery rather than employee benefit plans.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Medicare conditions** | Hospice providers must meet federal requirements |
| **Civil monetary penalties** | For hospice fraud and quality violations |
| **Program exclusion** | Persistent violators excluded from Medicare |
| **State licensure** | Provider licenses can be revoked for violations |
| **Qui tam actions** | False Claims Act allows whistleblower suits |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Palliative care eligibility gaming | Providers may diagnose "serious illness" broadly to qualify patients | Medium |
| Concurrent care cost-shifting | Hospices may use concurrent care to shift costs to Medicare Part A/B | High |
| Staffing ratio manipulation | Hospices may count administrative staff as direct care | Medium |
| Ownership disclosure avoidance | Complex corporate structures may obscure true ownership | Medium |
| MAID residency fraud | Non-residents may establish false residency to access MAID | Low |
| Quality measure gaming | Providers may select low-acuity patients to improve scores | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Palliative care geographic access | Rural areas may lack specialists | Workforce shortage |
| Cultural competency gaps | Non-white patients underserved | Training deficits |
| Caregiver support limits | Medicare benefit focused on patient | Benefit design |
| Survey frequency | Three-year cycle allows quality decline | Resource constraints |
| MAID prognosis uncertainty | Six-month prediction inaccurate | Medical limitations |
| ACP effectiveness unknown | Limited evidence for specific interventions | Research gaps |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Palliative care eligibility**: Require validated screening tool (e.g., surprise question, functional status) and periodic recertification
2. **Concurrent care cost-shifting**: Establish care coordination requirements and bundled payment cap
3. **Staffing manipulation**: Define direct care time clearly; require time studies
4. **Ownership disclosure**: Require ultimate beneficial owner disclosure; follow private equity holding company structures
5. **Quality gaming**: Risk-adjust measures; include case-mix in denominator
6. **Rural access**: Fund telehealth palliative care; establish mobile teams
7. **Cultural competency**: Require workforce diversity reporting; fund community health worker integration
8. **Survey frequency**: Increase appropriations for survey workforce; implement complaint-triggered surveys
9. **MAID prognosis**: Allow physician judgment; provide immunity for good-faith estimates

### General Implementation Concerns

1. **Workforce capacity**: Palliative care workforce expansion must parallel benefit expansion to avoid access bottlenecks
2. **State variation**: Federal POLST standardization may conflict with state medical practice autonomy
3. **Cost uncertainty**: New palliative care benefit costs difficult to estimate; may require adjustment
4. **Political sustainability**: "Death panel" framing could undermine reforms; requires careful messaging
5. **Technology infrastructure**: National ACP registry requires significant health IT investment
6. **Quality measure development**: Reliable, validated measures for goal-concordant care still emerging
