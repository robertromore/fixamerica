# End-of-Life Care: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles

- **Patient-centered**: Honor patient preferences and goals of care
- **Family-inclusive**: Support families as caregivers and in bereavement
- **Quality-focused**: Prioritize symptom management and quality of life
- **Timely**: Engage hospice and palliative care early, not as last resort
- **Accessible**: Ensure all Americans can access quality end-of-life care
- **Culturally competent**: Respect diverse values about death and dying
- **Evidence-based**: Use research to guide interventions
- **Financially sustainable**: Align payment with patient-centered goals

### Strategic Framework

| Dimension | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Payment | Reform hospice benefit; pay for conversations |
| Education | Train clinicians in communication, palliative care |
| Systems | Integrate advance directives; care coordination |
| Culture | Normalize death conversations; reduce stigma |
| Quality | Measure and report end-of-life care quality |
| Access | Expand hospice/palliative care to underserved areas |

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Reform Medicare Hospice Benefit

**Description**: Modify the hospice benefit to allow concurrent curative and comfort care, eliminating the either/or choice that delays hospice enrollment.

**Key Components**:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Concurrent care option | Allow curative treatment while enrolled in hospice |
| Trigger for eligibility | Serious illness, not just terminal prognosis |
| Payment structure | Blended per diem and fee-for-service |
| Quality requirements | Outcome measures for symptom management |
| Transition support | Bridge from curative to comfort focus |

**Evidence**:

- Medicare Care Choices Model showed concurrent care feasible
- Earlier enrollment improves patient and family outcomes
- Patients live as long or longer with hospice
- Families experience better bereavement
- Countries with concurrent care have earlier enrollment

**Challenges**:

- Budget scoring concerns (more people eligible)
- Industry adjustment to new model
- Defining "serious illness" eligibility
- Preventing inappropriate utilization

### Solution 2: Universal Advance Care Planning
