## Opposition Arguments

### Argument 1: "Hospice Is Giving Up"

**Claim**: Encouraging hospice enrollment means giving up on patients; aggressive treatment offers hope.

**Reality**:

- Hospice patients often live as long or longer than those with aggressive care
- Hospice addresses suffering that cure-focused care ignores
- Quality of remaining life improves dramatically
- Families report better bereavement outcomes
- Many patients want comfort over aggressive treatment

**Who makes this argument**: Some oncologists, families, patients with unrealistic expectations.

### Argument 2: "Medical Aid in Dying Is Euthanasia"

**Claim**: Legalizing assisted dying is a slippery slope to involuntary euthanasia and devaluing disabled lives.

**Reality**:

- Aid in dying requires terminal diagnosis, competence, self-administration
- No evidence of abuse in 25+ years in Oregon
- Strict safeguards prevent coercion
- Patients maintain control over their death
- Most who obtain medications don't use them (comfort of choice)

**Who makes this argument**: Pro-life groups, some religious leaders, some disability rights advocates.

### Argument 3: "Death Panels Will Ration Care"

**Claim**: Policies to improve end-of-life care are really about rationing care based on cost or age.

**Reality**:

- Goal is honoring patient preferences, not denying wanted care
- Many aggressive interventions harm patients
- Hospice and palliative care are patient-centered
- Advance care planning documents what patients want
- Better EOL care often costs less, but cost isn't the motivation

**Who makes this argument**: Political opponents, those with financial interests in current system.

### Argument 4: "Doctors Shouldn't Discuss Death"

**Claim**: Discussing death prognosis and preferences destroys hope and is harmful to patients.

**Reality**:

- Patients want honest information
- Avoiding discussion doesn't change prognosis
- Planning reduces anxiety for patients and families
- Hope can coexist with realism
- Families suffer when conversations don't happen

**Who makes this argument**: Some physicians, families in denial, cultural groups that avoid death talk.

### Argument 5: "Advance Directives Don't Work"

**Claim**: Advance directives don't change care and are a waste of effort.

**Reality**:

- Documents alone don't change care, but conversations do
- System barriers (portability) are fixable
- When accessible, directives guide decision-making
- Problem is implementation, not concept
- POLST forms more actionable than traditional directives

**Who makes this argument**: Critics of ACP policy, some researchers.

### Argument 6: "We Can't Predict Death"

**Claim**: Prognosis is too uncertain to base hospice eligibility on 6-month life expectancy.

**Reality**:

- Prognostic uncertainty is real but not absolute
- Functional decline, disease trajectories are predictable
- Current system errs toward optimism, harming patients
- Better tools and triggers can improve timing
- Uncertainty shouldn't prevent appropriate referrals

**Who makes this argument**: Some physicians, hospice critics, families.

### Argument 7: "For-Profit Hospice Is Fine"

**Claim**: Market competition improves hospice care; for-profit hospices serve patients well.

**Reality**:

- For-profit hospices have lower quality on several measures
- Shorter median stays in for-profit settings
- Fewer RN visits per patient
- Higher live discharge rates (patient selection)
- Some prioritize easy patients over complex ones

**Who makes this argument**: Hospice industry, market advocates.

### Argument 8: "Staffing Mandates Would Close Hospices"

**Claim**: Minimum staffing requirements would make hospice unsustainable, especially in rural areas.

**Reality**:

- Quality requires adequate staffing
- Some hospices maintain higher standards profitably
- Rural adaptations possible (telemedicine, flexible models)
- Per-patient payment can accommodate staffing costs
- Patients deserve minimum quality standards

**Who makes this argument**: Some hospice providers, industry associations.
