# End-of-Life Care

## Overview

End-of-life care encompasses the medical, social, and personal support provided to individuals in the final stages of life, typically the last months or year. In the United States, most people die in hospitals or nursing homes rather than at home as they prefer, often receiving aggressive treatments that may prolong suffering without improving quality of life. Despite significant advances in hospice and palliative care, these services remain underutilized due to late referrals, cultural barriers, inadequate payment systems, and insufficient conversations about patient preferences. Improving end-of-life care requires addressing systemic failures in advance care planning, expanding access to hospice and palliative care, and aligning healthcare incentives with patient-centered goals.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Hospice care**: Comfort-focused care for terminally ill patients with prognosis of 6 months or less
- **Palliative care**: Symptom management and quality of life focus for serious illness at any stage
- **Advance care planning**: Documentation of patient preferences including advance directives and POLST
- **End-of-life decision-making**: Conversations and choices about treatment goals
- **Medical aid in dying**: Legal assisted death options in authorized states
- **Bereavement support**: Services for families and caregivers after death
- **Healthcare settings**: Hospital, nursing home, home, and hospice facility deaths

## Key Facts

| Fact | Data |
|------|------|
| Annual deaths | ~3.4 million Americans die annually |
| Location of death | 36% hospital, 21% nursing home, 30% home, 6% hospice facility |
| Hospice use | 1.7 million patients (57% of Medicare decedents) |
| Average hospice length | 18 days median; 30% enrolled 7 days or less |
| Advance directive completion | 37% of adults have written advance directive |
| Healthcare costs in final year | 25% of Medicare spending on 5% who die |
| Palliative care availability | 72% of hospitals with 50+ beds have programs |
| Caregiver burden | 53 million Americans provide unpaid care |

## Types of End-of-Life Care

| Type | Description | Coverage |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Hospice** | Comfort care for terminal illness (≤6 months prognosis) | Medicare Part A, Medicaid, most insurance |
| **Palliative care** | Symptom relief for serious illness, any stage | Variable; improving under Medicare |
| **Hospital care** | Acute care, often aggressive treatment | Standard coverage |
| **Skilled nursing facility** | Post-acute and long-term care | Medicare limited, Medicaid, private pay |
| **Home care** | In-home medical and support services | Medicare Home Health, hospice |
| **Assisted living** | Residential care with services | Private pay primary |

## Why This Matters

### Human Impact

- **Patient suffering**: Aggressive care at end of life often increases suffering without benefit
- **Dying preferences**: 80% prefer to die at home; only 30% do
- **Family burden**: Caregivers experience physical, emotional, and financial strain
- **Missed opportunities**: Late hospice enrollment denies benefits to patients and families
- **Communication failures**: Many patients die without having discussed preferences with providers

### Economic Impact

| Cost Category | Amount |
|--------------|--------|
| Final year of life | $80,000+ average per Medicare decedent |
| Final month of life | 30% of final year costs |
| ICU in last month | 29% of Medicare decedents |
| Hospice savings | $2,600-$6,400 per patient vs. conventional care |
| Caregiver lost wages | $522 billion annually |

### Quality of Care Concerns

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Late hospice referral | Missed benefits of comfort care |
| Aggressive interventions | Suffering without survival benefit |
| Communication gaps | Care misaligned with preferences |
| Fragmented care | Poor coordination between providers |
| Caregiver burnout | Family collapse, institutionalization |

## Key Policy Questions

1. How can advance care planning become more universal and actionable?
2. What payment reforms would incentivize appropriate end-of-life care?
3. How should hospice and palliative care be better integrated into healthcare?
4. What training do clinicians need to improve end-of-life conversations?
5. How can racial and socioeconomic disparities in end-of-life care be addressed?
6. What role should medical aid in dying play, and how should it be regulated?
7. How can family caregivers be better supported at end of life?

## Reform Priorities

| Priority | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Universal advance care planning** | Document preferences before crisis |
| **Earlier hospice enrollment** | Maximize patient and family benefit |
| **Palliative care integration** | Symptom management throughout illness |
| **Clinician communication training** | Improve end-of-life conversations |
| **Payment reform** | Align incentives with patient goals |
