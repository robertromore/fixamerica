# End-of-Life Care: History

## Historical Development

### Death Before Modern Medicine (Pre-1900)

| Era | Characteristics |
|-----|-----------------|
| Pre-industrial | Death at home, family care, religious rituals |
| 19th century | Limited medical intervention, high mortality |
| Community role | Death as family/community event |
| Causes | Infection, childbirth, accidents, epidemics |
| Average lifespan | ~40 years (high infant mortality) |

**Key features of traditional dying**:

| Medical specialization | Focus on cure over care |
| Life expectancy rises | From 47 (1900) to 70 (1960) |
| Chronic disease emerges | New patterns of dying |

**The shift to institutional death**:

- 1900: ~80% died at home
- 1960: ~50% died in hospitals
- Death became a medical event
- Families increasingly excluded
- "Fighting death" became medical culture

### The SUPPORT Study (1995)

**Landmark research on end-of-life care quality**

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Dying patients in pain | 50% had moderate/severe pain |
| Physician awareness | Doctors often didn't know patient preferences |
| DNR orders late | Half written within 2 days of death |
| ICU use | Extensive even when patients preferred comfort |

**Significance**: Demonstrated that simply providing information doesn't change care; systemic reform needed.

**Lessons**: End-of-life care remains politically sensitive; messaging matters.

## Lessons from History

### What History Teaches

| Lesson | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Medical progress changed dying | Need to adapt systems to new realities |
| Hospice works | Proven model deserves expansion |
| Rights don't guarantee care | Implementation requires system change |
| Politics affects policy | EOL care is politically sensitive |
| Culture change is slow | Attitudes toward death evolve gradually |

### Recurring Themes

| Theme | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| Professionalization | Death moved from home to institution |
| Patient autonomy | Gradual recognition of patient rights |
| Quality vs. quantity | Tension between extending life and good death |
| Access disparities | Benefits don't reach all equally |
| Policy lag | Practice changes faster than policy |

### Unfinished Business

| Challenge | Historical Context |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Late hospice enrollment | Same problem for 40+ years |
| Advance directives | PSDA (1990) didn't solve |
| Aggressive EOL care | SUPPORT (1995) documented, still persists |
| Health disparities | Long-standing, persistent |
| Caregiver support | Never adequately addressed |
