# End-of-Life Care: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Improving end-of-life care requires sustained effort across multiple fronts: payment reform, workforce development, system integration, and culture change. The strategy sequences reforms to build on early successes, address low-hanging fruit first, and create momentum for harder changes. Political sensitivity requires careful framing to avoid "death panel" backlash.

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Patient-centered framing** | Always emphasize honoring patient wishes |
| **Bipartisan messaging** | Frame as personal choice, family support |
| **Build on evidence** | Demonstrate effectiveness before scaling |
| **Avoid political landmines** | Separate hospice/palliative from aid in dying |
| **Incremental progress** | Start with administrative, then legislative |
| **Coalition building** | Engage diverse stakeholders |

### Political Context

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Bipartisan support | Possible for most issues except MAID |
| Advocacy strength | Growing but fragmented |
| Industry position | Mixed; some support, some resist |
| Public awareness | Increasing after COVID |
| Electoral salience | Moderate; personal experience resonates |
