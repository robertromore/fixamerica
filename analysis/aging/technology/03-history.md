## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

| Success | Factors |
|---------|---------|
| **Smartphone adoption** | Intuitive interfaces; useful applications; family encouragement |
| **Video calling normalization** | COVID necessity; family connection; simplified apps |
| **Voice assistants** | No learning curve; hands-free; natural interaction |
| **OTC hearing aids** | Regulatory action; price reduction; retail access |
| **Telehealth expansion** | Payment parity; necessity during COVID; convenience |

### What Has Failed

| Failure | Causes |
|---------|--------|
| **Broadband for all** | High cost; rural economics; policy inconsistency |
| **Universal digital literacy** | Insufficient investment; no coordinated strategy |
| **Accessible health IT** | Poor design; fragmentation; profit focus |
| **PERS adoption** | Cost; stigma; limited Medicare coverage |
| **Fraud prevention** | Enforcement gaps; technology outpaces protection |

### Recurring Patterns

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Technology designed without older users** | Complex interfaces; small text; multi-step authentication |
| **Cost barriers to beneficial technology** | Hearing aids (until 2022); PERS; assistive technology |
| **Policy lags technology** | Telehealth restrictions; ACP ending; no broadband right |
| **Crises drive adoption** | COVID transformed telehealth and video calling |
| **Market fails to serve low-income** | Broadband; devices; digital literacy training |

### Key Insights

1. **Crisis as catalyst**: COVID demonstrated that rapid technology adoption among older adults is possible when necessary and when barriers are removed.

2. **Payment drives adoption**: Medicare coverage decisions profoundly shape technology availability and use (telehealth, assistive technology, PERS).

3. **Design matters enormously**: Voice interfaces succeeded where keyboard/mouse failed because they match natural human behavior.

4. **Affordability is essential**: OTC hearing aids show that regulatory action can dramatically improve access through price competition.

5. **Infrastructure is foundational**: Without broadband access, all other technology policy fails for those without connectivity.

6. **Training and support are necessary**: Technology adoption requires ongoing support, not just one-time training.

7. **Private market insufficient**: Left to market alone, low-income and rural older adults are systematically excluded.
