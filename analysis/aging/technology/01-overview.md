# Technology and Aging

## Overview

Technology holds enormous potential to support healthy aging, extend independence, improve care coordination, and enhance quality of life for older adults. From telehealth and remote monitoring to smart home systems and social connectivity tools, technological innovations can help address many challenges of an aging society. Yet this potential remains largely unrealized due to digital divides, poor design that ignores older users, inadequate reimbursement for technology-enabled care, privacy and security concerns, and lack of evidence for many emerging products. Approximately 25% of Americans over 65 do not use the internet, and even among users, many lack the digital literacy to navigate health portals, use video conferencing, or distinguish legitimate communications from scams. Making technology work for older adults requires intentional design, targeted training, appropriate reimbursement, and policies that ensure both access and protection.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Digital divide**: Internet access, device ownership, and digital literacy among older adults
- **Telehealth**: Remote healthcare delivery, reimbursement, and adoption barriers
- **Assistive technology**: Devices supporting independence (hearing aids, mobility aids, communication devices)
- **Smart home and monitoring**: Sensors, safety systems, and remote monitoring
- **Social connectivity**: Technology for reducing isolation and maintaining relationships
- **Caregiving technology**: Tools supporting family and professional caregivers
- **Cognitive support**: Technology for dementia care and cognitive assistance
- **Health information technology**: Electronic health records, patient portals, care coordination
- **Emerging technologies**: AI, robotics, wearables, and future applications
- **Privacy and security**: Protecting older adults from fraud, scams, and data misuse

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Internet non-users (65+)** | ~25% | vs. 7% for adults 18-64 |
| **Smartphone ownership (65+)** | ~61% | vs. 96% for ages 18-29 |
| **Broadband at home (65+)** | ~64% | vs. 86% for ages 18-64 |
| **Telehealth use (65+)** | ~40% | Increased dramatically during COVID |
| **Older adults using patient portals** | ~50% | Lower than younger adults |
| **Hearing aid adoption** | ~30% | Of those who need them |
| **Scam losses (60+)** | $3.4B+ | Reported to FTC in 2023 |
| **Digital literacy (basic)** | ~50% | Adults 65+ with basic skills |
| **Smart speaker ownership (65+)** | ~27% | Growing segment |

## Why This Matters

**Health outcomes**: Telehealth and remote monitoring can improve chronic disease management, reduce hospitalizations, and catch problems earlier—but only for those who can access and use these technologies.

**Independence**: Assistive technology, smart home systems, and cognitive support tools can extend the time older adults live safely at home, reducing costly institutional care.

**Social connection**: Technology can combat isolation and loneliness—major health risks for older adults—by maintaining connections with family, friends, and communities.

**Caregiver support**: Technology can reduce caregiver burden, provide peace of mind through monitoring, and improve coordination between family and professional caregivers.

**Economic efficiency**: Technology-enabled care can be more cost-effective than traditional models, but benefits depend on widespread adoption and appropriate reimbursement.

**Equity**: Without intentional efforts to close the digital divide, technology advances will widen disparities between older adults who can access innovations and those left behind.

**Security**: Older adults are disproportionately targeted by scams and fraud, much of it technology-enabled. Protecting this population requires both education and technical safeguards.

## The Technology Paradox for Older Adults

Technology offers solutions to many challenges of aging but simultaneously creates new barriers:

| Challenge | Technology Opportunity | Technology Barrier |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Healthcare access | Telehealth | Digital literacy needed |
| Social isolation | Video calling, social media | Complexity, privacy concerns |
| Cognitive decline | Reminders, assistance apps | Can't learn new interfaces |
| Mobility limitations | Smart home, delivery apps | Need setup, ongoing support |
| Financial management | Online banking | Fraud vulnerability |
| Information access | Internet research | Misinformation, scams |
| Safety monitoring | Sensors, alerts | Privacy invasion |

## Key Reform Priorities

| Priority | Approach | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Close digital divide** | Subsidized access, devices, training | Foundation for all tech benefits |
| **Improve technology design** | Age-friendly design standards; user testing | Make technology usable |
| **Expand telehealth** | Permanent reimbursement; broadband access | Improve healthcare access |
| **Protect from fraud** | Education, technical safeguards, enforcement | Reduce financial harm |
| **Support assistive technology** | Medicare coverage; Medicaid waivers | Extend independence |
| **Enable remote monitoring** | Reimbursement; interoperability standards | Reduce institutionalization |
| **Train caregivers and providers** | Technology competency requirements | Effective implementation |
