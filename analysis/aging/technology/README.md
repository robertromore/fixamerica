# Technology and Aging

Technology holds enormous potential to support healthy aging, extend independence, improve care coordination, and enhance quality of life for older adults. From telehealth and remote monitoring to smart home systems and social connectivity tools, technological innovations can help address many challenges of an aging society. Yet this potential remains largely unrealized due to digital divides, poor design that ignores older users, inadequate reimbursement for technology-enabled care, privacy and security concerns, and lack of evidence for many emerging products. Approximately 25% of Americans over 65 do not use the internet, and even among users, many lack the digital literacy to navigate health portals, use video conferencing, or distinguish legitimate communications from scams. Making technology work for older adults requires intentional design, targeted training, appropriate reimbursement, and policies that ensure both access and protection.
