# Technology and Aging: Legislation

## Overview

Legislative reform to ensure older adults benefit from technology requires action across multiple domains: broadband access and affordability, telehealth coverage and permanence, Medicare coverage of assistive technology, digital literacy programs, fraud prevention, and accessible design standards. This section provides draft federal legislation and state model acts addressing each component, along with analysis of implementation challenges and potential loopholes.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for technology and aging reforms. Federal broadband policy operates under Commerce Clause and Spending Power authority. Medicare and telehealth regulation falls within established congressional power over healthcare programs. Consumer protection and fraud prevention operate under Commerce Clause authority. Accessibility standards can be attached to federal programs through Spending Power.

## Federal Legislation

### Affordable Connectivity Permanence Act

**Purpose**: Make permanent the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to ensure low-income Americans, including seniors, have affordable broadband access.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Affordable Connectivity Permanence Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
    (1) The Affordable Connectivity Program provided broadband subsidies to
        over 23 million American households before its expiration.
    (2) Broadband access is essential for telehealth, government services,
        employment, education, and social connection.
    (3) Approximately 25 percent of Americans over age 65 do not use the
        internet, with cost being a primary barrier for many.
    (4) The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the critical importance of
        broadband connectivity for healthcare access and social connection.
    (5) Low-income households and rural areas are disproportionately
        affected by broadband affordability and availability gaps.

SEC. 3. PERMANENT AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—Section 904 of Division N of the Consolidated
    Appropriations Act, 2021 (47 U.S.C. 1752) is amended to establish
    a permanent Affordable Connectivity Program.

(b) BENEFIT AMOUNT.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—The monthly discount for eligible households shall
        be $30.
    (2) TRIBAL LANDS.—For households on Tribal lands, the monthly
        discount shall be $75.
    (3) CONNECTED DEVICE.—Eligible households may receive a one-time
        discount of $100 toward a connected device (computer, laptop,
        or tablet).

    (1) household income is at or below 200 percent of the Federal
        Poverty Guidelines;
    (2) any member participates in SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, Federal Public
        Housing Assistance, Veterans Pension, or the free/reduced school
        lunch program;
    (3) any member receives a Federal Pell Grant; or
    (4) any member meets eligibility criteria for existing FCC Lifeline
        program.

(d) SENIOR OUTREACH.—The Commission shall conduct targeted outreach to
    adults age 65 and older, including through—
    (1) coordination with the Social Security Administration;

Congress finds the following:
    (1) Approximately 30 million Americans over age 65 have hearing loss.
    (2) Only 30 percent of those who need hearing aids use them.
    (3) Untreated hearing loss is associated with cognitive decline,
        social isolation, depression, and falls.
    (4) The FDA's 2022 OTC hearing aid rule reduced prices but access
        barriers remain for many Medicare beneficiaries.
    (5) Most developed countries include hearing aids in their public
        health coverage.

SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF HEARING AIDS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1862(a)(7) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
    1395y(a)(7)) is amended to exclude hearing aids and related services
