# Technology and Aging: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Implementing technology reforms for older adults requires coordinated action across multiple domains: infrastructure, policy, training, and protection. The strategy prioritizes immediate action on expiring programs and established technologies while building toward longer-term transformation. Success depends on sustaining political momentum through demonstrated results and building coalitions that span traditional political divides.
