### Political Actions

**Federal Advocacy:**

| Issue | Target | Message |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **ACP renewal** | Congress | "Renew and make permanent the Affordable Connectivity Program so low-income seniors don't lose broadband access" |
| **Telehealth permanence** | Congress/CMS | "Make permanent all COVID telehealth flexibilities, including audio-only visits for seniors without video capability" |
| **Medicare hearing aid coverage** | Congress | "Add hearing aid coverage to Medicare to improve access for the 30 million seniors with hearing loss" |
| **Elder fraud prevention** | Congress/FTC | "Increase funding for FTC elder fraud enforcement and require platforms to prevent scam advertising" |
| **Broadband investment** | Congress/FCC | "Complete rural broadband deployment and establish broadband as an essential service" |
| **Digital literacy funding** | Congress/ACL | "Increase OAA funding for technology training programs at senior centers and libraries" |

**Sample Advocacy Messages:**

*For ACP renewal:*

> "I'm calling to urge Congress to renew the Affordable Connectivity Program. The ACP provided $30/month broadband subsidies to 23 million households, including millions of low-income seniors. Without renewal, many older adults will lose their internet connection and access to telehealth, online services, and family communication. Please support permanent ACP funding."

*For telehealth permanence:*

> "I'm calling about Medicare telehealth policy. The COVID emergency showed that telehealth works—43% of Medicare beneficiaries used it. But many temporary flexibilities will expire without Congressional action. Please support legislation making telehealth expansions permanent, including audio-only visits that seniors without broadband can use."

*For fraud prevention:*

> "I'm calling about protecting seniors from fraud. Americans over 60 lost $3.4 billion to scams last year. The FTC and state attorneys general need more resources to investigate and prosecute elder fraud. Please support increased funding for elder fraud enforcement and require platforms to remove scam advertising."

**State Advocacy:**

| Issue | Target | Message |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **State broadband programs** | State legislature | Support state broadband funding and deployment |
| **Municipal broadband** | State legislature | Remove barriers to public broadband networks |
| **Consumer protection** | Attorney General | Strengthen elder fraud enforcement |
| **Medicaid technology waivers** | Medicaid agency | Include technology in HCBS waivers |
| **Senior center funding** | State legislature | Increase funding for technology programs |
