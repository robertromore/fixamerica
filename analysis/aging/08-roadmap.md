## Dependencies and Sequencing

### Critical Path

| Dependency | Enables |
|------------|---------|
| **Workforce investment** | HCBS expansion (need workers to deliver) |
| **Data infrastructure** | Quality improvement, accountability |
| **State capacity** | Federal program implementation |
| **Political coalition** | Legislative victories |

### Sequencing Logic

| Sequence | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Workforce before expansion** | Can't expand services without workers |
| **State pilots before federal** | Demonstrate effectiveness, build support |
| **Administrative before legislative** | Move what can move |
| **Incremental benefits before universal** | Build political support |

| **Industry opposition** | High | Medium | Coalition building; public pressure |
| **Generational backlash** | Low | Medium | Frame as universal benefit; caregiver focus |

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Workforce shortage persists** | High | High | Immigration reform; wage increases |
| **State capacity variation** | Medium | Medium | Technical assistance; enhanced matching |
