# Aging Policy: History

## Historical Development

American aging policy evolved from nonexistence to a complex system of federal programs, reflecting shifting views about government responsibility, family obligation, and individual preparation. Each era's reforms responded to crises while embedding assumptions that shape today's challenges.

## Timeline

### Pre-New Deal Era (Before 1935)

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1880s-1920s | Industrial pensions emerge sporadically; most workers have no retirement security |
| 1870s-1920s | "Poorhouses" serve as primary institutional care for destitute elderly |
| 1920s | Civil War pensions provide limited precedent for federal support |
| 1929-1932 | Great Depression devastates seniors; bank failures wipe out savings |

Before 1935, aging was considered a family responsibility. The destitute elderly lived in poorhouses or depended on charity. State pensions existed in some states but were inadequate. The Great Depression changed public attitudes as millions of seniors faced destitution through no fault of their own.

### New Deal and Social Security (1935-1964)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1935 | Social Security Act creates Old-Age Insurance (OAI), federal-state old-age assistance |
| 1939 | Benefits extended to spouses and survivors |
| 1950 | Amendments expand coverage to additional occupations |
| 1956 | Disability Insurance (SSDI) created |
| 1961 | Early retirement at 62 allowed (reduced benefits) |

**Key Features of 1935 Act**:

- Payroll tax-funded contributory insurance (not welfare)
- Federal-state partnership for old-age assistance
- Unemployment insurance as separate program
- Public health and child welfare provisions

The Social Security Act established the principle of earned benefits tied to work history, distinguishing it from means-tested welfare. However, the original program excluded domestic workers, farmworkers, and the self-employed, disproportionately affecting women and minorities.

### Medicare and Medicaid Era (1965-1979)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1965 | Medicare (Parts A and B) and Medicaid enacted |
| 1965 | Older Americans Act creates Administration on Aging |
| 1972 | SSI replaces state-run old-age assistance |
| 1972 | COLA (cost-of-living adjustments) added to Social Security |
| 1974 | ERISA establishes pension protections |

**Medicare/Medicaid Creation**:

Medicare provided hospital insurance (Part A) and voluntary physician coverage (Part B) for those 65 and older. Medicaid, a federal-state partnership, covered the poor including many elderly needing long-term care.

The Older Americans Act created the "aging network": Area Agencies on Aging, senior centers, nutrition programs, and support services. This community-based infrastructure remains central to aging services.

**Key Gaps from 1965**:

- Medicare excluded long-term care, dental, vision, and hearing
- Medicaid required impoverishment for long-term care eligibility
- No mechanism to coordinate Medicare and Medicaid for dual-eligible beneficiaries

### Fiscal Strain and Reform (1980-1999)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1980 | Nursing Home Reform Act (OBRA '87) enacted |
| 1983 | Social Security amendments raise retirement age, tax benefits |
| 1983 | Medicare Prospective Payment System (DRGs) begins |
| 1988 | Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act (repealed 1989) |
| 1997 | State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP); Medicare+Choice |

**1983 Social Security Rescue**:

Bipartisan commission (Greenspan Commission) addressed projected insolvency through:

- Gradual increase in full retirement age from 65 to 67
- Taxation of benefits for higher earners
- Acceleration of scheduled payroll tax increases
- Coverage of federal employees

**Medicare Catastrophic Failure**:

The 1988 Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act would have added prescription drug coverage and out-of-pocket caps. Fierce opposition from affluent seniors who would pay income-related premiums led to repeal in 1989, a cautionary tale about reform politics.

**OBRA '87 Nursing Home Reform**:

Following scandals and advocacy, reforms required:

- Comprehensive resident assessments
- Care planning and quality assurance
- Limitations on restraints
- Residents' rights protections

### Managed Care and Prescription Drugs (2000-2009)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2000 | CLASS Act proposed (later repealed) |
| 2003 | Medicare Modernization Act adds Part D (prescription drugs) |
| 2006 | Part D implementation begins |
| 2006 | Deficit Reduction Act tightens Medicaid asset transfers |

**Medicare Part D**:

The prescription drug benefit represented Medicare's largest expansion since 1965:

- Private plan delivery (no government-run option)
- Coverage gap ("donut hole") for mid-range spending
- Low-income subsidies
- Prohibition on Medicare negotiating drug prices

The prohibition on price negotiation became increasingly controversial as drug costs soared.

### ACA and Post-ACA Era (2010-2020)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2010 | Affordable Care Act expands Medicaid, enhances Medicare |
| 2011 | CLASS Act repealed (long-term care program deemed unworkable) |
| 2014 | Medicaid expansion begins (in participating states) |
| 2015 | Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) |
| 2019 | RAISE Family Caregivers Act |

**ACA Provisions for Seniors**:

- Gradual closure of Part D donut hole
- Free preventive services
- Enhanced Medicaid HCBS options
- Accountable Care Organizations piloted
- Community First Choice option for states

The ACA's original long-term care provision (CLASS Act) was repealed before implementation when actuaries determined it was financially unsustainable. No replacement was enacted.

**Caregiver Recognition**:

The RAISE Act (Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage) directed HHS to develop a national family caregiving strategy, acknowledging unpaid care's role for the first time at the federal level.

### Recent Developments (2020-Present)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2020 | COVID-19 devastates nursing homes; telehealth expansion |
| 2021 | American Rescue Plan includes HCBS funding, caregiver provisions |
| 2022 | Inflation Reduction Act allows Medicare drug negotiations |
| 2023 | Medicare Advantage enrollment exceeds traditional Medicare |
| 2024 | CMS proposes nursing home staffing minimums |

**COVID-19 Reckoning**:

The pandemic exposed:

- Catastrophic infection control failures in nursing homes
- Staffing shortages and low wages
- Inadequate oversight and enforcement
- Isolation and mental health crises
- Digital divide limiting telehealth access

**Inflation Reduction Act**:

- Medicare can negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs (starting 2026)
- $35/month insulin cap for Medicare beneficiaries
- Out-of-pocket cap ($2,000/year) for Part D (2025)
- Premium growth limits

## Key Legislation

| Legislation | Year | Impact |
|------------|------|--------|
| Social Security Act | 1935 | Created retirement and survivor benefits |
| Medicare/Medicaid | 1965 | Universal senior health coverage, LTC safety net |
| ERISA | 1974 | Pension protections and standards |
| OBRA '87 | 1987 | Nursing home quality requirements |
| Medicare Modernization Act | 2003 | Prescription drug benefit (Part D) |
| Affordable Care Act | 2010 | Enhanced preventive care, HCBS options |
| Inflation Reduction Act | 2022 | Drug price negotiation, insulin cap |

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

- **Contributory social insurance**: Social Security's earned-benefit model built broad political support
- **Bipartisan crisis response**: 1983 reforms saved Social Security through negotiated compromise
- **Quality standards with enforcement**: OBRA '87 improved nursing home conditions where implemented
- **Incremental expansion**: Part D, despite flaws, provided needed coverage

### What Has Failed

- **Means-tested long-term care**: Medicaid's impoverishment requirement forces devastating spend-downs
- **Catastrophic coverage politics**: 1988 repeal showed limits of surtax financing
- **Voluntary long-term care insurance**: Private market never achieved scale
- **CLASS Act**: Voluntary program couldn't achieve actuarial sustainability

### Persistent Gaps

- No universal long-term care financing mechanism
- Medicare-Medicaid coordination remains fragmented
- Workforce investment chronically underfunded
- Rural infrastructure deteriorating
- Dental, vision, and hearing coverage inadequate

## Reform Patterns

Historical patterns suggest:

1. **Crisis drives action**: Major reforms followed Depression (1935), civil rights era (1965), fiscal crises (1983), and pandemic (2020-2022)
2. **Incremental wins possible**: Part D, donut hole closure, and IRA drug provisions passed when comprehensive reform stalled
3. **Financing is decisive**: Programs with dedicated funding (Social Security, Medicare Part A) prove more sustainable than general-fund programs
4. **Politics favor existing beneficiaries**: Reforms that protect current recipients while adjusting future benefits are more viable
5. **Bipartisanship is possible**: Social Security (1983), OBRA '87, and recent nursing home oversight have attracted cross-party support
