# Elder Abuse and Neglect: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Elder abuse reform requires building both the response infrastructure and the prevention capacity while generating political will for sustained investment. The strategy focuses on early wins that demonstrate effectiveness, followed by systemic transformation of adult protective services and related systems.

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Build foundation first** | Strengthen APS before expanding detection |
| **Multiple tracks** | Community, institutional, financial, justice in parallel |
| **Evidence generation** | Demonstrate effectiveness to justify investment |
| **Coalition maintenance** | Keep diverse stakeholders aligned |
| **State partnership** | Federal support with state implementation |

### Political Context

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Bipartisan support | Growing; COVID heightened awareness |
| Advocacy strength | Building; coalitions strengthening |
| Federal budget | Constrained but elder abuse low-cost compared to other programs |
| State interest | Variable; some leading |
| Electoral salience | Moderate; family impact drives attention |
