# Elder Abuse and Neglect: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles

- **Victim-centered**: Prioritize safety and well-being of older adults
- **Prevention-focused**: Stop abuse before it occurs, not just respond after
- **Autonomy-respecting**: Balance protection with self-determination
- **Coordinated**: Integrate systems across sectors
- **Adequately resourced**: Fund systems to meet actual needs
- **Accountable**: Hold perpetrators responsible
- **Evidence-based**: Use data to guide interventions

### Strategic Framework

| Dimension | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Detection | Healthcare screening, financial monitoring, community awareness |
| Response | Adequately funded APS, multidisciplinary teams |
| Prevention | Caregiver support, social connection, financial safeguards |
| Accountability | Prosecution, civil remedies, nursing home enforcement |
| Research | Evidence base for interventions |

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Transform Adult Protective Services Funding

**Description**: Create dedicated federal funding for APS comparable to child protective services, moving from $0.17 to $5+ per capita.

**Key Components**:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Dedicated formula grant | Based on population, need |
| Minimum staffing standards | Caseload limits |
| Training requirements | Standardized curriculum |
| Data collection | National APS reporting system |
| Service provision | Beyond investigation to intervention |

**Evidence**:

- States with higher APS funding have better outcomes
- CPS model demonstrates federal-state partnership works
- Current caseloads prevent adequate investigation
- Services, not just investigation, improve outcomes

**Challenges**:

- Significant cost increase
- State capacity variation
- Federalism concerns
- Defining "adequate" funding level

### Solution 2: Implement Universal Elder Abuse Screening in Healthcare

| Emergency department protocols | Validated screening tools |
| Training requirements | CME on recognition and response |
| Payment codes | Reimbursement for screening time |
| Referral pathways | Clear process to APS and services |

**Evidence**:

- Healthcare sees most older adults
- Validated screening tools exist (e.g., Elder Abuse Suspicion Index)
- Currently only 8% of reports come from healthcare
- Other screenings (depression, falls) are routine and effective

**Challenges**:

- Time constraints in healthcare
- Training infrastructure
- False positive concerns
- Follow-up capacity

### Solution 3: Create Financial Exploitation Prevention Infrastructure

| Transaction hold authority | Delay suspicious transactions |
| Trusted contact designation | Financial institutions contact trusted person |
| Joint account safeguards | Protections against misuse |
| Recovery fund | State-administered victim compensation |
| Prosecution units | Specialized financial crimes units |

**Evidence**:

- Financial exploitation is most common form ($36 billion annually)
- FINRA rules have worked for broker-dealers

- Oversight prevents exploitation
- Other countries use less restrictive approaches

**Challenges**:

- Court capacity
- Definition of capacity
