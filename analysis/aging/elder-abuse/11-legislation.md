# Elder Abuse and Neglect: Legislation

## Overview

Legislative reform to address elder abuse requires a multi-pronged approach: transforming Adult Protective Services (APS) from an underfunded afterthought into a robust federal-state partnership comparable to child protective services; creating a comprehensive financial exploitation prevention infrastructure; strengthening nursing home oversight and enforcement; and building the research and data systems needed to target interventions effectively. This legislative framework addresses all major forms of elder abuse through coordinated federal, state, and regulatory action.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments required. Elder abuse prevention and response fall within existing federal powers including:

- Commerce Clause authority over financial institutions
- Spending power to condition federal funding on state compliance
- Medicare and Medicaid regulatory authority
- Civil rights enforcement powers

## Federal Legislation

### Elder Justice Infrastructure Act of 2025

    compared to $11 per capita for child protective services.

```

**Explanation**: This legislation addresses the fundamental problem of APS underfunding by creating a dedicated formula grant program. The approach mirrors the child protective services model (Title IV-B of the Social Security Act) while maintaining state flexibility. The funding ramp-up allows states to build capacity gradually while establishing national standards.

**Challenges**:

- Budget competition with other priorities
- State capacity to absorb rapid funding increases
- Establishing meaningful standards without excessive federal mandates
- Building the APS workforce

**Refinements**:

- Consider enhanced federal match (75-25) similar to Medicaid to encourage state investment
- Include technical assistance funding to help states build capacity
- Establish workforce development grants parallel to service funding

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Commerce Clause** | Financial institution requirements within federal authority |
| **Spending power** | Federal conditions on state APS funding constitutional if clear |
| **Tenth Amendment** | Cannot commandeer states, but can condition funding |
| **Due process** | Guardianship standards protect, not violate, due process |
| **Takings** | Transaction delays may raise questions; safe harbor addresses |

### Preemption

| Area | Federal-State Relationship |
|------|---------------------------|
| APS standards | Federal floor, states may exceed |
| Financial reporting | Federal minimum, states may add requirements |
| Nursing home staffing | CMS sets floor, states may set higher |
| Guardianship | Federal conditions, state implementation |

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Federal funding conditions | APS grants, Older Americans Act |
| CMS certification | Nursing home participation |
| Financial regulator authority | Examination, enforcement actions |
| DOJ prosecution | Federal financial crimes |
| Private rights of action | Limited, primarily regulatory enforcement |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| State opt-out | States could decline federal APS funding | Medium |
| Staffing exemptions | Rural exemptions could become widespread | High |
| Financial institution size | Small institutions may avoid requirements | Medium |
| Guardian venue shopping | Moving wards across states to avoid oversight | Medium |
| Delayed implementation | Phase-in periods may be extended indefinitely | Medium |
| Reporting thresholds | High thresholds miss smaller exploitation | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Workforce availability | Cannot meet staffing mandates | Training pipeline inadequate |
| Data system delays | Cannot measure progress | Technical complexity |
| Prosecution capacity | Limited accountability | Resource constraints |
| Prevention underfunding | Reactive not proactive | Political priorities |
| Rural access | Geographic disparities persist | Population distribution |
| Self-neglect gap | Most common category least addressed | Intervention limitations |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Address state opt-out risk**: Make APS funding mandatory appropriation like Medicaid rather than discretionary; include maintenance of effort requirements.

2. **Limit staffing exemptions**: Cap exemptions at 10% of facilities per state; require annual reapplication; sunset exemption authority after 5 years.

3. **Include smaller institutions**: Phase in requirements for smaller institutions over longer period; provide technical assistance and compliance support.

4. **Prevent venue shopping**: Require national guardian registry check before any appointment; implement interstate information sharing; adopt uniform jurisdictional rules.

5. **Enforce timelines**: Include automatic triggers if implementation deadlines missed; authorize beneficiary litigation for enforcement delays.

6. **Lower reporting thresholds**: Require reporting of patterns (multiple small transactions), not just individual large transactions; use technology to detect exploitation patterns.
