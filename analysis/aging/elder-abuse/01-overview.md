# Elder Abuse and Neglect

## Overview

Elder abuse is the mistreatment of older adults through physical, emotional, sexual, or financial abuse, neglect, or abandonment. Approximately 1 in 10 Americans aged 60 and older experience some form of elder abuse, yet the problem remains largely hidden due to underreporting, shame, and systemic failures in detection and response. Unlike child abuse, which has robust mandatory reporting systems and child protective services in every state, elder abuse response is fragmented, underfunded, and often inadequate to protect vulnerable adults.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Physical abuse**: Intentional use of force causing injury or pain
- **Emotional/psychological abuse**: Verbal assault, threats, intimidation, isolation
- **Sexual abuse**: Non-consensual sexual contact
- **Financial exploitation**: Illegal or improper use of an elder's funds, property, or assets
- **Neglect**: Failure by caregivers to meet basic needs
- **Self-neglect**: Inability to meet one's own basic needs (often the most common APS category)
- **Abandonment**: Desertion by a person with care responsibility
- **Institutional abuse**: Mistreatment in nursing homes, assisted living, and other facilities

## Key Facts

| Fact | Data |
|------|------|
| Prevalence | 1 in 10 older adults experience elder abuse |
| Annual victims | ~5 million older Americans |
| Reporting rate | Only 1 in 24 cases reported to authorities |
| Financial exploitation | $36.5 billion lost annually |
| Perpetrators | 60% are family members (often adult children) |
| APS funding | $0.17 per capita federal investment |
| Nursing home abuse | 1 in 6 residents experience abuse yearly |
| COVID impact | 84% increase in calls to elder abuse hotlines (2020) |

## Types of Elder Abuse

| Type | Description | Prevalence |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Financial exploitation** | Theft, scams, undue influence | Most common reported type |
| **Neglect** | Failure to provide care | Second most common |
| **Emotional abuse** | Verbal attacks, isolation | Often co-occurs with other types |
| **Physical abuse** | Hitting, restraining, injury | ~2% of older adults annually |
| **Sexual abuse** | Unwanted sexual contact | Under-researched, underreported |
| **Self-neglect** | Cannot care for self | Largest APS caseload |

## Why This Matters

### Human Cost

- **Mortality**: Elder abuse victims have 300% higher mortality risk
- **Health decline**: Abuse accelerates cognitive and physical decline
- **Trauma**: Psychological effects persist even when abuse stops
- **Isolation**: Abusers often isolate victims from support systems
- **Loss of independence**: Abuse may trigger institutional placement

### Economic Cost

| Cost Category | Annual Amount |
|--------------|---------------|
| Financial exploitation losses | $36.5 billion |
| Healthcare costs from abuse | $5.3 billion |
| Lost productivity | Not quantified |
| Institutional care costs | Significant |
| **Total estimated** | **$42+ billion** |

### Social Cost

- **Family devastation**: Abuse often perpetrated by family members
- **Community trust**: Undermines social cohesion
- **Healthcare burden**: Emergency services, long-term care
- **Legal system strain**: Courts, law enforcement, prosecution
- **Social services**: Adult protective services overwhelmed

## Current System Failures

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Underfunding** | APS cannot investigate adequately |
| **Fragmentation** | No federal coordination framework |
| **Training gaps** | Healthcare providers miss signs |
| **Reporting confusion** | Inconsistent mandatory reporting |
| **Prosecution barriers** | Difficult to prosecute; victims reluctant |
| **Civil remedies weak** | Financial exploitation hard to recover |
| **Nursing home oversight** | Insufficient inspection, enforcement |

## Key Policy Questions

1. How can detection and reporting be improved without infringing on autonomy?
2. What funding level is necessary for effective adult protective services?
3. How should financial exploitation be prevented and remedied?
4. What reforms are needed in nursing home oversight?
5. How can the justice system better serve elder abuse victims?
6. What role should healthcare providers play in screening and response?
7. How do we balance protection with self-determination?

## Reform Priorities

| Priority | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **APS funding** | Foundation of response system |
| **Financial exploitation prevention** | Largest category of loss |
| **Healthcare screening** | Detection opportunity |
| **Nursing home quality** | Captive population at risk |
| **Multidisciplinary teams** | Coordinated response |
| **Research investment** | Evidence base still limited |
