# Elder Abuse and Neglect: History

## Historical Development

### Early History

Elder mistreatment has existed throughout human history, but conceptualization as a distinct social problem is relatively recent. Unlike child abuse, which gained public attention in the 1960s, elder abuse did not emerge as a recognized issue until the late 1970s.

| Era | Treatment of Elderly |
|-----|---------------------|
| Pre-industrial | Extended family care; some abandonment |
| Industrial era | Poorhouses for indigent elderly |
| Early 20th century | Growth of institutional care |
| Mid-20th century | Social Security, Medicare changed elder care |
| 1970s-present | Recognition of elder abuse as social problem |

### Before Recognition

| Period | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Colonial era** | Family responsibility; poorhouses for those without family |
| **19th century** | Almshouses, "old age homes" emerge |
| **Early 1900s** | Some states pass "relatives' responsibility" laws |
| **1930s-1960s** | Social Security, nursing homes develop |
| **1960s-1970s** | Nursing home scandals draw attention |

### Discovery of Elder Abuse (1975-1985)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1975 | British researcher describes "granny battering" |
| 1978 | First congressional hearings on elder abuse |
| 1979 | First state APS laws specifically for elders |
| 1981 | House Select Committee on Aging begins investigations |
| 1985 | Surgeon General's Workshop on Elder Abuse |

## Key Turning Points

### Congressional Awareness (1978-1981)

- **1978**: Representative Claude Pepper holds first congressional hearings
- **1981**: House Select Committee on Aging publishes "Elder Abuse: An Examination of a Hidden Problem"
- Report estimated 1 million elderly Americans abused annually
- Called for federal response similar to child abuse

### State APS Development (1980s)

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| All states establish APS | By 1985, every state had some form of adult protective services |
| Mandatory reporting laws | Most states adopt mandatory reporting for professionals |
| Model legislation | National guidelines developed but not adopted uniformly |

### Nursing Home Reform (1987)

**OBRA 1987** (Nursing Home Reform Act):

| Provision | Significance |
|-----------|--------------|
| Resident rights | First federal statement of nursing home resident rights |
| Quality standards | Minimum requirements for care |
| Survey process | Annual inspections required |
| Enforcement | Civil monetary penalties authorized |

This was the most significant federal legislation addressing institutional elder abuse until the Elder Justice Act.

### The Long Delay (1990-2010)

| Effort | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Elder Justice Act introduced | 2002 (first version) |
| Multiple reintroductions | 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009 |
| Obstacles | Cost concerns, complexity, competing priorities |
| Duration to passage | 8 years from introduction to enactment |

### Elder Justice Act (2010)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enacted | As part of Affordable Care Act |
| Authorized | Federal coordination, research, training |
| Funding | $777 million authorized over 4 years |
| Actual appropriation | Minimal until 2015 |

### Evolution of Understanding

| Era | Conceptualization |
|-----|-------------------|
| **1970s** | "Granny battering" - physical abuse focus |
| **1980s** | Multiple forms recognized; caregiver stress theory |
| **1990s** | Financial exploitation gains attention |
| **2000s** | Self-neglect debate; institutional abuse focus |
| **2010s** | Scams, exploitation, dementia-related abuse |
| **2020s** | COVID-related isolation; technology-enabled exploitation |

## Comparison with Child Protective Services

### Why CPS Developed Differently

| Factor | Child Abuse | Elder Abuse |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Moral clarity | Children always seen as innocent victims | Adults presumed autonomous |
| Political appeal | "Save the children" | Ageism reduces urgency |
| Federal response | CAPTA (1974) with dedicated funding | EJA (2010) with minimal funding |
| Per capita investment | ~$11 federal | $0.17 federal |
| System maturity | 50+ years of development | 40+ years, less developed |

### Lessons from CPS Development

| CPS Element | APS Equivalent | Gap |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| CAPTA funding | EJA formula grants | ~65x less per capita |
| National hotline | Eldercare Locator | Less known, different function |
| National database | No equivalent | Data collection fragmented |
| Court involvement | Limited | Adults can refuse services |

## Historical Nursing Home Scandals

### Key Scandals That Drove Reform

| Year | Scandal | Response |
|------|---------|----------|
| 1970 | Nursing home fires (multiple) | State fire safety regulations |
| 1974 | Long Island nursing home expose | State reform efforts |
| 1983 | California investigations | State quality initiatives |
| 1986 | Institute of Medicine report | Led to OBRA 1987 |
| 2000s | GAO reports on abuse | Increased CMS attention |
| 2020-21 | COVID nursing home deaths | Proposed staffing mandates |

### The Institute of Medicine Report (1986)

*"Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes"*

| Finding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Widespread quality problems | Documented extent of issues |
| Staffing shortfalls | Identified as root cause |
| Inadequate oversight | Called for reform |
| Resident rights | Conceptualized care recipient rights |

This report directly led to OBRA 1987, the most significant nursing home reform.

## Evolution of Research

### Early Research (1980s)

| Focus | Findings |
|-------|----------|
| Prevalence | First estimates (~1 million) |
| Risk factors | Caregiver stress theory dominant |
| Perpetrators | Focus on family caregivers |
| Settings | Community-dwelling emphasis |

### Modern Research (2000s-Present)

| Advancement | Contribution |
|-------------|--------------|
| Better prevalence data | Meta-analyses showing 10% rate |
| Financial exploitation focus | Documented scale ($36B+) |
| Institutional research | Nursing home quality measures |
| Intervention research | Limited but growing |
| Neuroscience | Understanding vulnerability in dementia |

### Research Gaps Identified Over Time

| Era | Identified Gaps |
|-----|-----------------|
| 1980s | Basic prevalence data needed |
| 1990s | Intervention effectiveness unknown |
| 2000s | Financial exploitation under-studied |
| 2010s | Implementation science lacking |
| 2020s | Technology-enabled abuse; COVID impacts |

## Failed Legislative Efforts

### What Didn't Pass

| Effort | Year | Reason for Failure |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| Elder abuse dedicated funding | 1990s | Budget concerns |
| National APS standards | Various | Federalism concerns |
| Nursing home ratio mandates | Various | Industry opposition |
| Financial exploitation federal crime | Various | Complexity |

### Elder Justice Act Delays

| Obstacle | Nature |
|----------|--------|
| Cost concerns | CBO scoring |
| Complexity | Multiple domains |
| Competing priorities | Other health legislation |
| Industry opposition | Some provisions opposed |
| Federalism | State vs. federal role |

## State Innovation

### States That Led Reform

| State | Innovation | Year |
|-------|------------|------|
| California | Elder abuse prosecution units | 1990s |
| Texas | APS reorganization | 2000s |
| New York | Financial exploitation task force | 2010s |
| Massachusetts | MDT model | 1990s |
| Washington | Adult family home standards | 2000s |

### Multidisciplinary Teams (MDTs)

| Phase | Development |
|-------|-------------|
| **Origins** | 1980s geriatric evaluation teams |
| **Expansion** | 1990s MDTs for complex cases |
| **Federal support** | 2000s Elder Abuse Forensic Centers |
| **Current** | Growing but not universal |

## Lessons from History

### What Worked

| Success | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| OBRA 1987 | Federal standards can drive improvement |
| Mandatory reporting | Increases detection |
| MDTs | Coordination improves outcomes |
| Ombudsman program | Independent advocacy matters |

### What Hasn't Worked

| Failure | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| Chronic underfunding | Unfunded mandates don't work |
| Fragmented response | Need federal coordination |
| Enforcement gaps | Standards without teeth are meaningless |
| Research neglect | Evidence base still weak |

### Unresolved Tensions

| Tension | Challenge |
|---------|-----------|
| Protection vs. autonomy | Adults can refuse help |
| Federal vs. state role | Federalism complicates response |
| Criminal vs. civil response | Different approaches needed |
| Prevention vs. response | Most resources go to response |
