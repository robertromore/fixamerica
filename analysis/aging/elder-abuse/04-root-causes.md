# Elder Abuse and Neglect: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

Elder abuse persists because of intersecting failures across multiple systems: an underfunded and fragmented protective services infrastructure, social and cultural factors that enable abuse, healthcare systems that fail to detect, and economic structures that create vulnerability. Unlike child abuse, where the response system has had 50 years of federal investment, elder abuse response remains chronically under-resourced and inconsistent.

## Individual and Interpersonal Factors

### Victim Vulnerability Factors

| Factor | How It Creates Vulnerability |
|--------|------------------------------|
| **Cognitive impairment** | Cannot recognize, report, or resist abuse |
| **Physical dependence** | Reliance on abuser for daily needs |
| **Social isolation** | No one to notice or intervene |
| **Financial insecurity** | Desperation, dependence on others |
| **Fear of consequences** | Loss of relationship, institutionalization |
| **Shame** | Embarrassment about victimization |

### Perpetrator Risk Factors

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Caregiver burden** | Stress leads to neglect or abuse |
| **Financial problems** | Desperation leads to exploitation |
| **Substance abuse** | Impaired judgment, disinhibition |
| **Mental illness** | Poor impulse control, delusions |
| **History of violence** | Pattern continuation |
| **Dependency on victim** | Role reversal; resentment |

### Relationship Dynamics

| Dynamic | How It Enables Abuse |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Power imbalance** | Victim depends on perpetrator |
| **Social isolation** | Abuser controls access to others |
| **Normalization** | "Always been this way" |
| **Intergenerational cycles** | Learned behavior |
| **Role reversal** | Adult child dependent on parent |

## Social and Cultural Causes

### Ageism

| Manifestation | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| **Devaluation of elderly** | Less urgency about their victimization |
| **Assumption of decline** | Injuries attributed to "normal aging" |
| **Invisibility** | Older adults marginalized in society |
| **"Old people problems"** | Lower political priority |
| **Healthcare rationing** | Less aggressive investigation |

### Family Norms

| Norm | How It Enables Abuse |
|------|---------------------|
| **"Family business" privacy** | Outsiders don't intervene |
| **Expectation of family care** | Creates caregiver burden without support |
| **Inheritance expectations** | Financial pressure on elders |
| **Obligation without resources** | Unprepared caregivers |
| **"Honor thy parents"** | Shame in admitting family abuse |

### Societal Attitudes

| Attitude | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| **"They're going to die anyway"** | Reduces urgency |
| **Victim-blaming** | "Why didn't they just leave?" |
| **Therapeutic nihilism** | "Nothing can be done" |
| **Stigma around aging** | Reluctance to discuss |
| **Death denial** | Avoid addressing end-of-life issues |

## System Failures

### Adult Protective Services

| Failure | Cause | Consequence |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Chronic underfunding** | Low political priority | High caseloads, inadequate investigation |
| **No federal standards** | Federalism | Inconsistent practice across states |
| **Training deficits** | Resource constraints | Workers unprepared for complex cases |
| **Limited services** | Budget gaps | Can investigate but not help |
| **No prevention mandate** | Reactive design | Responds only after harm occurs |

### Healthcare System

| Failure | Cause | Consequence |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **No routine screening** | No payment, no mandate | Cases go undetected |
| **Training gaps** | Curriculum neglect | Providers don't recognize abuse |
| **Time constraints** | Payment models | No time for sensitive discussions |
| **Documentation failures** | Inconsistent standards | Evidence not preserved |
| **Siloed information** | Fragmented records | Pattern not visible |

### Justice System

| Failure | Cause | Consequence |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Prosecution barriers** | Evidence, victim issues | <5% cases prosecuted |
| **Capacity concerns** | Cognitive impairment | Cases dismissed |
| **Resource constraints** | Low priority | Elder abuse units rare |
| **Civil remedy limits** | Legal complexity | Victims can't recover losses |
| **Guardianship problems** | Insufficient oversight | Guardians may be abusers |

### Financial System

| Failure | Cause | Consequence |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Limited oversight** | Privacy concerns | Exploitation not detected |
| **No recovery mechanism** | Legal complexity | Losses not recovered |
| **Inadequate reporting** | Liability fears | Banks don't report |
| **Product complexity** | Financial innovation | Elders confused, exploited |
| **Lack of coordination** | Siloed regulators | No unified response |

## Institutional Causes (Nursing Homes)

### Structural Problems

| Problem | Root Cause | Effect |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Inadequate staffing** | Reimbursement rates, profit extraction | Neglect, abuse |
| **High turnover** | Low wages, poor conditions | Inconsistent care, no relationships |
| **Minimal training** | Weak requirements | Staff unprepared for dementia care |
| **Profit motive** | For-profit ownership | Cost-cutting over quality |
| **Regulatory capture** | Industry influence | Weak enforcement |

### Oversight Failures

| Failure | Cause | Consequence |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Infrequent surveys** | Underfunding | Annual inspections miss problems |
| **Predictable timing** | System design | Facilities prepare for inspections |
| **Weak enforcement** | Industry lobbying | Low fines, rarely imposed |
| **Complaint delays** | Backlog | Residents harmed while waiting |
| **Information gaps** | Poor data systems | Pattern recognition difficult |

## Economic and Structural Causes

### Healthcare Financing

| Structure | How It Creates Risk |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **No LTC Medicare benefit** | Families bear costs; caregiver stress |
| **Medicaid spend-down** | Financial desperation; asset transfer schemes |
| **Low Medicaid rates** | Nursing home understaffing |
| **Fee-for-service** | No coordination payment |
| **Home care gaps** | Insufficient support for community living |

### Income Insecurity

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Retirement savings gaps** | Financial vulnerability |
| **Fixed income** | Inflation erodes purchasing power |
| **Healthcare costs** | Drain resources |
| **Housing costs** | Force living with family or institutions |
| **Predatory targeting** | Scammers target those with assets |

### Caregiver Economics

| Factor | How It Creates Risk |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Unpaid caregiving** | Stress without compensation |
| **Work-family conflict** | Caregivers lose income |
| **No paid leave** | Financial pressure |
| **No respite** | Burnout |
| **Cost of care** | Family financial stress |

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from Status Quo

| Beneficiary | How |
|-------------|-----|
| **Nursing home industry** | Weak oversight allows profit extraction |
| **Financial services** | Exploit elder assets without accountability |
| **Scammers** | Weak prosecution enables fraud |
| **States** | Low APS investment saves money |
| **Abusive family members** | Little accountability for exploitation |

### Political Obstacles

| Obstacle | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Ageism** | Low political priority |
| **Budget competition** | Other programs prioritized |
| **Federalism** | Responsibility diffused |
| **Industry lobbying** | Weakens oversight proposals |
| **Complexity** | Hard to message simply |

### Power Imbalances

| Imbalance | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Victims lack voice** | Cognitive impairment, isolation |
| **Industry well-organized** | Advocacy weak by comparison |
| **Family privacy norms** | Intervention seen as intrusion |
| **Criminal justice priority** | Other crimes take precedence |
