# Elder Abuse and Neglect

Elder abuse is the mistreatment of older adults through physical, emotional, sexual, or financial abuse, neglect, or abandonment. Approximately 1 in 10 Americans aged 60 and older experience some form of elder abuse, yet the problem remains largely hidden due to underreporting, shame, and systemic failures in detection and response. Unlike child abuse, which has robust mandatory reporting systems and child protective services in every state, elder abuse response is fragmented, underfunded, and often inadequate to protect vulnerable adults.
