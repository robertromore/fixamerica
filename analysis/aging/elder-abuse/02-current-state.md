# Elder Abuse and Neglect: Current State

## Present Conditions

Elder abuse affects approximately 5 million older Americans annually, but the true scope is unknown due to severe underreporting. Adult Protective Services (APS) agencies in all 50 states receive and investigate reports, but systems vary dramatically in capacity, authority, and effectiveness. The response system remains grossly underfunded compared to child protective services, despite serving a larger and growing population.
