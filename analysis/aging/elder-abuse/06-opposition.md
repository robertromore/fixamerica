|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Fiscal conservatives** | New spending | Government overreach, cost |
| **States' rights advocates** | Federal standards | Federalism, local control |
| **Privacy advocates** | Reporting requirements | Government intrusion |

| **Anti-regulation** | Industry mandates | Free market principles |

## Opposition Arguments

### Argument 1: "APS Funding Is a State Responsibility"

**Claim**: Elder abuse is a state issue; federal funding creates dependency and one-size-fits-all mandates.

**Reality**:

- Child protective services has federal funding (CAPTA) with state flexibility
- States receive 65x less per capita for APS than CPS
- Inconsistent state systems mean unequal protection based on geography
- Federal coordination is essential for cross-state exploitation
- States can maintain flexibility within federal framework

**Who makes this argument**: Some governors, fiscal conservatives, states' rights advocates.

### Argument 2: "Nursing Home Staffing Mandates Are Unfunded"

**Claim**: Federal staffing requirements without corresponding funding increases will force facilities to close, reducing access to care.

**Reality**:

- Many facilities have staffing well below safe levels
- Adequate staffing reduces hospitalizations, saving money
- Facilities extract profits while claiming insufficient funds
- Medicaid rate increases should accompany requirements
- Quality should not be optional

**Who makes this argument**: American Health Care Association, for-profit chains.

### Argument 3: "Financial Reporting Violates Privacy"

**Claim**: Requiring banks to report suspected exploitation violates customer privacy and creates liability concerns.

**Reality**:

- Banks already report suspicious activity for other crimes
- FINRA has implemented reporting with safeguards
- Privacy can be balanced with protection
- Current exploitation costs $36 billion annually
- Other countries have mandatory reporting with privacy protections

**Who makes this argument**: Banking industry, privacy advocates.

### Argument 4: "Mandatory Reporting Creates False Accusations"

**Claim**: Expanding mandatory reporting leads to unfounded investigations that harm families.

**Reality**:

- Current underreporting is the bigger problem (1 in 24 cases reported)
- Reporting triggers investigation, not automatic action
- Adults can refuse services; autonomy protected
- False report rates are low in existing systems
- Benefits of detection outweigh risks of investigation

**Who makes this argument**: Some family advocates, privacy advocates.

### Argument 5: "Adults Have a Right to Make Bad Decisions"

**Claim**: Protective interventions violate the autonomy of competent adults.

**Reality**:

- APS respects autonomy; competent adults can refuse services
- Many victims have cognitive impairment affecting decision-making
- Exploitation involves manipulation that negates true consent
- Protection and autonomy can coexist
- "Capacity" is complex and context-dependent

**Who makes this argument**: Libertarians, some disability rights advocates.

### Argument 6: "Healthcare Screening Is Too Burdensome"

**Claim**: Requiring elder abuse screening in healthcare settings adds burden without benefit.

**Reality**:

- Healthcare providers see most older adults
- Brief screening tools exist and can be integrated
- Detection enables intervention
- Other screenings (depression, falls) are routine
- Early detection prevents escalation

**Who makes this argument**: Healthcare industry, some physician groups.

### Argument 7: "Criminal Prosecution Is Too Difficult"

**Claim**: Elder abuse cases are inherently difficult to prosecute; resources should go elsewhere.

**Reality**:

- Specialized units have proven successful
- Training improves prosecution rates
- Victims deserve justice regardless of difficulty
- Civil remedies can complement criminal
- Deterrence requires some accountability

**Who makes this argument**: Some prosecutors, budget advocates.

### Argument 8: "Guardianship Reform Threatens Vulnerable Adults"

**Claim**: Limiting guardianship makes it harder to protect vulnerable adults from themselves.

**Reality**:

- Current system enables guardian abuse
- Less restrictive alternatives exist
- Due process protections are constitutionally required
- Reform targets abusive guardians, not protective ones
- Supported decision-making can maintain autonomy

**Who makes this argument**: Some guardianship attorneys, professional guardians.
