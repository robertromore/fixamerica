# Aging Policy: Legislation

## Overview

Aging policy reform requires action across multiple legislative domains: retirement security, health care, long-term care, caregiving support, and quality oversight. This section provides draft legislation, model state bills, and regulatory frameworks to address the challenges outlined in previous sections.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for most aging policy reforms. Federal authority rests on well-established foundations:

- **Commerce Clause**: Regulation of health insurance, employment standards
- **Spending Clause**: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security programs
- **Tax powers**: Payroll taxes, retirement savings incentives

Congress has broad authority to reform existing programs and create new ones within these constitutional boundaries.

## Federal Legislation

### Social Security 2100 Act

**Purpose**: Restore long-term solvency while expanding benefits for low-income beneficiaries and caregivers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Social Security 2100 Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) Social Security provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to
    67 million Americans;
(2) the Social Security trust funds face projected depletion by 2032 under
    current law;
(3) benefit adequacy has eroded as the cost-of-living adjustment fails to
    reflect actual senior expenses; and
(4) targeted reforms can restore solvency while improving benefits for those
    most in need.

SEC. 3. REVENUE PROVISIONS.
(a) PAYROLL TAX CAP.—
    (1) Section 230(b) of the Social Security Act is amended to apply the
        full OASDI tax rate to wages above $400,000.
    (2) The contribution and benefit base shall continue to apply for
        benefit calculation purposes up to $168,600 (as adjusted).

(b) INVESTMENT INCOME.—
    (1) A tax of 12.4 percent is imposed on net investment income
        (as defined in section 1411 of the Internal Revenue Code) above
        $250,000 for joint filers.
    (2) Revenues shall be credited to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors
        Insurance Trust Fund.

(c) PAYROLL TAX RATE.—
    (1) The OASDI tax rate shall increase by 0.1 percentage point per year
        for 20 years, split equally between employer and employee.

SEC. 4. BENEFIT IMPROVEMENTS.
(a) MINIMUM BENEFIT.—
    (1) A new special minimum benefit shall provide 125 percent of the
        federal poverty level for workers with 30 years of covered employment.
    (2) The minimum shall be prorated for workers with 10-29 years.

(b) COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT.—
    (1) The COLA shall be calculated using the Consumer Price Index for
        the Elderly (CPI-E) in lieu of the CPI-W.

(c) CAREGIVER CREDITS.—
    (1) Up to 5 years of deemed wages at 50 percent of the national
        average wage shall be credited for periods of unpaid caregiving
        for a child under 6 or an adult with functional impairment.
    (2) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for verification.

SEC. 5. BENEFIT TAXATION.
(a) The income thresholds for taxation of Social Security benefits shall be
    adjusted annually for inflation beginning in the taxable year following
    enactment.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
(a) Revenue provisions take effect January 1 of the calendar year following
    enactment.
(b) Benefit improvements take effect for benefits payable after the second
    calendar year following enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- Revenue provisions raise approximately 75% of funds needed for 75-year solvency
- Payroll tax increase is gradual (0.1%/year over 20 years) to minimize economic impact
- High-income cap targets those most able to contribute
- Benefit improvements help lowest earners and recognize caregiver contributions
- CPI-E better reflects actual senior spending patterns (higher health, housing weights)

**Challenges**:

- Requires bipartisan negotiation (historically difficult)
- Investment income tax may face opposition
- Benefits industry may oppose caregiver credits

**Refinements**:

- Consider alternative phase-in schedules
- Evaluate interaction with other retirement savings incentives
- Include hardship exemption for small businesses

### Medicare Benefit Expansion Act

(b) The Secretary shall establish a mechanism for tracking cumulative
    out-of-pocket costs and notifying beneficiaries and providers when
    the limit is reached.

SEC. 6. FINANCING.
(a) PREMIUM ADJUSTMENT.—Part B and D premiums shall be adjusted as
    necessary to cover 25 percent of new benefit costs.

(b) HIGH-INCOME SURCHARGE.—The income-related monthly adjustment amount
    under section 1839(i) shall be increased to cover additional costs
    for beneficiaries with modified adjusted gross income above $150,000.

    reduced by 2 percentage points to fund traditional Medicare benefits.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.
Benefits shall be available beginning with the plan year that is 2 years
after enactment to allow for implementation.
```

**Explanation**:

- Addresses three most-requested Medicare benefit gaps
- Phased cost-sharing reduces initial fiscal impact
- Out-of-pocket cap provides catastrophic protection absent in traditional Medicare
- Financing balances premiums, high-income contributions, and MA savings

### Care Workforce Investment Act

**Purpose**: Establish federal standards and funding for care worker wages, benefits, and training.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Care Workforce Investment Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
    (1) the United States will need 8.3 million paid caregivers by 2033;
    (2) current median wages of $15.77 per hour are insufficient to
        recruit and retain workers;
    (3) annual turnover exceeds 65 percent, undermining care quality; and
    (4) the care workforce is disproportionately women (87 percent) and
        people of color (62 percent), reflecting historical undervaluation.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to establish wage floors, benefit
    standards, and training pathways that recognize care work as essential
    infrastructure.

SEC. 3. WAGE AND BENEFIT STANDARDS.
(a) MINIMUM WAGE.—
    (1) Effective 2 years after enactment, the minimum wage for workers
        providing services reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or other
        federal health programs shall be not less than 150 percent of
        the federal minimum wage or $17 per hour, whichever is higher.
    (2) The Secretary shall adjust this floor annually based on the
        Consumer Price Index.

(b) BENEFITS.—
    (1) Employers of 10 or more care workers receiving federal health
        program reimbursement shall provide—
        (A) health insurance meeting minimum essential coverage standards;
        (B) at least 5 days of paid sick leave annually; and
        (C) access to a retirement savings plan with employer contribution.

(a) GRANTS.—The Secretary shall award competitive grants to—
    (1) establish registered apprenticeship programs for home health aides,
        certified nursing assistants, and related occupations;
    (2) create career ladder programs enabling advancement from entry-level
        positions to licensed practical nurse or registered nurse; and
    (3) develop specialized training in dementia care, behavioral health,
        and palliative care.

(b) AUTHORIZATION.—There is authorized to be appropriated $2,000,000,000
    annually for fiscal years 2026 through 2035.

SEC. 5. LOAN FORGIVENESS.
(a) GERIATRIC WORKFORCE.—The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program under
    section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act is amended to provide
    accelerated forgiveness (5 years) for—
    (1) geriatricians and geriatric psychiatrists;
    (2) nurse practitioners and physician assistants specializing in
        geriatrics; and
    (3) social workers in aging services.

SEC. 6. IMMIGRATION PROVISIONS.

    create a nonimmigrant visa category for care workers with—
    (1) demonstrated training or experience in caregiving;
    (2) a job offer from a qualifying employer; and
    (3) a path to permanent residence after 5 years of employment.

(b) ANNUAL CAP.—Not more than 50,000 such visas shall be issued annually.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.
Unless otherwise specified, this Act takes effect 1 year after enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- Wage floor linked to federal minimum wage ensures ongoing relevance
- Benefit requirements improve job quality without mandating full-time status
- Training grants build pipeline while career ladders retain experienced workers
- Immigration provisions address demographic reality of care workforce needs

### Medicaid HCBS Entitlement Act

**Purpose**: Convert optional home and community-based services to mandatory Medicaid coverage, eliminating waitlists.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Medicaid HCBS Entitlement Act".

SEC. 2. MANDATORY HCBS COVERAGE.
(a) Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to add:
    "(87) provide home and community-based services to all individuals
    who—
        "(A) meet nursing facility level of care criteria; and
        "(B) would be eligible for Medicaid if residing in a nursing

    There is authorized $5,000,000,000 for this purpose.

SEC. 4. QUALITY STANDARDS.
(a) The Secretary shall establish minimum quality standards including—
    (1) worker training and supervision requirements;
    (2) person-centered service planning;
    (3) incident reporting and investigation; and
    (4) outcome measurement and reporting.

(b) CONSUMER DIRECTION.—All states must offer a self-directed services
    option allowing beneficiaries to hire, train, and supervise their
    own workers, including family members.

SEC. 5. MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT.
(a) A state may not reduce its expenditures for institutional long-term
    care below the level in effect on the date of enactment, adjusted
    for changes in the nursing facility population.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
(a) The entitlement under section 2 takes effect 3 years after enactment.
(b) Enhanced matching under section 3(a) takes effect upon enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- Converts optional waiver coverage to mandatory entitlement
- 90% federal match incentivizes state participation
- Transition grants address existing 650,000-person waitlist
- Consumer direction requirement honors autonomy
- MOE prevents states from simply shifting to HCBS while closing nursing homes

## Regulatory Framework

### CMS Care Worker Standards Rule

**Existing Authority**: Section 1902(a)(30)(A) requiring payments sufficient to ensure access.

**Draft Regulation**:

| Provision | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Wage floor** | Medicaid HCBS rates must support wages at least 150% of state minimum wage |
| **Pass-through** | 80% of rate increases must flow to worker wages |
| **Reporting** | Providers must report worker compensation data annually |
| **Transparency** | CMS publishes state-by-state wage data publicly |

### CMS Nursing Home Staffing Rule

**Existing Authority**: Section 1819(d)(4)(B) requiring sufficient nursing staff.

**Draft Regulation**:

| Provision | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Total staffing** | 3.48 HPRD minimum (phase to 4.1 over 5 years) |
| **RN staffing** | 0.55 HPRD minimum (phase to 0.75) |
| **24/7 RN** | RN on site at all times |
| **Hardship exemption** | Available for rural facilities meeting criteria |
| **Enforcement** | CMP for staffing deficiencies; public posting |

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Spending Clause** | Congress may condition Medicaid funds on quality and wage requirements (South Dakota v. Dole) |
| **Commerce Clause** | Regulation of nursing homes and health insurers within commerce power |
| **Takings** | Reasonable rate-setting does not constitute taking (no property right in Medicaid participation) |
| **Federalism** | States remain free to exceed federal minimums; can decline Medicaid |

### Preemption Questions

| Area | Approach |
|------|----------|
| **State labor laws** | Federal standards should set floor, not ceiling |
| **State Medicaid** | Federal minimum requirements with state flexibility |
| **Scope-of-practice** | Defer to state licensing; encourage interstate compacts |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Civil monetary penalties** | Nursing home violations; increased amounts |
| **Qui tam** | Allow whistleblowers to recover for Medicaid fraud |
| **Private right of action** | For wage violations; resident rights |
| **Conditions of participation** | Termination for repeated serious deficiencies |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Contractor reclassification** | Employers classify workers as independent contractors to avoid wage/benefit requirements | High |
| **Related party transactions** | Nursing homes shift revenue to related entities, circumventing spending requirements | High |
| **Geographic gaming** | Providers locate in areas with lower minimum wages | Medium |
| **Acuity manipulation** | Facilities inflate resident acuity to justify staffing exemptions | Medium |
| **Benefit waiver** | Workers pressured to waive benefits | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Rural workforce shortage** | Access gaps despite wage increases | Underlying labor market constraints |
| **Implementation lag** | Workers don't see benefits immediately | Phased implementation timelines |
| **Administrative burden** | Small providers struggle with reporting | Compliance complexity |
| **Enforcement capacity** | Limited surveyors to monitor compliance | Agency resource constraints |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Contractor classification**: Adopt ABC test for worker classification; require certification of employment status
2. **Related party transactions**: Cap related party payments; require arm's-length pricing; enhanced disclosure
3. **Geographic gaming**: Index wage floors to local cost of living; require geographic-specific reporting
4. **Acuity manipulation**: Independent assessment protocols; penalties for systematic upcoding
5. **Benefit waivers**: Prohibit waivers as condition of employment; penalty for coercion
6. **Rural shortages**: Immigration provisions; telehealth flexibility; regional training centers
7. **Enforcement**: Dedicated funding for surveyor training and staffing; third-party audits

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Data infrastructure**: Requires coordinated data systems across Medicare, Medicaid, and state agencies
- **Workforce development timeline**: Training pipelines take years to produce results
- **State variation**: Wide differences in baseline conditions and administrative capacity
- **Provider sustainability**: Some providers may exit rather than comply; transition planning needed
