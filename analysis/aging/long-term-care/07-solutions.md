# Long-Term Care: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- **Universal coverage**: Everyone should have access to affordable LTC
- **Choice and autonomy**: People should choose where and how they receive care
- **Home-first bias**: Support aging in place when possible
- **Quality assurance**: Care must meet meaningful standards
- **Workforce dignity**: Caregivers deserve living wages and respect
- **Family support**: Recognize and support unpaid caregivers
- **Financial protection**: No one should face impoverishment for care needs
- **Sustainability**: Financing must be actuarially sound

### Reform Categories

|----------|------|-------------------|
| **Financing** | Universal coverage | Social insurance, Medicaid expansion |
| **Rebalancing** | HCBS over institutions | Entitlement, incentives |
| **Quality** | Better outcomes | Staffing, transparency, enforcement |
| **Workforce** | Stable, skilled caregivers | Wages, training, careers |
| **Family support** | Sustain informal care | Respite, payments, leave |
