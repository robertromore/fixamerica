# Long-Term Care: History

## Pre-Modern Era (Before 1935)

### Traditional Care Arrangements

| Era | Care Pattern |
|-----|--------------|
| Colonial | Family responsibility; almshouses for destitute |
| 19th century | Poor farms; charitable homes for elderly |
| Early 1900s | Hospitals excluded chronic patients |
| 1920s-1930s | Boarding houses; "old age homes" |

Long-term care was historically a family and charitable responsibility. Government involvement was limited to "indoor relief" through almshouses and poor farms that provided minimal custodial care to those with no family support.

### Emergence of Nursing Homes

The modern nursing home industry emerged from several sources:

- **Boarding houses** that specialized in elderly care
- **Charitable homes** operated by religious and fraternal organizations
- **Former hospitals** that transitioned to chronic care
- **Proprietary facilities** emerging in the 1930s

## Social Security Era (1935-1965)

### Old-Age Assistance and Its Consequences

The Social Security Act of 1935 inadvertently shaped long-term care:

| Provision | Effect on LTC |
|-----------|---------------|
| Old-Age Assistance (OAA) | Cash assistance to needy elderly |
| Public institution exclusion | OAA prohibited payment to public institution residents |
| Private nursing home growth | Exclusion drove shift to private facilities |

The prohibition on OAA payments to residents of public institutions was intended to encourage alternatives to poor farms. Instead, it stimulated growth of private (often proprietary) nursing homes that could receive OAA payments.

### Nursing Home Industry Growth

| Year | Nursing Home Beds |
|------|-------------------|
| 1939 | 25,000 |
| 1950 | 180,000 |
| 1960 | 450,000 |
| 1965 | 570,000 |

The industry grew rapidly but with minimal regulation and significant quality problems.

## Medicare and Medicaid Era (1965-1980)

### 1965: Medicare and Medicaid Creation

| Program | LTC Coverage |
|---------|--------------|
| **Medicare** | Limited post-acute care (skilled nursing only, 100-day maximum) |
| **Medicaid** | Nursing home coverage for eligible poor |

Key decisions in 1965:

- Medicare explicitly excluded long-term care (political choice to limit costs)
- Medicaid made nursing home coverage mandatory for categorically needy
- No corresponding mandate for home care

### Nursing Home Expansion

| Year | Nursing Home Beds | Medicaid Spending |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1967 | 800,000 | $1.3 billion |
| 1970 | 1,000,000 | $4.0 billion |
| 1975 | 1,300,000 | $8.0 billion |
| 1980 | 1,500,000 | $14.0 billion |

Medicaid funding drove massive nursing home construction, often with minimal quality oversight.

### Quality Scandals

The 1970s saw widespread nursing home scandals:

- **1970**: Senate hearings expose "warehousing" of elderly
- **1974**: Firestone scandal in Ohio (patient abuse)
- **1975**: New York nursing home scandals
- **1978**: GAO reports systematic quality failures

### Early Home Care Programs

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1967 | Medicaid authorizes limited home health |
| 1971 | Section 1115 waiver authority created |
| 1973 | Social Services Block Grant includes home care |
| 1975 | Title XX funds homemaker services |
| 1981 | 1915(c) HCBS waiver authority created |

## OBRA and Reform Era (1981-2000)

### 1981: HCBS Waiver Authority

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 created Section 1915(c), allowing states to request waivers to provide home and community-based services. This marked the beginning of the shift from institutional bias:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Optional** | States could choose to participate |
| **Cost neutral** | HCBS costs couldn't exceed institutional costs |
| **Target populations** | Initially limited groups |
| **Federal approval** | Required CMS approval |

### 1987: OBRA Nursing Home Reform

The most significant nursing home legislation since Medicaid creation:

| Provision | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Resident rights** | Bill of rights, freedom from restraints |
| **Assessment** | Mandatory resident assessment (MDS) |
| **Care planning** | Individualized care plans |
| **Training** | Nurse aide training and certification |
| **Survey** | Annual inspections with enforcement |
| **Anti-discrimination** | Cannot discriminate against Medicaid patients |

### Olmstead Decision (1999)

*Olmstead v. L.C.*, 527 U.S. 581 (1999): Supreme Court held that unjustified institutionalization of people with disabilities violates the ADA.

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Legal right** | Community placement when appropriate |
| **State obligations** | Must have comprehensive deinstitutionalization plan |
| **Ongoing enforcement** | DOJ enforcement actions continue |
| **HCBS expansion** | Accelerated state HCBS development |

### CLASS Act and ACA Era (2000-2015)

### Long-Term Care Insurance Market

| Year | Policies Sold | Active Policies |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1990 | 450,000 | 1.5 million |
| 2000 | 700,000 | 6.0 million |
| 2005 | 350,000 | 7.0 million |
| 2010 | 150,000 | 7.5 million |

The private market peaked around 2002 and has declined steadily since.

### CLASS Act (2010)

The Affordable Care Act included the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) Act:

| Feature | Design |
|---------|--------|
| **Voluntary** | Workers could opt in through payroll deduction |
| **Universal access** | No medical underwriting |
| **Cash benefit** | Average $50/day for LTC needs |
| **Self-funding** | Premiums only, no federal subsidy |

The CLASS Act was suspended in 2011 and repealed in 2013 because its voluntary nature created insurmountable adverse selection problems.

### Money Follows the Person (2005)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Goal** | Help Medicaid beneficiaries transition from institutions to community |
| **Funding** | Enhanced federal match |
| **Results** | 100,000+ transitioned (through 2020) |
| **Extension** | Repeatedly reauthorized |

## Recent Era (2015-Present)

### State Innovations

| State | Innovation |
|-------|------------|
| **Washington (2019)** | WA Cares: First state public LTC insurance |
| **Oregon** | Highest HCBS share (78%) |
| **Minnesota** | Managed care integration |
| **Vermont** | Global budget pilot |
| **California** | Minimum wage for care workers |

### COVID-19 Crisis (2020-2022)

| Impact | Magnitude |
|--------|-----------|
| Nursing home deaths | 200,000+ |
| Staff deaths | 3,000+ |
| Share of US COVID deaths | 23% |
| Industry workforce loss | 15% |
| Occupancy decline | 15 percentage points |

COVID-19 exposed long-standing problems:

- Inadequate staffing levels
- Infection control failures
- Lack of personal protective equipment
- Poor communication with families
- Regulatory enforcement gaps

### Policy Responses

| Year | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2020 | CARES Act provider relief funds |
| 2021 | American Rescue Plan: 10% HCBS FMAP increase |
| 2022 | CMS proposes nursing home staffing rule |
| 2023 | CMS finalizes staffing requirements |
| 2024 | WA Cares begins benefit payments |

## Key Historical Patterns

### Institutional Bias Persistence

Despite repeated efforts, institutional bias has proven difficult to overcome:

| Period | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| 1935-1965 | OAA exclusion created private nursing home industry |
| 1965-1980 | Medicaid entitlement for nursing homes, not HCBS |
| 1981-2000 | HCBS waivers optional and cost-neutral |
| 2000-present | Waitlists persist; nursing home entitlement unchanged |

### Failed Universal LTC Attempts

| Year | Proposal | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1988 | Pepper Commission | Not enacted |
| 1993 | Clinton Health Plan | Defeated |
| 2010 | CLASS Act | Repealed before implementation |
| 2021 | Build Back Better | LTC provisions dropped |

### Quality Improvement Cycles

| Decade | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| 1970s | Scandals → limited reforms |
| 1980s | OBRA 1987 reforms |
| 1990s | Implementation challenges |
| 2000s | Quality improvement initiatives |
| 2010s | Star ratings, value-based payment |
| 2020s | COVID crisis → staffing mandates |

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

| Success | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **OBRA 1987 standards** | Reduced restraints, improved documentation |
| **HCBS waiver expansion** | HCBS share grew from 18% to 59% |
| **Olmstead enforcement** | Accelerated community integration |
| **Money Follows the Person** | Demonstrated transition feasibility |
| **State innovation** | Oregon, Washington show alternatives |

### Persistent Failures

| Failure | Persistence |
|---------|-------------|
| **No universal financing** | 90 years without solution |
| **Nursing home quality** | Ongoing deficiencies despite regulation |
| **Workforce crisis** | Wages stagnant for decades |
| **Private insurance collapse** | Market failure not addressed |
| **Family caregiver burden** | No comprehensive support |

### Political Constraints

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Cost concerns** | Block comprehensive reform |
| **Industry lobbying** | Protects institutional status quo |
| **Federalism** | State variation in Medicaid |
| **Incremental approach** | Waivers instead of entitlements |
| **Crisis-driven policy** | COVID response, not prevention |
