# Long-Term Care: Overview

Long-term care (LTC) encompasses the range of services and supports needed by people who have chronic health conditions or disabilities that limit their ability to carry out basic self-care tasks (activities of daily living) or household-related tasks (instrumental activities of daily living). Unlike acute medical care, long-term care addresses ongoing needs over extended periods—months, years, or the remainder of a person's life.
