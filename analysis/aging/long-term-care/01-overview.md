# Long-Term Care: Overview

## Introduction

Long-term care (LTC) encompasses the range of services and supports needed by people who have chronic health conditions or disabilities that limit their ability to carry out basic self-care tasks (activities of daily living) or household-related tasks (instrumental activities of daily living). Unlike acute medical care, long-term care addresses ongoing needs over extended periods—months, years, or the remainder of a person's life.

America faces a looming long-term care crisis. The population needing LTC will double by 2050, but the current financing system remains fragmented, inadequate, and deeply inequitable. Most Americans have no plan for financing long-term care, and the burden falls disproportionately on families—particularly women—who provide unpaid care worth over $600 billion annually.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Long-term care settings**: Nursing homes, assisted living, home and community-based services (HCBS), adult day programs
- **Financing mechanisms**: Medicaid, Medicare (limited), private insurance, out-of-pocket spending
- **Quality and regulation**: Oversight systems, staffing requirements, resident rights
- **Workforce challenges**: Shortages, wages, training, turnover
- **Family caregiving**: Unpaid care, caregiver support policies
- **Reform approaches**: Public insurance options, HCBS expansion, workforce investment

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Americans needing LTC today | 12 million |
| Americans 65+ who will need LTC | 70% |
| Average years of LTC needed | 3 years |
| Annual nursing home cost (private room) | $108,000 |
| Annual home health aide cost (44 hrs/week) | $62,000 |
| Medicaid LTSS spending (2023) | $206 billion |
| Share of nursing home costs paid by Medicaid | 62% |
| Family caregivers (unpaid) | 53 million |
| Value of unpaid care annually | $600 billion |
| Home care worker median wage | $15.77/hour |
| Nursing home workers' annual turnover | 65% |

## The Financing Gap

Long-term care occupies a unique position in American healthcare policy: it is a nearly universal risk that most people will face, yet it has no universal financing mechanism.

| Financing Source | Role | Limitation |
|------------------|------|------------|
| **Medicare** | Covers short-term skilled nursing after hospitalization | No long-term care; maximum 100 days |
| **Medicaid** | Primary payer for nursing home and HCBS | Requires impoverishment; varies by state |
| **Private LTC insurance** | Covers LTC costs | Only 7% of Americans have policies |
| **Out-of-pocket** | Initial costs before Medicaid eligibility | Devastating for middle class |
| **Family caregivers** | Primary source of care | Unpaid; no formal support system |

This creates a "middle-class squeeze": Too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid, unable to afford private insurance or years of private-pay care, families face impossible choices.

## The Institutional Bias Problem

Historically, Medicaid has favored nursing home care over home and community-based services:

| Year | HCBS Share of Medicaid LTSS |
|------|----------------------------|
| 1995 | 18% |
| 2000 | 27% |
| 2010 | 45% |
| 2020 | 57% |
| 2023 | 59% |

While this ratio has improved, significant barriers remain:

- HCBS waiver programs have waiting lists totaling 650,000+ people
- Nursing home placement remains an entitlement while HCBS is optional
- Infrastructure for home care varies dramatically by state and region

## Quality Concerns

Long-term care quality remains deeply problematic:

| Issue | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **Nursing home staffing** | 75% of facilities below recommended levels |
| **Nursing home inspections** | 80% of facilities cited for deficiencies |
| **COVID-19 deaths** | 200,000+ nursing home deaths (2020-2022) |
| **Abuse and neglect** | GAO: "Persistent problems" across facilities |
| **Home care oversight** | Limited regulation; quality varies widely |

## Workforce Crisis

The long-term care workforce faces critical challenges:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Direct care workers needed by 2030 | 8.2 million |
| Current workforce | 4.5 million |
| Projected gap | 3.7 million workers |
| Median wage | $15.77/hour |
| Poverty rate among workers | 17% |
| Workers without health insurance | 15% |
| Annual turnover (nursing homes) | 65% |

Low wages, difficult working conditions, and lack of benefits drive chronic shortages and turnover that directly impact care quality.

## Why This Matters

**For individuals and families:**

- Most people will need long-term care; few have planned for it
- Care costs can deplete a lifetime of savings in months
- Family caregivers sacrifice careers, health, and financial security
- Quality problems put vulnerable people at risk

**For the healthcare system:**

- Fragmented financing creates inefficiency and gaps
- Lack of HCBS drives costly and unwanted institutionalization
- Workforce shortages threaten care availability

**For society:**

- Aging population will double LTC needs by 2050
- Current system is unsustainable without reform
- Women bear disproportionate caregiving burden
- Racial and economic disparities in access and quality persist

**For the economy:**

- Lost productivity from caregiving: $522 billion annually
- Caregiver workforce exits: 23% leave jobs to provide care
- Medicaid costs strain state budgets

## Core Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **No universal financing** | Unlike healthcare, no coverage system for LTC |
| **Medicaid spend-down** | Middle class must impoverish to qualify |
| **Institutional bias** | Home care underfunded relative to nursing homes |
| **Workforce shortage** | Low wages drive turnover and vacancies |
| **Quality problems** | Persistent deficiencies despite regulation |
| **Family burden** | Unpaid care exceeds entire Medicaid program |
| **Insurance market failure** | Private LTC insurance not viable for most |
| **State variation** | 50 different Medicaid LTC systems |

## Reform Directions

Major reform approaches include:

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **HCBS expansion** | Make home care entitlement; eliminate waitlists |
| **Public LTC insurance** | Universal coverage through social insurance |
| **Workforce investment** | Wage increases, benefits, career ladders |
| **Quality improvement** | Staffing mandates, enforcement, transparency |
| **Caregiver support** | Tax credits, respite, paid leave |
| **Medicare expansion** | Add LTC benefit to Medicare |
| **Medicaid enhancement** | Increase federal matching; HCBS requirements |
