# Long-Term Care: Legislation

## Overview

Long-term care reform requires a multi-pronged legislative approach: federal legislation to establish financing mechanisms and minimum standards, state legislation to implement programs and expand Medicaid HCBS, and regulatory action to improve quality and workforce conditions. No constitutional amendments are required, as Congress has clear authority under the Commerce Clause and Spending Clause.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for long-term care reform. Congress has established authority to:

- Regulate interstate commerce (Commerce Clause)
- Condition Medicaid funding on state compliance (Spending Clause)
- Establish social insurance programs (taxing power)
- Set minimum labor standards (Commerce Clause)

## Federal Legislation

### HCBS Access Act

**Purpose**: Eliminate institutional bias in Medicaid by making home and community-based services a mandatory benefit, ending waitlists and ensuring choice.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "HCBS Access Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) over 820,000 Americans are on waitlists for home and
    community-based services;
(2) the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C. (1999) held that
    unjustified institutionalization violates the ADA;
(3) home and community-based services are more cost-effective
    than institutional care;
(4) 90 percent of seniors prefer to receive care at home; and
(5) current Medicaid law creates institutional bias by making
    nursing home coverage mandatory while HCBS remains optional.

SEC. 3. HCBS AS MANDATORY MEDICAID BENEFIT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act
(42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)) is amended—
    (1) by striking "and" at the end of paragraph (30);
    (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (31) and
        inserting "; and"; and
    (3) by adding at the end the following:
    "(32) home and community-based services (as defined in
    subsection (cc)) for individuals who meet the level of care
    criteria for nursing facility services.".

(b) DEFINITION.—Section 1905 of such Act is amended by
adding at the end the following:
"(cc) HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES.—For purposes of
this title, the term 'home and community-based services' means—
    "(1) case management services;
    "(2) homemaker and home health aide services;
    "(3) personal care services;
    "(4) adult day health services;
    "(5) habilitation services;
    "(6) respite care;
    "(7) assistive technology and home modifications;
    "(8) self-directed services; and
    "(9) other services approved by the Secretary that support
    individuals in community settings.".

SEC. 4. ENHANCED FEDERAL MATCHING.
(a) FMAP INCREASE.—Section 1905(b) of the Social Security Act
is amended by adding at the end the following:
"Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, with respect to amounts
expended for home and community-based services described in
subsection (a)(32), the Federal medical assistance percentage
shall be equal to 90 percent.".

SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF WAITLISTS.
(a) PROHIBITION.—A State may not establish or maintain a
waiting list for home and community-based services under
section 1905(a)(32).
(b) TRANSITION.—States shall eliminate existing waitlists
within 3 years of enactment.

SEC. 6. SELF-DIRECTION OPTION.
Each State shall offer a self-directed services option under
which individuals receiving home and community-based services
may—
(1) hire, supervise, and dismiss workers providing such
    services; and
(2) manage an individual budget for such services.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall take effect on the date that is 2 years after
the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This bill transforms Medicaid's institutional bias by making HCBS mandatory coverage, like nursing home care. The 90% federal match incentivizes state adoption and covers transition costs.

**Challenges**:

- CBO scoring may show significant short-term costs
- States concerned about long-term obligations
- Workforce capacity in some areas

**Refinements**:

- Consider phased implementation (3-5 years)
- Technical assistance grants for low-capacity states
- Workforce development funding tied to expansion

### Long-Term Care Social Insurance Act

**Purpose**: Create universal long-term care insurance through dedicated payroll tax, providing cash benefits and services coverage.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Long-Term Care Social
Insurance Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
    (1) 70 percent of Americans turning 65 will need long-term
        care services;
    (2) the private long-term care insurance market has collapsed;
    (3) Medicaid requires impoverishment before providing coverage;
    (4) family caregivers provide over $600 billion in unpaid
        care annually; and
    (5) international experience demonstrates social insurance
        can provide universal, sustainable coverage.
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to establish a
universal long-term care insurance program modeled on
Medicare Hospital Insurance.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.
(a) LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE PROGRAM.—There is hereby
established a Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program to
provide benefits to eligible individuals who require long-term
services and supports.

(b) ADMINISTRATION.—The Program shall be administered by
the Secretary of Health and Human Services through the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY.
(a) IN GENERAL.—An individual is eligible for benefits under
the Program if the individual—
    (1) has earned 40 quarters of coverage (as defined in
        section 213 of the Social Security Act);
    (2) is unable to perform, without substantial assistance
        from another individual, at least 2 activities of daily
        living for a period expected to last at least 90 days; and
    (3) has satisfied a 90-day waiting period.

(b) ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING.—For purposes of this
section, the term "activities of daily living" means—
    (1) eating;
    (2) toileting;
    (3) transferring;
    (4) bathing;
    (5) dressing; and
    (6) continence.

SEC. 5. BENEFITS.
(a) CASH BENEFIT.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—Eligible individuals shall receive a daily
        cash benefit of $75, adjusted annually for inflation.
    (2) USE OF BENEFIT.—Benefits may be used for—
        (A) home and community-based services;
        (B) institutional care;
        (C) family caregiver compensation; or
        (D) other long-term care needs.

(b) SERVICES OPTION.—Individuals may elect to receive
services in lieu of cash benefits, with the value of services
equal to 125 percent of the cash benefit.

SEC. 6. FINANCING.
(a) LONG-TERM CARE TRUST FUND.—There is established in
the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known
as the "Long-Term Care Trust Fund".

(b) PAYROLL TAX.—
    (1) There is hereby imposed on the income of every
        individual a tax equal to 0.5 percent of wages.
    (2) There is hereby imposed on every employer an excise
        tax equal to 0.5 percent of wages paid.
    (3) There is hereby imposed on the self-employment income
        of every individual a tax equal to 1.0 percent.

(c) NO CAP.—The taxes imposed by this section shall apply
to all wages and self-employment income without limitation.

SEC. 7. COORDINATION WITH MEDICAID.
(a) SUPPLEMENTATION.—Benefits under this Act shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, benefits available under
title XIX of the Social Security Act.

(b) COST SAVINGS.—The Secretary shall ensure that the
Program reduces Medicaid long-term care expenditures.

(a) TAX COLLECTION.—The taxes imposed by section 6 shall
take effect on January 1 of the year following enactment.
(b) BENEFITS.—Benefits shall be payable beginning on the
date that is 5 years after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This creates Medicare-style social insurance for LTC. The 1% total payroll tax (split employer/employee) with no cap generates significant revenue while ensuring progressivity.

**Challenges**:

- Political difficulty of new taxes
- 5-year benefit delay may reduce support
- Transition for current Medicaid beneficiaries

**Refinements**:

- Consider partial benefits during phase-in period
- Enhanced benefits for severe disability
- Coordination with state programs like WA Cares

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

| Provision | Constitutional Basis |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Medicaid conditions | Spending Clause (South Dakota v. Dole) |
| Labor standards | Commerce Clause |
| Social insurance | Taxing power (Helvering v. Davis) |
| Nursing home regulation | Commerce Clause |

### Potential Challenges

| Challenge | Risk Level | Response |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| State sovereignty | Medium | Conditions on funding, not mandates |
| Takings claims | Low | Regulation of participation |
| Due process | Low | Adequate procedures |
| Commerce Clause limits | Low | Substantial interstate activity |

### Preemption Issues

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| State LTC insurance | Federal support, not preemption |
| State labor laws | Federal floor, states may exceed |
| State Medicaid programs | Federal minimum standards |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Corporate restructuring | Facilities reorganize to avoid ownership disclosure | High |
| Rate gaming | Providers inflate costs to justify higher Medicaid rates | High |
| Quality measure manipulation | Facilities game metrics while quality suffers | Medium |
| Staffing data fraud | Falsified reporting to meet requirements | Medium |
| Self-direction exploitation | Agencies control "self-directed" services | Medium |
| Related-party transactions | Complex structures hide excessive payments | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Workforce pipeline | Insufficient workers despite wage increases | Training capacity, immigration limits |
| Rural access | Geographic gaps in services | Population density, economics |
| Quality measurement | Metrics don't capture person-centered care | Measurement difficulty |
| Family caregiver support | Insufficient respite, training | Funding limitations |
| Technology adoption | Slow integration of assistive technology | Reimbursement, training |
| Care coordination | Fragmented delivery systems | Payment silos |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Ownership transparency gaps**: Require disclosure of all entities in ownership chain; impose penalties on ultimate beneficial owners; mandate annual updates
2. **Rate gaming**: Independent rate-setting commissions; actuarial standards; audit requirements
3. **Quality measure manipulation**: Unannounced surveys; outcome-based measures; resident satisfaction weighting
4. **Staffing fraud**: Real-time electronic verification; payroll data matching; whistleblower incentives
5. **Self-direction exploitation**: Direct payment to workers; independent support brokers; participant surveys
6. **Related-party transactions**: Market rate requirements; independent appraisals; prohibited transaction categories

### General Implementation Concerns

- **State capacity variation**: Some states lack administrative infrastructure; provide technical assistance and extended timelines
- **Workforce development**: Wage increases alone insufficient; need training programs, immigration reform, career pathways
- **Provider viability**: Some facilities may close; transition planning, alternative care capacity needed
- **Political durability**: Future administrations may weaken; statutory protections, stakeholder coalitions
- **Cost control**: Open-ended entitlements create budget pressure; quality-based payment, utilization management
