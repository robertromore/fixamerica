# Long-Term Care: Current State

## Present Conditions

America's long-term care system operates as a fragmented patchwork of public programs, private insurance, out-of-pocket spending, and unpaid family care. Approximately 12 million Americans currently need long-term care assistance, a number projected to double by 2050 as the population ages. The system's defining feature is its lack of universal coverage—unlike healthcare, there is no comprehensive financing mechanism for long-term care.

The private LTC insurance market has largely collapsed due to:

- Adverse selection (sick people more likely to buy)
- Underpricing of early policies
- Interest rate decline reducing investment returns
- Insurers exiting market or raising premiums dramatically
