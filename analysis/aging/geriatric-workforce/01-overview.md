# Geriatric Healthcare Workforce

## Overview

The geriatric healthcare workforce encompasses physicians, nurses, social workers, and other professionals specially trained to care for older adults. As the U.S. population ages rapidly—with the 65+ population projected to reach 95 million by 2060—the nation faces a critical shortage of geriatric-trained providers. Fewer than 7,500 board-certified geriatricians practice in the United States, a number that has declined since 2000 even as the older population has grown. This shortage affects care quality, contributes to overuse of hospitals and nursing homes, and leaves millions of older adults without access to age-appropriate care.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Geriatric physicians**: Geriatricians, geriatric psychiatrists, other physician specialists
- **Geriatric nursing**: Geriatric nurse practitioners, certified nurse specialists, bedside nurses
- **Allied health professions**: Social workers, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists
- **Direct care workforce**: Certified nursing assistants, home health aides with geriatric training
- **Training pipeline**: Medical schools, residencies, fellowships, continuing education
- **Workforce distribution**: Geographic maldistribution, rural shortages, underserved communities

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Board-certified geriatricians | ~7,300 | ABIM, 2023 |
| Recommended ratio | 1 per 2,500 older adults | Health Resources Report |
| Current ratio | 1 per 10,000+ older adults | Calculated |
| Unfilled geriatric fellowship slots | ~50% annually | ADGAP |
| 65+ population (current) | 58 million | Census 2023 |
| 65+ population (projected 2060) | 95 million | Census projections |
| Geriatricians needed (projected) | 30,000+ | IOM estimate |
| Geriatric psychiatrists | ~1,600 | AAGP |
| Geriatric NPs | ~10,000 | AANP |

## Why This Matters

### Care Quality

Older adults have distinct healthcare needs including:

- **Multiple chronic conditions**: 80% of people 65+ have at least one chronic disease; 68% have two or more
- **Polypharmacy risks**: Appropriate medication management requires geriatric expertise
- **Functional assessment**: Evaluating mobility, cognition, and independence
- **Geriatric syndromes**: Falls, delirium, frailty, urinary incontinence
- **Goals-of-care alignment**: Balancing treatment intensity with quality of life

Providers without geriatric training often miss these issues, leading to:

- Inappropriate prescribing (29% of Medicare beneficiaries receive potentially inappropriate medications)
- Preventable hospitalizations
- Premature institutionalization
- Care misaligned with patient preferences

### Economic Impact

The geriatric workforce shortage imposes significant costs:

| Cost Driver | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Preventable hospitalizations | Billions annually in Medicare spending |
| Nursing home use | Increased institutionalization when home care unavailable |
| Emergency department visits | Falls and medication errors often trigger ED use |
| Caregiver burden | Family caregivers provide $470 billion in unpaid care |

### Equity Implications

Geriatric workforce shortages disproportionately affect:

- **Rural communities**: Few geriatricians practice in rural areas
- **Low-income elders**: Medicaid patients face limited access
- **Racial minorities**: Cultural competency gaps persist
- **Non-English speakers**: Language barriers compound access issues

### Crisis Trajectory

Without intervention, the workforce shortage will worsen:

| Year | 65+ Population | Current Geriatrician Supply | Gap |
|------|----------------|----------------------------|-----|
| 2025 | 62 million | ~7,300 | 17,500+ |
| 2030 | 73 million | ~6,500 (projected decline) | 22,500+ |
| 2040 | 81 million | Unknown | 25,000+ |
| 2060 | 95 million | Unknown | 30,000+ |

## Key Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Interest | Position |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Older adults and families | Access to quality care | Support workforce expansion |
| Geriatricians | Sustainable careers | Support better compensation, lower debt |
| Medical schools | Curriculum decisions | Variable commitment to geriatrics |
| Teaching hospitals | Residency and fellowship funding | Constrained by GME caps |
| CMS | Medicare payment policy | Mixed signals through payment rates |
| HRSA | Workforce development | Limited funding authority |

## Reform Priorities

1. **Increase geriatric fellowship training capacity** through GME expansion and funding
2. **Improve compensation** to make geriatrics competitive with other specialties
3. **Expand loan forgiveness** for geriatric specialists
4. **Integrate geriatrics into primary care training** for all physicians
5. **Develop geriatric expertise in nursing and allied health** professions
6. **Address geographic maldistribution** through rural and underserved area incentives
7. **Support career sustainability** through workload and practice model improvements
