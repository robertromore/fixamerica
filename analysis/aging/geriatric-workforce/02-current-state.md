# Geriatric Healthcare Workforce: Current State

## Present Conditions

The geriatric healthcare workforce is in crisis. The United States has approximately 7,300 board-certified geriatricians to serve over 58 million adults aged 65 and older—a ratio of roughly 1 geriatrician per 10,000 older adults, far below the recommended 1:2,500. The situation is worsening as more geriatricians retire than enter the field. Fellowship positions go unfilled, medical schools provide minimal geriatrics training, and the compensation gap with other specialties discourages career choices in geriatric medicine.
