# Geriatric Healthcare Workforce: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Building the geriatric workforce requires sustained effort across multiple fronts: compensation, training, education, and practice models. The strategy recognizes that workforce development takes years—a fellow trained today practices for decades—so early action is essential. The approach sequences reforms to address immediate barriers first (compensation) while building long-term infrastructure (training capacity).

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Compensation before training** | People won't enter geriatrics until it's financially viable |
| **Incremental before transformational** | Build support through early wins |
| **Federal-state partnership** | Federal funding with state implementation |
| **Interdisciplinary breadth** | Expand all professions, not just physicians |
| **Geographic equity** | Address rural and underserved areas explicitly |
| **Evidence generation** | Evaluate interventions to inform scaling |

### Political Context

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Bipartisan support potential | Moderate; older adult care crosses party lines |
| Fiscal constraints | Significant; requires cost-effectiveness argument |
| Advocacy strength | Moderate; AGS, AARP, Hartford Foundation |
| Administrative feasibility | High for regulatory; mixed for legislation |
| Window of opportunity | Post-COVID awareness of aging issues |
