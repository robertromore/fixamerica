# Geriatric Healthcare Workforce: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles

- **Multi-pronged approach**: No single intervention will resolve the shortage; comprehensive action across training, compensation, and system design is needed
- **Address root causes**: Surface-level fixes (e.g., awareness campaigns) without addressing compensation and training constraints will fail
- **Invest for return**: Workforce investment generates downstream savings through quality improvement
- **Interdisciplinary teams**: Expand all geriatric professions, not just physicians
- **Geographic equity**: Ensure rural and underserved areas benefit from expansion
- **Build on evidence**: Scale what works; evaluate innovations

### Theory of Change

```text
Increased compensation + Training expansion + Medical education reform
    ↓
More medical students choose geriatrics + More fellows trained
    ↓
Growing geriatric workforce across professions
    ↓
Better access to geriatric care
    ↓
Improved outcomes, reduced costs, enhanced quality of life
```

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: GME Expansion for Geriatrics

**Description**: Increase Medicare graduate medical education (GME) funding specifically for geriatric medicine fellowship positions, exempting geriatrics from the overall GME cap.

**Components**:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| New fellowship slots | 500 additional positions over 5 years |
| Funding mechanism | Medicare GME cap exemption for geriatrics |
| Annual investment | ~$100 million |
| Distribution | Priority to shortage areas |
| Requirements | Programs must maintain fill rates |

**Evidence**:

- GME cap has constrained growth since 1997
- Similar exemptions exist for rural and children's hospitals
- VA GRECC programs demonstrate training effectiveness
- Other countries with more training capacity have better ratios

**Challenges**:

- Congressional budget concerns
- Teaching hospital capacity
- Faculty availability
- Fill rate uncertainty (must also address compensation)

### Solution 2: Geriatric Workforce Loan Repayment Program

**Description**: Create a dedicated loan repayment program for geriatric medicine physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals who commit to practice in shortage areas.

**Components**:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Eligibility | Geriatricians, geriatric NPs, pharmacists, social workers |
| Forgiveness amount | Up to $100,000 for physicians; $50,000 for others |
| Service commitment | 3-5 years in shortage area |
| Annual participants | 500 physicians, 1,000 other professionals |
| Annual cost | ~$75 million |

**Evidence**:

- National Health Service Corps model effective for primary care
- Loan debt major barrier to low-paying specialties
- Similar programs work for teaching, nursing, public service
- Geriatrics salary gap makes debt burden particularly problematic

**Challenges**:

- Defining "shortage area" for geriatrics
- Retention after service commitment
- Funding competition with other programs
- Administrative complexity

### Solution 3: Medicare Payment Reform for Cognitive Services

**Description**: Increase Medicare payment rates for evaluation and management (E/M) services and create new codes for geriatric care coordination and comprehensive assessment.

**Components**:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|

| Geriatric assessment code | New code for comprehensive geriatric assessment |
| Care coordination code | Monthly payment for complex care management |
| Team-based care payment | Support interdisciplinary geriatric teams |
| Value-based bonus | Quality incentives for geriatric outcomes |

**Evidence**:

- Current RVU system undervalues cognitive work
- CMS has increased E/M payments in recent years (continued progress needed)
- Medicare Advantage plans pay for care coordination
- Demonstration projects show value of geriatric assessment

**Challenges**:

- Budget neutrality requirements
- Specialty society opposition
- RUC process favors procedures
- Documentation burden

### Solution 4: Medical School Curriculum Requirements

**Challenges**:

- Curriculum crowding
- Faculty shortages
- Medical school autonomy concerns
- Accreditation process slow

### Solution 5: Residency Training Enhancement
