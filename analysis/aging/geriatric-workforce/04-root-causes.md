# Geriatric Healthcare Workforce: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The geriatric workforce shortage persists despite decades of recognition because it results from interconnected structural, institutional, and economic factors. The problem is not primarily a failure of awareness but rather a failure of incentives and investment. Market forces, payment systems, training constraints, and cultural attitudes all work against geriatrics as a career choice.

### Why the Shortage Persists

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Compensation gap** | Geriatricians earn 40-60% less than procedure-heavy specialties |
| **Training constraints** | GME cap limits fellowship growth |
| **Medical education** | Minimal geriatrics exposure in training |
| **Career perceptions** | Specialty seen as low-status, low-reward |
| **Payment structure** | Fee-for-service disadvantages cognitive care |
| **Ageism** | Society and medicine devalue older patients |

## Structural Causes

### Payment System Misalignment

**Fee-for-Service Disadvantage**:

Medicare's fee-for-service payment system compensates procedures at much higher rates than cognitive services (evaluation, management, care coordination). Geriatric care is primarily cognitive, involving:

- Comprehensive assessment
- Medication management
- Care coordination
- Goals-of-care conversations
- Caregiver support

| Service Type | Relative Payment | Who Benefits |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| Procedures (surgery, endoscopy) | High | Surgical specialties |
| Diagnostic imaging | High | Radiology, cardiology |
| Office visits | Moderate | Primary care |
| Complex care management | Low | Geriatrics |
| Care coordination | Very low | Geriatrics |
| Family meetings | Minimal | Geriatrics |

**Consequence**: Physicians who spend an hour on a complex geriatric assessment earn a fraction of what a colleague earns performing a procedure in the same time.

### Graduate Medical Education (GME) Constraints

**The GME Cap**:

Medicare funds the majority of residency and fellowship training. The 1997 Balanced Budget Act capped Medicare GME funding at 1996 levels, creating a zero-sum competition for training slots.

| Impact | Effect on Geriatrics |
|--------|---------------------|
| Fixed total slots | No room for growth |
| Competition among specialties | Hospitals prioritize high-revenue specialties |
| Fellowship funding | Geriatric fellowships compete for limited dollars |
| New programs | Difficult to start without funding |

**Fellowship Funding Structure**:

- Geriatric fellowships are 1-2 years after internal medicine or family medicine residency
- Fellowship slots are funded by hospitals (using GME money) or grants
- Limited return on investment makes hospitals reluctant to expand

### Medical Education Deficits

**Undergraduate Medical Education**:

| Problem | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Minimal required hours | Median: ~20 hours total geriatrics instruction |
| Variable exposure | Many students have no geriatric clinical rotation |
| Negative experiences | Geriatrics often taught in nursing home settings |
| Faculty shortages | Few geriatrics faculty to teach |
| Curriculum competition | Other specialties have more lobbying power |

**Residency Training**:

| Problem | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Limited geriatrics exposure | Internal medicine residents: ~1-2 weeks |
| Competency gaps | Graduates unprepared for older patients |
| No geriatrics requirement | Primary care residencies vary widely |
| Nursing home aversion | Residents dislike long-term care rotations |

### Geographic Maldistribution

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Academic center concentration | Geriatricians cluster near training programs |
| Urban preference | Better employment options, higher compensation |
| Rural disincentives | Lower pay, professional isolation, limited resources |
| Medicaid patient concentration | Low reimbursement in high-need areas |
| Spouse/family considerations | Two-career families prefer metro areas |

## Institutional Causes

### Medical School and Academic Priorities

**Institutional Incentives**:

| Priority | How It Disadvantages Geriatrics |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Research revenue | NIH funding in geriatrics lower than other fields |
| Clinical revenue | Geriatrics generates less clinical income |
| Prestige | Specialty hierarchy disadvantages geriatrics |
| Curriculum hours | Competition for limited teaching time |
| Faculty recruitment | Difficult to attract when compensation low |

**Faculty Pipeline**:

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Few geriatric faculty | Limited teaching capacity |
| Low academic salaries | Difficulty recruiting |
| Research funding gaps | Career advancement harder |
| Teaching burden | Geriatric faculty spread thin |

### Health System Priorities

**Hospital and Health System Focus**:

| Priority | Effect on Geriatrics |
|----------|---------------------|
| Procedural revenue | Favors surgical and interventional services |
| Short-term outcomes | Undervalues prevention and function |
| Throughput | Complex geriatric patients "slow down" systems |
| Quality metrics | Some metrics penalize complexity (readmissions) |
| Service line development | Geriatrics rarely prioritized |

**Employment Markets**:

| Challenge | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| Limited job openings | Few positions outside academic medicine |
| Salary compression | Geriatricians paid at general internal medicine rates |
| Scope of practice | Often limited to consultation |
| Panel sizes | Large patient loads reduce satisfaction |

### Professional Hierarchy

**Status Within Medicine**:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Procedure-oriented prestige | Cognitive specialties lower status |
| Compensation as status marker | Low pay signals low status |
| "Turfing" attitudes | Complex patients "dumped" on geriatrics |
| Hidden curriculum | Students learn to avoid geriatrics |
| Professional recognition | Awards, leadership positions favor other fields |

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Beneficiary | How They Benefit |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Procedural specialists** | Higher compensation, more GME slots |
| **Academic medical centers** | Revenue from high-margin services |
| **Teaching hospitals** | GME funding for preferred specialties |
| **Medical device/pharma** | Procedure-oriented, drug-intensive care |
| **Insurance companies** | Complex care management costs avoided |
| **Current geriatricians** | Limited competition (perversely) |

### Who Is Harmed

| Group | Harm |
|-------|------|
| **Older adults** | Inadequate access to appropriate care |
| **Family caregivers** | Less professional support |
| **Primary care physicians** | Inadequate training, overwhelming complexity |
| **Healthcare system** | Higher costs, lower quality |
| **Medical students interested in geriatrics** | Debt burden, low compensation |
| **Society** | Unprepared for demographic transition |

### Political Dynamics

| Dynamic | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Specialty lobbying** | AMA, specialty societies protect procedure payments |
| **GME cap politics** | Expansion blocked by budget concerns |
| **Ageism** | Older adults have less political voice |
| **Fragmented advocacy** | Geriatrics organizations relatively weak |
| **Short-term focus** | Workforce takes years to build; politicians focus on immediate |

## Cultural and Social Causes

### Ageism in Medicine

| Manifestation | Evidence |
|---------------|----------|
| "Geri-turfing" | Complex older patients unwanted |
| Therapeutic nihilism | "They're just old" attitude |
| Teaching bias | Negative framing of older patients |
| Research exclusion | Older adults excluded from clinical trials |
| Implicit bias | Provider attitudes affect care |

### Societal Attitudes

| Attitude | Impact on Workforce |
|----------|---------------------|
| Youth obsession | Caring for elderly seen as less valuable |
| Death denial | End-of-life care avoided |
| Family responsibility | Caregiving seen as family, not professional, role |
| Invisibility of elders | Older adults marginalized from public discourse |

### Medical Student Perspectives

| Factor | Influence on Career Choice |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Role models | Few geriatricians as mentors |
| Early exposure | Often negative nursing home experiences |
| Peer attitudes | Geriatrics seen as "not competitive" |
| Lifestyle | Perception of demanding, low-reward work |
| Debt burden | Financial pressure toward higher-paying fields |

```

### Reinforcing Cycles

**Fewer Geriatricians → Less Exposure → Less Interest → Fewer Geriatricians**:

The shortage perpetuates itself as fewer geriatric faculty means less teaching, fewer role models, and declining interest among students.

**Low Compensation → Less Prestige → Less Investment → Lower Compensation**:

The financial disadvantage of geriatrics leads to lower professional status, which reduces institutional investment, further depressing compensation.

**Limited Research → Less NIH Funding → Fewer Academic Positions → Less Research**:

Academic geriatrics struggles to compete for research funding, limiting faculty positions and further reducing research capacity.

## Proximate vs. Root Causes

### Proximate Causes (Immediate)

| Cause | Directly Produces |
|-------|-------------------|
| Unfilled fellowships | Insufficient new geriatricians |
| Retirements | Net workforce decline |
| Geographic clustering | Rural shortages |
| Burnout | Early career exits |

### Root Causes (Fundamental)

| Cause | Underlying Problem |
|-------|-------------------|
| Fee-for-service payment | Structural devaluation of cognitive care |
| GME financing | Training capacity constraint |
| Ageism | Cultural devaluation of older adults |
| Market logic in healthcare | Mission-driven work unsustainable |

Addressing proximate causes alone (e.g., loan forgiveness) will have limited effect without addressing root causes (payment reform, GME restructuring, cultural change).
