### Political Actions

**Federal Advocacy:**

| Issue | Target | Message |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **GME cap lift for geriatrics** | Congress | "Exempt geriatric fellowship positions from GME caps to train more geriatricians" |
| **Geriatric workforce funding** | Congress/HRSA | "Increase appropriations for HRSA Geriatric Workforce Development programs" |
| **Loan repayment expansion** | Congress/HRSA | "Create robust loan repayment program for geriatric specialists" |
| **Medicare payment reform** | CMS/Congress | "Increase reimbursement for geriatric care complexity" |
| **Geriatric assessment coverage** | CMS | "Cover comprehensive geriatric assessment under Medicare" |
| **VA GRECC expansion** | Congress/VA | "Expand VA Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Centers" |

**Sample Advocacy Scripts:**

*For GME expansion:*

> "I'm calling about the geriatric workforce shortage. There are only 7,300 geriatricians for 58 million Americans over 65. Half of geriatric fellowship positions go unfilled each year. Please support legislation to exempt geriatric fellowships from Medicare's GME caps so we can train more geriatricians."

*For loan repayment:*

> "I'm calling about medical education debt. Geriatricians earn 40-60% less than other specialists but carry the same educational debt. Please support expanding loan repayment programs for geriatricians to make this critical specialty financially viable."

*For Medicare payment reform:*

> "I'm calling about Medicare payment policy. Geriatric care requires more time—managing multiple conditions, coordinating care, involving families—but Medicare doesn't adequately compensate this complexity. Please support higher reimbursement for geriatric care."

**State Advocacy:**

| Issue | Target | Message |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **State loan repayment** | State legislature | Support state loan repayment for geriatric specialists |
| **Medicaid rates** | Medicaid agency | Increase Medicaid reimbursement for geriatric care |
| **Medical school investment** | State university boards | Fund geriatric faculty positions at state medical schools |
| **Geriatric NP scope** | Licensing boards | Allow geriatric NPs to practice to full scope of training |
| **Workforce planning** | Health planning agencies | Include geriatrics in state workforce planning |
