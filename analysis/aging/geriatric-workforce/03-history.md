# Geriatric Healthcare Workforce: History

## Historical Development

### Origins of Geriatric Medicine

Geriatric medicine emerged as a distinct specialty in the twentieth century, evolving from charitable care for the aged poor to a specialized medical discipline focused on the unique healthcare needs of older adults.

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-1900** | Elderly care in almshouses and charitable institutions |
| **1909** | Ignatz Nascher coins "geriatrics" from Greek *geron* (old man) + *iatrikos* (medical treatment) |
| **1914** | Nascher publishes *Geriatrics: The Diseases of Old Age and Their Treatment* |
| **1935** | Social Security Act creates framework for elder support |
| **1940s-1950s** | British model of geriatric medicine develops under Marjory Warren |
| **1965** | Medicare and Medicaid transform healthcare for older adults |

### Early History

**Charitable Care Era (Pre-1900)**:

Care for the elderly was primarily custodial, provided in almshouses, poorhouses, and charitable institutions. Medical treatment was minimal, and "old age" was considered an incurable condition rather than a stage of life requiring specialized care.

**Nascher's Vision (1909-1935)**:

Dr. Ignatz Nascher, an American physician, argued that old age required specialized medical attention just as childhood required pediatrics. His work was largely ignored by mainstream medicine, which viewed aging as inevitable decline beyond medical intervention.

**British Influence (1935-1960)**:

British physician Marjory Warren demonstrated that many older patients in chronic care institutions could be rehabilitated and discharged with proper assessment and treatment. Her work established the "geriatric assessment" approach that became foundational to the field.

### Key Turning Points

**1965: Medicare and Medicaid**

The creation of Medicare provided healthcare coverage for Americans 65+, dramatically increasing healthcare utilization by older adults and creating financial incentives for geriatric care—though not specifically for geriatric training.

**1966: First U.S. Geriatrics Fellowship**

The first formal geriatric medicine fellowship program was established at the National Institute on Aging, though the field remained marginal in American medicine.

**1974: National Institute on Aging (NIA)**

Congress established the NIA as part of NIH, providing federal research infrastructure for aging-related research and eventually workforce development.

**1978: Veterans Administration Geriatric Programs**

The VA established Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Centers (GRECCs), becoming the primary training ground for geriatricians and demonstrating the clinical value of geriatric care.

**1988: Geriatric Medicine Board Certification**

The American Board of Internal Medicine established certification in geriatric medicine, legitimizing the specialty. Family medicine certification followed.

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **1965** | Medicare enacted | Created healthcare market for older adults |
| **1966** | First fellowship | Formalized training pathway |
| **1974** | NIA established | Federal research infrastructure |
| **1978** | VA GRECCs | Major training and research centers |
| **1988** | Board certification | Specialty legitimized |
| **1998** | BBA GME cap | Training slot growth halted |
| **2000** | Peak geriatrician count | ~10,300 certified |
| **2010** | ACA | Workforce provisions, limited effect |
| **2020** | COVID-19 | Exposed workforce crisis |

### Development of Training Infrastructure

**Fellowship Programs (1970s-1990s)**:

| Decade | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| **1970s** | VA-based programs dominate; academic programs rare |
| **1980s** | Academic medical centers begin programs; HRSA grants support |
| **1990s** | Fellowship positions grow to ~500; fill rates decline |

**Medical School Education**:

| Era | Geriatrics in Curriculum |
|-----|--------------------------|
| **1970s** | Virtually absent |
| **1980s** | Optional electives begin |
| **1990s** | Some required rotations; uneven |
| **2000s** | LCME accreditation includes geriatrics; minimal hours |
| **2010s** | Competency-based standards; still limited |

### The GME Cap and Workforce Stagnation

**1997 Balanced Budget Act**:

The 1997 BBA capped Medicare graduate medical education (GME) funding at 1996 levels, freezing the number of residency and fellowship positions Medicare would support. This cap:

- Prevented growth in geriatric fellowship positions
- Limited hospitals' ability to expand training
- Created competition for limited slots among all specialties
- Contributed to geriatrics' inability to grow supply

**Post-2000 Decline**:

After peaking around 2000 with approximately 10,300 board-certified geriatricians, the workforce began declining due to:

- Retirements exceeding new certifications
- Low fellowship fill rates
- Competition from higher-paying specialties
- Limited career opportunities outside academic medicine

### Modern Era (2000-Present)

**Workforce Crisis Recognition (2000s)**:

The Institute of Medicine, HRSA, and other bodies published reports documenting the geriatric workforce shortage and calling for action. Key reports included:

- *Retooling for an Aging America* (IOM, 2008)
- *Health Workforce* reports (HRSA, various)
- National Academy of Medicine reports on aging

**Affordable Care Act (2010)**:

The ACA included several provisions relevant to the geriatric workforce:

- Geriatric education centers reauthorization
- Primary care workforce initiatives
- Value-based payment models (indirect effect)
- However, no significant new GME slots or loan forgiveness

**Age-Friendly Health Systems (2017-Present)**:

The John A. Hartford Foundation and Institute for Healthcare Improvement launched the Age-Friendly Health Systems initiative, emphasizing the "4Ms" (What Matters, Medication, Mentation, Mobility) and spreading geriatric principles even in settings without geriatricians.

**COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-Present)**:

The pandemic exposed the consequences of the geriatric workforce shortage:

- Nursing home residents (and staff) devastated
- Age-specific care protocols lacking
- Geriatricians in high demand but short supply
- Post-pandemic workforce burnout

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

| Strategy | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| **VA investment** | GRECCs produced most geriatric leaders |
| **Board certification** | Legitimized specialty |
| **Geriatric education centers** | Trained faculty, spread expertise |
| **Demonstration projects** | Proved clinical and cost value |
| **Hartford Foundation support** | Sustained innovation when federal support weak |

### What Has Not Worked

| Strategy | Why It Failed |
|----------|---------------|
| **Market forces** | Low compensation deters trainees |
| **Voluntary medical school integration** | Uneven implementation |
| **GME cap exceptions** | Never enacted for geriatrics |
| **Loan forgiveness programs** | Geriatrics largely excluded |
| **Appeals to demographic need** | Insufficient to overcome financial disincentives |

### Historical Patterns

**Specialty vs. Primary Care Tension**:

Geriatrics has been caught between two models:

- **Specialty model**: Geriatricians as consultants for complex patients
- **Primary care model**: Every primary care physician should have geriatric skills

Neither model has been fully implemented, leaving gaps in both specialist care and primary care competency.

**Federal Ambivalence**:

Federal policy has simultaneously:

- Recognized the workforce shortage in reports
- Failed to meaningfully fund workforce expansion
- Capped GME funding that constrains training
- Maintained payment systems that disadvantage cognitive specialties

**Private Philanthropy's Role**:

The John A. Hartford Foundation has been the primary sustained funder of geriatric workforce development, substituting for inadequate federal investment. This reliance on private philanthropy has limited scale and created program instability.

### International Comparison

| Country | Approach | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **United Kingdom** | Geriatrics well-established; NHS integration | Higher geriatrician ratios |
| **Canada** | Geriatrics as specialty; universal coverage | Better ratios than US |
| **Australia** | Geriatrics recognized specialty | Growing workforce |
| **Germany** | Primary care emphasis with specialists | Moderate supply |
| **Japan** | Geriatrics integrated in primary care | Addresses aging population |
| **United States** | Market-driven, subspecialty model | Severe shortage |

### Timeline Summary

| Era | Characterization |
|-----|------------------|
| **1909-1965** | Field founding; ignored by mainstream medicine |
| **1965-1988** | Infrastructure building; VA leadership |
| **1988-2000** | Certification and growth; peak supply |
| **2000-2020** | Decline despite demographic imperative |
| **2020-present** | Crisis recognition; uncertain response |
