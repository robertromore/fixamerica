# Geriatric Healthcare Workforce: Legislation

## Overview

Building the geriatric healthcare workforce requires a multi-pronged legislative strategy addressing the core barriers to specialty growth: (1) frozen training capacity through GME caps, (2) inadequate compensation making the specialty financially unviable, (3) insufficient workforce development funding, and (4) minimal educational requirements. This legislative package combines GME reform, loan repayment, Medicare payment adjustments, and training program funding to create a comprehensive workforce expansion strategy.

**Legislative Priorities:**

| Priority | Vehicle | Lead Agency |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| GME cap exemption for geriatrics | Congressional legislation | CMS |
| Geriatric workforce loan repayment | Congressional appropriation | HRSA |
| Medicare payment for geriatric services | Congressional direction + CMS rule | CMS |
| Geriatric workforce development funding | Appropriations | HRSA |
| Medical education standards | Regulatory/accreditation | LCME/ACGME |

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for geriatric workforce legislation. Workforce development, Medicare payment policy, and medical education fall within Congress's existing powers under the Spending Clause and Commerce Clause.

## Federal Legislation

### Geriatric Physician Training Act

**Purpose**: Exempt geriatric medicine fellowship positions from Medicare's Graduate Medical Education (GME) caps to expand training capacity without requiring teaching hospitals to sacrifice positions in other specialties.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Geriatric Physician Training Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) There are approximately 7,300 board-certified geriatricians in the
    United States caring for a population of over 58,000,000 Americans
    aged 65 and older.
(2) By 2030, there will be over 73,000,000 Americans aged 65 and older,
    and by 2060, over 95,000,000.
(3) The American Geriatrics Society estimates the United States needs
    approximately 30,000 geriatricians to provide adequate care.
(4) Approximately 50 percent of geriatric medicine fellowship positions
    go unfilled annually.
(5) Medicare's Graduate Medical Education caps, established in 1997,
    freeze training capacity regardless of workforce needs.
(6) Exempting geriatric fellowship positions from GME caps would allow
    expansion without penalizing other specialties.

SEC. 3. EXEMPTION OF GERIATRIC MEDICINE FELLOWSHIP POSITIONS FROM GME CAPS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1886(h) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
    1395ww(h)) is amended—
    (1) in paragraph (4)(F), by adding at the end the following:
        "(vi) GERIATRIC MEDICINE POSITIONS.—Effective for cost reporting
        periods beginning on or after July 1 of the year following
        enactment of the Geriatric Physician Training Act—
            "(I) IN GENERAL.—The limitation under this subparagraph
            shall not apply to additional geriatric medicine fellowship
            positions approved by the Secretary.
            "(II) GERIATRIC MEDICINE FELLOWSHIP DEFINED.—For purposes of
            this clause, the term 'geriatric medicine fellowship' means
            a fellowship program accredited by the Accreditation Council
            for Graduate Medical Education in geriatric medicine.
            "(III) APPROVED POSITIONS.—The Secretary shall approve
            additional geriatric medicine fellowship positions at
            teaching hospitals that—
                "(aa) demonstrate capacity to provide quality training;
                "(bb) commit to maintaining at least the same number of
                positions for a period of 5 years after approval;
                "(cc) agree to participate in workforce data reporting
                required by the Secretary.
            "(IV) ANNUAL LIMIT.—The Secretary may approve not more than
            200 additional geriatric medicine fellowship positions per
            year under this clause for the first 5 years, and not more
            than 100 additional positions per year thereafter, until
            the Secretary determines that the workforce shortage has
            been adequately addressed.
            "(V) GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.—In approving positions under
            this clause, the Secretary shall give priority to hospitals
            located in States with geriatrician-to-population ratios
            below the national median.";

    (2) in paragraph (4)(H), by adding at the end the following:
        "(vii) GERIATRIC MEDICINE POSITIONS.—In applying the limitation
        under this subparagraph, positions described in subparagraph
        (F)(vi) shall not be taken into account."

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made by this section shall apply to
    cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1 of the year
    following the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 4. GERIATRIC MEDICINE FELLOWSHIP EXPANSION GRANTS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the
    Health Resources and Services Administration, shall establish a
    grant program to support the establishment and expansion of
    geriatric medicine fellowship programs.

(b) USE OF FUNDS.—Grants under this section may be used for—
    (1) faculty recruitment and development;
    (2) curriculum development;
    (3) clinical training site development;
    (4) fellow stipend supplementation;
    (5) administrative support for program expansion.

(c) PRIORITY.—In awarding grants, the Secretary shall give priority to—
    (1) programs located in States with geriatrician shortages;
    (2) programs located in rural or underserved areas;
    (3) programs with strong track records of fellow retention in
        geriatric practice;
    (4) programs with demonstrated commitment to training for
        underserved populations.

(d) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There is authorized to be
    appropriated $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 through 2030
    to carry out this section.

SEC. 5. REPORTS.
(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of
    this Act, and annually thereafter for 10 years, the Secretary shall
    submit to Congress a report on—
    (1) the number of geriatric medicine fellowship positions approved
        under this Act;
    (2) the geographic distribution of such positions;
    (3) fellowship fill rates;
    (4) retention of graduates in geriatric practice;
    (5) changes in the geriatrician-to-population ratio.

(b) EVALUATION.—Not later than 5 years after the date of enactment of
    this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress an
    evaluation of the effectiveness of the GME exemption in addressing
    the geriatric workforce shortage.
```

**Explanation**: This bill creates a targeted exemption from Medicare's 1997 GME caps specifically for geriatric medicine fellowship positions. Unlike proposals to broadly lift GME caps, this focused approach addresses a documented workforce crisis without increasing overall GME costs substantially. The annual position limits (200 positions/year initially, then 100/year) provide controlled expansion while geographic priority provisions ensure positions flow to underserved areas.

**Challenges**:

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Budget scoring | CBO scores as modest cost (~$100M/year) due to fellowship length and numbers |
| Opposition from other specialties | Targeted exemption doesn't take positions from others |
| Teaching hospital capacity | Expansion grants address startup costs |
| Fill rate concerns | Loan repayment (separate bill) addresses compensation |

**Refinements**:

- Consider including geriatric psychiatry positions in the exemption
- Add provisions for telehealth-based training to reach rural areas
- Include requirements for diversity in fellow recruitment
- Create pathway for geriatric NP fellowship development

### Geriatric Specialist Loan Repayment Act

**Purpose**: Establish a dedicated loan repayment program for geriatric medicine specialists to address the compensation gap that deters physicians from entering the field.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Geriatric Specialist Loan Repayment Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Geriatricians earn 40 to 60 percent less than other medical
    specialists while carrying comparable educational debt.
(2) Average medical school debt exceeds $200,000, making loan repayment
    a significant factor in specialty choice.
(3) The National Health Service Corps does not include geriatrics as a
    priority discipline despite severe workforce shortages.
(4) Targeted loan repayment programs have proven effective in recruiting
    physicians to shortage specialties.

SEC. 3. GERIATRIC SPECIALIST LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of
    the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall establish
    a loan repayment program for geriatric medicine specialists.

(b) ELIGIBILITY.—To be eligible for loan repayment under this section,
    an individual shall—
    (1) have completed a geriatric medicine fellowship accredited by
        the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, or be
        currently enrolled in the final year of such fellowship;
    (2) have outstanding qualifying educational loans;
    (3) enter into an agreement with the Secretary to provide full-time
        geriatric medicine services for a period of not less than 2
        years in—
        (i) a health professional shortage area;
        (ii) a medically underserved area;
        (iii) an area with a geriatrician-to-population ratio below the
              national median;
        (iv) a nursing home, assisted living facility, or Program of
             All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) program;
        (v) a Veterans Affairs medical facility; or
        (vi) an academic medical center with a geriatric medicine
             training program.

(c) LOAN REPAYMENT AMOUNT.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall repay not more than $50,000 of
        the principal and interest of qualifying educational loans of
        an individual for each year the individual provides service
        pursuant to an agreement under subsection (b)(3).
    (2) MAXIMUM.—The total amount of loan repayment made to any
        individual under this section shall not exceed $200,000.
    (3) TAX TREATMENT.—Payments made under this section shall not be
        considered gross income of the recipient for purposes of the
        Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(d) PRIORITY.—In selecting participants, the Secretary shall give
    priority to applicants who—
    (1) agree to practice in areas with the most severe geriatrician
        shortages;
    (2) agree to provide a service period exceeding the minimum
        2-year requirement;
    (3) demonstrate commitment to serving underserved populations;
    (4) agree to participate in geriatric medicine training programs.

(e) BREACH OF CONTRACT.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—An individual who fails to complete the required
        service period shall be liable to the United States for the
        amount of loan repayment received, plus interest.
    (2) WAIVER.—The Secretary may waive the repayment requirement in
        cases of extreme hardship or if the Secretary determines that
        enforcement is against equity and good conscience.

(f) REPORTS.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this
    Act, and every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to
    Congress a report on—
    (1) the number of participants in the program;
    (2) the geographic distribution of participants;
    (3) retention rates after service period completion;
    (4) impact on geriatrician supply in shortage areas.

(g) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There is authorized to be
    appropriated $75,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 through 2035
    to carry out this section.

SEC. 4. NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS GERIATRIC PRIORITY.
(a) PRIORITY DESIGNATION.—Section 338A of the Public Health Service Act
    (42 U.S.C. 254l) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    "(j) GERIATRIC MEDICINE PRIORITY.—The Secretary shall include
    geriatric medicine as a priority discipline for purposes of the
    National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program."

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment made by subsection (a) shall take
    effect on the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 5. NURSING HOME AND LONG-TERM CARE INCENTIVES.
(a) ENHANCED REPAYMENT.—An individual who provides geriatric medicine
    services primarily in nursing homes, assisted living facilities,
    or PACE programs shall be eligible for an additional $10,000 per
    year in loan repayment under section 3, not to exceed a total of
    $240,000.

(b) RATIONALE.—Congress finds that nursing home and long-term care
    settings face particular difficulty recruiting physician services
    and that enhanced incentives are necessary to ensure adequate
    medical coverage.
```

**Explanation**: This bill creates a dedicated loan repayment program offering up to $200,000 (or $240,000 for nursing home physicians) in exchange for 2-4 years of geriatric practice in shortage areas. The amounts are calibrated to meaningfully offset the specialty's compensation disadvantage while maintaining reasonable service commitments. Tax-exempt treatment mirrors the NHSC model.

**Challenges**:

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Budget cost | $75M/year serves ~1,500 physicians annually |
| Service site definitions | Broad categories with Secretary discretion |
| Retention after service | Studies show 80%+ retention in loan repayment programs |
| Competition with other specialties | Targeted program, doesn't reduce NHSC funding |

**Refinements**:

- Consider extending to geriatric psychiatrists and geriatric NPs
- Add bonus for physicians who become fellowship faculty
- Include bridge funding during fellowship years
- Create pathway for part-time service with proportional benefits

### Medicare Geriatric Care Improvement Act

**Purpose**: Reform Medicare payment policy to better compensate the complexity and time requirements of geriatric care, including establishing dedicated billing codes for comprehensive geriatric assessment.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Medicare Geriatric Care Improvement Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older have an average of 6 chronic
    conditions requiring complex management.
(2) Geriatric care requires substantially more time than care for younger
    patients due to cognitive screening, medication reconciliation,
    functional assessment, and care coordination.
(3) Current Medicare payment rates do not adequately compensate the
    additional time and complexity of geriatric care.
(4) The undervaluation of cognitive and evaluation services relative to
    procedures discourages physicians from geriatric practice.
(5) Comprehensive geriatric assessment has been shown to reduce
    hospitalizations, improve functional outcomes, and decrease costs.

SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT BENEFIT.
(a) COVERAGE.—Section 1861 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x)
    is amended by adding at the end the following:

        shall be separate from and in addition to any other evaluation
        and management services provided on the same day.

(c) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made by this section shall apply to
    services furnished on or after January 1 of the year following the
    date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 4. ADJUSTMENT TO E/M PAYMENTS FOR COMPLEX ELDERLY PATIENTS.
(a) COMPLEXITY ADD-ON.—The Secretary shall establish a payment add-on
    for evaluation and management services furnished to Medicare
    beneficiaries who—
    (1) are aged 75 or older; and
    (2) have 3 or more chronic conditions documented in the medical
        record.

(b) AMOUNT.—The add-on under subsection (a) shall be not less than 15

    management services' means, with respect to a beneficiary aged 65
    or older with multiple chronic conditions—
        "(1) development and revision of a comprehensive care plan;
        "(2) coordination of care among multiple providers;
        "(3) medication management and reconciliation;
        "(4) caregiver support and education;
        "(5) transitional care following hospitalization;
        "(6) connection to community-based services.
    Such services shall be furnished by or under the supervision of a
    physician, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist with
    geriatric expertise."

(c) PAYMENT.—The Secretary shall establish payment rates for geriatric
    care management services that reflect the time and resources
    required for effective care coordination.

SEC. 6. NURSING HOME VISIT PAYMENT ENHANCEMENT.
(a) ENHANCED PAYMENT.—For physician services furnished in a nursing
    facility (as defined in section 1919 of the Social Security Act),
    the payment amount under section 1848 of such Act shall be

    services established under this Act and report to Congress annually
    on uptake, costs, and preliminary outcomes.
```

**Explanation**: This bill creates three new pathways for enhanced Medicare payment for geriatric services: (1) a comprehensive geriatric assessment benefit covering detailed multi-domain evaluation, (2) a complexity add-on for E/M services to elderly patients with multiple conditions, and (3) enhanced payment for nursing facility visits. Together, these changes address the fundamental economic disadvantage that discourages geriatric practice.

**Challenges**:

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Budget impact | Targeted to highest-need populations; potential downstream savings |
| Documentation burden | CGA is evidence-based, clinically valuable |
| Fraud concerns | Clear criteria; audit provisions |
| Specialty boundaries | Focus on patient complexity, not specialty |

**Refinements**:

- Add quality reporting requirements for CGA
- Create telehealth provisions for remote CGA components
- Link payment to Age-Friendly Health System participation
- Include caregiver consultation as billable component

### Geriatric Medical Education Standards Act

**Purpose**: Direct medical education accrediting bodies to strengthen geriatric training requirements and create incentives for medical schools to expand geriatric curricula.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Geriatric Medical Education Standards Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
(1) Medical students receive an average of 20 hours of geriatric-specific
    training despite the fact that older adults account for a majority
    of healthcare utilization.
(2) Only 50 percent of medical students complete a geriatric clinical
    rotation, and many rotations provide negative experiences due to
    setting and patient selection.
(3) Internal medicine and family medicine residencies have variable
    geriatric training requirements, with many providing minimal
    exposure to geriatric-specific care.
(4) Ageist attitudes develop during medical training and contribute to
    negative perceptions of geriatric careers.
(5) The Liaison Committee on Medical Education and Accreditation Council
    for Graduate Medical Education have not established strong
    geriatric competency requirements.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MEDICAL EDUCATION STANDARDS.
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1) the Liaison Committee on Medical Education should require all
    accredited medical schools to provide a minimum of 40 hours of
    geriatric-specific didactic instruction;
(2) all medical students should complete a clinical rotation in
    geriatric medicine, with emphasis on outpatient and community
    settings that demonstrate positive aspects of aging care;
(3) the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education should
    require all internal medicine and family medicine residencies to
    include specific geriatric competency milestones;
(4) medical schools and residency programs should actively address
    ageism in medical culture.

```

**Explanation**: This bill uses a combination of "sense of Congress" language to signal expectations to accrediting bodies and grants to incentivize curriculum enhancement. Rather than directly mandating curriculum requirements (which would raise accreditation independence concerns), it creates strong incentives for schools to strengthen geriatric training.

**Challenges**:

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Accreditation independence | Use incentives rather than mandates |
| Curriculum crowding | Focus on integration rather than separate courses |
| Faculty shortage | Include faculty development in grants |
| Measurement difficulty | Fund outcome tracking |

**Refinements**:

- Consider tying Medicare GME funding to geriatric curriculum standards
- Add provisions for standardized geriatric competency assessment
- Include medical school ranking considerations
- Develop national geriatric curriculum resources

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: All proposed legislation relies on Congress's power to attach conditions to federal spending (Medicare, Medicaid, HRSA grants). This is well-established constitutional authority.

**Commerce Clause**: Workforce development programs are permissible regulation of interstate commerce in healthcare services.

**Tenth Amendment**: Programs operate through federal-state partnerships and voluntary participation, avoiding commandeering concerns.

### Preemption Issues

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| State licensure | Federal programs work within state licensing; no preemption |
| Medical education | Accreditation bodies remain independent; federal grants create incentives |
| Medicaid | Enhanced rates require state plan amendments |
| Scope of practice | Federal programs defer to state scope of practice laws |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Grant conditions | Compliance required for continued funding |
| Loan repayment contracts | Service obligation with repayment penalty |
| Medicare conditions | Payment tied to compliance |
| Reporting requirements | Transparency and accountability |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Geographic gaming | Institutions could claim shortage status while located near well-served areas | Medium |
| Service commitment avoidance | Physicians could complete minimum service then leave geriatrics | Medium |
| Credential without practice | Physicians could maintain geriatric certification without practicing geriatrics | Low |
| Training without faculty | Programs could expand positions without adequate faculty | Medium |
| Code billing abuse | Providers could bill CGA without providing comprehensive services | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Limited rural reach | Rural areas may not attract geriatricians despite incentives | Infrastructure limitations |
| Faculty shortage | Training expansion limited by faculty availability | Pipeline timing |
| Compensation gap persistence | Loan repayment doesn't fully close specialty gap | Structural payment issues |
| Voluntary accreditation standards | Schools may not strengthen curricula without mandates | Accreditation independence |
| State Medicaid variation | Uneven state participation in enhanced rates | State fiscal constraints |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Geographic definitions**: Require Secretary to define shortage areas using granular data; include rural/urban distinctions; require periodic recertification.

2. **Service commitment strengthening**: Extend minimum service periods to 3-4 years; add retention bonuses for continued practice; create career pathway incentives.

3. **Practice requirements**: Link certification maintenance to minimum geriatric practice hours; require continuing education in geriatric care.

4. **Faculty development**: Tie GME expansion to faculty development milestones; require faculty-to-fellow ratios; fund parallel faculty pipeline.

5. **Billing integrity**: Establish documentation requirements for CGA; require use of standardized assessment tools; implement audit programs.

6. **Rural enhancement**: Create additional rural incentives; fund telehealth infrastructure; support mobile geriatric teams.

7. **Curriculum accountability**: Tie portion of Medicare GME funding to curriculum standards; publish school-level data on geriatric training.

8. **State incentives**: Create federal matching funds for state Medicaid enhancements; provide technical assistance for state programs.

### General Implementation Concerns

**Coordination challenges**: Multiple agencies (CMS, HRSA, VA, ACGME) must coordinate effectively. Establish interagency committee with clear lead agency designation.

**Budget sustainability**: Initial investments must demonstrate value to secure continued appropriations. Build in rigorous evaluation from the start.

**Workforce pipeline timing**: Training expansion takes years to produce practicing physicians. Communicate realistic timelines; invest in parallel NP/PA expansion.

**Healthcare system transformation**: Payment reform alone won't change practice models. Complement with Age-Friendly Health Systems expansion and quality incentives.

**Political sustainability**: Programs must maintain support across administrations. Build bipartisan coalition; demonstrate constituent benefit.
