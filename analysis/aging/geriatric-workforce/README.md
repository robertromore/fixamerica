# Geriatric Healthcare Workforce

The geriatric healthcare workforce encompasses physicians, nurses, social workers, and other professionals specially trained to care for older adults. As the U.S. population ages rapidly—with the 65+ population projected to reach 95 million by 2060—the nation faces a critical shortage of geriatric-trained providers. Fewer than 7,500 board-certified geriatricians practice in the United States, a number that has declined since 2000 even as the older population has grown. This shortage affects care quality, contributes to overuse of hospitals and nursing homes, and leaves millions of older adults without access to age-appropriate care.
