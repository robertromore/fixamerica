# Aging Policy

The United States faces an unprecedented demographic transformation. By 2030, more than one in five Americans will be 65 or older, and the 85-plus population will nearly triple by 2060. This shift strains retirement security, long-term care, health systems, and caregiving infrastructure built for a younger nation. Policies must evolve to support older Americans' health, financial security, and autonomy while controlling costs and strengthening the workforce that provides care.
