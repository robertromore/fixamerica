# Aging Policy

## Overview

The United States faces an unprecedented demographic transformation. By 2030, more than one in five Americans will be 65 or older, and the 85-plus population will nearly triple by 2060. This shift strains retirement security, long-term care, health systems, and caregiving infrastructure built for a younger nation. Policies must evolve to support older Americans' health, financial security, and autonomy while addressing challenges like the "middle-income trap" for long-term care and ensuring protection from abuse and exploitation.

## Scope

This analysis examines:

- **Retirement security**: Social Security solvency, pension coverage, and savings adequacy
- **Long-term care**: The "middle-income trap," nursing facilities, and care financing
- **Health care**: Medicare sustainability, chronic disease management, and care coordination
- **Caregiving**: Paid workforce shortages and the $600 billion unpaid family caregiver burden
- **Quality of life**: End-of-life care, protection from abuse, and social isolation

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Population 65+ | 58.9 million (17.5% of population) | Census Bureau, 2024 |
| Population 85+ by 2060 | 19 million (projected) | Census Bureau |
| Medicare spending | $1 trillion annually | CMS, FY 2024 |
| Social Security beneficiaries | 67 million | SSA, 2024 |
| Unpaid family caregivers | 53 million | AARP, 2023 |
| Economic value of unpaid care | $600 billion annually | AARP, 2023 |
| Paid care worker median wage | $17.36/hour | BLS, 2024 |
| Nursing home annual cost | $108,000 (private room) | Genworth, 2024 |

## Why This Matters

**Fiscal sustainability**: Medicare and Social Security face projected trust fund shortfalls in the 2030s without reforms. Medicare's Hospital Insurance trust fund is projected for depletion by 2033; Social Security's combined trust funds by 2032 (following the 2025 "One Big Beautiful Bill Act").

**Family economic burden**: The average household spends $7,200 annually on elder care costs, while family caregivers provide an estimated $600 billion in unpaid economic value collectively each year.

**The Middle-Income Trap**: Many seniors earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but lack the private savings to afford long-term care, which can exceed $100,000 annually for a private nursing room.

**Vulnerability to abuse**: Approximately 1 in 10 older Americans experience elder abuse, yet the problem remains largely hidden due to underreporting and fragmented protective systems.

**Workforce crisis**: The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a need for 8.3 million paid caregivers by 2033, but current training pipelines and wage levels cannot meet demand.

**Inequality**: Seniors of color are twice as likely to live in poverty. Rural elders face provider shortages and transportation barriers. Women are disproportionately represented among both the caregiving workforce and those needing care.

| [Dementia](dementia/01-overview.md) | Alzheimer's, care infrastructure, research |
| [Elder Abuse](elder-abuse/01-overview.md) | Physical, financial, emotional abuse; neglect; protective systems |

| [Technology](technology/01-overview.md) | Telehealth, digital divide, assistive technology |

## Political Context

Aging policy occupies unusual political territory. Both parties claim to protect Social Security and Medicare, yet fundamental reforms stall:

- **Conservatives** emphasize personal responsibility, market-based solutions, and fiscal restraint
- **Liberals** prioritize benefit expansion, workforce investment, and universal coverage
- **Bipartisan agreement** exists on caregiver support and fraud prevention, but major structural reforms remain contentious

The AARP's 38 million members make seniors a formidable voting bloc, yet generational tensions over resource allocation complicate coalition-building.

## Key Challenges

### Financial Sustainability

- Social Security's cost-of-living adjustments may undercount seniors' actual expenses
- Medicare spending grows faster than GDP, driven by chronic disease and technology costs
- Medicaid's institutional bias drains budgets while HCBS waitlists grow

### Care Infrastructure

- 75% of nursing homes are understaffed relative to federal guidelines
- Home care worker turnover exceeds 65% annually
- Rural areas face acute provider shortages

### Coverage Gaps

- Medicare lacks comprehensive dental, vision, hearing, and long-term care benefits
- The "middle-income trap" leaves millions unable to afford care but ineligible for aid
- 12 states have not expanded Medicaid

## Reform Principles

Effective aging policy should:

1. **Preserve dignity** through person-centered care and maximum autonomy
2. **Ensure adequacy** of income and services for basic needs
3. **Promote efficiency** by rewarding prevention and coordination over volume
4. **Strengthen workforce** through living wages and career paths
5. **Protect vulnerability** from environmental and technological risks
