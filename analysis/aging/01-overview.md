# Aging Policy

## Overview

The United States faces an unprecedented demographic transformation. By 2030, more than one in five Americans will be 65 or older, and the 85-plus population will nearly triple by 2060. This shift strains retirement security, long-term care, health systems, and caregiving infrastructure built for a younger nation. Policies must evolve to support older Americans' health, financial security, and autonomy while controlling costs and strengthening the workforce that provides care.

## Scope

This analysis examines:

- **Retirement security**: Social Security solvency, pension coverage, and savings adequacy
- **Long-term care**: Nursing facilities, home and community-based services, and care financing
- **Health care**: Medicare sustainability, chronic disease management, and care coordination
- **Caregiving**: Paid workforce shortages, family caregiver burdens, and support systems
- **Economic security**: Senior poverty, age discrimination, and housing affordability
- **Quality of life**: End-of-life care, dementia care, elder abuse prevention, and social isolation

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Population 65+ | 58.9 million (17.5% of population) | Census Bureau, 2024 |
| Population 85+ by 2060 | 19 million (projected) | Census Bureau |
| Medicare spending | $1 trillion annually | CMS, FY 2024 |
| Medicaid LTSS spending | $219 billion annually | MACPAC, 2024 |
| Social Security beneficiaries | 67 million | SSA, 2024 |
| Unpaid family caregivers | 53 million | AARP, 2023 |
| Paid care worker median wage | $15.77/hour | BLS, 2024 |
| Nursing home annual cost | $108,000 (private room) | Genworth, 2024 |

## Why This Matters

**Fiscal sustainability**: Medicare and Social Security face projected trust fund shortfalls in the 2030s without reforms. Medicare's Hospital Insurance trust fund is projected for depletion by 2031; Social Security's combined OASI and DI trust funds by 2034.

**Family economic burden**: The average household spends $7,200 annually on elder care costs, while family caregivers lose an estimated $522 billion in wages collectively each year.

**Workforce crisis**: The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a need for 8.3 million paid caregivers by 2033, but current training pipelines and wage levels cannot meet demand.

**Inequality**: Seniors of color are twice as likely to live in poverty. Rural elders face provider shortages and transportation barriers. Women are disproportionately represented among both the caregiving workforce and those needing care.

**Dignity**: How a society treats its oldest members reflects its values. Current systems too often fail to honor autonomy, prevent abuse, or allow people to age in their communities.

## Political Context

Aging policy occupies unusual political territory. Both parties claim to protect Social Security and Medicare, yet fundamental reforms stall:

- **Conservatives** emphasize personal responsibility, market-based solutions, and fiscal restraint, often proposing benefit restructuring or eligibility changes
- **Liberals** prioritize benefit expansion, workforce investment, and universal coverage, often proposing tax increases on higher earners
- **Bipartisan agreement** exists on caregiver support, fraud prevention, and pilot programs, but major structural reforms remain contentious

The AARP's 38 million members make seniors a formidable voting bloc, yet generational tensions over resource allocation complicate coalition-building.

## Key Challenges

### Financial Sustainability

- Social Security's cost-of-living adjustments undercount seniors' actual expenses (especially health and housing)
- Medicare spending grows faster than GDP, driven by chronic disease and technology costs
- Medicaid's institutional bias drains budgets while HCBS waitlists grow

### Care Infrastructure

- 75% of nursing homes are understaffed relative to federal guidelines
- Home care worker turnover exceeds 65% annually
- Rural areas face acute provider shortages

### Coverage Gaps

- Medicare lacks comprehensive dental, vision, hearing, and long-term care benefits
- 12 states have not expanded Medicaid
- Middle-income seniors often earn too much for Medicaid but cannot afford private long-term care insurance

### Coordination Failures

- Medicare and Medicaid operate separately despite serving millions of "dual-eligible" beneficiaries
- Transitions between hospitals, rehab facilities, and home create dangerous gaps
- Social services, housing, and health care remain siloed

## Reform Principles

Effective aging policy should:

1. **Preserve dignity** through person-centered care and maximum autonomy
2. **Ensure adequacy** of income and services for basic needs
3. **Promote efficiency** by rewarding prevention and coordination over volume
4. **Strengthen workforce** through wages, training, and career paths that attract workers
5. **Reduce disparities** in access, quality, and outcomes across race, geography, and income
6. **Maintain sustainability** through balanced financing that does not burden future generations unfairly
