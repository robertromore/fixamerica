# Caregiving Workforce: Legislation

## Overview

Reforming the caregiving workforce requires action at federal, state, and regulatory levels. The legislative approach includes:

1. **Federal legislation** to set wage floors, require benefits, and expand training
2. **Medicaid amendments** to ensure rate adequacy and pass-through requirements
3. **State model legislation** for wage standards, benefits, and career pathways
4. **Regulatory action** through CMS staffing requirements and DOL enforcement
5. **Immigration reform** to create care worker visa pathways

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments required. Wage, benefit, and training requirements fall within existing federal commerce clause authority and state police powers.

## Federal Legislation

3. **Condition provider certification** on wage adequacy
4. **Mandate transparency** in staffing and wage reporting

### Department of Labor Actions

2. **Issue guidance** on care worker classification
3. **Expand Wage and Hour** enforcement capacity
4. **Develop apprenticeship** standards for care work

### State Medicaid Actions

State Medicaid agencies should:

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

| Level | Authority | Basis |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Federal wage floor | Commerce Clause | Regulation of interstate commerce |
| Medicaid conditions | Spending Clause | Conditions on federal funds |
| Immigration | Plenary power | Constitutional grant to Congress |
| State wage laws | Police power | General welfare authority |

### Preemption Issues

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Federal-state conflict | Federal law sets floor; states can exceed |
| ERISA preemption | Benefits mandates may face challenges |
| Immigration preemption | Federal law supreme; state cooperation varies |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| DOL enforcement | FLSA violations, wage claims |
| CMS conditions | Certification, payment |
| State labor boards | State law violations |
| Private actions | Back pay, damages |
| Qui tam | Medicaid fraud claims |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Independent contractor classification | Employers may misclassify workers to avoid mandates | High |
| Small employer exemptions | Workers at small agencies may be excluded | Medium |
| Part-time scheduling manipulation | Reduce hours to avoid benefit thresholds | Medium |
| Pass-through gaming | Creative accounting to appear compliant | High |
| Training cost shifting | Charge workers for required training | Medium |
| Multi-employer structures | Split workers across entities to avoid thresholds | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Enforcement capacity | Limited compliance monitoring | Inadequate funding |
| State variation | Uneven implementation | Federalism |
| Wage floor erosion | Inflation reduces real value | Lack of indexing |
| Benefit portability | Workers lose benefits between jobs | Employer-based system |
| Credential recognition | Training not recognized across states | No national standards |
| Immigration uncertainty | Workers vulnerable to policy changes | Political instability |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-misclassification provisions**: Define care worker status clearly; presume employee status; penalties for misclassification; worker right to challenge
2. **Small employer solutions**: Pooled benefits options; sliding scale compliance; public option for smallest employers
3. **Anti-manipulation rules**: Look-back periods for hours calculation; aggregate hours across employer entities; penalties for scheduling manipulation
4. **Pass-through enforcement**: Third-party audits; public reporting; worker complaint mechanisms; automatic clawback for non-compliance
5. **Paid training guarantee**: Explicit prohibition on training charges; enforcement through DOL; private right of action
6. **Anti-fragmentation rules**: Aggregate employees across related entities; joint employer liability; pierce corporate veil provisions

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Industry resistance | Phase-in periods; rate support; stakeholder engagement |
| State capacity | Federal technical assistance; grant funding |
| Worker awareness | Outreach campaigns; worker organization involvement |
| Political sustainability | Bipartisan framing; constituency building |
| Unintended consequences | Pilot programs; evaluation requirements; adjustment authority |
