# Caregiving Workforce: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles

- **Living wages**: Care workers must be able to support themselves and families
- **Comprehensive benefits**: Health insurance, paid leave, retirement for all workers
- **Professional recognition**: Training, credentials, and career pathways
- **Worker voice**: Collective bargaining and worker representation
- **Funded mandates**: Requirements must come with rate increases
- **Quality connection**: Workforce investment as care quality investment

### Financing Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Medicaid rate adequacy** | Rates must support living wages |
| **Pass-through requirements** | Rate increases must flow to workers |
| **Transparency** | Track how money flows to workers |
| **Multi-payer approach** | Medicare, Medicaid, private pay all contribute |
| **Social insurance** | Long-term financing through dedicated revenue |

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Establish Care Worker Wage Standards

**Description**: Create federal and state wage floors for care workers tied to living wage calculations, with requirements that Medicaid and Medicare rates support these wages.

**Key Components**:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Federal wage floor | $20/hour minimum for all direct care workers |
| Living wage indexing | Tie to regional living wage calculations |
| Medicaid pass-through | 80% of rate increases must go to worker compensation |
| Transparency | Public reporting of wages by facility/agency |
| Enforcement | DOL enforcement with whistleblower protections |

**Evidence**:

- States with higher wages have lower vacancy rates
- DC raised wages to $18.50+; turnover dropped significantly
- Turnover costs ($2,600-$5,000/worker) exceed wage increases
- PHI analysis shows wage increases improve quality metrics

**Challenges**:

- Federal minimum wage politics
- Medicaid rate increases require state buy-in
- Industry opposition to mandates
- Enforcement across fragmented sector

**Implementation**:

| Phase | Timeline | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Year 1-2 | Federal minimum at $18/hour |
| 2 | Year 3-4 | Increase to $20/hour |
| 3 | Year 5+ | Index to living wage |
