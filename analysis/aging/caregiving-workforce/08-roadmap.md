# Caregiving Workforce: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

### Theory of Change

The caregiving workforce crisis stems from decades of policy neglect and structural undervaluation. Reform requires:

1. **Rate reform first**: Medicaid rate increases create fiscal space for wage improvements
2. **Worker power**: Organizing and collective bargaining build political power for further reform
3. **Quality connection**: Linking workforce to care quality builds public support
4. **State innovation**: State-level victories demonstrate what's possible
5. **Federal standards**: Ultimate goal of national standards and financing

### Political Strategy

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Coalition building** | Unite workers, families, quality advocates |
| **Bipartisan framing** | Rural access, veteran caregivers, family values |
| **Crisis narrative** | Workforce shortage as care access crisis |
| **State victories** | Build momentum through state wins |
| **Electoral pressure** | Make care workforce a campaign issue |

### Key Leverage Points

| Leverage Point | Opportunity |
|----------------|-------------|
| Medicaid rate-setting | States set rates; advocacy can change them |
| Federal waiver requirements | CMS can require workforce provisions |
| Medicare conditions | CMS has authority over nursing home staffing |
| State labor law | States can enact higher wages, protections |
| Federal matching | Higher FMAP can incentivize state investment |
