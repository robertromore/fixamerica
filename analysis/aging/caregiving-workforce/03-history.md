# Caregiving Workforce: History

## Historical Development[^1]

Across eras, paid caregiving has expanded in response to demographic change, institutional reform, and crisis, while wages, benefits, and labor protections lagged behind. The result is a workforce that was formalized late, regulated unevenly, and financed in ways that systematically suppress compensation. This historical pattern shapes the present-day workforce crisis.

---

### Pre-Modern Era (Before 1935)

Care for older adults and people with disabilities was historically provided through informal and charitable arrangements:

- **Family members**: Primarily women in extended family households
- **Religious institutions**: Charity hospitals, almshouses, and missions
- **Domestic servants**: Paid caregivers for wealthy families
- **Poor farms**: County-run public institutions for the indigent elderly and disabled

The occupation of "caregiver" did not exist as a formal labor category. Care was embedded in unpaid family labor or domestic service, reinforcing its low social and economic valuation.

---

### Early 20th Century (1900-1935)[^2]

Rapid social change began to strain informal care arrangements.

| Development | Impact on Care Work |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Urbanization | Families dispersed; fewer multigenerational households |
| Women's labor force participation | Competing demands on traditional caregivers |
| Professionalization of nursing | Hospital work elevated; home care devalued |
| Domestic worker organizing | Efforts constrained by legal exclusions and fragmentation |

As institutional medicine professionalized, caregiving outside hospitals became increasingly marginalized, reinforcing a divide between "skilled" clinical labor and "unskilled" personal care.

---

### The Cultural Devaluation of Care

The persistent low wages and poor job quality in caregiving are rooted in its historical association with socially devalued forms of labor.

- **"Women's Work":** Care was seen as a natural, unpaid duty of female family members, not as a formal profession requiring specialized skills and compensation.
- **Domestic Service:** Paid caregiving evolved from domestic service, a field historically occupied by marginalized groups, including immigrant women and women of color, and explicitly excluded from early labor protections.
- **Racial Dynamics:** Following the Civil War, domestic service became one of the few occupations open to Black women. The exclusion of this work from New Deal labor laws was, in part, a reflection of the racial politics of the era.

This legacy created a structural assumption that care work requires little skill and deserves little pay—an assumption that public financing systems later inherited and reinforced.

---

### Social Security Era (1935-1965)[^3]

The Social Security Act of 1935 reshaped old-age security but entrenched exclusions in care work:

- Domestic workers, including many caregivers, were excluded from coverage
- Because domestic and care work was disproportionately performed by Black workers, these exclusions had racially disparate effects
- Household employment remained largely invisible to labor protections
- A bifurcated workforce emerged: covered workers vs. excluded caregivers

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1935 | Social Security excludes domestic workers |
| 1939 | Survivor benefits added; exclusions remain |
| 1950 | Domestic workers added to Social Security |
| 1954 | Coverage expanded, but many remain excluded |

Formal recognition of care labor arrived decades after the creation of core social insurance programs.

---

## Medicare and Medicaid Era (1965-1980)[^4]

### Creation of Medicare and Medicaid (1965)

The establishment of Medicare and Medicaid created the modern paid caregiving workforce by expanding publicly financed care.

| Program | Effect on Workforce |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Medicare home health** | Created employment in certified agencies |
| **Medicaid nursing homes** | Expanded institutional care employment |
| **Personal care services** | Optional benefit; limited early home care growth |

This expansion formalized paid caregiving **without** establishing comprehensive workforce standards.

---

### Early Workforce Characteristics

| Characteristic | 1970s Pattern |
|----------------|---------------|
| Wages | Below minimum wage common |
| Training | Minimal requirements |
| Benefits | Rare |
| Demographics | Predominantly women of color |
| Formalization | Most care still unpaid family work |

Public financing expanded demand, but labor protections and wage standards lagged.

---

### Labor Law Exclusions[^5]

Care work remained structurally excluded from core labor protections.

| Year | Status |
|------|--------|
| 1938 | Fair Labor Standards Act enacted; domestic workers excluded |
| 1974 | Domestic workers added to FLSA |
| 1974 | "Companionship exemption" created |
| 1974-2015 | Home care workers exempt from minimum wage and overtime |

Program expansion occurred alongside continued labor exclusion, reinforcing low wages and weak bargaining power.

---

## Nursing Home Reform Era (1980-2000)[^6]

### OBRA 1987: Nursing Home Reform

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 marked the first federal recognition of direct care workers as a distinct workforce requiring standards.

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Nurse aide training | 75-hour federal minimum |
| Competency testing | Certification exams |
| Registries | State tracking of certified aides |
| Continuing education | Annual training requirements |

This reform improved baseline training consistency but did not address compensation or career advancement.

---

### 1990s Developments

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1993 | PHI (Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute) founded |
| 1999 | *Olmstead v. L.C.* decision |
| 1999 | BLS modern occupational classifications |
| Early 2000s | Some state-funded wage increases |

The *Olmstead* decision accelerated the shift toward community-based care **without a commensurate national workforce strategy**, expanding demand faster than supply.

---

## Modern Era (2000-Present)[^7]

### Growing Recognition (2000s)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2001 | Direct Care Alliance formed |
| 2003 | National Direct Service Workforce Resource Center |
| 2006 | First national direct care worker conference |
| 2007 | California establishes IHSS wage standards |
| 2008 | Financial crisis suppresses wages |

Awareness of workforce challenges grew, but structural reforms remained limited.

### The Rise of Labor Organizing

Beginning in the 1980s and accelerating in the 2000s, labor unions—most notably the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME)—launched major campaigns to organize the home care workforce.

- **Strategy:** Unions organized workers under state-funded consumer-directed programs (like California's IHSS), establishing the state as a de facto employer for collective bargaining.
- **Impact:** These campaigns successfully established collective bargaining agreements covering hundreds of thousands of workers, leading to higher wages, benefits access (health insurance, paid time off), and improved training opportunities in states with strong home care unions.
- **Legacy:** Unionization became one of the most effective strategies for improving direct care job quality, demonstrating that policy and organizing could overcome structural wage suppression.

### State-Level Policy Innovation

While federal policy was often slow to evolve, several states served as laboratories for workforce innovation.

- **California:** The In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program became a national model for consumer-directed care and a focal point for union organizing that dramatically improved worker compensation.
- **Washington:** Washington State was an early leader in establishing a public authority for home care workers, creating a framework for collective bargaining and investing state funds in wages and training.
- **Massachusetts:** The state created a home care worker council to serve as an employer of record, enabling collective bargaining and benefit provision.

These state-level efforts demonstrated that alternative models for financing and structuring the workforce were possible.

---

### Affordable Care Act Era (2010-2015)[^8]

| Provision | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Workforce advisory panel | Federal attention to workforce |
| HCBS expansion | Increased demand for workers |
| Community First Choice | New option expanded services |

The ACA increased service demand but did not establish a national wage or benefit framework.

---

### Companionship Exemption Battle (2007-2015)[^5]

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2007 | Supreme Court upholds exemption |
| 2011 | DOL proposes rule change |
| 2013 | DOL finalizes rule |
| 2015 | D.C. Circuit upholds rule |

**Result:** Home care workers gained minimum wage and overtime protections nearly 80 years after exclusion.

---

### COVID-19 Era (2020-Present)[^9]

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2020 | Care workers designated "essential" |
| 2020 | Severe nursing home workforce losses |
| 2021 | ARPA HCBS FMAP increase |
| 2024 | CMS staffing rule finalized |
| 2024 | Many temporary wage increases expired |

COVID exposed longstanding workforce fragility and produced crisis-driven reform rather than structural redesign.

---

## Key Turning Points[^10]

### 1974: FLSA Domestic Worker Amendment

Partial inclusion created a legacy of incomplete labor protection.

### 1987: OBRA Nursing Home Reform

Established training standards without addressing wages.

### 1999: *Olmstead v. L.C.*[^11]

Shifted care to the community without building workforce capacity.

### 2015: End of Companionship Exemption[^5]

Completed formal labor law inclusion after decades of exclusion.

### 2020: COVID-19 Pandemic[^9]

Exposed systemic vulnerability and accelerated reform momentum.

---

## Historical Wage Trends[^12]

### Inflation-Adjusted Wages

| Year | Median Hourly (2024 dollars) | Change |
|------|------------------------------|--------|
| 1980 | $12.50 | — |
| 1990 | $13.20 | +6% |
| 2000 | $14.00 | +6% |
| 2010 | $14.80 | +6% |
| 2020 | $15.20 | +3% |
| 2024 | $15.77 | +4% |

Inflation-adjusted wages illustrate long-term stagnation rather than meaningful growth.

---

### Wage Comparison Over Time

| Year | Care Worker Wage | Retail Wage* | Ratio |
|------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| 1990 | $13.20 | $11.50 | 115% |
| 2000 | $14.00 | $12.80 | 109% |
| 2010 | $14.80 | $14.50 | 102% |
| 2020 | $15.20 | $16.50 | 92% |
| 2024 | $15.77 | $18.00 | 88% |

*Note: Retail wage is a composite of retail salespersons and cashiers.*

Care work has fallen behind alternative service occupations.

---

## Lessons from History[^13]

Across multiple reform eras, policymakers addressed training, compliance, or access, but rarely addressed compensation, benefits, or career advancement in a sustained way.

### What Has Worked

| Success | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| OBRA training standards | Improved baseline competency |
| Unionization | Higher wages where present |
| Ending labor exclusions | Established baseline protections |
| State wage increases | Modest retention gains |

---

### Persistent Failures

| Failure | Pattern |
|--------|--------|
| Poverty wages | Four decades of stagnation |
| Labor exclusions | Delayed inclusion |
| Training adequacy | Federal minimum unchanged |
| Benefits | Never systematically addressed |
| Career ladders | Minimal development |

---

### Recurring Historical Pattern

- Care work expands in response to crisis or demographic change
- Labor protections follow decades later
- Financing mechanisms cap wages
- Workforce instability persists
- Reform remains reactive rather than anticipatory
