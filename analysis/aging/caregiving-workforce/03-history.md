# Caregiving Workforce: History

## Historical Development[^1]

### Pre-Modern Era (Before 1935)

Care for the elderly and disabled was historically provided by:

- **Family members**: Primarily women in extended family households
- **Religious institutions**: Charity hospitals, almshouses
- **Domestic servants**: Paid caregivers for wealthy families
- **Poor farms**: Public institutions for destitute elderly

The occupation of "caregiver" did not exist as a formal category. Care was embedded in family and domestic work.

### Early 20th Century (1900-1935)[^2]

| Development | Impact on Care Work |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Urbanization | Families dispersed; less multigenerational care |
| Women's labor force participation | Competing demands on traditional caregivers |
| Professionalization of nursing | Hospital work elevated; home care devalued |
| Domestic worker organizing | Organizing constrained by legal exclusions and fragmented workforce |

### Social Security Era (1935-1965)[^3]

The Social Security Act of 1935 shaped care work by:

- Excluding domestic workers from coverage (including many caregivers)
- Racial discrimination: Most Black workers were domestic/care workers
- No coverage for household employees until amendments
- Created bifurcated workforce: covered vs. excluded

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1935 | Social Security excludes domestic workers |
| 1939 | Amendments add survivor benefits; domestic workers still excluded |
| 1950 | Domestic workers finally covered by Social Security |
| 1954 | Social Security coverage expanded, still limited for many domestic workers |

## Medicare and Medicaid Era (1965-1980)[^4]

### 1965: Medicare and Medicaid Creation

These programs created the modern paid caregiving workforce:

| Program | Effect on Workforce |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Medicare home health** | Created employment in certified agencies |
| **Medicaid nursing homes** | Expanded institutional care employment |
| **Personal care optional** | Limited home care workforce growth |

### Early Workforce Characteristics

| Characteristic | 1970s Pattern |
|----------------|---------------|
| Wages | Below minimum wage common |
| Training | Minimal requirements |
| Benefits | Rare |
| Demographics | Already predominantly women of color |
| Formalization | Most care still unpaid family work |

### Labor Law Exclusions[^5]

The Fair Labor Standards Act excluded domestic service workers:

| Year | Status |
|------|--------|
| 1938 | FLSA enacted; domestic workers excluded |
| 1974 | Domestic workers added to FLSA |
| 1974 | "Companionship exemption" created |
| 1974-2015 | Home care workers exempt from overtime, minimum wage |

## Nursing Home Reform Era (1980-2000)[^6]

### OBRA 1987: Nursing Home Reform

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 established:

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Nurse aide training** | 75-hour minimum federal requirement |
| **Competency testing** | Certification exams |
| **Registry** | State registries of certified aides |
| **Continuing education** | Annual training requirements |

This was the first federal recognition of direct care workers as a distinct workforce requiring standards.

### 1990s Developments

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1993 | PHI (Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute) founded |
| 1999 | *Olmstead v. L.C.* accelerates HCBS expansion |
| 1999 | BLS begins modern SOC transition (2000 SOC rollout) |
| Early 2000s | States begin raising wages for publicly funded home care |

## Modern Era (2000-Present)[^7]

### 2000s: Growing Recognition

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2001 | Direct Care Alliance formed |
| 2003 | National Direct Service Workforce Resource Center |
| 2006 | First national direct care worker conference |
| 2007 | California creates first-in-nation IHSS wage standards |
| 2008 | Financial crisis depresses wages, increases demand |

### Affordable Care Act Era (2010-2015)[^8]

The ACA included several workforce provisions:

| Provision | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Personal Care Attendant Workforce Advisory Panel** | Federal attention to workforce |
| **Home health provisions** | Some training requirements |
| **Medicaid HCBS expansion** | Grew demand for workers |
| **Community First Choice** | New option increased workforce demand |

### Companionship Exemption Battle (2007-2015)[^5]

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2007 | Supreme Court upholds DOL companionship exemption (*Long Island Care at Home*) |
| 2011 | Obama DOL proposes rule change |
| 2013 | DOL finalizes rule ending exemption |
| 2014 | Industry lawsuit challenges rule |
| 2015 | D.C. Circuit upholds DOL rule; exemption ends |

**Result**: Home care workers finally entitled to minimum wage and overtime protections.

### COVID-19 Era (2020-Present)[^9]

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2020 | Care workers designated "essential" |
| 2020 | COVID devastates nursing home workforce |
| 2020 | Temporary "hero pay" implemented |
| 2021 | American Rescue Plan: HCBS FMAP increase |
| 2022 | CMS proposes nursing home staffing rule |
| 2024 | CMS finalizes minimum staffing requirements |
| 2024 | Many temporary wage increases expired |

### Recent Policy Developments[^9]

| Development | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Federal staffing mandates | Finalized 2024, implementation ongoing |
| State wage increases | CA, WA, NY lead |
| Union organizing | SEIU campaigns continue |
| Immigration reform | Stalled |
| Better Care Better Jobs Act | Introduced, not passed |

## Key Turning Points[^10]

### 1974: FLSA Domestic Worker Amendment

- Added domestic workers to minimum wage protections
- But created "companionship exemption" that excluded most home care
- Set pattern of partial inclusion that persisted 40 years

### 1987: OBRA Nursing Home Reform

- First federal training standards for nurse aides
- Established workforce as distinct professional category
- Created infrastructure (registries, certification) still in use

### 1999: Olmstead Decision[^11]

- Accelerated shift from institutions to community
- Dramatically expanded demand for home care workers
- Workforce supply did not keep pace

### 2015: End of Companionship Exemption[^5]

- Home care workers gained FLSA protections
- Minimum wage and overtime requirements
- Marked full inclusion in labor law 80 years after exclusion

### 2020: COVID-19 Pandemic[^9]

- Exposed crisis in nursing home staffing
- 100,000+ nursing home resident deaths (2020-2023)
- 15% of workforce left industry (est.)
- Created political momentum for reform

### Policy Milestones Timeline

| Year | Milestone | Workforce Relevance |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1935 | Social Security Act | Excluded many domestic workers |
| 1965 | Medicare/Medicaid created | Formalized paid caregiving |
| 1974 | FLSA domestic coverage | Added protections with exemptions |
| 1987 | OBRA nurse aide standards | Federal training minimums |
| 1999 | Olmstead decision | Expanded community-based demand |
| 2015 | Companionship exemption ended | Minimum wage/overtime coverage |
| 2024 | CMS staffing rule finalized | Federal staffing baseline |

## Historical Wage Trends[^12]

### Inflation-Adjusted Wages

| Year | Median Hourly (2024 dollars) | Change |
|------|------------------------------|--------|
| 1980 | $12.50 | — |
| 1990 | $13.20 | +6% |
| 2000 | $14.00 | +6% |
| 2010 | $14.80 | +6% |
| 2020 | $15.20 | +3% |
| 2024 | $15.77 | +4% |

Real wage growth has been minimal over 40+ years.

### Wage Comparison Over Time

| Year | Care Worker Wage | Retail Wage | Ratio |
|------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| 1990 | $13.20 | $11.50 | 115% |
| 2000 | $14.00 | $12.80 | 109% |
| 2010 | $14.80 | $14.50 | 102% |
| 2020 | $15.20 | $16.50 | 92% |
| 2024 | $15.77 | $18.00 | 88% |

Care workers have fallen behind retail workers.

## Lessons from History[^13]

### What Has Worked

| Success | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| **OBRA 1987 training standards** | Improved baseline training consistency |
| **Unionization** | Higher wages in union settings |
| **Ending companionship exemption** | Established baseline protections |
| **State wage increases** | Modest retention improvements |
| **COVID attention** | Created policy momentum |

### Persistent Failures

| Failure | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| **Poverty wages** | 40+ years without meaningful increase |
| **Labor law exclusion** | 80 years to gain full FLSA coverage |
| **Training adequacy** | 75-hour minimum unchanged since 1987 |

| **Career ladders** | Minimal development |

### Historical Patterns

| Pattern | Manifestation |
