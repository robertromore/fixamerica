|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Free market conservatives** | Government wage-setting | Market should determine wages |
| **Fiscal conservatives** | Medicaid rate increases | Unsustainable spending growth |
| **Libertarians** | Occupational regulation | Training mandates restrict entry |
| **Business conservatives** | Employer mandates | Benefits should be voluntary |
| **Anti-union conservatives** | Collective bargaining | Increases costs, reduces flexibility |

This table summarizes ideological objections and their typical framing.

## Opposition Arguments

### Argument 1: "Wage Mandates Will Cause Provider Closures"

**Claim**: Requiring higher wages without commensurate rate increases will force nursing homes and home care agencies to close, reducing access to care.

**Reality**:

- Facilities already closing due to staffing shortages from low wages
- High-wage providers often have better financial performance
- Turnover costs (65% annual rate) exceed cost of wage increases
- Closure threats historically overestimated; rarely materialize
- States with higher wages haven't seen mass closures

**Who makes this argument**: AHCA, state provider associations, some home care agencies.

### Argument 2: "There Aren't Enough Workers Even at Higher Wages"

**Claim**: The workforce shortage is demographic, not economic—raising wages won't solve it because workers simply don't exist.

**Reality**:

- Current wages don't compete with Amazon, fast food ($18-20/hr)
- States with higher wages have lower vacancy rates
- "Shortage" is partly workers choosing other sectors
- Immigration reform could expand workforce
- Many former care workers would return for better pay/conditions

**Who makes this argument**: Industry groups, some economists, facility owners.

### Argument 3: "Higher Wages Mean Higher Costs for Care Recipients"

**Claim**: Wage increases will be passed on to families already struggling with care costs.

**Reality**:

- Most long-term care is Medicaid-funded; rates set by state
- Private pay clients already pay $30+/hour; workers see fraction
- Higher wages improve quality, reducing other costs
- Family caregivers currently absorb costs through unpaid labor
- Other countries fund living wages through social insurance

**Who makes this argument**: Some consumer advocates, industry groups, fiscal conservatives.

### Argument 4: "Benefits Mandates Hurt Part-Time Workers"

**Claim**: Workers prefer flexibility; mandating benefits will reduce hours and eliminate jobs.

**Reality**:

- 43% of workers rely on public benefits due to low employer compensation
- Part-time scheduling often driven by employer, not worker choice
- Workers consistently prioritize health insurance in surveys
- Mandates can be structured to protect part-time workers
- Current system subsidizes employers through public programs

**Who makes this argument**: Industry groups, some libertarian-leaning economists.

### Argument 5: "Training Requirements Create Barriers to Entry"

**Claim**: Requiring more training will reduce workforce by creating barriers for low-income workers.

**Reality**:

- Most training requirements are minimal (75 hours for CNAs)
- Paid training can reduce barriers while improving quality
- Other countries require more training and have adequate workforces
- Training creates career pathways, improving retention
- Quality problems partly trace to insufficient training

**Who makes this argument**: Some industry groups, libertarians.

### Argument 6: "Unions Are Bad for Care Quality"

**Claim**: Unionization increases costs, creates adversarial relationships, and harms care quality.

**Reality**:

- Unionized facilities often have lower turnover
- Collective bargaining has improved staffing ratios
- Union contracts can include quality provisions
- Workers with voice more likely to report problems
- Many high-quality international systems have unionized workforces

**Who makes this argument**: Nursing home industry, anti-union groups, some employers.

### Argument 7: "The Market Should Set Wages"

**Claim**: Government shouldn't interfere in wage-setting; market equilibrium will attract workers.

**Reality**:

- Market has failed to deliver adequate workforce
- Medicaid already sets effective wage ceiling through rates
- Care labor has unique market failures (information asymmetry, captive consumers)
- "Market" wages depend on policy choices (minimum wage, immigration, etc.)
- No country has solved care workforce through pure markets

**Who makes this argument**: Free market economists, libertarian groups.

### Argument 8: "Immigration Reform Would Undercut American Workers"

**Claim**: Expanding immigration for caregiving will suppress wages for American workers.

**Reality**:

- Current vacancies show insufficient domestic workers
- 27% of workforce already immigrant; deportation would cause crisis
- Immigration expansion should come with wage protections
- Other countries combine immigration with strong labor standards
- Immigrant workers often fill shifts others won't take

**Who makes this argument**: Some labor groups, immigration restrictionists.

## Counter-Evidence Index
