# Caregiving Workforce: Current State

## Present Conditions

America's direct care workforce operates in a state of permanent crisis. Despite providing essential services that enable millions to live with dignity, these workers face poverty wages, lack of benefits, difficult working conditions, and limited advancement opportunities. The current state includes chronic understaffing, high turnover, and quality problems that affect both workers and care recipients.

## Workforce Composition (2023 OEWS; 2022 ACS)

**Definition (direct care)**: Paid workers who provide hands-on assistance with activities of daily living or health-related tasks in home, community, and facility settings; typically includes personal care aides, home health aides, and nursing assistants. Some datasets include psychiatric aides; this section flags where that broader scope is used.[^11]

### Data Caveats

Figures in this section combine survey, administrative, and projection sources with slightly different occupational definitions and time frames. Where categories vary across sources (for example, inclusion of psychiatric aides), notes in the tables indicate the broader scope. Shortage and turnover figures are based on provider surveys and may reflect differences in measurement across states and settings.[^4]

### By Occupation[^1]

| Occupation | Number | Median Wage | Primary Setting |
|------------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Personal care aides** | 2.5 million | $14.93/hour | Home care |
| **Home health aides** | 940,000 | $15.72/hour | Home health agencies |
| **Nursing assistants** | 1.4 million | $17.41/hour | Nursing homes, hospitals |
| **Psychiatric aides** | 50,000 | $17.92/hour | Psychiatric facilities |
| **Total (rounded)** | 4.9 million | $15.77/hour | Various |

Note: Includes psychiatric aides; some direct care definitions exclude this category.[^11]
These counts highlight the concentration of employment in home care roles relative to institutional settings.[^1]

### Demographics[^2]

| Characteristic | Percentage |
|----------------|------------|
| Female | 87% |
| People of color | 62% |
| Black/African American | 26% |
| Hispanic/Latino | 20% |
| Asian | 9% |
| Other/multiple | 7% |
| Immigrant (foreign-born) | 27% |
| Age 45+ | 48% |
| Age 55+ | 26% |

The workforce is overwhelmingly female and racially diverse, with a large mid- to late-career cohort.[^2]

### Education and Experience[^2]

| Characteristic | Percentage |
|----------------|------------|
| High school diploma or less | 52% |
| Some college | 32% |
| Associate degree or higher | 16% |
| New to occupation (less than 1 year) | 25% |
| 5+ years in occupation | 40% |

Education levels skew toward high school and some college, with substantial shares of both new entrants and long-tenured workers.[^2]

## Economic Status (2023 OEWS; 2023 CPS ASEC)

### Wages[^1]

| Occupation | 10th Percentile | Median | 90th Percentile |
|------------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Personal care aides | $11.71 | $14.93 | $19.46 |
| Home health aides | $12.33 | $15.72 | $20.13 |
| Nursing assistants | $13.66 | $17.41 | $22.82 |
| All U.S. occupations (BLS OEWS) | $13.67 | $23.11 | $59.14 |

Direct care wages cluster in the mid-teens, well below the national all-occupation median.[^1]

### Pay Parity Pressures[^12]

| Comparison | Typical Range | Note |
|------------|---------------|------|
| Retail/food service wages | Similar or higher | Tight local labor markets coincide with competition |
| Hospital support roles | Higher | Competes for the same workers |
| Home care vs. nursing home | Lower in home care | Reimbursement and scheduling volatility |

Even modest wage differentials are reported alongside weaker applicant flow into home care, especially in markets where retail and warehouse pay rose post-2020. The gap is most visible in high-cost metros where home care rates lag local living costs.[^12]

### Annual Income[^3]

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Median annual income by occupation (range) | $21,000-$29,000 |
| Full-time equivalent | $32,800 |
| Poverty threshold (individual) | $15,060 |
| 200% FPL | $30,120 |
| Share working part-time | 35% |
| Share working multiple jobs | 22% |

Annual earnings reflect low hourly wages and the prevalence of part-time and multi-job work.[^3]

### Payer Mix and Reimbursement[^13]

| Payer | Role in Financing | Workforce Impact |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Medicaid | Primary LTSS payer | Rates function as wage benchmarks |
| Medicare | Limited home health | Emphasis on skilled care relative to long-term support |
| Private pay | Concentrated in higher-income markets | Associated with local wage dispersion |

Payer mix varies by market, and reimbursement rates align with the baseline for provider wage offers.[^13]

### Benefits Access[^3]

| Benefit | % with Access |
|---------|---------------|
| Health insurance (any source) | 85% |
| Employer-provided health insurance | 45% |
| Paid sick leave | 50% |
| Paid vacation | 40% |
| Retirement plan (employer) | 30% |
| Any paid leave | 55% |

Benefits are uneven, with employer-provided coverage available to less than half of workers.[^3]

### Public Benefits Usage[^3]

| Benefit | % Receiving |
|---------|-------------|
| Any public assistance | 43% |
| Medicaid | 32% |
| SNAP (food stamps) | 21% |
| EITC | 35% |
| Housing assistance | 8% |

A large share of workers rely on public benefits to meet basic needs.[^3]

## Employment Characteristics (2022 ACS; 2023 CPS ASEC)

### Work Arrangements[^3]

| Characteristic | Percentage |
|----------------|------------|
| Full-time (35+ hours) | 65% |
| Part-time by choice | 15% |
| Part-time involuntary | 20% |
| Multiple jobs | 22% |
| Variable schedule | 45% |
| On-call work | 30% |

Nonstandard schedules and multiple jobs are common features of direct care employment.[^3]

### Employment Settings[^2]

| Setting | Workers | Share |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Home care/personal care agencies | 2.8 million | 61% |
| Nursing homes | 600,000 | 13% |
| Residential care/assisted living | 450,000 | 10% |
| Hospitals | 400,000 | 9% |
| Home health agencies | 250,000 | 5% |
| Other | 100,000 | 2% |

Home care agencies account for most employment, with smaller shares in institutional settings.[^2]

### Employer Types[^2]

| Type | Share of Employment |
|------|---------------------|
| Private for-profit | 62% |
| Private nonprofit | 20% |
| Government | 8% |
| Self-directed (consumer-directed) | 10% |

For-profit firms dominate, while consumer-directed models represent a notable minority share.[^2]

## Workforce Shortage (BLS 2022-2032 projections)[^4]

### Current Gaps

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Estimated shortage (national) | 150,000+ workers |
| Nursing home vacancy rate | 15-20% |
| Home care unfilled positions | 10-15% |
| States with acute shortages | 45 |

Shortage estimates reflect provider surveys with varying definitions and self-reported gaps.[^4]
Vacancy and unfilled-position data indicate persistent, widespread unmet demand.[^4]

### Demand Projections

| Metric | 2022 | 2032 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Home health/personal care aides | 3.4 million | 4.2 million | +22% |
| Nursing assistants | 1.4 million | 1.5 million | +5% |
| Job openings per year | 690,000 | 800,000+ | +16% |

Projected growth is concentrated in home health and personal care, alongside high annual openings.[^4]

### Supply Constraints

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Low wages** | Workers choose retail, fast food |
| **Competition** | Amazon, Walmart, Target pay more |
| **Demographics** | Working-age population growing slowly |
| **Immigration limits** | Visa restrictions |
| **COVID aftermath** | Many workers left industry |

These constraints co-occur with recruitment and retention challenges across settings.[^4]

### Pipeline Constraints[^14]

| Bottleneck | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Training capacity | Associated with fewer new entrants |
| Background checks | Delays hiring and placement |
| Credential reciprocity | Hinders interstate mobility |
| Career ladders | Weak retention incentives |

Training capacity remains uneven across states, with slower credentialing and placement in many areas. Background checks and onboarding requirements often take multiple weeks, while limited reciprocity across states is associated with lower mobility for certified workers.[^14]

### Immigration Constraints[^15]

| Constraint | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Limited visa pathways | Associated with slower workforce growth |
| Backlogs and caps | Slow entry and retention |
| Work authorization instability | Increases churn |

Direct care roles have limited dedicated visa pathways, and backlogs in employment-based categories are associated with slower entry even when demand is high. Work authorization instability is reported alongside higher turnover as workers cycle in and out of eligibility.[^15]

### Measurement Appendix

Provider surveys typically define vacancy and turnover at the facility or agency level, which can differ from labor market measures used in federal surveys. Administrative sources (for example, CMS and state Medicaid data) often capture staffing compliance or payroll snapshots rather than full-year retention patterns. These differences mean vacancy, turnover, and shortage figures are not always directly comparable across sources.[^4]

## Turnover Crisis[^5]

### Turnover Rates

| Setting | Annual Turnover |
|---------|-----------------|
| Nursing homes | 65-80% |
| Home care agencies | 60-70% |
| Assisted living | 50-60% |
| Hospitals | 20-30% |

Turnover is highest in long-term care settings, amplifying staffing instability.[^5]

### Turnover Costs

| Cost Component | Estimated Amount |
|----------------|------------------|
| Recruitment | $500-$1,000 |
| Training | $1,000-$2,000 |
| Lost productivity | $500-$1,500 |
| Quality impact | Difficult to quantify |
| **Total per worker** | $2,000-$4,500 |

Replacing a worker typically costs several thousand dollars in direct and indirect expenses.[^5]

### Turnover Reasons

| Reason | % Citing |
|--------|----------|
| Low pay | 65% |
| Better opportunity elsewhere | 45% |
| Difficult working conditions | 40% |
| Lack of respect | 35% |
| No advancement | 30% |
| Physical demands | 25% |
| Family responsibilities | 20% |

Pay and alternative job opportunities are the most frequently cited drivers of exits.[^5]

## Working Conditions[^6]

### Physical Demands

| Challenge | % Reporting |
|-----------|-------------|
| Heavy lifting required | 70% |
| Back pain/injury | 45% |
| On feet entire shift | 80% |

The work is physically demanding and associated with high injury exposure.[^6]

### Emotional Demands

| Challenge | % Reporting |
|-----------|-------------|
| Emotional stress | 65% |
| Dealing with death/dying | 50% |
| Verbal abuse from clients | 40% |
| Physical abuse from clients | 15% |
| Burnout symptoms | 55% |

Emotional strain and burnout are prevalent across direct care roles.[^6]

### Scheduling Challenges

| Challenge | % Reporting |
|-----------|-------------|
| Unpredictable hours | 45% |
| On-call requirements | 30% |
| Split shifts | 25% |
| Overtime mandatory | 35% |
| Weekend/holiday work | 70% |

Irregular hours and weekend coverage requirements contribute to retention challenges.[^6]

## Training and Credentials[^7]

### Current Requirements

| Setting | Federal Minimum Training |
|---------|-------------------------|
| **Nursing homes (CNAs)** | 75 hours (some states higher) |
| **Home health (Medicare)** | 75 hours |
| **Personal care (Medicaid)** | Varies by state (0-40 hours) |
| **Assisted living** | Varies by state |

Training requirements vary widely by setting, with a 75-hour federal floor in some sectors.[^7]

### State Variation

| Training Level | Number of States |
|----------------|------------------|
| 120+ hours | 8 |
| 100-119 hours | 10 |
| 75-99 hours | 20 |
| Less than 75 hours | 12 |

Most states sit near the federal minimum, with relatively few requiring 120+ hours.[^7]

### Continuing Education

| Requirement | Compliance |
|-------------|------------|
| Annual training required | 85% of states |
| Hours required | 8-24 hours |
| Actual compliance | Variable |

Continuing education requirements are common, but adherence is inconsistent.[^7]

## Geographic Variation (2023 OEWS)[^1]

### Regional Wages

| Region | Median Hourly Wage |
|--------|-------------------|
| Northeast | $17.50 |
| West | $16.80 |
| Midwest | $15.20 |
| South | $14.10 |
| National | $15.77 |

Regional pay differences align with cost-of-living and labor market variation.[^1]

### High-Cost States

| State | Median Wage | Cost of Living Adj. |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| California | $17.15 | Below COL |
| New York | $18.20 | Below COL |
| Massachusetts | $18.50 | Below COL |
| Washington | $19.00 | At/near COL |

Even in high-cost states, wages often lag local living costs.[^1]

### Low-Wage States

| State | Median Wage | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Mississippi | $12.80 | Lowest nationally |
| Louisiana | $13.10 | Below federal min + $5 |
| Arkansas | $13.40 | Medicaid expansion recent |
| Alabama | $13.50 | No Medicaid expansion |

Low-wage states are several dollars below national medians, intensifying recruitment challenges.[^1]

### Rural vs. Urban

| Area | Challenge |
|------|-----------|
| **Rural** | Fewer workers, lower wages, travel distances |
| **Urban** | Higher costs, more competition, housing unaffordable |
| **Suburban** | Mixed challenges, commute costs |

Both rural and urban areas face distinct but significant barriers to stable staffing.[^16]

### Rural Access Gaps[^16]

| Metric | Rural Pattern |
|--------|--------------|
| Travel time per visit | Higher due to distance |
| Agency coverage | Fewer providers per capita |
| Staffing stability | Higher vacancy and turnover |

Rural shortages are reported alongside missed visits and longer waitlists, with higher travel time and lower paid care hours per route. Smaller agencies also report difficulty sustaining coverage across large service areas.[^16]

## Recent Trends (COVID era 2020-2023)[^8]

### COVID-19 Impact

| Change | Magnitude |
|--------|-----------|
| Workers who left industry (estimate) | 15% |
| Temporary wage increases | $2-5/hour (many expired) |
| Burnout increase | +40% reporting |
| Infections/deaths (estimate) | 3,000+ worker deaths |
| Retention bonuses | Widespread but temporary |

Pandemic shocks reduced workforce capacity while raising stress and mortality risks.[^8]

### Post-COVID Changes

| Trend | Direction |
|-------|-----------|
| Wages | Modest increases, not keeping pace with inflation |
| Staffing shortages | Worsened |
| Worker organizing | Increased |
| Policy attention | Heightened |
| Provider financial stress | Increased |

Post-pandemic recovery has not reversed staffing shortages despite modest wage gains.[^8]

### Union Representation[^9]

| Sector | Union Density |
|--------|---------------|
| Nursing homes | 8-10% |
| Home care | 15-20% |
| Hospitals | 12-15% |
| All private sector | 6% |

Union density remains modest outside home care, with bargaining power varying by market and employer type.[^9]
Recent organizing wins:

- SEIU campaigns in multiple states
- California home care unionization
- Strike activity increased

## Quality Implications[^10]

### Staffing-Quality Connection

| Staffing Level | Quality Outcome |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Higher staffing | Fewer falls, infections, pressure ulcers |
| Lower turnover | Better continuity, resident satisfaction |
| Better training | Fewer errors, improved care |
| Worker satisfaction | Associated with resident satisfaction |

Quality outcomes are reported to be better where staffing levels and training are stronger.[^10]

### Current Quality Concerns

| Issue | Connection to Workforce |
|-------|------------------------|
| 75% nursing homes deficient | Understaffing commonly cited |
| Preventable hospitalizations | Missed warning signs |
| Medication errors | Training, workload |
| Falls | Insufficient monitoring |
| Pressure ulcers | Inadequate repositioning |

Many quality failures are reported alongside understaffing and uneven training.[^10]

### Enforcement Signals[^17]

| Signal | Connection |
|--------|------------|
| Staffing citations | Highlight chronic understaffing |
| Infection control deficiencies | Reported alongside staffing gaps |
| Complaint-driven surveys | More frequent with turnover and short staffing |

Inspection and citation data routinely flag staffing shortages and infection-control lapses that are reported alongside turnover and vacancy spikes. Complaint-driven surveys are more common in facilities relying on temporary staffing or operating below recommended staffing levels.[^17]
