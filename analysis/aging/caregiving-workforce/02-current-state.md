# Caregiving Workforce: Current State

## Present Conditions

America's direct care workforce operates in a state of permanent crisis. Despite providing essential services that enable millions to live with dignity, these workers face poverty wages, lack of benefits, difficult working conditions, and limited advancement opportunities.
