**State Issues**:

- State care worker wage floors
- Medicaid rate increases
- Training program funding
- Pass-through requirements

### Sample Script: Federal Representative

> "I'm calling to urge [Representative/Senator name] to support investments in the direct care workforce. The 4.6 million workers who care for our elderly and disabled are paid poverty wages—a median of $15.77 per hour—leading to 65% annual turnover and chronic understaffing.
>
> I'm asking the [Representative/Senator] to:
>
> - Support increased federal Medicaid matching for workforce investment
> - Back CMS staffing requirements for nursing homes
> - Support care worker visa programs in immigration reform
>
> This isn't just about workers—it's about whether our parents and grandparents can get the care they need. Thank you."

### Sample Script: State Legislator

> "I'm calling about the care worker crisis in our state. Our nursing homes and home care agencies can't find workers because wages are too low—often less than Amazon or fast food.
>
> I'm asking [name] to support:
>
> - A state care worker wage floor of at least $20/hour
> - Medicaid rate increases that pass through to workers
> - Funded training and career pathway programs
>
> We all have family members who need or will need care. Please prioritize the people who provide it. Thank you."

### Sample Letter to Editor

> **Care Workers Deserve Living Wages**
>
> The workers who care for our elderly parents and disabled family members earn poverty wages—a median of $15.77 per hour. These "essential workers" praised during COVID remain underpaid and undervalued.
>
> The result? Chronic understaffing, 65% annual turnover, and quality problems in our nursing homes and home care. Meanwhile, 4.6 million care workers struggle to support their own families.
>
> We need state and federal action: higher Medicaid rates that pass through to workers, wage floors that reflect the skill and importance of care work, and benefits for all care workers.
>
> Our parents deserve quality care. The people who provide it deserve living wages.
