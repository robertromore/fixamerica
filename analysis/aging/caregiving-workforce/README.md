# Caregiving Workforce

America faces a caregiving workforce crisis of historic proportions. The 4.6 million direct care workers who provide hands-on support to older adults and people with disabilities are among the lowest-paid workers in the economy, resulting in chronic understaffing, high turnover, and quality problems across the care system. As 10,000 Americans turn 65 every day and the population needing care doubles over the next two decades, the existing workforce shortage of hundreds of thousands of workers will grow to crisis levels without fundamental policy change.
