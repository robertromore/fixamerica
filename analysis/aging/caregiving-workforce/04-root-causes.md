# Caregiving Workforce: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The caregiving workforce crisis is not a market failure or an accident of policy—it is the predictable outcome of deliberate choices embedded in law, economics, and culture. Understanding these root causes reveals why incremental reforms have failed and what fundamental changes are necessary.

## Structural Causes

### Devaluation of Care Work

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Gendered labor** | Care historically unpaid "women's work" |
| **Racial stratification** | Care work assigned to marginalized groups |
| **Invisibility** | Work performed in private settings, not seen |
| **Skill non-recognition** | Emotional, relational skills not valued |
| **Market logic** | Care doesn't produce measurable "output" |

This section reflects a common framing that care is treated as a natural female/maternal activity and is not compensated accordingly.

### Labor Law Architecture

| Exclusion | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **1938 FLSA exclusion** | Domestic workers outside labor protections |
| **1974 companionship exemption** | Home care workers denied overtime |
| **Agricultural worker pattern** | Racialized occupations excluded |
| **Independent contractor status** | Benefits, protections avoided |
| **Anti-union provisions** | Collective bargaining limited |

The legal framework includes exclusions that leave care workers outside standard protections.

### Public Financing Structure

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Medicaid as primary payer** | State budget politics drive wages |
| **Cost containment priority** | Squeeze labor costs first |
| **Fee-for-service payment** | No incentive for quality/retention |
| **State rate-setting** | Political limits on increases |
| **No federal wage floor** | Race to the bottom |

Medicaid's structure is commonly cited as exerting downward pressure on wages.

### Market Failure

| Failure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Monopsony** | Few large employers dominate local markets |
| **Information asymmetry** | Consumers can't evaluate quality |
| **Externalities** | Social costs of low wages not captured |
| **Non-transferability** | Skills not recognized across settings |
| **Segmented labor market** | Care work segregated from general labor market |

Standard market mechanisms are described as weak in care labor markets.

## Institutional Causes

### Fragmented Regulatory System

| Level | Approach | Problem |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Federal** | Medicare conditions, some Medicaid rules | Limited scope |
| **State** | Medicaid programs, licensing | 50 different systems |
| **Local** | Some wage ordinances | Uneven coverage |
| **Private** | Employer policies | Wide variation |

The table summarizes a fragmented regulatory approach without a single national framework.

### Training System Failures

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Inadequate hours** | 75-hour federal minimum unchanged since 1987 |
| **Variable quality** | No national curriculum standards |
| **No career pathway** | Training doesn't lead anywhere |
| **Employer bears cost** | Disincentive to invest |
| **Portability limits** | Credentials don't transfer |

Training requirements are described as minimal, inconsistent, and disconnected from advancement.

### Provider Industry Structure

| Characteristic | Effect on Wages |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **For-profit dominance** | Profit extracted before wages |
| **Private equity ownership** | Financial engineering prioritized |
| **Fragmented market** | Many small agencies can't raise wages |
| **Low margins** | Claim inability to pay more |
| **High administrative costs** | Money spent on overhead |

Provider industry structure is described as diverting resources from worker compensation.

### Immigration Policy

| Constraint | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **No care worker visa** | No legal pathway for workers |
| **Enforcement fear** | Undocumented workers exploitable |
| **Credential non-recognition** | Foreign training not counted |
| **Citizenship requirements** | Barriers to some programs |
| **Deportation threat** | Suppresses wage demands |

Immigration policy is described as relying on immigrant workers while leaving them vulnerable.

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from Status Quo

| Beneficiary | How |
|-------------|-----|
| **Nursing home owners** | Low wages = higher margins |
| **Private equity** | Profit extraction from care |
| **State budgets** | Lower Medicaid costs |
| **Consumers (short-term)** | Lower out-of-pocket costs |
| **Employers in competing sectors** | Access to labor pool |

The table lists groups described as benefiting from low wages.

### Who Loses

| Group | Loss |
|-------|------|
| **Care workers** | Poverty wages, no advancement |
| **Care recipients** | Quality problems, turnover |
| **Family caregivers** | Must fill gaps left by workforce shortage |
| **Taxpayers** | Workers rely on public benefits |
| **Healthcare system** | Preventable hospitalizations |

The table lists groups described as bearing the costs.

### Political Dynamics

| Dynamic | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Worker disorganization** | Low union density limits power |
| **Industry lobbying** | Opposes wage mandates |
| **Fiscal conservatism** | Resists Medicaid spending |
| **Anti-tax sentiment** | Blocks revenue for wages |
| **Electoral politics** | Seniors vote; care workers don't |

The table summarizes political dynamics associated with low wages.

## Causal Diagram

### Primary Causal Chain

```text
Historical devaluation of "women's work"
    ↓
Legal exclusion from labor protections (1938-2015)
    ↓
Medicaid as primary payer with cost containment focus
    ↓
State budget politics constrain reimbursement rates
    ↓
Providers pay poverty wages
    ↓
High turnover, chronic shortages
    ↓
Quality problems, unmet care needs
    ↓
(Status quo persists; no political will to change)
```

**Causal map sources**: The chain reflects themes documented in PHI workforce reports, CMS staffing standards, DOL home care rule history, and Medicaid financing analyses listed in `analysis/aging/caregiving-workforce/09-resources.md`.

### Secondary Dynamics

| Dynamic | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Immigration dependence** | Suppresses domestic wage demands |
| **Training adequacy** | Low standards normalize low expectations |
| **Career pathway absence** | Workers exit rather than advance |
| **Provider consolidation** | Monopsony power |
| **Technology hype** | False promise of replacement |

These dynamics summarize reinforcing pressures beyond the primary causal chain.

### Feedback Loops

| Loop | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Low wages → turnover → training costs → low wages** | Self-reinforcing poverty trap |
| **Worker shortage → overtime → burnout → more exits** | Workforce depletion spiral |
| **Quality problems → regulation → compliance costs → wage pressure** | Regulatory burden increases |
| **Family care substitution → less demand → lower priority → less funding** | Hidden care perpetuates inattention |

These feedback loops describe commonly cited self-reinforcing patterns.

## Root Cause by Category

### Economic Root Causes

| Cause | Mechanism | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Medicaid reimbursement** | Sets ceiling on wages | Wages track Medicaid rates |
| **Market power imbalance** | Workers can't demand more | Monopsony in local markets |
| **Cost externalization** | Society bears costs of low wages | 43% on public benefits |
| **Investment undervaluation** | Human capital not counted | No ROI analysis for training |

This table summarizes economic mechanisms often cited in workforce discussions.

### Social Root Causes

| Cause | Mechanism | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Gendered devaluation** | "Women's work" = low value | 87% female, lowest-paid |
| **Racial stratification** | Care work for marginalized groups | 62% workers of color |
| **Invisibility** | Private settings, hidden work | Not counted in GDP |
| **Status hierarchy** | "Unskilled" label | No professional recognition |

This table summarizes social mechanisms commonly cited in care work devaluation.

### Political Root Causes

| Cause | Mechanism | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Worker disorganization** | Low collective bargaining | 10-15% union density |
| **Industry lobbying** | Oppose mandates | AHCA spending |
| **Fiscal constraints** | State budgets prioritized | Medicaid cuts |
| **Electoral dynamics** | Workers don't vote as bloc | No electoral consequences |

This table summarizes political mechanisms cited in care workforce analyses.

### Institutional Root Causes

| Cause | Mechanism | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Regulatory fragmentation** | No coherent standards | 50+ systems |
| **Training inadequacy** | Low expectations normalized | 75 hours since 1987 |
| **Credentialing failure** | Skills not recognized | No career ladder |
| **Data gaps** | Can't manage what you don't measure | Poor workforce data |

This table summarizes institutional mechanisms tied to workforce constraints.

## Why Problems Persist

### Structural Lock-In

| Lock-In | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Medicaid infrastructure** | Hard to change payment systems |
| **Provider business models** | Built on low wages |
| **Consumer expectations** | Assume care will be cheap |
| **Workforce composition** | Marginalized workers lack power |
| **Policy path dependence** | Easier to maintain than change |

These lock-ins summarize institutional inertia in the current system.

### Reform Obstacles

| Obstacle | How It Blocks Reform |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Cost** | Wage increases = billions in spending |
| **Complexity** | 50 state systems, multiple payers |
| **Industry opposition** | Providers resist wage mandates |
| **Political will** | Low priority relative to other issues |
| **Measurement** | Hard to demonstrate ROI |

These obstacles describe common barriers cited in reform efforts.

### Information Gaps

| Gap | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| **Workforce data** | Can't target interventions |
| **Quality measurement** | Staffing-quality link underappreciated |
| **Cost accounting** | Turnover costs hidden |
| **Public awareness** | Issue not salient |
| **Best practices** | Successful models not disseminated |

These gaps summarize limits in data, measurement, and awareness.

## Comparative Context

Other countries have addressed these causes:

| Country | Approach | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Germany** | Social insurance, regulated wages | Higher wages, stable workforce |
| **Denmark** | Municipal employment, strong unions | Living wages, low turnover |
| **Japan** | National standards, immigration | Workforce adequate but strained |
| **Australia** | National wage determination | Recent increases via Fair Work |
| **Canada** | Provincial variation, some wage floors | Mixed results |

This table summarizes international approaches cited in comparative discussions.
The U.S. stands out for:

- No national wage floor for care workers
- Weakest union representation
- Most reliance on low-wage immigrant labor
- Most fragmented regulatory system
- Lowest public investment in workforce
