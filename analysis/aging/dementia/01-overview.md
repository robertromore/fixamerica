# Alzheimer's and Dementia Care

## Overview

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias represent one of the most significant health challenges facing America's aging population. Over 6.7 million Americans age 65 and older currently live with Alzheimer's disease, a number projected to reach 12.7 million by 2050. The disease exacts an enormous toll—not only on those living with dementia but on the 11 million family caregivers who provide unpaid care, the healthcare system that struggles to meet specialized needs, and a society that has yet to find a cure or disease-modifying treatment.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Disease prevalence and impact**: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias affecting older Americans
- **Diagnostic challenges**: Early detection, access to evaluation, disclosure practices
- **Care delivery**: Specialized dementia care across home, community, and institutional settings
- **Caregiver support**: Family caregiver burden, respite, training, and workplace accommodations
- **Research funding**: Federal investment in finding treatments and a cure
- **Quality of life**: Person-centered care, dignity, and rights of those with dementia
- **End-of-life care**: Hospice access, advance planning, palliative care

This analysis does not cover:

- General aging issues (see [Aging Overview](../01-overview.md))
- Long-term care financing (see [Long-Term Care](../long-term-care/))
- Caregiving workforce (see [Caregiving Workforce](../caregiving-workforce/))

## Key Facts

### Prevalence and Projections

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Americans 65+ with Alzheimer's | 6.7 million |
| Projected by 2050 | 12.7 million |
| Americans with all dementias | 7-8 million |
| Under age 65 with early-onset | ~200,000 |
| Annual deaths from Alzheimer's | ~120,000 |
| 6th leading cause of death | All ages |

### Costs

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total annual cost (2024) | $360 billion |
| Medicare and Medicaid share | $206 billion |
| Out-of-pocket costs | $76 billion |
| Average per-person cost | $57,000/year |
| Lifetime cost per person | $373,000 |

### Caregiving

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Unpaid caregivers | 11 million |
| Hours of unpaid care annually | 16 billion |
| Value of unpaid care | $271 billion |
| Average hours per week | 30 hours |
| Caregivers reporting emotional stress | 59% |
| Caregivers with depression | 30-40% |

### Research Investment

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| NIH Alzheimer's funding (2024) | $3.7 billion |
| Per capita vs. cancer research | ~50% less |
| FDA-approved treatments | 7 (limited efficacy) |
| Disease-modifying treatments | 2 (recent approvals) |

## Why This Matters

### Human Cost

The impact of dementia extends far beyond the person diagnosed:

- **Cognitive decline**: Progressive loss of memory, reasoning, and independence
- **Family disruption**: Caregiving demands transform family relationships
- **Caregiver health**: Physical and mental health impacts on caregivers
- **Economic hardship**: Care costs deplete savings, force work reductions
- **Social isolation**: Both persons with dementia and caregivers become isolated

### Health System Impact

| Impact | Magnitude |
|--------|-----------|
| Hospital admissions | 3x higher than peers |
| ED visits | 2x higher |
| Potentially preventable hospitalizations | 50% higher |
| Nursing home admissions | Primary driver |
| Medicare spending | 3x average |

### Economic Impact

| Impact | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Direct healthcare costs | $360 billion annually |
| Lost productivity (caregivers) | $36 billion annually |
| Reduced work hours | 80% of working caregivers affected |
| Early retirement | 20% of caregivers |
| Projected 2050 costs | $1 trillion+ |

### Equity Dimensions

| Disparity | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Black Americans | 2x higher Alzheimer's risk |
| Hispanic Americans | 1.5x higher risk |
| Women | 2/3 of those with Alzheimer's |
| Rural areas | Less access to specialized care |
| Low income | Less access to diagnosis, support |

## Key Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **No cure** | Despite decades of research, no disease-modifying treatment widely available |
| **Late diagnosis** | Many diagnosed only in later stages, limiting intervention options |
| **Care fragmentation** | No coordinated system for dementia care across settings |
| **Caregiver burnout** | Insufficient support for family caregivers |
| **Workforce gaps** | Healthcare workforce not trained in dementia care |
| **Quality problems** | Nursing homes and other settings lack dementia expertise |
| **Research barriers** | Trial recruitment challenges, funding limitations |

## Core Questions

1. How can early detection and diagnosis be improved while respecting patient autonomy?
2. What care models best support people with dementia and their families across the disease trajectory?
3. How should the significant costs of dementia care be distributed between families, insurers, and government?
4. What level of research investment is appropriate given the scale of the crisis?
5. How can the rights and dignity of people with dementia be protected as capacity declines?
