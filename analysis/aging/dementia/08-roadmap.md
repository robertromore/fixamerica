# Alzheimer's and Dementia Care: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Dementia reform requires action across multiple domains simultaneously: research, care delivery, caregiver support, and workforce development. This roadmap prioritizes building political momentum through bipartisan quick wins while laying groundwork for transformative long-term change.

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Build on success** | Leverage bipartisan research momentum |
| **Multiple tracks** | Research, care, and caregiver streams in parallel |
| **Near-term relief** | Prioritize caregiver support with immediate impact |
| **Evidence generation** | Demonstration projects before national expansion |
| **Coalition building** | Maintain diverse stakeholder alignment |

### Political Context

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Bipartisan support | Strong for research, moderate for care |
| Advocacy strength | Well-organized, influential |
| Federal budget | Constrained but dementia is priority |
| State interest | Growing; some leading |
| Electoral salience | Increasing with aging population |
