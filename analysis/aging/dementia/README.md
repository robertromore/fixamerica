# Alzheimer's and Dementia Care

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias represent one of the most significant health challenges facing America's aging population. Over 6.7 million Americans age 65 and older currently live with Alzheimer's disease, a number projected to reach 12.7 million by 2050. The disease exacts an enormous toll—not only on those living with dementia but on the 11 million family caregivers who provide unpaid care, the healthcare system that struggles to meet specialized needs, and a society that has yet to find a cure or disease-modifying treatment.
