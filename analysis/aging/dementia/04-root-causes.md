# Alzheimer's and Dementia Care: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The challenges in addressing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias stem from multiple intersecting causes: the inherent biological complexity of the disease, the structure of healthcare financing that neglects chronic care, research paradigms that may have limited progress, and social factors that create stigma and delay help-seeking. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective interventions.

## Disease-Level Causes

### Biological Complexity

| Factor | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| **Multiple pathologies** | Amyloid, tau, vascular, inflammation all play roles |
| **Long preclinical phase** | Disease begins 15-20 years before symptoms |
| **Heterogeneity** | Different subtypes, different progression patterns |
| **Late intervention** | Treatment starts after significant damage |
| **Blood-brain barrier** | Limits drug delivery to brain |
| **Lack of biomarkers** | Diagnosis often requires autopsy confirmation |

### Why Research Has Been Slow

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Amyloid hypothesis dominance** | Other approaches underexplored |
| **High trial failure rate** | 99% of drugs fail; industry loses interest |
| **Recruitment challenges** | Hard to enroll diverse, early-stage participants |
| **Long trial timelines** | 5-7 years for major trials |
| **Endpoint debates** | Cognition vs. function vs. biomarkers |
| **Commercial incentives** | Industry prefers symptomatic drugs |

## Healthcare System Causes

### Medicare's Acute Care Model

| Design Flaw | Consequence |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Designed for acute illness** | Doesn't address chronic, progressive disease |
| **Fee-for-service incentives** | No payment for care coordination |
| **Fragmented coverage** | Medicare A/B/D split, no LTC |
| **Specialist focus** | Primary care not equipped for dementia |
| **Limited home care** | Skilled nursing only, not personal care |
| **No family support** | Caregivers invisible to Medicare |

### Diagnosis Barriers

| Barrier | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Primary care capacity** | PCPs lack time, training for evaluation |
| **Specialist shortage** | 6-12 month waits for neurology |
| **Stigma** | Patients, families avoid evaluation |
| **Therapeutic nihilism** | "Why diagnose if no treatment?" |
| **Cognitive assessment** | Not consistently performed |
| **Disclosure challenges** | Providers uncomfortable with diagnosis |

### Care Delivery Fragmentation

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **No care coordination payment** | Nobody owns the patient |
| **Separate systems** | Medical care, HCBS, mental health, housing |
| **Transitions failures** | Falls through cracks at handoffs |
| **No dementia specialty** | Generalist workforce without training |
| **Quality measures lacking** | What gets measured gets managed—dementia isn't |
| **EHR limitations** | Cognitive status not well-captured |

## Financing Causes

### The Medicaid Spend-Down Problem

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **No Medicare LTC benefit** | Dementia care not covered |
| **Medicaid requires poverty** | Must spend down assets |
| **Nursing home bias** | Institutional care easier to get than HCBS |
| **Family financial devastation** | Care costs deplete savings |
| **Perverse incentives** | Divorce, asset transfer to qualify |
| **Class disparity** | Wealthy can self-insure; middle class cannot |

### Private Insurance Failure

| Factor | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **LTC insurance collapse** | 90%+ carrier exit |
| **Adverse selection** | Only high-risk buy |
| **Premium increases** | Unaffordable for many |
| **Dementia exclusions** | Some policies limit coverage |
| **Market failure** | No private solution working |

### Research Funding Gaps

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **Historic underfunding** | Decades of minimal investment |
| **Catch-up mode** | Only recently reached $3B+ |
| **Industry exit** | Failures drove private investment away |
| **Care research neglected** | Focus on cure over care |
| **Prevention understudied** | Risk reduction not prioritized |
| **Implementation research lacking** | Evidence doesn't reach practice |

## Workforce Causes

### Specialist Shortage

| Specialty | Shortage | Driver |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Geriatricians | 26,000 short | Low Medicare reimbursement |
| Geriatric psychiatrists | 4,000 short | Training pipeline |
| Neurologists | Significant | Geographic maldistribution |
| Dementia-trained nurses | Unknown | No credential requirements |

### Direct Care Worker Gaps

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **No dementia training required** | 75 hours total, minimal dementia |
| **Turnover** | 65% annual; no continuity |
| **Wages** | $15.77 median; can't recruit |
| **Burnout** | Dementia care especially difficult |
| **No career ladder** | No advancement in specialty |

### Family Caregiver Burden

| Cause | Result |
|-------|--------|
| **Assumed to be free** | No payment system for families |
| **No workplace protections** | FMLA inadequate |
| **Training not available** | Families learn by trial and error |
| **Respite shortage** | Can't get breaks |
| **Health impacts** | Caregivers get sick |
| **Isolation** | Stigma limits social support |

## Social and Cultural Causes

### Stigma

| Source | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Fear of diagnosis** | Delay help-seeking |
| **Social isolation** | Withdrawal from community |
| **Workplace discrimination** | Early-onset job loss |
| **Dehumanizing language** | "Victims," "shells" |
| **Internalized stigma** | Shame, hiding symptoms |
| **Professional nihilism** | "Nothing can be done" |

### Ageism

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **"Normal aging" dismissal** | Symptoms not taken seriously |
| **Healthcare rationing** | Older patients get less aggressive care |
| **Research exclusion** | Older adults excluded from trials |
| **Structural ageism** | Policies assume aging unimportant |
| **Media stereotypes** | Reinforce negative expectations |

### Racial and Ethnic Disparities

| Disparity | Cause |
|-----------|-------|
| **Higher prevalence** | Cardiovascular risk factors, social determinants |
| **Later diagnosis** | Less access to specialty care |
| **Lower research participation** | Historical mistrust, exclusion |
| **Less culturally appropriate care** | Services designed for White patients |
| **Higher caregiver burden** | Less access to support services |

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from Status Quo

|-------------|-----|
| **Hospital systems** | Readmissions not penalized |
| **Pharmaceutical industry** | Symptomatic drugs profitable |
| **Private insurers** | Don't cover LTC |
| **Nursing home industry** | Medicaid pays for institutional care |
| **States** | Federal government pays most Medicaid |

### Political Obstacles

| Obstacle | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Cost** | Comprehensive dementia care expensive |
| **Fragmented advocacy** | Multiple groups, no unified voice |
| **Competing priorities** | Cancer, heart disease get more attention |
| **Long time horizons** | Benefits decades away |
| **Complexity** | Hard to message simply |
| **Electoral politics** | "Old people problems" lower priority |

### Industry Influence

| Actor | Influence |
|-------|-----------|
| **Pharmaceutical lobby** | Focus on drugs over care |
| **Nursing home industry** | Resist HCBS expansion |
