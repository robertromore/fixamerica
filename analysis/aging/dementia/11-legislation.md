# Alzheimer's and Dementia Care: Legislation

## Overview

Legislative reform for dementia care requires a multi-pronged approach: sustained research investment, Medicare coverage reform, caregiver support, workforce development, and quality standards. This builds on the bipartisan foundation of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) and BOLD Infrastructure Act while addressing gaps in care delivery and financing.

### Legislative Strategy

| Track | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| **Research** | Annual appropriations; sustained advocacy |
| **Care coordination** | Medicare demonstration authority; statutory benefit |
| **Caregiver support** | Tax code changes; program expansion |
| **Workforce** | Medicare conditions; training requirements |
| **Quality** | CMS authority; state partnership |

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments required. Dementia policy reform can be achieved through federal and state legislation using existing constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause, Spending Clause, and Taxing Clause.

## Federal Legislation

### Alzheimer's Research Acceleration Act

**Purpose**: Increase and diversify NIH Alzheimer's research funding with specific allocations for non-amyloid approaches, care research, and prevention.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Alzheimer's Research Acceleration Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) Alzheimer's disease affects 6.7 million Americans and costs over
    $360 billion annually;
(2) Current NIH funding of $3.7 billion is insufficient relative to
    disease burden;
(3) The 99 percent failure rate of clinical trials indicates the need
    for diversified research approaches;
(4) Care and caregiver research has demonstrated impact on quality of
    life but receives minimal funding; and
(5) Prevention research shows promise for risk reduction.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZED FUNDING LEVELS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—There are authorized to be appropriated to the National
    Institutes of Health for research on Alzheimer's disease and related
    dementias—
    (1) $5,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2026;
    (2) $5,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2027; and
    (3) $6,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2028 and each subsequent fiscal
        year.

(b) RESEARCH PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION.—Of the amounts appropriated under
    subsection (a), the Director of the National Institute on Aging shall
    allocate—
    (1) not less than 40 percent to research on non-amyloid mechanisms
        and targets;
    (2) not less than 20 percent to care and caregiver research;
    (3) not less than 15 percent to prevention research;
    (4) not less than 10 percent to health equity research; and
    (5) not less than 10 percent to implementation science research.

SEC. 4. RESEARCH COORDINATION.
(a) STRATEGIC PLAN.—The Director of the National Institute on Aging
    shall develop a 5-year strategic plan for Alzheimer's research that—
    (1) identifies priority research areas across mechanisms;
    (2) promotes coordination among NIH institutes;
    (3) establishes milestones and success metrics; and
    (4) incorporates input from persons living with dementia.

(b) ANNUAL REPORT.—The Director shall submit an annual report to
    Congress on research progress, funding allocation, and emerging
    opportunities.

SEC. 5. CLINICAL TRIAL DIVERSITY.
(a) REQUIREMENT.—The Director shall establish requirements for diversity
    in clinical trial enrollment, with a goal of achieving trial
    populations that reflect the demographics of the affected population.

(b) REPORTING.—All federally funded Alzheimer's trials shall report
    enrollment demographics annually.
```

**Explanation**: This legislation establishes a funding trajectory to $6 billion while mandating portfolio diversification beyond amyloid-focused research. The allocation requirements ensure sustained investment in care research, prevention, and equity.

**Challenges**: Budget constraints; scientific community resistance to mandated allocations; long timelines to research results.

**Refinements**: Consider advisory committee to inform allocation percentages; allow flexibility within ranges; establish review process.

### Medicare Dementia Care Coordination Act

**Purpose**: Create a Medicare benefit for comprehensive dementia care management.

**Draft Text**:

SEC. 4. CAREGIVER LEAVE.
(a) FMLA AMENDMENT.—Section 102 of the Family and Medical Leave Act is
    amended—
    (1) by striking "12 workweeks" and inserting "16 workweeks"; and
    (2) by adding eligibility for leave to provide ongoing care for a
        family member with a serious chronic condition including dementia.

(b) PAID LEAVE.—The Secretary of Labor shall establish a pilot program
    in 5 States to provide partial wage replacement (60 percent of wages,
    up to $1,000 per week) for caregiving leave.
```

**Explanation**: Addresses the financial burden on the 11 million dementia caregivers who provide $271 billion in unpaid care annually. The tax credit, respite guarantee, and leave provisions provide immediate relief.

**Challenges**: Revenue loss from tax credit; program administration; employer concerns about extended leave; respite workforce availability.

**Refinements**: Phase in respite guarantee; include employer tax credits to offset leave costs; allow states to expand beyond federal floor.

### Dementia Workforce Development Act

**Purpose**: Build the workforce capacity needed for quality dementia care through training requirements, geriatric pipeline investment, and wage standards.

**Draft Text**:

```text
