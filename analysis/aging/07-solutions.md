# Aging Policy: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Person-centered** | Seniors choose where and how they receive care |
| **Universal access** | Coverage regardless of income, geography, or health status |
| **Sustainability** | Financing that works for current and future generations |
| **Workforce investment** | Living wages, benefits, and career paths for caregivers |
| **Prevention focus** | Invest upstream to reduce downstream costs |
| **Coordination** | Integrate fragmented systems around the whole person |
| **Equity** | Address disparities by race, income, and geography |

### Design Criteria

| Criterion | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| **Effectiveness** | Evidence base from pilots, international models |
| **Feasibility** | Implementable with existing or achievable capacity |
| **Political viability** | Bipartisan potential or path to majority support |
| **Cost-effectiveness** | Net savings or reasonable cost relative to benefits |
| **Scalability** | Works in diverse states and communities |

## Retirement Security Solutions

### Solution 1: Social Security Solvency Package

**Description**: Comprehensive reforms to restore 75-year actuarial balance while improving adequacy for low earners.

**Key Elements**:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Raise payroll tax cap** | Apply full 12.4% tax to income above $400,000 (currently capped at $168,600) |
| **Increase benefits for long-term low earners** | Boost minimum benefit to 125% of poverty line |
| **Adjust COLA formula** | Use CPI-E (elderly-specific inflation) instead of CPI-W |
| **Modest payroll tax increase** | 0.1% per year for 20 years (employer and employee) |
| **Caregiver credits** | Provide deemed wages for unpaid caregiving years |

**Evidence**: Multiple combinations of revenue increases and benefit adjustments can achieve solvency; progressive approaches maintain support.

**Challenges**: Any "fix" is politically difficult; requires bipartisan negotiation.

### Solution 2: Universal Retirement Savings Access

**Description**: Automatic enrollment in retirement savings for all workers without employer plans.

**Key Elements**:

- State-based auto-IRA programs with federal backup
- Automatic enrollment with opt-out
- Portable accounts follow workers across jobs
- Low-cost index fund options
- Savers tax credit expansion

**Evidence**: Auto-enrollment dramatically increases participation (90%+ vs. 50% with opt-in). State programs (Oregon, California, Illinois) show feasibility.

## Long-Term Care Solutions

### Solution 3: Universal Long-Term Care Insurance

**Description**: Social insurance program providing long-term care benefits for all Americans.

**Key Elements**:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Financing** | Payroll contribution (1.5% split employer/employee) |
| **Benefits** | Cash allowance ($36,000/year) or services up to 3x cash value |
| **Eligibility** | Functional impairment (2+ ADLs) or cognitive impairment |
| **Vesting** | 10 years of contributions; partial benefits with 5 years |
| **Administration** | Federal standards, state administration option |

**Evidence**: Germany (1995) and Japan (2000) implemented social LTC insurance successfully, reducing family burden while controlling costs.

**Challenges**: Requires new revenue; phased implementation over decades.

### Solution 4: Medicaid HCBS Entitlement

**Description**: Convert optional HCBS coverage to mandatory Medicaid entitlement, eliminating waitlists.

**Key Elements**:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Entitlement** | States must cover HCBS for eligible individuals |
| **Enhanced FMAP** | 90% federal match for HCBS (vs. current ~60%) |
| **Quality standards** | Minimum wage, training, supervision requirements |
| **Consumer direction** | Self-directed option in all states |
| **Transition support** | Grants for waitlist elimination over 5 years |

**Evidence**: States with HCBS investment (Oregon, Minnesota, Washington) have lower institutionalization rates and better outcomes.

**Challenges**: Significant federal cost; state capacity variation.

### Solution 5: PACE Expansion

**Description**: Scale Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly nationally.

**Key Elements**:

- Remove geographic restrictions on PACE development
- Streamlined approval process for new PACE organizations
- Enhanced per-capita payments to ensure viability
- For-profit PACE permitted with quality guardrails
- Rural PACE models with telehealth and hub-spoke design

**Evidence**: PACE enrollees have lower hospitalization, higher satisfaction, and delayed nursing home admission.

**Challenges**: Capitated model unfamiliar to some providers; rural adaptation needed.

## Medicare Solutions

### Solution 6: Medicare Benefit Expansion

| **Hearing** | Hearing aids; audiology services |
| **Out-of-pocket cap** | $4,000 annual limit (traditional Medicare) |

**Financing**: Combination of premium increases, higher-income Medicare taxes, and MA payment reductions.

**Evidence**: These are the most-requested benefit additions; lack of coverage drives cost and health problems.

### Solution 7: Medicare Advantage Reform

**Description**: Address overpayments, prior authorization abuse, and quality concerns in MA.

**Key Elements**:

| Reform | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Payment alignment** | Benchmark to 100% of traditional Medicare costs |
| **Prior auth limits** | Ban prior authorization for emergency, urgent care |
| **Quality enforcement** | Meaningful star rating adjustments; audit requirements |
| **Network adequacy** | Enforce access standards; prevent narrow networks |
| **Upcoding penalties** | Reduce payments for diagnosis intensity gaming |

**Evidence**: MA overpayments cost $100B+ over 10 years; prior auth denials harm beneficiaries.

### Solution 8: Drug Pricing Reform Expansion

**Description**: Build on Inflation Reduction Act to expand Medicare negotiation.

**Key Elements**:

- Expand number of drugs subject to negotiation (currently 10-20)
- Apply negotiated prices to commercial market
- Require disclosure of R&D costs and public funding

| **Training investment** | $5B for apprenticeships, CNA-to-RN pathways |
| **Immigration reform** | Care worker visa category; path to citizenship |

| **Spending accountability** | 70% of revenue to direct care |
| **Enforcement** | Increased fines; facility closure authority |
| **Resident rights** | Arbitration clause ban; visitation rights |

### Lessons
