# Senior Poverty and Economic Security: History

## Historical Development

### Pre-Social Security Era (Before 1935)

**Conditions:**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Poverty rate (65+)** | Estimated 50%+ |
| **Income sources** | Family support, savings, charity, poorhouses |
| **Government role** | Minimal; states had poorhouses and outdoor relief |
| **Life expectancy** | ~60 years (fewer reached old age) |
| **Work in old age** | Common until physical inability |

**Old Age as Economic Catastrophe:**

Before Social Security, old age was synonymous with economic vulnerability for most Americans. Without pensions (available only to some government and railroad workers), older adults depended on:

- **Children**: The expectation that children would support aging parents
- **Personal savings**: Minimal for most workers earning subsistence wages
- **Charity and almshouses**: The "poorhouse" was a real destination for destitute elderly
- **Continued work**: Many worked until physically unable

The Great Depression devastated older adults who had managed to save, as banks failed and asset values collapsed. By 1934, over half of older Americans were estimated to be unable to support themselves.

### Social Security Era (1935-1965)

**The Social Security Act of 1935:**

| Component | Original Design |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Old-Age Insurance (OAI)** | Monthly benefits for retired workers 65+ |
| **Old-Age Assistance (OAA)** | Means-tested state grants for poor elderly |
| **Funding** | Payroll taxes on first $3,000 of wages |
| **First benefits** | 1940 (monthly payments began) |
| **Coverage** | About 60% of workers; excluded agriculture, domestic work |

**Key Turning Points:**

| Year | Development | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **1935** | Social Security Act signed | Created federal role in retirement security |
| **1939** | Added survivor and dependent benefits | Extended protection to families |
| **1950** | Major benefit increase; coverage expansion | Raised benefits 77%; brought in more workers |
| **1954** | Disability freeze; more coverage | Protected disabled workers' benefits |
| **1956** | Disability Insurance (DI) added | Benefits for disabled workers before 65 |
| **1961** | Early retirement at 62 for men | Matched women's 1956 provision |
| **1965** | Medicare and Medicaid enacted | Health coverage for elderly; Medicaid for poor |

**Impact on Poverty:**

- 1959: 35% of adults 65+ in poverty (first official measurement)
- Old-Age Assistance provided income to 2.5 million elderly poor
- Social Security benefits remained modest; average $69/month in 1960

### The Great Society and Benefit Expansion (1965-1980)

**1965-1972: Transformation:**

| Year | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| **1965** | Medicare and Medicaid | Eliminated medical bankruptcy risk for elderly |
| **1969** | SSI proposed | To replace state welfare programs |
| **1972** | 20% benefit increase | Largest single increase in history |
| **1972** | Automatic COLAs established | Benefits indexed to inflation (effective 1975) |
| **1972** | SSI created (effective 1974) | Federal floor for aged, blind, disabled |

**The 1972 Amendments:**

The most significant expansion since 1935:

- **20% benefit increase** immediately
- **Automatic cost-of-living adjustments** (COLAs) tied to Consumer Price Index
- **Supplemental Security Income (SSI)** replaced state Old-Age Assistance programs
- **Medicare coverage expanded** to disabled after 24 months

| 1970 | 24.6% |
| 1974 | 14.6% |

### Fiscal Constraints and Retrenchment (1980-2000)

**1983 Social Security Reforms:**

Facing projected insolvency, the Greenspan Commission recommended changes enacted in 1983:

**SSI Stagnation:**

- SSI benefit levels fell further behind inflation
- Asset limits frozen at 1989 levels ($2,000/$3,000)
- Participation declined among eligible elderly

## Lessons from History

### What Worked

| Strategy | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| **Universal social insurance** | Social Security reduced poverty from 35% to 10% |
| **Automatic adjustments** | COLAs protected purchasing power |
| **Medicare creation** | Eliminated medical bankruptcy for elderly |
| **SSI establishment** | Created federal floor for poorest elderly |
| **Benefit increases** | 1972 expansion dramatically cut poverty |

### What Failed

| Approach | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **Market-based retirement** | 40% have no savings; inadequate for most |
| **Voluntary coverage** | Gaps persist; inequality widens |
| **Frozen SSI limits** | Benefit eroded; participation declined |
| **Means-tested programs** | Low participation; stigma; complexity |
| **State variation** | Uneven protection by geography |

### Historical Parallels

**1930s vs. Today:**

| Factor | 1930s | Today |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Economic insecurity** | Bank failures; Depression | Savings inadequacy; pension decline |
| **Political context** | New Deal coalition | Partisan gridlock |
| **Demographic trend** | Increasing life expectancy | Aging population boom |
| **Policy response** | Social Security creation | Potential reform needed |

**The Recurring Pattern:**

1. Crisis reveals inadequacy of existing system
2. Reform coalition emerges
3. New program creates or expands protection
4. Benefits erode through inflation or policy changes
5. New crisis demands response
