# Senior Poverty and Economic Security: Legislation

## Overview

Legislative reform to reduce senior poverty requires action across multiple programs: strengthening Social Security as the primary anti-poverty program, modernizing Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for the poorest elderly, reducing Medicare out-of-pocket costs, expanding affordable housing, improving food security through SNAP, and preventing future poverty through universal retirement savings. This section provides draft federal legislation and state model acts addressing each component, along with analysis of implementation challenges and potential loopholes.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for senior poverty reduction. Social Security, SSI, Medicare, housing assistance, and SNAP all operate within established constitutional authority under the Commerce Clause and Spending Power. The federal government has clear authority to establish social insurance programs, provide public benefits, and condition grants to states.

However, constitutional concerns may arise regarding:

- **State sovereign immunity**: Enforcement mechanisms against states must respect Eleventh Amendment limits
- **Due process**: Benefit termination procedures must provide adequate notice and hearing rights
- **Equal protection**: Benefit rules must not discriminate on prohibited grounds

## Federal Legislation

### Supplemental Security Income Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Comprehensively reform SSI to provide adequate income support for the poorest elderly and disabled Americans by raising benefit levels to the federal poverty line, updating asset limits frozen since 1989, and simplifying enrollment.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Supplemental Security Income Modernization Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
    (1) Supplemental Security Income provides essential income support to
        approximately 7.5 million elderly and disabled Americans.
    (2) The maximum federal SSI benefit of $943 per month represents only
        75 percent of the federal poverty line, leaving recipients in poverty.
    (3) SSI asset limits of $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples
        have not been updated since 1989, equivalent to less than $1,000 in
        1989 dollars today.
    (4) Complex eligibility rules, including in-kind support and maintenance
        provisions, create barriers to enrollment and administrative burdens.
    (5) Approximately 1 million eligible elderly Americans do not receive
        SSI benefits due to enrollment barriers.

SEC. 3. INCREASE IN BENEFIT LEVELS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1611(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
    1382(b)(1)) is amended—

        guidelines for the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia
        as published annually by the Department of Health and Human Services,
        or (B)"; and
    (2) by adding at the end the following: "For purposes of subparagraph

(b) VEHICLES.—Section 1613(a) is further amended by adding:
    "(17) The value of any motor vehicle, without limitation as to number
         or value, if reasonably necessary for transportation."

    is increased from $1,500 to $10,000.

SEC. 6. SIMPLIFICATION OF IN-KIND SUPPORT RULES.
(a) ELIMINATION OF ONE-THIRD REDUCTION.—Section 1612(a)(2)(A) of the
    Social Security Act is amended by striking clauses (i) and (ii) and
    inserting the following:
    "(i) any food or shelter provided by another person shall not be
         counted as income for purposes of determining eligibility or

to carry out this Act.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.
Except as otherwise provided, this Act shall take effect on January 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation**: This legislation addresses the core inadequacies of SSI by: (1) raising the benefit level to 100% of poverty, ensuring recipients can meet basic needs; (2) updating asset limits to reflect inflation since 1989; (3) excluding retirement accounts and vehicles from asset tests to encourage savings and employment; (4) eliminating complex in-kind support rules that penalize recipients for receiving family help; and (5) streamlining enrollment through combined applications and presumptive eligibility.

**Challenges**:

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|
| Budget cost (~$15-20B annually) | Offset through other revenue; investment in poverty reduction |
| SSA administrative capacity | Simplification reduces burden; phased implementation |
| State supplement coordination | Technical assistance; hold-harmless provisions |
| Political opposition | Strong advocacy coalition; bipartisan poverty reduction framing |

        American workers, lifting 22 million Americans out of poverty.
    (2) Despite Social Security's success, approximately 10 percent of
        Americans over age 65 live in poverty.
    (3) Workers with low lifetime earnings, interrupted careers due to
        caregiving, and survivors often receive inadequate benefits.
    (4) The current cost-of-living adjustment formula understates inflation
        experienced by older Americans due to higher healthcare costs.
    (5) Women, who constitute two-thirds of elderly poor, face particular
        disadvantages under current benefit formulas.

SEC. 3. SPECIAL MINIMUM BENEFIT.

            month of qualifying caregiving shall equal 50 percent of the
            national average wage index for that year.
        "(C) MAXIMUM CREDITS.—An individual may receive caregiver credits
            for not more than 60 months (5 years) in total.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following:
    (1) Medicare beneficiaries face average out-of-pocket costs of $6,800
        per year, representing a significant portion of retirement income.
    (2) Unlike virtually all other insurance, traditional Medicare has no
        out-of-pocket maximum, exposing beneficiaries to unlimited costs.
    (3) Medicare does not cover dental, vision, or hearing services despite
        their importance to health and quality of life.
    (4) Approximately 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries lack dental
        coverage, and poor dental health contributes to serious medical

### State Implementation

States retain significant roles in:

- SSI supplementation

| **Medicare** | CMS oversight; OIG investigations; qui tam |
| **Housing** | HUD oversight; fair housing litigation |
| **SNAP** | USDA oversight; administrative penalties |
| **Employer retirement mandates** | DOL enforcement; private right of action |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **SSI asset hiding** | Transfer assets to relatives before applying | Medium |
| **Caregiver credit fraud** | False claims of caregiving | Medium |
| **Medicare DVH overutilization** | Unnecessary procedures for new benefits | Medium |
| **Auto-IRA employer evasion** | Misclassifying workers as independent contractors | High |
| **Housing voucher discrimination** | Source-of-income discrimination by landlords | High |
| **SNAP trafficking** | Selling SNAP benefits for cash | Low |
| **Property tax fraud** | False claims of residency or income | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **SSI still below poverty in high-cost areas** | Inadequate benefits in expensive regions | Uniform national benefit |
| **Medicare DVH limited network** | Access problems, especially dental | Provider shortage; low reimbursement |
| **Housing supply insufficient** | Vouchers unusable in tight markets | Supply-side constraints |
| **Auto-IRA doesn't help current retirees** | No benefit for already-retired | Forward-looking design |
| **State variation in implementation** | Uneven benefit levels across states | Federalism |
| **Benefit cliff effects** | Loss of benefits as income rises | Multiple program interaction |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **SSI asset loopholes**: Implement look-back period for asset transfers (similar to Medicaid); verify assets through data matching with financial institutions

2. **Caregiver credit verification**: Require third-party documentation (physician, social worker); implement audit program; civil penalties for fraud

3. **Medicare DVH overutilization**: Implement prior authorization for major services; utilization review; beneficiary education

4. **Auto-IRA employer evasion**: Strengthen worker classification rules; DOL enforcement targeting; whistleblower protections

5. **Housing voucher discrimination**: Federal prohibition on source-of-income discrimination; active enforcement; landlord incentives

6. **Geographic benefit variation**: Consider regional SSI supplements; Medicare geographic adjusters; housing voucher payment standards

7. **Provider network adequacy**: Dental workforce investment; reimbursement rate increases; community health center expansion

8. **Benefit cliffs**: Coordinate program phase-outs; implement earned income disregards; create transition benefits

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Administrative capacity** | Phased implementation; agency funding; technology investment |
| **Interagency coordination** | Memoranda of understanding; joint guidance; data sharing agreements |
