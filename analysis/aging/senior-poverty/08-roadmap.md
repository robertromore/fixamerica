# Senior Poverty and Economic Security: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Reducing senior poverty requires sustained action across multiple fronts: strengthening the Social Security foundation, modernizing safety net programs, reducing healthcare costs, and preventing future poverty through improved retirement savings. The strategy recognizes that the Social Security trust fund situation creates both urgency and opportunity—solvency legislation must pass, and that legislation can include benefit improvements. The approach sequences reforms to achieve early wins (SSI modernization, SNAP outreach) while building toward comprehensive reform.

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Solvency as opportunity** | Use trust fund deadline to include benefit improvements |
| **Start with most vulnerable** | SSI modernization helps poorest; politically viable |
| **Administrative before legislative** | Maximize executive action; reduce barriers |
| **Build coalition** | Connect senior poverty to broader economic security agenda |
| **Demonstrate impact** | Evaluate and publicize results to build momentum |

### Political Context

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Public support** | Strong (70%+ support strengthening Social Security) |
| **Trust fund deadline** | Creates pressure for action by ~2033 |
| **Partisan landscape** | Social Security historically bipartisan; currently polarized |
| **Budget constraints** | Deficit concerns complicate new spending |
| **Advocacy capacity** | Strong (AARP, unions, advocacy groups) |
| **Window of opportunity** | Solvency deadline creates action-forcing event |
