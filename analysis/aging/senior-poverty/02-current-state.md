# Senior Poverty and Economic Security: Current State

## Present Conditions

Approximately 5.8 million Americans aged 65 and older live in poverty using the official federal measure, representing about 10% of the older adult population. This represents substantial progress from the 35% poverty rate in 1959 before Medicare and the major expansion of Social Security. However, the official measure significantly understates economic hardship among seniors. Using the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which accounts for medical expenses and other factors, the poverty rate rises to approximately 14.1%—the highest of any age group. Nearly half of older adults lack income sufficient to meet basic needs according to more comprehensive measures of economic security.

## Poverty Measurement

### Comparing Poverty Measures

| Measure | Rate (65+) | Threshold | Key Features |
|---------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Official Poverty Measure (OPM)** | ~10% | $15,060 (single); $19,020 (couple) | Based on 1960s food costs; pre-tax income |
| **Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM)** | ~14.1% | Varies by geography | Includes medical costs; post-tax income with benefits |
| **Elder Economic Security Standard Index** | ~45% insecure | Varies by location, health, housing | Full cost of basic needs |
| **200% of poverty** | ~32% | Double OPM threshold | Common "near-poor" threshold |

### Why SPM Shows Higher Senior Poverty

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Medical out-of-pocket costs** | Subtracted from income; seniors average $6,800/year |
| **Geographic adjustment** | Higher thresholds in expensive areas |
| **Includes in-kind benefits** | SNAP, housing subsidies count as income |
| **Net effect** | +4 percentage points higher than OPM |
