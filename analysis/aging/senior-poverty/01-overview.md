# Senior Poverty and Economic Security

## Overview

Despite decades of progress since the creation of Social Security and Medicare, economic insecurity remains a persistent challenge for millions of older Americans. While the official poverty rate for adults 65+ has declined dramatically from over 35% in 1959 to approximately 10% today, this headline figure obscures deeper vulnerabilities. Using more comprehensive measures that account for medical expenses and geographic cost variation, approximately 14-15% of older adults live in poverty, and nearly half lack the income needed to meet basic needs without assistance. Senior poverty is not evenly distributed—women, people of color, those who live alone, and those in poor health face substantially higher rates of economic hardship. The solutions require strengthening the foundation of Social Security while addressing the specific vulnerabilities that push older adults into poverty: inadequate retirement savings, rising healthcare and housing costs, caregiving responsibilities that limit lifetime earnings, and discrimination in employment.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Income poverty**: Older adults living below poverty thresholds
- **Economic insecurity**: Those above poverty but unable to meet basic needs
- **Retirement income adequacy**: Social Security, pensions, and savings
- **Medical expenses**: Healthcare costs driving economic hardship
- **Housing costs**: Affordability and stability challenges
- **Food insecurity**: Hunger and nutrition challenges among seniors
- **Disparities**: Differential impacts by gender, race, and living arrangement
- **Safety net programs**: SSI, SNAP, housing assistance, and Medicaid

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Official poverty rate (65+)** | ~10% | 5.8 million older adults |
| **SPM poverty rate (65+)** | ~14.1% | Includes medical costs |
| **Economic insecurity rate** | ~45% | Below Elder Economic Security Standard |
| **Social Security reliance** | 90% | Receive benefits; 40% rely on it for majority of income |
| **Lifted from poverty by SS** | 22 million | Would be poor without Social Security |
| **Median retirement savings** | ~$144,000 | Households aged 55-64 |
| **No retirement savings** | ~40% | Households aged 55-64 |
| **Women's poverty rate** | 12% | vs. 8% for men |
| **Black poverty rate (65+)** | ~18% | vs. 7% for white seniors |
| **Hispanic poverty rate (65+)** | ~17% | vs. 7% for white seniors |

## Why This Matters

**Human dignity**: After a lifetime of work and contribution, no one should face hunger, inadequate housing, or inability to afford medication in their final years.

**Health outcomes**: Economic insecurity directly harms health—older adults in poverty face higher rates of chronic disease, disability, cognitive decline, and mortality.

**Family burden**: When seniors lack resources, the financial and caregiving burden falls on family members, often adult children in their own financially precarious situations.

**Fiscal implications**: Poverty and its health consequences are expensive—emergency care for preventable conditions, nursing home placements that could have been avoided, and social costs of unaddressed need.

**Demographic urgency**: As the 65+ population grows from 58 million today to 95 million by 2060, the absolute number of seniors in poverty will grow substantially without policy changes.

**Social contract**: Americans expect that Social Security and Medicare will provide economic security in retirement. When millions still face poverty, the social contract is not being fulfilled.

## The Gap Between Official and Real Poverty

The official poverty measure understates senior economic hardship because it:

- Uses a threshold originally based on food costs when food is no longer the primary expense
- Fails to account for medical expenses, which average $6,800/year for older adults
- Does not adjust for geographic cost of living variations
- Ignores the different consumption patterns of older households

The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) addresses some of these issues and shows a senior poverty rate approximately 4 percentage points higher than the official measure. The Elder Economic Security Standard Index, developed by the Gerontological Society of America, shows that **nearly half of older adults** lack income sufficient to cover basic expenses (housing, food, healthcare, transportation) without public or private assistance.

## Key Reform Priorities

| Priority | Approach | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Strengthen Social Security** | Increase benefits for lowest earners; improve COLAs | Reduce poverty directly |
| **Enhance SSI** | Raise benefits; update asset limits; simplify enrollment | Help poorest seniors |
| **Reduce healthcare costs** | Lower Medicare costs; cap drug prices | Reduce medical impoverishment |
| **Expand affordable housing** | Increase subsidies; preserve affordable units | Address housing cost burden |
| **Improve retirement savings** | Expand access; protect pensions; require employer plans | Prevent future poverty |
| **Address disparities** | Target interventions to high-risk groups | Achieve equity |
