### Political Actions

**Federal Advocacy:**

| Issue | Target | Message |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Social Security expansion** | Congress | "Support legislation to increase Social Security benefits for low-income retirees and improve COLAs using CPI-E" |
| **SSI modernization** | Congress | "Update SSI by raising benefits to 100% of poverty, increasing asset limits to $10,000, and simplifying enrollment" |
| **Medicare dental/vision/hearing** | Congress | "Add dental, vision, and hearing coverage to Medicare to reduce out-of-pocket costs for seniors" |
| **Medicare drug pricing** | Congress | "Expand Medicare drug price negotiation to lower costs for seniors" |
| **Housing voucher expansion** | Congress/HUD | "Increase Section 8 vouchers for low-income seniors facing housing cost burdens" |
| **SNAP benefit improvements** | Congress/USDA | "Increase minimum SNAP benefit and simplify enrollment for seniors" |

**Sample Advocacy Messages:**

*For Social Security expansion:*

> "I'm calling to urge support for strengthening Social Security. Social Security keeps 22 million Americans out of poverty, but benefits are often too low—the average retiree receives just $1,900/month. Please support legislation to establish a minimum benefit at 125% of the poverty line for workers with 30+ years of earnings and switch to the CPI-E for cost-of-living adjustments."

*For SSI modernization:*

> "I'm calling about Supplemental Security Income, which helps the poorest seniors. SSI's asset limit has been frozen at $2,000 since 1989—that would be over $10,000 today with inflation. The maximum benefit is only 75% of the poverty line. Please support legislation to modernize SSI by raising benefits to 100% of poverty and updating asset limits."

*For Medicare coverage expansion:*

> "I'm calling about Medicare coverage gaps. Medicare doesn't cover dental, vision, or hearing—services seniors desperately need. 70% of Medicare beneficiaries lack dental coverage, and poor dental health leads to serious medical complications. Please support adding comprehensive dental, vision, and hearing benefits to Medicare."

**State Advocacy:**

| Issue | Target | Message |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **State SSI supplement** | State legislature | Support or increase state supplement to federal SSI |
| **Property tax relief** | State legislature | Expand circuit breaker property tax credits for seniors |
| **Medicaid expansion** | State legislature | Expand Medicaid if not yet done |
| **State EITC** | State legislature | Create or expand state Earned Income Tax Credit |
| **Utility assistance** | Public utility commission | Expand low-income rate programs |
| **Prescription assistance** | State pharmacy board | Support state pharmaceutical assistance programs |
