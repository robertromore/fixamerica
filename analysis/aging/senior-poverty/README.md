# Senior Poverty and Economic Security

Despite decades of progress since the creation of Social Security and Medicare, economic insecurity remains a persistent challenge for millions of older Americans. While the official poverty rate for adults 65+ has declined dramatically from over 35% in 1959 to approximately 10% today, this headline figure obscures deeper vulnerabilities. Using more comprehensive measures that account for medical expenses and geographic cost variation, approximately 14-15% of older adults live in poverty, and nearly half lack the income needed to meet basic needs without assistance. Senior poverty is not evenly distributed—women, people of color, those who live alone, and those in poor health face substantially higher rates of economic hardship. The solutions require strengthening the foundation of Social Security while addressing the specific vulnerabilities that push older adults into poverty: inadequate retirement savings, rising healthcare and housing costs, caregiving responsibilities that limit lifetime earnings, and discrimination in employment.
