# Automation and the Future of Work: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Addressing automation's workforce impacts requires a comprehensive legislative approach: worker transition support programs, revenue mechanisms to fund them, disclosure requirements to give workers advance notice, and reforms to the social safety net. This document provides draft legislation targeting the key challenges of automation-driven displacement, working within current constitutional constraints while identifying where bolder approaches might be needed.

## Constitutional Amendments

### Right to Economic Security Amendment

**Purpose**: Establish a constitutional right to economic security and transition support in the face of technological change.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. Every person in the United States shall have the right to:
(a) fair advance notice of technological displacement from employment;
(b) access to retraining and education to prepare for new employment;
(c) economic security during transitions between employment; and
(d) meaningful work or, in the absence of adequate employment, a basic
    income sufficient to meet essential needs.

SECTION 2. Congress and the States shall have the power to enforce this
article by appropriate legislation, including but not limited to taxation
of automation, employer mandates, and direct provision of services.

SECTION 3. The rights enumerated in this article shall not be construed
to diminish other rights retained by the people.

SECTION 4. This article shall take effect two years after the date of
ratification.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 1**: Establishes affirmative economic rights related to technological change
- **Section 2**: Provides clear authority for implementing legislation including automation taxation
- **Section 3**: Non-diminishment clause protects other rights
- **Section 4**: Phase-in period for implementation

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Justiciability | Courts can develop standards over time |
| Cost | Rights don't mandate specific dollar amounts |
| Enforcement | Implementing legislation provides mechanisms |
| Political feasibility | Would require mass movement |

## Federal Legislation

### Automation Revenue Act

**Purpose**: Create revenue mechanisms to fund worker transition programs through taxation of automation.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Automation Revenue Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The federal tax code currently provides incentives for capital
    investment, including automation, while taxing labor.
(2) Employers pay payroll taxes on human workers but not on
    automated systems that replace them.
(3) Revenue is needed to fund transition support for workers
    displaced by automation.
(4) Equalizing the tax treatment of human and automated work would
    create resources for worker support without preventing beneficial
    automation.

SEC. 3. AUTOMATION REVENUE CONTRIBUTION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is
    amended to add a new Subchapter E as follows:

"SUBCHAPTER E—AUTOMATION REVENUE CONTRIBUTION

        (A) The employer's total wages paid in the base year; and
        (B) The employer's total wages paid in the current year;
    (2) Adjusted for changes in output or revenue; and
    (3) Multiplied by the automation factor.

"(d) AUTOMATION FACTOR.—The automation factor equals the percentage
    of the wage change attributable to automation rather than other
    factors, as determined under regulations prescribed by the
    Secretary.

"SEC. 3162. DEFINITIONS.

"(a) COVERED EMPLOYER.—A covered employer means any employer that:
    (1) Has more than 100 employees; and
    (2) Has introduced automated systems resulting in workforce
        reductions of 10 percent or more.

    the taxable year."

(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.—The table of subchapters for chapter 21
    is amended to add:
    "Subchapter E. Automation Revenue Contribution"

SEC. 4. DEPRECIATION ADJUSTMENT FOR AUTOMATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
    is amended to add the following:

"(m) LIMITATION ON BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR LABOR-DISPLACING
    AUTOMATION.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—In the case of any qualified automation property,
        the amount of bonus depreciation allowed under subsection (k)
        shall be reduced by 50 percent.
    (2) QUALIFIED AUTOMATION PROPERTY.—Qualified automation property
        means any property that:
        (A) Is designed primarily to automate tasks previously
            performed by human workers; and
        (B) Reasonably results in displacement of 10 or more
            full-time equivalent employees.
    (3) EXCEPTIONS.—This subsection shall not apply to automation
        property that:

    for expenditures under the Worker Transition Act.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2026.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Creates payroll tax equivalent for automated work
- **Section 4**: Reduces tax incentives for labor-displacing automation
- **Section 5-6**: Dedicates revenue to worker transition programs
- Alternative calculation options provide flexibility

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Defining automation | Multiple calculation options; regulatory refinement |
| Competitiveness | 15.3% matches payroll tax; levels playing field |
| Administration | Build on existing tax infrastructure |
| Business opposition | Revenue dedicated to transition support |

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Taxing Power**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Automation tax | Valid exercise of taxing power |
| Dedicated revenue | Permissible trust fund structure |
| Employer obligations | Commerce Clause supports |

**Commerce Clause**

| Legislation | Authority |
|-------------|-----------|
| Transition assistance | Regulation of interstate commerce |
| Disclosure requirements | Commerce Clause (labor standards) |
| State automation taxes | May face dormant Commerce Clause limits |

**Takings Clause**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Notification requirements | Not a taking (regulatory requirement) |
| Employer transition mandates | Valid police power exercise |

### Preemption Questions

| Area | Federal vs. State |
|------|-------------------|
| Worker notification | States can exceed federal (WARN model) |
| Automation taxes | States have authority; federal could preempt |
| Training programs | Supplementary state programs permitted |
| Disclosure requirements | States can go beyond federal minimum |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Law | Enforcement |
|-----|-------------|
| Worker Transition Act | DOL administration; private right of action |
| Automation Impact Assessment | DOL review; civil penalties |
| UBI Pilot Act | HHS administration |
| Automation Revenue Act | IRS enforcement |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Worker Transition Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Definition of "automation-displaced" | Difficult to prove causation | High |
| Gradual displacement | Slow automation below thresholds | High |
| Contractor/gig worker exclusion | May not cover all workers | Medium |
| Employer restructuring | Spin-off before automation | Medium |
| Notice circumvention | Claim unforeseen circumstances | Medium |
| Training quality | Providers may not deliver results | Medium |
| Geographic arbitrage | Move operations to avoid requirements | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Funding adequacy | May be insufficient for scale | Political constraints |
| Implementation capacity | DOL not currently equipped | Historical underfunding |
| Timing | May not reach workers in time | Notice periods insufficient |
| Benefit cliffs | Support ends abruptly | Program design |
| Geographic mismatch | Jobs may not exist where workers are | Economic concentration |
| Quality of new jobs | Workers may find only lower-wage work | Structural labor market |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Definition challenges**: Create rebuttable presumption of automation displacement in industries with documented automation trends; allow worker attestation with employer non-rebuttal
2. **Gradual displacement**: Track cumulative displacement over rolling 24-month period; lower thresholds for industries with high automation exposure
3. **Contractor exclusion**: Expand definition to include workers substantively controlled by covered employer; include temp and staffing agency workers
4. **Employer restructuring**: Look-through provisions; successor liability; anti-avoidance rules
5. **Notice circumvention**: Strict interpretation of exceptions; penalties sufficient to deter; private right of action
6. **Training quality**: Outcome-based contracting; disqualification of poor performers; public reporting of outcomes
7. **Geographic arbitrage**: Regional coordination; federal minimum standards; anti-avoidance rules

### Automation Impact Assessment Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Threshold avoidance | Stay below 100-worker threshold | High |
| Definition gaming | Characterize automation as something else | High |
| Incomplete assessments | Provide minimal required information | Medium |
| Delayed disclosure | File late, pay penalties as cost of business | Medium |
| Confidentiality claims | Over-claim trade secrets | Medium |
| Subsidiary structures | Use subsidiaries to avoid thresholds | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No approval requirement | Disclosure doesn't prevent harmful automation | Political compromise |
| Limited scope | Only large employers covered | Administrability |
| Retrospective nature | Assessment comes after decisions made | Procedural design |
| Weak penalties | May be insufficient deterrent | Political constraints |
| No worker voice | Workers not party to assessment process | Limited labor law |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Threshold avoidance**: Track automation across related entities; sector-wide reporting for high-automation industries
2. **Definition gaming**: Broad functional definition; regulatory guidance with examples; substance-over-form analysis
3. **Incomplete assessments**: Detailed regulatory requirements; rejection authority; escalating penalties
4. **Delayed disclosure**: Per-day penalties substantial enough to deter; private right of action with statutory damages
5. **Confidentiality claims**: Narrow trade secret definition; public interest override; independent review of claims
6. **Subsidiary structures**: Aggregation rules; common ownership rules; anti-avoidance provisions

### Universal Basic Income Pilot Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Selection bias | Non-representative participants | High |
| Hawthorne effects | Behavior change from observation | Medium |
| Temporary vs. permanent | Pilot may not reflect permanent program | Medium |
| Benefit interaction gaming | Manipulation of other benefits | Low |
| Political interference | Administration undermines pilots | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Scale | Pilots may be too small for conclusive evidence | Cost constraints |
| Duration | 3 years may be insufficient | Cost constraints |
| Generalizability | Pilot conditions may not scale | Inherent in pilots |
| Political sustainability | Results may be ignored | Political context |
| Comparison to alternatives | No direct comparison with other interventions | Design complexity |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Selection bias**: Multiple sites with different selection methods; saturation design in some areas; demographic balancing
2. **Hawthorne effects**: Large scale and long duration reduce effects; some sites with less intensive observation
3. **Temporary vs. permanent**: Longest feasible duration; model permanent effects; clear communication to participants
4. **Benefit interaction**: Statutory benefit protection; monitoring and enforcement
5. **Political interference**: Independent evaluation; statutory protections for pilot integrity; bipartisan oversight
6. **Scale and duration**: Maximum feasible funding; extension authority if warranted
7. **Comparison**: Include arms testing different interventions (job guarantee, wage subsidy, etc.)

### Automation Revenue Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Automation definition | Narrow interpretation excludes automation | High |
| Offshoring instead | Move work offshore rather than automate | High |
| Contractor conversion | Use contractors instead of automation | Medium |
| Timing manipulation | Delay or accelerate automation for tax | Medium |
| Base year manipulation | Manipulate base year comparisons | Medium |
| Output adjustment gaming | Inflate output to reduce calculated impact | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Measurement difficulty | Hard to quantify automation's role | Technical complexity |
| Competitiveness concerns | Unilateral tax may disadvantage US | International competition |
| Small employer exclusion | May shift automation to smaller firms | Administrability |
| Administrative burden | Complex calculations | Program design |
| Economic effects | May slow beneficial automation | Tax incentive effects |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Automation definition**: Functional definition; rebuttable presumption for specified technologies; regulatory updates
2. **Offshoring**: Anti-base erosion provisions; exit taxes; international coordination
3. **Contractor conversion**: Include contractor relationships in calculations; anti-avoidance rules
4. **Timing manipulation**: Multi-year averaging; anti-abuse rules
5. **Base year manipulation**: Rolling base year; auditing requirements
6. **Output adjustment gaming**: Third-party verification; audit authority; penalties for manipulation
7. **Measurement difficulty**: Alternative calculation options; safe harbors; good faith compliance
8. **Competitiveness**: Phase-in; international coordination efforts; border adjustments if needed
9. **Small employer exclusion**: Lower thresholds over time; sector-specific rules
10. **Economic effects**: Exemptions for beneficial automation; offset with transition support

### Cross-Cutting Issues

#### Systemic Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Affects | Mitigation |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Political reversibility | All reforms | Build durable coalitions; design for broad support |
| Underfunding | Program effectiveness | Dedicated revenue; trust fund structure |
| Administrative capacity | Implementation | Phase-in; capacity building investment |
| Coordination failures | Federal-state programs | Clear roles; information sharing |
| Technology outpacing policy | All provisions | Regular review; adaptive mechanisms |
| Employer non-compliance | Worker protections | Strong enforcement; private right of action |

#### Monitoring Requirements

| Metric | Frequency | Entity |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Automation deployment | Annual | DOL Bureau of Labor Statistics |
| Worker displacement | Quarterly | State workforce agencies |
| Transition outcomes | Annual | DOL evaluation |
| Employer compliance | Ongoing | DOL Wage and Hour Division |
| Program enrollment | Monthly | Program administrators |
| Revenue collection | Annual | Treasury/IRS |

#### Amendment Procedures

1. **Threshold adjustments**: Automatic inflation indexing; periodic review
2. **Rate adjustments**: Built-in review after 5 years; super-majority for reduction
3. **Definition updates**: Regulatory authority to update definitions; annual review
4. **Program evaluation**: GAO mandatory review every 5 years; sunset if ineffective
5. **Coordination**: Federal-state coordination mechanisms; information sharing requirements

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| DOL capacity | Major funding increase; multi-year commitment |
| State variation | Strong federal floor; state supplementation |
| Political sustainability | Universal framing; broad coalition support |
| Economic transition | Phase-in periods; adjustment assistance |
| Data collection | Investment in workforce statistics |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- All major provisions should include automatic review after 10 years
- Threshold adjustments every 5 years based on effectiveness
- GAO evaluation of each major program
- Required congressional testimony by implementing agencies
