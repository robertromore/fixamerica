# Automation and the Future of Work: Current State

## The Problem Today

### Automation Is Already Here

While much discussion focuses on future automation, significant displacement is already occurring:

**Current Deployment**

## Impact Analysis

### On Different Worker Groups

**Lower-Skill Workers**

- Retail, food service, warehouse workers most affected
- Few receive meaningful retraining
- Displacement often leads to lower-wage work
- Benefits often lost in transitions

**Middle-Skill Workers**

- Office administrative, manufacturing
- Traditional path to middle class eroding
- Many jobs being restructured or eliminated
- "Middle-skill" jobs hollowing out

**Higher-Skill Workers**

- Previously considered safe from automation
- AI now affecting lawyers, doctors, programmers
- Focus shifting to "human" skills
- Augmentation more common than displacement (so far)

### Geographic Concentration

**Most Vulnerable Regions**

| Region | Primary Exposure | Risk Level |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Midwest manufacturing belt | Industrial automation | Very High |
| Truck-dependent corridors (I-80, I-40) | Autonomous vehicles | High |
| Rural retail centers | Store automation | High |
| Suburban office parks | Knowledge work automation | Medium-High |
| Coastal tech hubs | More resilient (job creation) | Lower |
