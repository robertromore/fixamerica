# Automation and the Future of Work: History

## Origins of Automation Concerns

### Early Industrial Automation

**The Luddites (1811-1816)**

- Skilled textile workers in England
- Destroyed labor-saving machinery
- Not anti-technology per se, but anti-displacement
- Eventually suppressed, movement criminalized
- Legacy: "Luddite" as term of derision

**The Lesson**: Worker resistance to displacement has always existed; the question is whether society provides alternatives.

**19th Century Mechanization**

| Era | Technology | Workers Displaced | Transition |
|-----|------------|-------------------|------------|
| 1800-1850 | Textile machinery | Craft weavers | Decades of hardship, then factory work |
| 1850-1900 | Agricultural equipment | Farm laborers | Migration to cities |
| 1870-1920 | Assembly line | Craft producers | Mass production jobs created |

### The "Automation" Concept

**1940s-1960s: First "Automation Scare"**

- Term "automation" coined (1948)
- Post-WWII factory automation
- Congressional hearings on technological unemployment
- Predictions of mass displacement
- **Outcome**: New jobs created, fears unrealized

**Why Fears Didn't Materialize Then**

- Strong labor unions negotiated transitions
- Expanding economy absorbed displaced workers
- Education system expanded (GI Bill)
- Government invested in adjustment
- New industries (aerospace, electronics) created jobs
- Automation was primarily physical, not cognitive

**Key Policy Responses**

| Policy | Purpose | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Trade Adjustment Assistance (1962) | Help displaced workers | Limited reach |
| Manpower Development Act (1962) | Worker retraining | Modest impact |
| Higher Education Act (1965) | Expand college access | Significant |

## Key Turning Points

### The Computer Revolution (1970s-1990s)

**First Wave: Mainframes and Offices**

- Automated routine clerical work
- Typing pools eliminated
- Data processing transformed
- Middle management reduced

**Second Wave: Personal Computers**

| Change | Worker Impact |
|--------|--------------|
| Word processing | Secretarial jobs eliminated |
| Spreadsheets | Accounting roles changed |
| Databases | Filing/records jobs lost |
| Email | Clerical communication automated |

**The "Jobless Recovery" of Early 1990s**

- 1990-91 recession
- Recovery created fewer jobs than previous recessions
- First signs of technology-driven job destruction
- Set pattern for future recoveries

### Globalization and Automation (1990s-2000s)

**Intertwined Forces**

- Hard to separate automation from offshoring effects
- Both reduced American manufacturing employment
- NAFTA (1994) coincided with manufacturing automation
- China WTO entry (2001) accelerated trends

**Manufacturing Employment**

| Year | Manufacturing Jobs | Share of Employment |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1979 | 19.4 million | 22% |
| 1990 | 17.7 million | 16% |
| 2000 | 17.2 million | 13% |
| 2010 | 11.5 million | 9% |
| 2023 | 12.9 million | 8% |

**The Debate: Automation vs. Trade**

- Studies suggest 85% of manufacturing job loss was automation
- But trade accelerated the timeline
- Workers displaced by either faced similar challenges
- Policy response inadequate for both

### The Rise of AI (2010s-Present)

**Deep Learning Breakthrough (2012)**

- ImageNet competition showed AI could match humans
- Sparked massive investment in AI
- Enabled new categories of automation
- Changed expert predictions dramatically

**Timeline of AI Capabilities**

| Year | Milestone | Implication |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 2012 | AlexNet image recognition | Machine vision practical |
| 2016 | AlphaGo defeats world champion | Complex strategic tasks |
| 2018 | BERT language model | Natural language processing |
| 2020 | GPT-3 | Generative text at scale |
| 2022 | ChatGPT | Mass adoption of generative AI |
| 2023 | GPT-4, Claude, etc. | Near-human performance many tasks |

**What Changed**

- Cognitive tasks now automatable
- White-collar workers newly vulnerable
- Speed of improvement exponential
- Predictions of "10-20 years away" arriving much sooner

## Historical Patterns

### What Previous Transitions Teach Us

**Pattern 1: Displacement Is Real But Not Permanent**

| Transition | Jobs Lost | Jobs Created | Timeline |
|------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Agricultural mechanization | 90% of farm jobs | Industrial, service jobs | 100+ years |
| Manufacturing automation | 50%+ of factory jobs | Service, knowledge jobs | 50+ years |
| Office computerization | Clerical positions | IT, new office roles | 30+ years |

**Pattern 2: Transitions Are Painful**

- Workers displaced often never recover previous wages
- Geographic impacts concentrated
- Generational effects (children of displaced workers)
- Social fabric of communities damaged

**Pattern 3: Policy Matters**

| Policy Approach | Example | Outcome |
|-----------------|---------|---------|
| Active support | Post-WWII America | Successful transition |
| Passive/market-based | 1980s-present US | Painful, unequal transition |
| Coordinated (corporatist) | Germany, Nordics | Smoother transitions |

### Why This Time Might Be Different

**Arguments It's Different**

| Factor | Historical | Current |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Scope of tasks affected | Physical, routine | Physical + cognitive |
| Speed of change | Decades | Years |
| Labor market institutions | Strong unions, safety net | Weak unions, thin safety net |
| Education response | Expanding access | Stagnant, debt-laden |
| Geographic mobility | Higher | Lower |

**Arguments It's Not Different**

- "Automation anxiety" has always existed
- New jobs have always emerged
- Human creativity/adaptability underestimated
- Current pessimism may be overblown

**The Honest Assessment**

We cannot know for certain whether this transition will follow historical patterns. But the combination of speed, scope, and weakened institutions creates genuine risk that past patterns may not hold.

## Timeline of US Automation Policy

### Era of Active Policy (1960s-1970s)

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1962 | Manpower Development and Training Act |
| 1962 | Trade Adjustment Assistance created |
| 1964 | President's Commission on Automation |
| 1973 | CETA (Comprehensive Employment and Training Act) |

### Era of Retreat (1980s-2000s)

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1982 | CETA replaced with smaller JTPA |
| 1998 | Workforce Investment Act (further devolution) |
| 2002 | Trade Adjustment Assistance expansion (modest) |
| Various | Training programs chronically underfunded |

### Era of Inaction (2010s-Present)

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2014 | Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act |
| 2016-20 | Automation concerns rise, no major legislation |
| 2021 | Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (some workforce) |
| 2022 | CHIPS Act (semiconductor workforce provisions) |
| 2023 | AI Executive Order (no worker provisions) |

## Lessons from History

### Lesson 1: Market Forces Alone Don't Ensure Good Outcomes

Historical transitions succeeded when:

- Labor had power to negotiate transitions
- Government invested in adjustment
- Education expanded access
- Safety net caught those who fell

Historical transitions failed when:

- Workers left to market forces
- Regions abandoned
- Education inaccessible
- Safety net inadequate

### Lesson 2: Speed of Response Matters

**Fast Response (Post-WWII)**

- GI Bill before soldiers returned
- Strong unions to negotiate
- Growing economy
- Successful transition for most

**Slow Response (Deindustrialization)**

- Trade Adjustment Assistance inadequate
- Training reached few workers
- Regions devastated
- Opioid crisis, deaths of despair

### Lesson 3: Geographic Impacts Are Severe

Every major technological transition has devastated some regions:

- New England textile towns (1920s-1950s)
- Appalachian coal regions (1950s-present)
- Rust Belt manufacturing (1980s-present)

Without intervention, automation will create new "left behind" regions.

### Lesson 4: New Jobs Emerge But Not Automatically for Same Workers

- Agricultural workers didn't become factory workers overnight
- Factory workers didn't become service workers easily
- Transitions take generations without active policy
- Individual workers often suffer even if aggregate employment rises

### Lesson 5: Technology Is Not Destiny

The impacts of automation depend on choices:

- How gains are distributed
- What transitions are supported
- How education adapts
- What social contract exists
