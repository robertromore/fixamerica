# Automation and the Future of Work: Overview

Automation technologies--artificial intelligence, robotics, and machine learning--are reshaping the American economy at an unprecedented pace. Unlike previous technological revolutions that unfolded over generations, today's automation wave threatens to displace workers faster than the economy can create new jobs or retrain displaced workers. An estimated 25-50% of current jobs face significant automation risk over the next two decades, with potential displacement concentrated among middle-skill workers, routine cognitive occupations, and specific geographic regions that have already suffered from deindustrialization.
