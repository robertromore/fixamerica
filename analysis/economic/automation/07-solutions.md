# Automation and the Future of Work: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Criteria for Evaluating Reforms

| Criterion | Definition | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Supports displaced workers** | Helps those losing jobs to automation | Direct beneficiaries |
| **Prevents future displacement** | Reduces unnecessary job destruction | Proactive approach |
| **Shares gains broadly** | Distributes productivity gains | Addresses inequality |
| **Preserves dignity** | Maintains meaningful work and agency | Human values |
| **Politically viable** | Can build majority support | Must pass |
| **Durable** | Withstands political changes | Long-term impact |

### The Framework

Comprehensive automation policy addresses multiple dimensions:

1. **Worker transition support**: Help displaced workers
2. **Gain sharing**: Ensure productivity gains broadly distributed
3. **Prevention**: Give workers voice before automation decisions
4. **Education**: Prepare future workers
5. **Safety net**: Universal protections regardless of employment status

## Policy Proposals

### Tier 1: Worker Transition Support

**Universal Transition Assistance**

*Key Provisions*

- Income support during retraining (75% of prior wage for 2 years)

**Automation Early Warning System**

*Key Provisions*

- Require large employers to provide 6-month notice of major automation
- Report automation plans to Department of Labor
- Trigger automatic transition benefits
- Allow workers time to prepare and retrain

*Evidence*

- Creates accountability

*Challenges*

- Business opposition to disclosure
- Defining "major automation"
- Enforcement
- May accelerate some displacement

### Tier 2: Revenue and Gain Sharing

**Automation Tax/Robot Tax**

*How It Would Work*

- Tax employers when they replace workers with automation
- Revenue funds transition programs
- Could be structured as:
    - Per-robot tax
    - Tax on automation-related capital investment
    - Payroll tax equivalent on automated work
    - Windfall profits tax on automation gains

*Evidence*

- Bill Gates, other business leaders have endorsed concept
- Current tax code favors capital over labor
- Revenue needed to fund transition programs
- International discussion ongoing

*Advantages*

- Creates revenue for transition programs
- Reduces tax bias toward automation
- Slows automation where socially harmful
- Links gains to responsibilities

*Challenges*

- Administration complexity

**Proposed Rates**

| Approach | Rate | Revenue Estimate |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| Per-robot fee | $10,000-50,000/year | $20-100 billion |
| Payroll tax equivalent | 15.3% of displaced wages | Varies by displacement |

- Transition bonuses funded from automation savings

*Evidence*

- Some companies voluntarily provide this
- European models include worker participation
- Addresses fairness concerns directly
- Increases public acceptance of automation

### Tier 3: Universal Basic Income and Safety Net

**Universal Basic Income (UBI)**

*How It Would Work*

- Regular cash payment to all adults
- Unconditional (no work requirements)

- Pilot programs show positive results
- Alaska Permanent Fund provides model
- Addresses concerns about future job scarcity
- Simplifies complex safety net

*Advantages*

- Reduces stigma of targeted programs
- Administrative simplicity

*Challenges*

- High cost ($2-3 trillion annually for significant UBI)
- Political resistance (both left and right concerns)
- Effects on work incentive debated
- Doesn't address meaning and purpose of work

**Alternative: Negative Income Tax/EITC Expansion**

*Key Provisions*

- Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit
- Available to workers with low or no earnings
- Phases out gradually as income rises

- Less expensive than UBI
- Maintains work incentive
- Bipartisan support possible

**Portable Benefits**

*Key Provisions*

- Decouple benefits from employment
- Healthcare, retirement, paid leave follow worker

- Available to gig and contingent workers

*Evidence*

- Current system ties benefits to jobs
- Job transitions mean benefit loss
- Gig economy workers lack protections
- Other countries provide universal benefits

### Tier 4: Worker Voice and Prevention

**Automation Bargaining Rights**

*Key Provisions*

- Require employer consultation before major automation
- Worker representatives on automation decisions
- Negotiated automation plans
- Appeal process for automation decisions

*Evidence*

- Union contracts with automation provisions exist
- Worker voice leads to better outcomes
- Reduces adversarial dynamic

*Advantages*

- Addresses root of problem
- Workers have information about their jobs
- Can identify better ways to implement automation
- Reduces fear and opposition

*Challenges*

- Requires labor law reform
- Business opposition
- Weak union coverage limits reach
- May slow some automation

**Federal Job Guarantee**

*How It Would Work*

- Government guarantees job to anyone who wants one
- Public service jobs at living wage
- Serves as floor for labor market
- Jobs in infrastructure, care, environment, community service

*Evidence*

- Historical precedent (WPA, CCC)
- Modern proposals developed
- Addresses meaning and purpose concerns
- Acts as automatic stabilizer

*Advantages*

- Guarantees employment regardless of automation
- Provides meaningful work
- Addresses social needs
- Counter-cyclical

*Challenges*

*Challenges*

- Cultural shift needed
- Quality assurance
- Time constraints for workers
- Coordination complexity

**Education System Reform**

*Focus Areas*

- Employer commitment to hire completers
- Apprenticeship expansion
- Career pathway development

## International Models

### Nordic Flexicurity

**How It Works**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Flexible labor markets | Relatively easy hiring/firing |
| Strong unemployment benefits | 80-90% wage replacement |
| Active labor market policies | Training, job matching |
| Universal safety net | Healthcare, housing not tied to job |

**Results**

- Low unemployment despite economic change
- High labor market participation
- Lower inequality
- Good economic performance

**Applicability to US**

- Would require major expansion of programs
- Cultural shift needed
- High taxes required
- But demonstrates alternative possible

### German Kurzarbeit

**How It Works**

- Government subsidizes reduced hours instead of layoffs
- Workers keep jobs at reduced pay (government makes up difference)
- Company retains skilled workforce
- Transitions negotiated with worker councils

**Evidence**

- Helped Germany through 2008-09 recession
- Preserved jobs during COVID
- Lower unemployment than market-only approach
- Workers retain skills and attachment

**Applicability to US**

- Could apply during automation transitions
- Preserve employment while adjusting
- Requires employer participation
- Some US experimentation during COVID

### Singapore SkillsFuture

**How It Works**

- Every citizen gets learning account
- Government credits for training
- Wide range of approved courses
- Employer incentives for worker training

**Results**

- High participation in lifelong learning
- Workforce adaptation to economic change
- Government-industry partnership
- Competitive economy maintained

**Applicability to US**

- Learning account concept adaptable
- Would require funding
- Quality assurance needed
- Public-private partnership model

## Trade-offs

### Universal vs. Targeted Programs

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Universal (UBI) | Simple, no stigma, catches everyone | Expensive, less targeted |
| Targeted (transition assistance) | More affordable, directed at need | May miss people, stigma, administrative burden |

**Recommendation**: Combination--universal base plus targeted transition support.

### Speed vs. Protection

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Slow automation | Allows adaptation, less displacement | May reduce productivity, competitiveness |
| Fast automation with protection | Productivity gains realized, workers supported | More disruption, harder to manage |

**Recommendation**: Don't try to stop automation but ensure strong protections and gain-sharing.

### Work vs. Income Guarantee

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Job guarantee | Provides work, not just income; addresses purpose | Administrative complexity, job quality concerns |
| Income guarantee (UBI) | Simple, flexible, individual choice | Doesn't address meaning, work incentive debates |

**Recommendation**: Both have merits; could combine job guarantee available to those who want it with basic income floor.
