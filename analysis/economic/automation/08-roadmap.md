## Risks and Contingencies

### Risk: Automation Accelerates Faster Than Policy

**Threat**: Mass displacement before programs in place

**Mitigation**

- Emergency response planning
- Rapid scaling mechanisms
- Automatic triggers
- Crisis protocols

**Contingency**: Implement emergency relief; use crisis to push broader reform (New Deal model).

### Risk: Business/Tech Opposition Blocks Reform

**Threat**: Well-funded opposition defeats proposals

**Mitigation**

- Build broad coalition
- Focus on popular elements
- State-level progress first
- Document impacts to build pressure

**Contingency**: Continue state-level work; wait for crisis or political shift.

### Risk: Economic Downturn

**Threat**: Recession weakens support and reduces resources

**Mitigation**

- Frame reforms as economic stabilizers
- Automatic expansion mechanisms
- Build fiscal capacity in good times
- Counter austerity messaging

**Contingency**: Use downturn to emphasize need; push for counter-cyclical programs.

### Risk: Programs Poorly Implemented

**Threat**: Transition programs fail, discrediting approach

**Mitigation**

- Invest in implementation capacity
- Learn from pilots before scaling
- Continuous evaluation and adjustment
- Quality standards and accountability

**Contingency**: Reform and improve programs; don't abandon approach.

### Risk: Political Backlash

**Threat**: Populist opposition to "handouts" or "government control"

**Mitigation**

- Frame as earned benefits for workers
- Universal programs reduce backlash
- Cross-partisan coalition building
- Focus on dignity and opportunity

**Contingency**: Adjust framing; build from successful elements.
