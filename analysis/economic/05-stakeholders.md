# Economic Reform: Stakeholders

## Who Benefits from the Status Quo

### The Wealthy Elite

**The Top 0.1%**

The roughly 130,000 households at the very top of the distribution have accumulated unprecedented wealth and political power:

| Characteristic | Details |
|----------------|---------|
| Minimum net worth | $35+ million |
| Combined wealth | $18+ trillion |
| Share of all wealth | ~15% |
| Primary income sources | Capital gains, business income, investments |
| Tax advantages | Preferential rates, loopholes, offshore avoidance |
| Political influence | Dominant campaign donors; personal access to politicians |

**Benefits from Current System**:
- Low capital gains rates mean investments taxed less than wages
- Step-up in basis eliminates taxes on appreciated assets at death
- Estate tax exemptions allow dynastic wealth transfer
- Carried interest loophole benefits hedge fund managers
- Weak enforcement means wealthy can evade with impunity

**Billionaire Class**

The roughly 750 American billionaires represent extreme concentration:

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Combined wealth | $5+ trillion |
| Average wealth | ~$7 billion |
| Pandemic wealth gain | $1.5+ trillion |
| Effective tax rate (top 400) | 8.2% (lower than working class) |

These individuals have resources to shape politics, media, philanthropy, and public discourse to protect their interests.
