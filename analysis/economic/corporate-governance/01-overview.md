# Corporate Governance Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

Corporate governance in America has become dominated by shareholder primacy doctrine, which holds that corporations exist solely to maximize shareholder value. This narrow focus has produced exploding executive compensation (CEOs now earn 350x average worker pay), short-term thinking that sacrifices long-term investment, stock buybacks that enrich shareholders at the expense of workers and communities, and a fundamental disconnect between corporate behavior and societal well-being. Reform requires rethinking the purpose of the corporation and redesigning governance structures to balance the interests of all stakeholders.

## The Core Problem

| Aspect | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| Purpose | Shareholder primacy doctrine ignores workers, communities, environment |
| Executive pay | CEO-to-worker pay ratio has grown from 20:1 (1965) to 350:1 (2023) |
| Short-termism | Pressure for quarterly results undermines long-term investment |
| Buybacks | $7+ trillion spent on stock repurchases since 2010 instead of wages/R&D |
| Worker voice | 0% of Fortune 500 companies have worker representatives on boards |
| Accountability | Boards dominated by insiders and management allies |

## Why It Matters

**For Workers**

- Wages suppressed while shareholders profit
- Job insecurity from cost-cutting and offshoring
- No voice in major corporate decisions
- Pension and benefit cuts to boost stock prices

**For the Economy**

- Underinvestment in R&D and productive capacity
- Wealth concentrated in shareholder class
- Financial engineering prioritized over real production
- Community devastation when companies relocate

**For Democracy**

- Corporate political spending shapes policy
- Massive wealth inequality undermines democratic equality
- Citizens United enabled unlimited corporate influence
- Economic power translates to political power

## Key Questions

1. Should corporations serve only shareholders or all stakeholders?
2. How can boards be made truly independent of management?
3. Should workers have representation on corporate boards?
4. What limits should apply to executive compensation?
5. When should stock buybacks be restricted or banned?
6. How can long-term thinking be incentivized over quarterly returns?
7. What role should government play in corporate governance?

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Shareholder primacy | Doctrine that corporations exist to maximize shareholder value |
| Stakeholder capitalism | View that corporations should serve all affected parties |
| Codetermination | System giving workers representation on corporate boards |
| Stock buybacks | Corporations repurchasing their own shares |
| Board independence | Boards free from management control |
| ESG | Environmental, Social, and Governance criteria |
| Benefit corporation | Legal form requiring consideration of all stakeholders |
| Delaware incorporation | 68% of Fortune 500 incorporate in Delaware for favorable law |

## The Stakes

**Current Reality**

- S&P 500 companies spent $5.3 trillion on buybacks (2010-2019)
- Average CEO pay: $16.7 million; average worker: $47,000
- 92% of S&P 500 boards have no worker representatives
- Only 5 states allow or require stakeholder consideration
- Delaware courts consistently uphold shareholder primacy

**What's at Risk**

- Middle-class economic security
- Long-term economic competitiveness
- Democratic governance of the economy
- Social cohesion and shared prosperity
