# Corporate Governance Reform: Overview

Corporate governance in America has become dominated by shareholder primacy doctrine, which holds that corporations exist solely to maximize shareholder value. This narrow focus has produced exploding executive compensation (CEOs now earn 350x average worker pay), short-term thinking that sacrifices long-term investment, stock buybacks that enrich shareholders at the expense of workers and communities, and a fundamental disconnect between corporate behavior and societal well-being. Reform requires rethinking the purpose of the corporation and redesigning governance structures to balance the interests of all stakeholders.
