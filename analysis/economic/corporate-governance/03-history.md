# Corporate Governance Reform: History

## Origins of the Corporation

### Early American Corporations (1776-1860)

**Colonial and Early Republic Era**

| Period | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| Colonial era | Corporations rare, required special charter |
| 1776-1800 | ~300 corporate charters granted total |
| Purpose | Specific public purposes (roads, bridges, banks) |
| Duration | Often time-limited charters |
| Governance | Close state oversight |

**Key Features of Early Corporations**

- Charters granted for specific public purposes
- Limited duration and scope
- Required legislative approval
- Could be revoked for abuse
- Shareholders personally liable in some cases
- Directors owed duties to public, not just shareholders

### The Shift to General Incorporation (1860-1920)

**Legal Changes**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1811 | New York: first general incorporation law |
| 1875 | New Jersey: liberal incorporation law |
| 1889 | New Jersey: allows holding companies |
| 1899 | Delaware: begins competing for incorporation |
| 1913 | Delaware: Court of Chancery established |

**The Race to the Bottom**

- Delaware won by 1920 with even more permissive law
- Corporation charters became perpetual
- Public purpose requirements eliminated
- Management power expanded

## The Managerial Revolution (1920-1970)

**The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932)**

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Ownership separated from control | Shareholders dispersed, passive |
| Management controls corporations | Directors serve management |
| Shareholders are investors, not owners | Limited oversight capacity |
| Public interest at stake | Corporations affect entire society |

**Proposed Solutions**
