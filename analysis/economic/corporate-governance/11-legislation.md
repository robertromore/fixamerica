# Corporate Governance: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Reforming corporate governance requires legislation at both federal and state levels. This document provides draft legislation addressing shareholder primacy, worker representation, executive compensation, stock buybacks, and corporate purpose. Because corporate law is primarily state law (dominated by Delaware), federal reforms must work within constitutional constraints while state reforms can directly address governance structures.

## Federal Legislation

### Accountable Capitalism Act

    primacy" came to dominate corporate governance, reducing
    obligations to workers, communities, and other stakeholders.

    inequality, short-term thinking, and declining investment.

    governed by national standards.
