# Corporate Governance Reform: Root Causes

## The Core Dynamic

The current corporate governance system did not emerge by accident. It reflects deliberate legal, ideological, and structural choices that serve particular interests while disadvantaging others.

## Ideological Foundations

### Shareholder Primacy as Ideology

**The Friedman Doctrine's Influence**

| Pathway | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Business schools | MBA programs teach shareholder value maximization |
| Legal education | Law schools train lawyers in agency theory |
| Judicial philosophy | Judges embrace economic efficiency |
| Corporate practice | Executives internalize shareholder focus |
| Public discourse | "Fiduciary duty" framed as legal mandate |

**The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**

| Step | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Academics claim shareholder primacy is law |
| 2 | Lawyers advise clients it is law |
| 3 | Executives act as if it is law |
| 4 | Courts cite business practice as evidence |
| 5 | Doctrine becomes entrenched |

### Market Fundamentalism

**Core Beliefs**

| Belief | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Markets are efficient | Stock prices reflect true value |
| Profit-seeking serves society | Externalities are minor |
| Regulation distorts markets | Government should not interfere |
| Shareholders bear risk | Therefore deserve all returns |
| Stakeholders can protect themselves | Through contracts |

**How Beliefs Shape Governance**

| Belief | Governance Consequence |
|--------|----------------------|
| Stock price = value | Manage to stock price |
| Shareholders are residual claimants | Maximize shareholder returns |
| Workers are interchangeable | Minimize labor costs |
| Community obligations are charity | Avoid unless profitable |

## Legal Structure

### Delaware's Dominance

**Why Delaware Matters**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| 68% of Fortune 500 | Sets national corporate law |
| Court of Chancery | Expert, business-friendly judges |
| Predictable law | Lawyers know outcomes |
| Management-friendly | Protects board discretion |
| Revenue dependence | $1+ billion annually from franchise taxes |

**The Race to the Bottom**

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Interstate competition | States compete for incorporation fees |
| Management picks state | Chooses most favorable law |
| Delaware wins by being most permissive | Liberal treatment of management |
| Federal inaction | No federal corporate law |
| Result | Standards set by most lax jurisdiction |

### Fiduciary Duty Framework

**How It Works**

| Duty | What Courts Say | What It Means |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| Duty of care | Reasonable diligence | Easily satisfied |
| Duty of loyalty | No self-dealing | Rarely violated |
| Business judgment rule | Deference to boards | Protects any decision |

**The Problem**

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Shareholder-only duty | Other stakeholders have no standing |
| Business judgment rule | Courts don't second-guess boards |
| Revlon doctrine | Must maximize price in sale |
| No enforcement by workers | Can't sue for breach |

## Incentive Structures

### Executive Compensation Design

**How CEOs Are Paid**

| Component | Incentive |
|-----------|-----------|
| Stock options | Maximize stock price |
| Restricted stock | Same |
| Performance shares | Usually tied to stock metrics |
| Bonuses | Quarterly/annual earnings |
| Golden parachutes | Accept takeover offers |

**The Short-Term Bias**

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Quarterly earnings targets | Focus on next quarter |
| Annual bonus cycles | Sacrifice long-term for short-term |
| Stock option vesting | Create value by exit date |
| Takeover premiums | Cash out quickly |

### Board Compensation

**Who Pays Directors**

| Source | Alignment |
|--------|-----------|
| Management nominates | Directors serve management |
| Shareholders vote | Mostly rubber-stamp |
| Pay tied to stock | Align with shareholders |
| Social ties to CEO | Personal loyalty |

**The Independence Problem**

| "Independent" Means | Does Not Mean |
|---------------------|---------------|
| No formal employment | No social ties |
| No direct financial ties | No indirect interests |
| Nominal criteria met | Actual independence |

## Market Pressures

### Institutional Investor Dynamics

**The Big Three**

| Institution | Problem |
|-------------|---------|
| BlackRock | Manages $9+ trillion, votes millions of shares |
| Vanguard | Index funds require low-cost, passive voting |
| State Street | Concentrated voting power |

**Why They Favor Shareholders**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Fiduciary duty to beneficiaries | Must maximize investment returns |
| Low-cost business model | Minimal governance engagement |
| Index investing | Own entire market, can't sell |
| Short-term focus | Quarterly fund performance matters |

### Activist Investor Pressure

**The Activist Playbook**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Accumulate significant stake |
| 2 | Demand board seats |
| 3 | Push for "value creation" |
| 4 | Sell after stock rises |

**What "Value Creation" Means**

| Demand | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Cost cuts | Layoffs |
| Buybacks | Less investment |
| Spin-offs | Break up companies |
| Management change | Replace with "shareholder-friendly" CEO |

### Stock Market Short-Termism

**Quarterly Earnings Obsession**

| Pressure | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Analyst expectations | Miss by a penny, stock crashes |
| Earnings guidance | Companies predict own earnings |
| Quarterly reports | Constant disclosure pressure |
| High-frequency trading | Rewards short-term moves |

**Consequences**

| Behavior | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Earnings management | Accounting manipulation |
| R&D cuts | Long-term underinvestment |
| Buybacks | Financial engineering over real growth |
| Job cuts | Quick cost reduction |

## Political and Regulatory Capture

### Business Influence on Policy

**Lobbying Power**

| Sector | Influence |
|--------|-----------|
| Corporate lobbying | $3+ billion annually |
| Business associations | Chamber of Commerce, BRT |
| Executive networks | Access to policymakers |
| Campaign contributions | Citizens United enabled |

**Regulatory Capture**

| Agency | Capture |
|--------|---------|
| SEC | Commissioner revolving door |
| DOL | ERISA rule weakening |
| State regulators | Industry-friendly |

### Political Economy of Delaware

**Delaware's Incentives**

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Franchise tax revenue | $1+ billion annually |
| Corporate bar | Major industry |
| Political influence | Business-friendly legislation |
| Judicial selection | Chancellors from corporate bar |

| Finance | Shareholder value maximization |
| Economics | Agency theory, market efficiency |
| Strategy | Competitive advantage for returns |

**The Result**

| Generation | Belief |
|------------|--------|

| Executives | Trained in Friedman doctrine |
| Directors | See themselves as shareholder agents |

### Media and Public Discourse

|-------|---------|
| "The market" | Shareholders are the economy |
| "Job creators" | Executives deserve rewards |
| "Market discipline" | Layoffs are healthy |
| "Competitiveness" | Labor costs must be cut |

## Structural Lock-In

### Why Change Is Hard

**Path Dependence**

| Lock-In | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Delaware dominance | No one company will leave |
| Executive compensation norms | Must match peers |
| Board composition | Directors choose successors |
| Investor expectations | Built into stock prices |

**Coordination Problems**

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Collective action | Individual firm can't change alone |
| First-mover disadvantage | Stakeholder focus may reduce stock price |
| Regulatory competition | States race to bottom |
| Political opposition | Business lobbying blocks reform |

### The Vicious Cycle

| Step | Dynamic |
|------|---------|
| 1 | Shareholder primacy dominates |
| 2 | Shareholders capture most gains |
| 3 | Wealth concentrates at top |
| 4 | Wealthy fund lobbying and politics |
| 5 | Political system protects status quo |
| 6 | Return to step 1 |
