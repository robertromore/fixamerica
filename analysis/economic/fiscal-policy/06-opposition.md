# Fiscal Policy: Opposition to Reform

## Overview

Meaningful fiscal policy reform faces opposition from multiple directions: those who oppose tax increases, those who oppose spending cuts, those who benefit from current dysfunction, and those with ideological commitments to particular fiscal positions.
