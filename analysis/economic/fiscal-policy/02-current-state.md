# Fiscal Policy: Current State

## Overview

The federal fiscal situation in 2024 reflects decades of accumulated dysfunction: a $1.9 trillion deficit, $34 trillion in gross debt, growing interest payments, and a budget process that lurches from crisis to crisis. Mandatory spending dominates the budget while discretionary investment is squeezed. The debt ceiling remains a recurring crisis point, and neither party has offered a credible path to fiscal sustainability.
