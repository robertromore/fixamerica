# Fiscal Policy: History

## Overview

The history of American fiscal policy reflects shifting philosophies about government's economic role, from balanced-budget orthodoxy to Keynesian demand management to supply-side economics and back to deficit concerns. Understanding this evolution illuminates how we arrived at current dysfunction and what alternatives exist.

## Early American Fiscal Policy (1789-1930)

### The Founding Era

**Constitutional Framework**:

- Article I grants Congress power to tax and spend
- No explicit balanced budget requirement
- Hamilton vs. Jefferson debates over national debt
- Hamilton: "A national debt, if not excessive, will be to us a national blessing"

**Hamilton's Financial System**:

| Policy | Purpose | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Assumption of state debts | Establish federal credit | Created unified national debt |
| Bank of the United States | Fiscal management | Central banking (temporary) |
| Tariff revenue | Primary federal funding | Kept government small |
| Excise taxes | Additional revenue | Sparked Whiskey Rebellion |

### 19th Century Pattern

**Balanced Budget Norm**:

| Era | Fiscal Pattern |
|-----|----------------|
| 1800-1860 | Small government, surpluses common |
| Civil War | Massive debt (income tax introduced) |
| 1866-1893 | Debt repayment, budget surpluses |
| 1893-1913 | Modernizing federal role |

**Civil War Finance**:

- First income tax (1861)
- Debt peaked at 31% of GDP (1865)
- Rapid postwar debt reduction
- Income tax repealed (1872), then declared unconstitutional (1895)

### Progressive Era Changes

**16th Amendment (1913)**:

- Enabled federal income tax
- Fundamentally changed fiscal capacity
- Initially low rates, narrow base

**World War I Impact**:

| Year | Debt/GDP | Top Marginal Rate |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| 1916 | 3% | 15% |
| 1919 | 35% | 77% |
| 1929 | 16% | 24% |

## Depression and Keynesian Revolution (1930-1970)

### The Great Depression Response

**Hoover Administration (1929-1933)**:

- Initially maintained balanced budget orthodoxy
- Raised taxes in 1932 (Revenue Act)
- Restricted spending as economy collapsed
- Pro-cyclical policy deepened depression

**Roosevelt and the New Deal**:

| Phase | Policy | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1933-1936 | Deficit spending, relief programs | Recovery begins |
| 1937-1938 | Attempted budget balance | Recession returns |
| 1938-1941 | Resumed spending | Recovery continues |

### Keynesian Economics Emerges

**Key Concepts**:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Aggregate demand | Total spending drives output and employment |
| Fiscal multiplier | Government spending creates additional economic activity |
| Counter-cyclical policy | Deficits in recession, surpluses in expansion |
| Automatic stabilizers | Built-in fiscal responses to economic conditions |

**Keynes's Contribution**:

- *General Theory* (1936) provided theoretical framework
- Challenged balanced-budget orthodoxy
- Argued governments should manage aggregate demand
- Influenced New Deal and postwar policy

### World War II and Postwar

**War Finance**:

| Year | Debt/GDP | Deficit/GDP |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1940 | 43% | 3% |
| 1943 | 79% | 27% |
| 1946 | 119% | 7% |

**Postwar Adjustment**:

- Rapid debt-to-GDP reduction through growth
- No major debt repayment campaign
- Employment Act of 1946: federal responsibility for economic stability
- Military spending remained elevated (Cold War)

### The Keynesian Consensus (1945-1970)

**Fiscal Policy Goals**:

1. Full employment
2. Price stability
3. Economic growth
4. Budget balance (flexible, cyclical)

**Practice**:

| Administration | Fiscal Approach |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Truman | Balanced budgets, debt reduction |
| Eisenhower | Fiscal conservatism, three recessions |
| Kennedy | Tax cuts to stimulate growth |
| Johnson | Guns and butter, deficit rise |

**1964 Kennedy-Johnson Tax Cut**:

- Reduced top rate from 91% to 70%
- Keynesian stimulus during expansion
- Demonstrated fiscal activism
- Successful in boosting growth

## Stagflation and Supply-Side Era (1970-2000)

### The 1970s Crisis

**Stagflation Challenge**:

| Year | Unemployment | Inflation | Deficit/GDP |
|------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1970 | 4.9% | 5.7% | 0.3% |
| 1974 | 5.6% | 11.0% | 0.4% |
| 1980 | 7.1% | 13.5% | 2.7% |

**Policy Dilemma**:

- Keynesian tools designed for demand shortfall
- Stagflation: high unemployment AND inflation
- Supply shocks (oil) complicated response
- Fiscal policy effectiveness questioned

### Congressional Budget Act of 1974

**Reforms**:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Budget committees | Coordinate fiscal policy |
| Budget resolution | Set overall spending/revenue targets |
| CBO | Independent budget analysis |
| Reconciliation | Fast-track procedure for budget |
| Impoundment controls | Limit presidential withholding |

**Context**:

- Response to Nixon impoundments
- Assertion of congressional budget power
- Designed for orderly process
- Eventually produced dysfunction

### Supply-Side Revolution

**Reagan Economic Program (1981)**:

| Policy | Description | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| ERTA tax cuts | Top rate 70% to 50% | Revenue decline |
| Defense buildup | Massive increase | Spending increase |
| Domestic cuts | Social programs reduced | Partially offset |
| Deregulation | Reduce government role | Mixed effects |

**Fiscal Results**:

| Year | Deficit/GDP | Debt/GDP |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1980 | 2.7% | 26% |
| 1983 | 6.0% | 33% |
| 1986 | 5.0% | 39% |
| 1989 | 2.8% | 41% |

### Deficit Reduction Era (1990-2000)

**1990 Budget Enforcement Act**:

- PAYGO rules: new spending/tax cuts must be offset
- Discretionary caps
- Bipartisan deal (Bush tax increase)
- Contributed to eventual surplus

**1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act**:

- Tax increases on high incomes
- Spending restraint
- Entirely Democratic votes
- Contributed to surplus

**1997 Balanced Budget Act**:

- Bipartisan agreement
- Medicare savings
- Balanced budget achieved by 1998

**The Surpluses**:

| Year | Surplus/GDP |
|------|-------------|
| 1998 | +0.8% |
| 1999 | +1.4% |
| 2000 | +2.4% |
| 2001 | +1.3% |

**Contributing Factors**:

1. Strong economic growth
2. Capital gains revenue surge (dot-com bubble)
3. Defense spending decline (peace dividend)
4. 1990 and 1993 deficit reduction
5. PAYGO discipline

## Debt Ceiling History

### Origins and Evolution

## Historical Lessons

### What History Teaches

| Lesson | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Rapid debt reduction possible | Post-WWII, 1990s |
| Growth matters more than austerity | 1950s-1960s vs. 1930s |
| Budget rules can be circumvented | PAYGO, BCA both eroded |
| Crises lead to fiscal expansion | Wars, depressions, pandemic |
| Politics trump economics | Tax cuts passed without offset |

### Recurring Patterns

1. **Crisis-driven spending**: Wars, depressions, pandemic
2. **Tax cuts easier than increases**: Political asymmetry
3. **Rules circumvented**: PAYGO, caps always broken
4. **Debt reduced through growth**: Not repayment campaigns
5. **Partisan conflict over fiscal policy**: Consistent since founding
