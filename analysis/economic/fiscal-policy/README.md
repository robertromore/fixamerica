# Fiscal Policy: Overview

American fiscal policy is characterized by structural dysfunction, chronic deficits, and an inability to use fiscal tools effectively for economic stabilization or long-term investment. The federal budget process repeatedly breaks down, producing government shutdowns, debt ceiling crises, and governance by continuing resolution. Meanwhile, the national debt grows without meaningful debate about its implications, mandatory spending crowds out discretionary investment, and counter-cyclical fiscal policy remains politically contentious.
