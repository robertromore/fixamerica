# Fiscal Policy: Stakeholders

## Overview

Fiscal policy affects virtually every American, but its complexity means most citizens have little direct engagement with budget debates. Power over fiscal policy is concentrated among politicians, interest groups, financial institutions, and ideological organizations. Understanding who shapes fiscal decisions and who bears the consequences reveals the political economy of budget dysfunction.
