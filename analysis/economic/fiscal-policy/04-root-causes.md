# Fiscal Policy: Root Causes

## Overview

American fiscal dysfunction stems from structural political problems, ideological conflicts, institutional design flaws, and fundamental disagreements about government's role. Understanding these root causes reveals why fiscal policy repeatedly fails and what genuine reform would require.

## Political Structure

### Partisan Polarization

**The Fiscal Divide**:

| Party | Traditional Position | Current Position |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| Republicans | Deficit concern | Tax cuts without offsets |
| Democrats | Spending support | Resistance to entitlement reform |
| Both | | Unwilling to compromise |

**Polarization Effects**:

- No bipartisan agreement possible on fiscal matters
- Budget process becomes political weapon
- Debt ceiling used as leverage
- Governing by crisis becomes normalized

### Short-Term Electoral Incentives

**The Political Calculus**:

| Action | Political Cost | Political Benefit | Timeframe |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Tax cuts | None immediate | Immediate visibility | Short-term |
| Spending increases | None immediate | Constituent benefits | Short-term |
| Tax increases | Immediate anger | Long-term fiscal health | Long-term |
| Spending cuts | Immediate opposition | Long-term fiscal health | Long-term |

**Why Politicians Avoid Hard Choices**:

1. Voters reward spending, punish taxes
2. Benefits immediate, costs deferred
3. Opponents attack any fiscal discipline
4. No electoral reward for fiscal responsibility
5. Term limits prevent accountability

### Divided Government

**Frequency**:

| Period | Unified Government | Divided |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| 1945-1968 | 14 years | 10 years |
| 1969-1992 | 6 years | 18 years |
| 1993-2024 | 10 years | 22 years |

**Effects**:

- Budget agreements require bipartisan compromise
- Each party can block the other's priorities
- Status quo bias strengthened
- Crisis becomes only forcing mechanism

### Veto Points and Gridlock

**American Institutional Barriers**:

| Veto Point | Effect on Fiscal Policy |
|------------|------------------------|
| Presidential veto | Requires 2/3 override |
| Senate filibuster | 60-vote threshold |
| House majority | Majority party control |
| Conference committee | Reconciliation of differences |
| Budget committees | Multiple jurisdictions |

**Result**: Any significant fiscal change requires extraordinary consensus.

## Structural Budget Problems

### Mandatory Spending on Autopilot

**The Structural Shift**:

| Period | Mandatory | Discretionary |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| 1962 | 26% | 67% |
| 1990 | 57% | 37% |
| 2024 | 63% | 24% |
| 2050 (projected) | 75%+ | <20% |

**Why This Happens**:

- Entitlements enacted with permanent appropriations
- Benefits tied to demographics and eligibility
- No annual reauthorization required
- Political cost of changing benefits
- Beneficiary growth automatic

### Demographic Pressure

**Population Aging**:

| Year | Workers per Beneficiary (SS) | 65+ Population |
|------|------------------------------|----------------|
| 1960 | 5.1 | 9% |
| 2000 | 3.4 | 12% |
| 2024 | 2.8 | 18% |
| 2050 | 2.2 | 22% |

**Healthcare Cost Growth**:

| Driver | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Aging population | More beneficiaries |
| Medical technology | Expensive new treatments |
| End-of-life care | Intensive, costly |
| Chronic disease | Long-term management |
| Provider pricing power | Above-inflation increases |

### Revenue Structure Weaknesses

**Revenue Inadequacy**:

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Tax expenditures | $1.5+ trillion annually foregone |
| Capital gains preference | Lower rates on wealthy income |
| International avoidance | Corporate profit shifting |
| Enforcement gaps | IRS underfunding |
| Political constraints | Tax increase aversion |

**Structural Mismatch**:

```text
Revenue (17.5% GDP) + Spending Commitments (24%+ GDP) = Permanent Deficits
```

## Ideological Conflicts

### Fundamental Disagreements

**Role of Government**:

| View | Fiscal Implication |
|------|-------------------|
| Limited government | Cut spending, cut taxes |
| Active government | Tax adequately, invest publicly |
| Supply-side | Tax cuts pay for themselves |
| Keynesian | Counter-cyclical deficits appropriate |
| MMT | Deficits not constrained by revenue |

**No Consensus Possible**:

These views are fundamentally incompatible, making bipartisan fiscal agreement impossible absent crisis.

### "Starve the Beast" Strategy

**The Theory**:

1. Cut taxes regardless of spending
2. Deficits create pressure to cut spending
3. Government shrinks over time
4. Spending will eventually be forced down

**The Reality**:

| Prediction | Actual Outcome |
|------------|----------------|
| Tax cuts force spending cuts | Spending continued, deficits grew |
| Deficits create pressure | Deficits normalized |
| Government shrinks | Government grew (mandatory) |

**Why It Failed**:

- Spending has its own political support
- Entitlements nearly impossible to cut
- Defense spending has bipartisan support
- Interest payments mandatory
- Strategy produced deficits, not smaller government

### Normalization of Deficits

**Shifting Attitudes**:

| Era | Deficit Norm |
|-----|--------------|
| Pre-1930s | Balanced budgets except war |
| 1930s-1970s | Keynesian: deficits OK in recession |
| 1980s-1990s | Deficit concern (Gramm-Rudman, PAYGO) |
| 2000s-present | Deficits normalized regardless of cycle |

**Contributing Factors**:

1. No immediate consequences (low interest rates)
2. Both parties use deficits for priorities
3. Fiscal responsibility politically unrewarded
4. Academic debate (MMT) legitimizes deficits
5. Foreign buyers absorb debt

## Institutional Design Flaws

### Congressional Budget Process

**Design Problems**:

| Feature | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Annual appropriations | Repeated crisis points |
| Two-step process | Authorization and appropriation disconnect |
| Multiple committees | Fragmented jurisdiction |
| Budget resolution | Non-binding, often abandoned |
| Debt ceiling | Artificial crisis mechanism |

**Why 1974 Process Fails**:

- Deadlines routinely missed
- No enforcement mechanism
- Reconciliation abused
- Budget resolution ignored
- Process circumvented by CRs and omnibus

### Debt Ceiling Dysfunction

**The Problem**:

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Doesn't control spending | Spending already authorized |
| Creates artificial crisis | Brinksmanship each time |
| Enables hostage-taking | Minority leverage |
| Threatens default | Economic catastrophe risk |
| No other country uses it | Uniquely American dysfunction |

**Why It Persists**:

- Provides leverage to minority
- Creates forcing mechanism for negotiations
- Symbolic commitment to fiscal responsibility
- Difficult to abolish politically

### Entitlement Design

**Design Choices That Create Fiscal Pressure**:

| Program | Design Feature | Fiscal Effect |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Social Security | Defined benefit | Cost certainty for beneficiary, not government |
| Medicare | Fee-for-service | No cost control mechanism |
| Medicaid | Entitlement matching | States determine eligibility, feds pay share |
| ACA subsidies | Premium percentage | Cost rises with premiums |

**Alternative Designs**:

| Alternative | Example | Trade-off |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Defined contribution | 401(k) | Shifts risk to individuals |
| Premium support | Ryan plan | Could reduce government cost |
| Global budget | VA, other countries | Limits total spending |
| Block grants | TANF | Shifts cost to states |

## Information and Cognitive Problems

### Budget Complexity

**Public Understanding**:

| Item | Public Belief | Reality |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Foreign aid | 25% of budget | <1% of budget |
| Welfare | Major spending | ~2% of budget |
| Social Security/Medicare | Not "welfare" | Largest spending |
| Defense | Often underestimated | 13% of budget |

**Complexity Effects**:

- Voters cannot evaluate fiscal trade-offs
- Myths about budget composition persist
- Easy to manipulate perceptions
- Informed debate impossible

### Temporal Discounting

**Psychology of Fiscal Policy**:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Present bias | Immediate benefits preferred |
| Hyperbolic discounting | Future costs heavily discounted |
| Optimism bias | Assume problems will resolve |
| Diffusion of responsibility | "Not my generation's problem" |

**Result**: Systematic preference for current benefits, deferred costs.

### Interest Group Mobilization

**Asymmetric Organization**:

| Interests | Organization | Influence |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Beneficiaries | Highly organized | Very high |
| Taxpayers | Diffuse | Low |
| Future generations | Cannot organize | Zero |
| Industry | Well-organized | High |

**Concentrated Benefits, Diffuse Costs**:

- Program beneficiaries fight any cuts
- Taxpayers don't notice marginal increases
- Special interests protect tax preferences
- General interest in fiscal health unorganized

## Economic Ideology Conflicts

### Views on Deficits

**Conservative View**:

- Deficits crowd out private investment
- Government spending is less efficient
- Debt burden passed to children
- Inflation risk from monetization

**Progressive View**:

- Deficits enable investment
- Multiplier effects boost economy
- Austerity is counterproductive
- Interest rates show market acceptance

**Modern Monetary Theory**:

- Sovereign currency issuer cannot default
- Deficits limited only by inflation
- Full employment should be target
- Debt is accounting identity

### Views on Taxation

**Supply-Side View**:

- High taxes reduce growth
- Tax cuts can increase revenue
- Capital formation requires low rates
- Incentives matter more than redistribution

**Progressive View**:

- Taxes fund public goods
- Progressivity ensures fairness
- Revenue adequate for commitments
- Inequality harms growth

## Feedback Loops

### Deficit-to-Deficit Cycle

```text
1. Tax cuts pass → Revenue falls
2. Spending continues → Deficits rise
3. Interest costs grow → Less discretionary room
4. Investment cut → Growth slows
5. Revenue underperforms → Deficits persist
6. Return to Step 1: More tax cuts proposed
```

### Political Economy Trap

```text
1. Deficits emerge
2. Each party blames other
3. No compromise possible
4. Crisis forces short-term fix
5. Structural problems unaddressed
6. Deficits continue
7. Return to Step 2
```

## Summary: Why Reform Is Hard

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Political polarization | No bipartisan agreement |
| Electoral incentives | Reward spending, punish taxes |
| Veto points | Any change requires supermajority |
| Mandatory spending | On autopilot, hard to change |
| Debt ceiling | Creates crisis, not solutions |
| Public misunderstanding | Cannot evaluate trade-offs |
| Interest group power | Status quo protected |
| Ideological conflict | Fundamental disagreement |
