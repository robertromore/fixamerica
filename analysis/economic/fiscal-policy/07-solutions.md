# Fiscal Policy: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming American fiscal policy requires addressing both process dysfunction and substantive fiscal imbalances. Solutions range from technical fixes to the budget process to fundamental changes in how we think about fiscal sustainability. This document outlines comprehensive reforms at multiple levels of ambition.

## Principles for Reform

### Goals of Fiscal Policy Reform

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Functionality | Government funded predictably |
| Stabilization | Counter-cyclical capacity |
| Sustainability | Long-term balance achievable |
| Transparency | Public understands choices |
| Accountability | Politicians responsible for decisions |
| Investment | Adequate public goods provision |

### Design Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Automatic where possible | Reduce need for political action |
| Bipartisan structure | Survive political transitions |
| Enforcement mechanisms | Rules must have teeth |
| Flexibility | Accommodate genuine emergencies |
| Simplicity | Public can understand |

## Budget Process Reforms

### End Government Shutdowns

**Automatic Continuing Resolution**:

| Element | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Trigger | If appropriations not passed by deadline |
| Funding level | Prior year, inflation-adjusted |
| Duration | Until appropriations pass |
| Limits | Cannot exceed current services |

**Benefits**:

- Eliminates shutdown threat
- Removes hostage-taking opportunity
- Maintains government operations
- Creates positive incentive to negotiate

**Alternative: Full-Year Automatic Appropriation**:

- If deadline passes, full-year CR at prior level
- Agencies have certainty
- Congress loses leverage but gains functionality

### Debt Ceiling Reform

**Option 1: Abolish Entirely**:

| Argument For | Argument Against |
|--------------|------------------|
| Serves no fiscal purpose | Symbolic commitment |
| Creates crises | Provides negotiating moment |
| Threatens default | Forces fiscal debate |
| No other country uses it | Historical practice |

**Option 2: Automatic Increase**:

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Gephardt Rule | Deemed increased when budget passes |
| Tied to appropriations | Ceiling matches spending authorized |
| Presidential authority | President can increase with congressional override |

**Option 3: Suspension Norm**:

- Routinely suspend rather than increase
- Removes leverage while maintaining form
- Already done repeatedly in recent years

### Biennial Budgeting

**Design**:

| Year 1 | Year 2 |
|--------|--------|
| Full budget process | Oversight focus |
| Appropriations | Supplementals only |
| Authorization | Reauthorization |
| Major legislation | Technical corrections |

**Benefits**:

- More time for deliberation
- Agencies can plan better
- Reduces crisis frequency
- Allows oversight focus

**Concerns**:

- Reduces congressional control
- Economic conditions change
- Forecasting more difficult

### Budget Resolution Reform

**Make It Binding**:

| Current | Reformed |
|---------|----------|
| Non-binding targets | Enforceable caps |
| Often not passed | Required by deadline |
| No penalty | Automatic consequences |

**Automatic Resolution**:

- If not passed by April 15, prior year resolution continues
- CBO determines current services baseline
- Reconciliation still available

### Reconciliation Reform

**Restore Original Purpose**:

| Original Intent | Current Practice | Reform |
|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| Deficit reduction | Partisan legislation | Limit to deficit-related |
| Expedited process | Avoid filibuster | Maintain expedition |
| Mandatory/revenue | Major policy changes | Restrict scope |

**Byrd Rule Enhancement**:

- Stricter definition of budget-related
- Close loopholes that enable policy changes
- Independent enforcement

## Automatic Stabilizers

### Enhanced Unemployment Insurance
