# Fiscal Policy: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Implementing fiscal policy reform requires a phased approach that builds political support, demonstrates effectiveness, and creates momentum for more ambitious changes. This roadmap sequences reforms from immediately achievable to long-term structural changes.

## Phase 1: Process Stabilization (Years 1-2)

### End Government Shutdowns

**Timeline**:

| Month | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1-3 | Draft automatic CR legislation |
| 4-6 | Build bipartisan coalition |
| 7-9 | Committee hearings and markup |
| 10-12 | Floor passage in both chambers |

**Key Steps**:

1. Secure commitment from appropriations leadership
2. Address concerns about losing leverage
3. Design automatic funding level (prior year, inflation)
4. Include exceptions for genuine emergencies
5. Sunset provision for review

**Success Metrics**:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Government operating continuously | 100% |
| Appropriations completed on time | Improvement over baseline |
| Public approval of process | Increase |

### Debt Ceiling Reform
