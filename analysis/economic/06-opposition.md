### Specific Arguments

**Against Tax Reform**

| Argument | Counter |
|----------|---------|
| "Tax hikes kill jobs" | Evidence doesn't support; higher-tax eras had more growth |
| "Wealthy already pay most taxes" | Because they have most income; effective rates often low |
| "Capital gains tax hurts investment" | Evidence weak; other factors dominate investment |
| "Death tax destroys family farms" | Exemption already $13M+; almost no family farms affected |

| "Government shouldn't pick winners" | Letting monopolies persist is also picking winners |

**Against Labor Reform**

| Argument | Counter |

## Weaknesses

### Unpopular Positions

**Public Opinion Gap**

| Issue | Public Support | Opposition Position |

| Break up monopolies | 50-60% | Oppose |
| Strengthen unions | 70%+ | Oppose |
| Regulate Wall Street | 60%+ | Oppose |

The opposition often argues against popular positions, requiring them to rely on money and process rather than democratic persuasion.

**Elite vs. Mass Disconnect**

Business community positions often at odds with:
