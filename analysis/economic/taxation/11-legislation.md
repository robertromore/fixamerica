# Taxation: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Tax reform operates within significant constitutional and political constraints. This document provides draft legislation working within current doctrine while identifying pathways for more fundamental reform. Included are federal bills addressing income tax fairness, corporate tax reform, and wealth taxation, along with state model legislation and comprehensive analysis of potential loopholes and shortcomings.

## Constitutional Considerations

### Current Constitutional Framework

| Provision | Effect on Tax Policy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 16th Amendment | Allows federal income tax without apportionment |
| Article I, Section 8 | General taxing power |
| Article I, Section 9 | Direct taxes must be apportioned (if not income) |
| Due Process Clause | Limits retroactive taxation |

### Unsettled Constitutional Questions

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Wealth tax constitutionality | Unclear if "direct tax" requiring apportionment |
| Mark-to-market on unrealized gains | Realization traditionally required but not constitutionally mandated |
| Retroactive application | Limited by due process; prospective application preferred |

## Federal Legislation

### Tax Fairness for Working Families Act

**Purpose**: Eliminate preferential treatment of capital over labor income, close carried interest loophole, and ensure wealthy pay at least the same rate as workers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Tax Fairness for Working Families Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The current tax system taxes income from labor at higher rates
    than income from capital.
(2) Taxpayers with incomes exceeding $1,000,000 often pay lower
    effective tax rates than middle-class workers.
(3) The carried interest loophole allows investment fund managers
    to pay lower rates on their compensation than their employees.
(4) The stepped-up basis at death allows trillions in capital gains
    to escape taxation entirely.
(5) These provisions undermine confidence in the fairness of the
    tax system and reduce revenue for public investment.

SEC. 3. EQUALIZATION OF CAPITAL GAINS RATES.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
    is amended by striking paragraph (1) and inserting:

    not exceed the sum of—
        "(A) a tax computed at the rates and in the same manner as
        if this subsection had not been enacted on taxable income
        reduced by the amount of such gain; plus
        "(B) the amount determined under paragraph (2)."

    "(2) RATE ON NET CAPITAL GAIN.—
        "(A) IN GENERAL.—The amount determined under this paragraph
        shall be the sum of—
            "(i) zero percent of so much of the net capital gain
            (or, if less, taxable income) as does not exceed the
            amount on which a tax is determined at a rate below
            12 percent under section 1(a), (b), (c), or (d);
            "(ii) 12 percent of so much of the net capital gain
            (or, if less, taxable income) as exceeds the amount on
            which a tax is determined under clause (i) but does not
            exceed the amount on which a tax is determined at a
            rate below 24 percent; and
            "(iii) the rate applicable to ordinary income under
            section 1(a), (b), (c), or (d) on the remaining amount."

        "(2) APPLICABLE TRADE OR BUSINESS.—The term 'applicable trade
        or business' means any activity conducted on a regular,

            of $50,000,000; or
        (B) the sum of all wealth taxes that would have been imposed
            for the 10-year period preceding expatriation.
    (2) PRIOR RESIDENTS.—Any individual who was subject to this
