# Taxation: Overview

## Executive Summary

The American tax system fails to generate sufficient revenue while distributing the burden unfairly across income levels. Wealthy individuals and corporations exploit a system riddled with preferential rates, deductions, and loopholes that reduce their effective tax rates below those paid by working families. Capital gains receive preferential treatment over wages, inherited wealth passes largely untaxed, and multinational corporations shift profits offshore to avoid U.S. taxes entirely. Meanwhile, payroll taxes fall regressively on low and middle-income workers, and the IRS lacks the resources to enforce existing laws against wealthy tax evaders.

The result is a two-tiered system: working Americans pay their taxes through automatic wage withholding, while the wealthy hire accountants and lawyers to minimize their obligations. This creates both revenue shortfalls that limit public investment and deepening inequality that undermines economic opportunity and democratic legitimacy.

## The Core Problem

### A System That Favors Wealth Over Work

The fundamental inequity in American taxation is the preferential treatment of capital income over labor income:

| Income Type | Maximum Federal Rate | Who Benefits |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Wages and salary | 37% | Working and middle class |
| Long-term capital gains | 20% | Wealthy investors |
| Qualified dividends | 20% | Wealthy investors |
| Carried interest | 20% | Hedge fund managers |
| Inherited assets | 0% (stepped-up basis) | Heirs of the wealthy |

### The Practical Effect

**For Workers**

- Pay full marginal rates on every dollar earned
- Taxes automatically withheld from paychecks
- Limited deductions available
- Payroll taxes add 7.65% (plus employer share)

**For the Wealthy**

- Structure income as capital gains at lower rates
- Defer taxes indefinitely through unrealized gains
- Pass assets to heirs with zero tax on appreciation
- Employ complex structures to minimize obligations

**For Corporations**

- Effective rates far below statutory rates
- Shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions
- Exploit transfer pricing and intellectual property loopholes
- Use pass-through structures to avoid corporate tax entirely

## By the Numbers

### Income Tax Progressivity

| Income Group | Share of Income | Share of Federal Taxes | Effective Rate |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Bottom 50% | ~12% | ~3% | ~3% |
| 50th-90th percentile | ~40% | ~35% | ~15% |
| 90th-99th percentile | ~25% | ~35% | ~24% |
| Top 1% | ~20% | ~25% | ~26% |
| Top 0.1% | ~10% | ~15% | ~23% (declines) |

### Tax Gap and Enforcement

| Metric | Amount/Rate | Trend |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Annual tax gap | $600+ billion | Growing |
| Top 1% share of tax gap | ~25% | Stable |
| IRS audit rate (millionaires) | <1% | Down 80% since 2010 |
| IRS budget (real) | Down 20% | Declining |
| Revenue return on IRS funding | $5-12 per $1 spent | High ROI |

### Corporate Taxation

| Metric | Amount | Context |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Statutory corporate rate | 21% | Down from 35% in 2017 |
| Average effective rate | ~12% | After deductions/credits |
| Offshore profit holdings | $3+ trillion | In low-tax jurisdictions |
| Revenue lost to profit shifting | $100+ billion/year | Conservative estimate |

## Key Concepts

### Types of Taxes

**Progressive Taxes**: Rate increases with income/wealth (income tax)

**Regressive Taxes**: Take larger share from lower incomes (sales tax, payroll tax)

**Proportional/Flat Taxes**: Same rate regardless of income

### Key Tax Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Marginal rate** | Tax rate on next dollar of income |
| **Effective rate** | Total taxes paid divided by total income |
| **Tax expenditure** | Revenue lost through deductions, credits, exclusions |
| **Capital gains** | Profit from selling assets (stocks, property) |
| **Stepped-up basis** | Resetting asset cost basis at death to eliminate gains |
| **Carried interest** | Investment managers' share of profits taxed as capital gains |
| **Pass-through entity** | Business income taxed on owner's individual return |
| **Transfer pricing** | Pricing transactions between subsidiaries to shift profits |

### Tax Policy Trade-offs

| Goal | Tension With |
|------|--------------|
| Revenue adequacy | Economic growth concerns |
| Progressivity | Complexity and avoidance |
| Simplicity | Targeted incentives |
| Horizontal equity | Encouraging behavior |
| Vertical equity | Capital mobility |

### The Avoidance Cycle

1. **Tax preference created**: Lobbyists secure favorable treatment
2. **Wealthy exploit**: Restructure income to qualify
3. **Revenue declines**: Less money for public investment
4. **Rates raised on others**: Workers bear more burden
5. **Inequality grows**: Wealth concentrates further
6. **Lobbying power increases**: Return to Step 1

## Why This Matters

### For Economic Opportunity

When the tax system favors wealth over work, it becomes harder for working families to build savings and harder for workers to compete with capital. The path to prosperity shifts from hard work to inheritance.

### For Public Investment

Revenue shortfalls from tax avoidance mean less funding for education, infrastructure, research, and social programs that create opportunity and drive growth.

### For Democratic Legitimacy

When ordinary citizens see billionaires paying lower rates, trust in government and the fairness of the system erodes. Tax fairness is essential to social cohesion.

### For Economic Stability

Extreme wealth concentration creates fragile economies dependent on the spending decisions of a few, while undermining the broad-based consumer demand that drives sustainable growth.
