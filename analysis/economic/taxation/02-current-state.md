# Taxation: Current State

## Overview

The American tax system in 2024 combines a nominally progressive income tax with numerous provisions that favor capital over labor, creating a system where the wealthiest often pay lower effective rates than working families. Corporate tax revenues have declined dramatically as a share of GDP, the IRS lacks resources to enforce the law against wealthy evaders, and hundreds of billions in revenue are lost annually to legal and illegal tax avoidance.

## Individual Income Tax

### Rate Structure

The federal income tax has seven brackets (2024):

| Tax Rate | Single Filers | Married Filing Jointly |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| 10% | Up to $11,600 | Up to $23,200 |
| 12% | $11,601-$47,150 | $23,201-$94,300 |
| 22% | $47,151-$100,525 | $94,301-$201,050 |
| 24% | $100,526-$191,950 | $201,051-$383,900 |
| 32% | $191,951-$243,725 | $383,901-$487,450 |
| 35% | $243,726-$609,350 | $487,451-$731,200 |
| 37% | Over $609,350 | Over $731,200 |

### Effective Tax Rates by Income

Due to deductions, credits, and preferential rates on investment income, effective rates differ from marginal rates:

| Income Percentile | Average Income | Effective Federal Rate |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Bottom 20% | ~$15,000 | <0% (refundable credits) |
| 20th-40th | ~$35,000 | ~3% |
| 40th-60th | ~$60,000 | ~8% |
| 60th-80th | ~$100,000 | ~13% |
| 80th-95th | ~$175,000 | ~18% |
| 95th-99th | ~$400,000 | ~24% |
| Top 1% | ~$1.5 million | ~26% |
| Top 0.01% | ~$30 million | ~23% |

Note: Effective rates decline at the very top due to capital gains preference.

### Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

The AMT was designed to ensure high-income taxpayers pay minimum tax:

- Exemption: $85,700 (single), $133,300 (married) in 2024
- Rate: 26-28% on AMT income
- Impact: Significantly reduced after 2017 tax law changes
- Current effect: Primarily affects upper-middle class, not the very wealthy

## Capital Gains and Investment Income

### Preferential Rates

Long-term capital gains (assets held >1 year) and qualified dividends receive preferential rates:

| Ordinary Income Bracket | Capital Gains Rate |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| 10% and 12% brackets | 0% |
| 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% | 15% |
| 37% bracket | 20% |

### Net Investment Income Tax

Additional 3.8% surtax on investment income for:

- Single filers with MAGI over $200,000
- Married filing jointly over $250,000
- Applies to: interest, dividends, capital gains, rental income

### Carried Interest Loophole

Investment fund managers (hedge funds, private equity) receive share of profits as "carried interest":

- Taxed at 20% capital gains rate instead of 37% ordinary income rate
- Three-year holding period requirement (easily met)
- Estimated cost: $13-18 billion over 10 years
- Benefits approximately 35,000 individuals

### Opportunity Zones

Created in 2017 tax law:

- Defer and reduce capital gains by investing in designated areas
- Significant tax benefits, limited community benefit
- Primary beneficiaries: wealthy real estate developers
- Limited requirements for actual community investment

## Corporate Taxation

### Rate Structure

| Rate | Status |
|------|--------|
| Statutory rate | 21% (down from 35% pre-2017) |
| Average effective rate | ~12-15% |
| Minimum rate on foreign income | 10.5% (GILTI) |

### Revenue Trends

| Period | Corporate Tax as % of GDP | Corporate Tax as % of Revenue |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1950s | ~5-6% | ~30% |
| 1990s | ~2% | ~10-12% |
| 2010s | ~1.5% | ~9% |
| 2022-2024 | ~1.5-2% | ~8-10% |

### International Profit Shifting

Major corporations shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions:

| Jurisdiction | U.S. Corporate Profits Booked | Effective Tax Rate |
|--------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Ireland | $120+ billion | ~2-3% |
| Netherlands | $100+ billion | ~3-5% |
| Luxembourg | $80+ billion | <1% |
| Bermuda | $75+ billion | 0% |
| Cayman Islands | $70+ billion | 0% |

**Methods**:

- Transfer pricing: Selling goods/services between subsidiaries at manipulated prices
- Intellectual property shifting: Locate patents, trademarks in low-tax jurisdictions
- Debt shifting: Load U.S. operations with intercompany debt, deduct interest
- Check-the-box rules: Choose tax treatment of foreign entities

### Pass-Through Business Income

Over 90% of U.S. businesses are pass-throughs (S-corps, LLCs, partnerships):

- Income taxed on owners' individual returns
- 20% deduction on qualified business income (Section 199A)
- Significant benefits flow to high-income owners
- Enables avoiding corporate tax and some payroll taxes

## Estate and Gift Taxes

### Current Structure

| Element | 2024 Amount |
|---------|-------------|
| Estate tax exemption | $13.61 million per person |
| Gift tax exemption | $18,000 annual; $13.61 million lifetime |
| Top estate tax rate | 40% |
| Portability | Unused exemption transfers to surviving spouse |

### Effective Coverage

- Less than 0.1% of estates pay any estate tax
- Only ~2,500 estates per year are taxable
- Revenue: ~$20-25 billion annually

### Avoidance Mechanisms

**Stepped-Up Basis**

- At death, asset cost basis resets to current value
- All capital gains during life escape taxation entirely
- Estimated cost: $40+ billion annually
- Primary beneficiaries: wealthiest 1% of estates

**Dynasty Trusts**

- Assets placed in perpetual trusts
- Avoid estate taxes for generations
- Available in 20+ states with no rule against perpetuities
- Estimated assets: $1+ trillion

**Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)**

- Transfer appreciation to heirs tax-free
- "Zeroed-out" GRATs minimize gift tax exposure
- Used extensively by ultra-wealthy families
- Cost: billions in avoided estate taxes

**Valuation Discounts**

- Family businesses and limited partnerships
- Claim 30-40% discounts for lack of marketability/control
- Reduces taxable value of transfers
- Frequently challenged but often upheld
