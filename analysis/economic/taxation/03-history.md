# Taxation: History

## Overview

American taxation has evolved from minimal federal taxes in the early republic to today's complex system of income, payroll, and corporate taxes. The history reflects ongoing tensions between revenue needs, fairness concerns, and economic ideology. Key developments include the Civil War income tax, the 16th Amendment, the dramatic rate reductions since the 1980s, and the increasing sophistication of tax avoidance strategies.

## Early Republic (1789-1860)

### Founding Era

The Constitution originally limited federal taxation:

- **Tariffs**: Primary federal revenue source (80-90%)
- **Excise taxes**: On whiskey, tobacco, carriages
- **No income tax**: Direct taxes required to be apportioned by population
- **State-centric**: Most taxation occurred at state and local levels

### Debates

| Position | Advocates | Arguments |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Limited federal taxation | Jefferson, states' rights | Preserve state sovereignty |
| Stronger federal revenue | Hamilton, nationalists | Fund national debt, build industry |

### Pre-Civil War Changes

- Tariffs remained primary revenue source
- Debates over protectionism vs. free trade
- Internal improvements funded through land sales
- Mexican-American War financed by tariffs and loans

## Civil War and First Income Tax (1861-1872)

### Revenue Act of 1861

- First federal income tax in U.S. history
- 3% on incomes over $800 (approximately $26,000 today)
- Emergency war measure
- Poorly administered initially

### Revenue Act of 1862

More comprehensive income tax:

| Income Level | Tax Rate |
|-------------|----------|
| $600-$10,000 | 3% |
| Over $10,000 | 5% |

- Established Bureau of Internal Revenue (predecessor to IRS)
- Included withholding on dividends and salaries
- Progressive principle established

### Post-War Period

- Rates increased during war, reaching 10% on high incomes
- Income tax repealed in 1872 after war financing needs ended
- Tariffs returned as primary revenue source
- Court challenges began

### Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. (1895)

- Supreme Court struck down 1894 income tax
- Ruled income tax on property income was "direct tax" requiring apportionment
- Effectively made progressive income tax unconstitutional
- Led to 16th Amendment movement

## Progressive Era and the 16th Amendment (1900-1920)

### Movement for Income Tax

- Growing inequality in Gilded Age
- Populist and Progressive movements demanded tax fairness
- Muckrakers exposed corporate abuses
- Labor movement supported redistribution

### 16th Amendment (1913)

"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration."

- Ratified February 3, 1913
- Removed constitutional obstacle to income tax
- Enabled graduated/progressive rates

### Revenue Act of 1913

Initial income tax structure:

| Income Level | Tax Rate |
|-------------|----------|
| First $20,000 | 1% |
| $20,000-$50,000 | 2% |
| $50,000-$75,000 | 3% |
| $75,000-$100,000 | 4% |
| $100,000-$250,000 | 5% |
| $250,000-$500,000 | 6% |
| Over $500,000 | 7% |

## Key Lessons from History

### What History Shows

1. **Income tax was controversial**: Took constitutional amendment
2. **Rates have varied dramatically**: From 7% to 94%
3. **High rates didn't prevent growth**: Post-war boom with 91% top rate
4. **Base erosion accompanies rate cuts**: Preferences proliferate
5. **Bipartisan reform is possible**: 1986 example
6. **Tax policy is cyclical**: Rates rise and fall with politics

### Persistent Tensions

| Tension | Historical Manifestation |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Progressivity vs. incentives | Ongoing rate debates |
| Simplicity vs. targeting | Preference accumulation |
| Revenue vs. growth | Supply-side debates |
| Federal vs. state | Federalism concerns |
| Capital vs. labor | Preferential rates for capital |
