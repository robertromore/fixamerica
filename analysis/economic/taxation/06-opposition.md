## Arguments Against Reform

### Economic Arguments

**"Tax increases harm growth"**:

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Lower taxes = higher growth | Weak correlation in data |
| 1980s cuts caused boom | Multiple factors; inequality grew |
| High-tax states underperform | California, NY are economic leaders |
| Job creation requires low taxes | Demand matters more |

**Counter-Evidence**:

- Post-WWII growth with 91% top rate
- 1990s boom after Clinton tax increases
- Kansas experiment failed
- Europe sustains growth with higher taxes

**"Capital flight"**:

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Wealthy will leave | Very few actually emigrate |
| Businesses will relocate | Market access matters more |
| Investment will decline | Driven by demand, not rates |

### Fairness Arguments

**"Wealthy already pay most taxes"**:

| Claim | Context |
|-------|---------|
| Top 1% pays 40% of income taxes | They have 20% of income |
| Top 10% pays 70% | Progressive system by design |
| Bottom 50% pays little | They earn little |

**Counter-Arguments**:

- Payroll, sales, property taxes not counted
- Effective rates decline at very top
- Wealth concentration requires progressivity
- System still enables massive accumulation

**"Double taxation"**:

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Corporate income taxed twice | Many corporations pay near-zero |
| Estate tax taxes already-taxed income | Appreciation often never taxed |
| Capital gains already taxed | Often deferred indefinitely |

### Constitutional Arguments

**"Wealth tax is unconstitutional"**:

| Claim | Counter-Arguments |
|-------|-------------------|
| Direct tax must be apportioned | 16th Amendment scope debated |
| Property tax at federal level | States impose property taxes |
| Unclear precedent | Never tested at Supreme Court |

**Legal Uncertainty**: Some scholars argue wealth tax could be constitutional; others disagree. Would likely face litigation.

### Practical Arguments

**"Complexity makes reform difficult"**:

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Wealthy will find new loopholes | Require anti-avoidance rules |
| Enforcement too difficult | Fund IRS adequately |
| Valuation is impossible | Already done for estate tax |

**"Unintended consequences"**:

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Harm family farms | Very few affected; exemptions possible |
| Force asset sales | Liquidity provisions |
| Reduce entrepreneurship | Evidence weak |

## Case Studies

### Carried Interest: Decades of Failed Reform

- Proposed by multiple presidents (Obama, Trump, Biden)
- Bipartisan rhetorical support
- Never enacted
- Financial industry lobbying prevails

**Lessons**: Need sustained pressure; industry mobilizes when threatened.

### 2017 TCJA: Opposition Victory

- Major corporate rate cut
- Pass-through deduction created
- Estate tax weakened
- Individual cuts made temporary

**Lessons**: Unified opposition with power prevails; corporate lobbying effective.

### IRS Funding: Vulnerable Target

- Decades of budget cuts
- "Targeting" allegations
- Inflation Reduction Act partially reversed
- Ongoing rescission attempts

**Lessons**: Enforcement funding politically vulnerable; need sustained defense.
