# Taxation: Root Causes

## Overview

The inequities in the American tax system are not accidental but result from deliberate policy choices driven by concentrated political power, ideological shifts, and structural features that advantage those who can shape the rules. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing reforms that can withstand the forces that created the current system.

## Political Economy of Taxation

### Wealth Buys Influence

The wealthy have disproportionate influence over tax policy through:

| Mechanism | Effect on Tax Policy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Campaign contributions | Candidates dependent on wealthy donors |
| Lobbying | Direct influence on legislation drafting |
| Revolving door | Former officials craft favorable rules |
| Think tank funding | Shapes intellectual climate |
| Media ownership | Frames public debate |

**Evidence**:

- Tax legislation often drafted by industry lobbyists
- Campaign donors receive preferential tax treatment
- Complexity benefits those who can hire experts
- Public preferences for higher taxes on wealthy not enacted

### Collective Action Problem

| Group | Organization Level | Policy Influence |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| General public | Diffuse, weak | Low |
| Wealthy individuals | Concentrated, strong | High |
| Corporations | Highly organized | Very high |
| Tax professionals | Strong trade associations | High |

The costs of tax preferences are spread among millions of taxpayers (each paying a little more), while benefits concentrate on a few (who gain a lot). This creates asymmetric incentives for political action.

### Political Asymmetry

**Tax cuts are easier to pass than tax increases**:

- Cutting taxes provides immediate, visible benefits
- Raising taxes imposes immediate, visible costs
- Deficit financing defers consequences
- "No new taxes" pledges constrain politicians

**Result**: Ratchet effect where cuts happen during good times and increases are blocked during bad times.

## Ideological Foundations

### Supply-Side Economics

Core claims:

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Lower rates increase revenue | Not supported by evidence |
| Cutting capital taxes spurs investment | Weak effect, mostly windfall gains |
| Trickle-down benefits all | Benefits concentrate at top |
| High rates reduce work effort | Minimal effect at current rates |

**Political Utility**:

- Provides intellectual cover for regressive cuts
- Frames tax cuts as growth policy
- Shifts burden of proof to reformers

### Capital as "Job Creator"

The ideological framing of capital income as different:

| Framing | Counter-Evidence |
|---------|------------------|
| "Risk-taking should be rewarded" | Workers also take risks |
| "Capital creates jobs" | Demand creates jobs; capital follows demand |
| "Double taxation" on dividends | Workers' income also taxed multiple times |
| "Investment should be encouraged" | Much "investment" is just asset trading |

### Anti-Government Ideology

- "Government is the problem"
- Starve the beast strategy
- Tax cuts reduce capacity for public investment
- Creates self-fulfilling prophecy of government failure

## Structural Factors

### Complexity Advantages the Wealthy

| Aspect | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Multiple income types | Wealthy can characterize income favorably |
| Deduction stacking | Itemizers benefit disproportionately |
| Entity choice | Business structures offer tax advantages |
| Timing strategies | Wealthy can defer income |
| International options | Global income requires global planning |

**Tax Professionals**:

- $20,000+ for sophisticated tax planning
- Access to cutting-edge strategies
- Continuous optimization

**Working Families**:

- Simple Form 1040 or paid preparer
- Limited planning opportunities
- Pay taxes as earned

### Realization Requirement

Current law taxes capital gains only when assets are sold:

**Consequences**:

1. Wealthy can defer indefinitely
2. Borrow against assets instead of selling
3. Pass to heirs with stepped-up basis
4. Pay zero tax on lifetime appreciation

**"Buy, Borrow, Die" Strategy**:

1. Buy assets (stocks, real estate)
2. Borrow against appreciated assets (loans not taxable)
3. Die with assets (stepped-up basis eliminates gains)
4. Heirs inherit with no tax on appreciation

### Third-Party Reporting Gap

| Income Type | Reporting Level | Compliance Rate |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Wages (W-2) | Near 100% | 99% |
| Interest (1099-INT) | High | 95% |
| Business income (no 1099) | Low | 45-55% |
| Partnership (K-1) | Moderate | 55% |
| Rental income | Low | 55% |

**Wealthy have more "opaque" income** that lacks third-party reporting.

### Pass-Through Entity Proliferation

Shift from C-corporations to pass-throughs:

| Year | Pass-Through Share of Business Income |
|------|--------------------------------------|
| 1980 | ~20% |
| 2000 | ~50% |
| 2020 | ~65% |

**Drivers**:

- Lower individual rates after 1986
- State tax avoidance
- Self-employment tax planning
- Flexibility in income characterization

**Consequences**:

- Blurs line between labor and capital income
- Enables income shifting within families
- Complicates enforcement
- Creates Section 199A windfall

## Corporate Tax Erosion

### Race to the Bottom

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Globalization | Capital can relocate |
| Tax competition | Countries offer lower rates |
| Transfer pricing | Profits shifted to low-tax jurisdictions |
| IP mobility | Intangibles easily relocated |

### Corporate Lobbying Power

- Hundreds of millions spent on tax lobbying
- Industry-specific provisions proliferate
- "Tax extenders" package renewed repeatedly
- Enforcement resources stripped

### Tax Planning Industry

- Accounting firms earn billions from tax planning
- Aggressive positions pushed to clients
- Revolving door with Treasury and IRS
- Penalty arbitrage (save more than potential penalty)

## Historical Path Dependencies

### 1986 Base Broadening Reversed

The 1986 Tax Reform Act eliminated many preferences but:

- Preferences gradually restored
- Each narrow interest organized for restoration
- General public didn't notice incremental erosion
- By 2017, more preferences than 1985

### Capital Gains Preference Entrenched

| Year | Capital Gains Rate | Ordinary Income Top Rate |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1986-1990 | Same as ordinary | 28% |
| 1991-1996 | 28% | 31-39.6% |
| 1997-2002 | 20% | 39.6% |
| 2003-2012 | 15% | 35% |
| 2013-Present | 20%+ | 37-39.6% |

**Path Dependency**: Once preferential treatment exists, eliminating it is framed as a "tax increase."

### Estate Tax Erosion

| Year | Exemption | Estates Taxable |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 2001 | $675,000 | ~50,000 |
| 2009 | $3.5 million | ~5,500 |
| 2017 | $5.49 million | ~5,000 |
| 2024 | $13.61 million | ~2,500 |

**Framing Success**: "Death tax" language shifted public opinion despite affecting only wealthiest 0.1%.

## Enforcement Erosion

### Deliberate Defunding

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Budget cuts | Fewer agents, auditors |
| Hiring freezes | Aging workforce |
| Complexity increases | Resources stretched thinner |
| Technology gaps | IRS systems outdated |

**Who Benefits**: Those with complex returns and aggressive positions.

### Political Protection of Non-Compliance

- IRS politically vulnerable
- Budget cuts framed as "waste reduction"
- Audits of wealthy framed as "harassment"
- Enforcement resources for low-income easier to fund

### Practitioner Capture

- Tax lawyers and accountants shape enforcement
- Penalty mitigation industry
- IRS career path to private sector
- Favorable rulings for aggressive positions

## State and Local Factors

### Interstate Competition

- States compete for businesses with tax breaks
- Race to bottom on corporate rates
- Tax incentive packages rarely evaluated
- Wealth concentration in low-tax states

### Property Tax Limits

- Proposition 13 (California, 1978) model spreads
- Assessment limits lock in low bases
- Shifts burden to new buyers
- Reduces local government capacity

### Regressive State Systems

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Sales tax reliance | Regressive burden |
| No income tax states | Attract wealthy residents |
| Limited property tax | Inadequate local funding |
| SALT deduction | Federal subsidy for wealthy |

## Information Asymmetries

### Complexity as Barrier

- Tax code: 4+ million words
- Regulations: millions more
- Case law: extensive
- Understanding requires expertise

**Who Wins**: Those who can afford experts.

### Opacity of Wealthy Finances

- Little transparency on ultra-wealthy taxation
- ProPublica leak revealed effective rates
- IRS rarely publishes distributional analysis
- Self-reporting without verification

### Public Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "Half of Americans pay no taxes" | Payroll, sales, property taxes universal |
| "Corporations pay 21%" | Average effective rate ~12% |
| "Capital gains are double-taxed" | Many gains never taxed (stepped-up basis) |
| "Rich pay most of the taxes" | Because they have most of the income |

## Reinforcing Dynamics

### Wealth Concentration Feedback Loop

1. Wealthy influence tax policy
2. Tax policy favors wealth accumulation
3. Wealth concentrates further
4. Political influence increases
5. Return to Step 1

### Underfunding Feedback Loop

1. Tax cuts reduce revenue
2. Government services decline
3. Public loses faith in government
4. Support for more tax cuts increases
5. Return to Step 1

### Complexity Feedback Loop

1. Special interests add preferences
2. Complexity increases
3. Expertise required for compliance
4. Tax professionals benefit
5. Lobby for more complexity
6. Return to Step 1

## Comparative Context

### Why Other Countries Differ

| Factor | U.S. | Other Developed Nations |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| Campaign finance | Unlimited | Regulated |
| Lobbying | Lightly regulated | More restrictions |
| Administrative capacity | Underfunded | Adequately funded |
| Tax morale | Lower | Higher |
| Wealth concentration | Extreme | Significant but less |

### What Works Elsewhere

- Automatic return filing (many countries)
- Real-time third-party reporting
- Stronger international cooperation
- Higher enforcement rates
- Simpler systems

## Summary: Why the System Persists

| Root Cause | Manifestation | Persistence Mechanism |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Money in politics | Donor-friendly policy | Citizens United, lobbying |
| Ideology | Supply-side justifications | Think tanks, media |
| Structural advantages | Complexity, realization rule | Path dependency |
| Corporate power | Profit shifting, erosion | Globalization, mobility |
| Enforcement collapse | Tax gap, non-compliance | Budget cuts, capture |
| Information asymmetry | Public confusion | Complexity, opacity |
