# Taxation: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming the American tax system requires addressing multiple interconnected problems: the preference for capital over labor, corporate tax avoidance, enforcement gaps, and regressive elements. This document outlines comprehensive solutions ranging from immediately achievable reforms to transformative structural changes.

## Principles for Reform

### Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Progressivity | Those with greater ability pay higher rates |
| Horizontal equity | Similar incomes taxed similarly |
| Revenue adequacy | Sufficient funds for public investment |
| Simplicity | Understandable, administrable rules |
| Transparency | Public knows who pays what |
| Enforceability | Rules can be monitored and enforced |

### Trade-offs to Navigate

| Goal | Tension |
|------|---------|
| Simplicity vs. Targeting | Fewer provisions = less precision |
| Progressivity vs. Avoidance | Higher rates = more planning incentive |
| Revenue vs. Growth | Some tax-sensitive behavior exists |
| Certainty vs. Flexibility | Stable rules may become outdated |

## Income Tax Reform

### Equalize Treatment of Work and Wealth

**The Problem**: Capital gains taxed at 20% while wages taxed at 37%.

**Solutions**:

| Reform | Description | Revenue Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Tax capital gains as ordinary income | Same rate for all income types | $400+ billion/10 years |
| Annual mark-to-market | Tax appreciation annually | $200+ billion/10 years |
| Limit preferential rate | Apply only to inflation-adjusted gains | Moderate |
| Death as realization event | Tax gains at death | $40+ billion/year |

**Mark-to-Market Taxation**:

For publicly traded assets, calculate gain annually and tax:

- Ends "buy, borrow, die" strategy
- Eliminates benefit of indefinite deferral
- Requires liquidity provisions for illiquid assets
- Could apply above income threshold

**Death as Realization**:

- All assets deemed sold at death
- Gains taxed before transfer to heirs
- Ends stepped-up basis benefit
- Exemption for small estates and family businesses

### Carried Interest Reform

**The Problem**: Investment fund managers pay 20% instead of 37% on compensation.

**Solutions**:

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Tax as ordinary income | Treat carried interest like other compensation |
| Extend holding period | Already 3 years; could extend further |
| Enterprise test | Require fund manager capital at risk |

**Revenue**: $13-18 billion over 10 years from closing this loophole.

### Strengthen Rate Structure

**Current**: Seven brackets, top rate 37% at $609,350.

**Reform Options**:

| Bracket Structure | Top Rate | Threshold |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|
| Current | 37% | $609,350 |
| Clinton-era | 39.6% | ~$500,000 |
| Pre-Reagan | 50% | $1 million |
| Millionaire surtax | 45% | $1 million |
| FDR-inspired | 60%+ | $10 million |

**Millionaire Surtax**:

- Additional 5% on income over $1 million
- 3% additional over $10 million
- Applies to all income including capital gains
- Simple overlay on existing structure

### Limit Tax Expenditures

**The Problem**: Deductions and credits benefit higher incomes disproportionately.

**Solutions**:

| Reform | Description | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Cap itemized deductions | Limit to 28% of value | Reduces upper-income benefit |
| Convert deductions to credits | Same dollar benefit regardless of bracket | More progressive |
| Pease limitation | Phase out deductions at high income | Revenue and progressivity |
| Standard deduction increase | Fewer itemizers | Simplification |

**Specific Expenditure Reforms**:

| Expenditure | Current | Reform |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Mortgage interest | Unlimited on $750K | Cap at $500K; credit not deduction |
| SALT | $10,000 cap | Maintain or lower cap |
| Charitable | Unlimited | 30% AGI cap; require minimum distribution |
| Retirement | High limits favor wealthy | Lower contribution limits; expand Saver's Credit |

| Obama proposal | $3.5 million | 45% | $40+ billion/year |
| Sanders proposal | $3.5 million | 45-77% | $50+ billion/year |

**Close Avoidance Techniques**:

| Sanders (2019) | $32 million | 1-8% graduated | $4.35 trillion/10 years |
| Moderate version | $100 million | 1% | ~$500 billion/10 years |

**Implementation Challenges**:

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Valuation | IRS already values estates; expand capacity |
| Liquidity | Payment plans; borrow against assets |
| Constitutional | 16th Amendment scope uncertain; may require amendment |
| Avoidance | Exit taxes; mark-to-market for traded assets |
| Enforcement | Robust reporting requirements; international cooperation |

**Alternative: Billionaire Minimum Tax**:
