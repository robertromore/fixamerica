# Taxation: Overview

The American tax system fails to generate sufficient revenue while distributing the burden unfairly across income levels. Wealthy individuals and corporations exploit a system riddled with preferential rates, deductions, and loopholes that reduce their effective tax rates below those paid by working families. Capital gains receive preferential treatment over wages, inherited wealth passes largely untaxed, and multinational corporations shift profits offshore to avoid U.S. taxes entirely. Meanwhile, payroll taxes fall regressively on low and middle-income workers, and the IRS lacks the resources to enforce existing laws against wealthy tax evaders.
