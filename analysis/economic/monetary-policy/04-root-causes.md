# Monetary Policy: Root Causes

## Why Monetary Policy Problems Persist

### Structural Issues in Fed Governance

**Private Bank Ownership of Regional Feds**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Member banks own stock | Conflict of interest |
| Bank directors on boards | Regulated entities govern regulator |
| Selection process | Industry captures appointments |
| Accountability | To banks, not public |

**Board of Governors Limitations**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Presidential appointment | Political considerations |
| Senate confirmation | Partisan battles |
| 14-year terms | Can become out of touch |
| Vacancies | Often unfilled |
| Narrow backgrounds | Finance-dominated |

**FOMC Composition**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| NY Fed always votes | Disproportionate Wall Street influence |
| Rotating regional votes | Inconsistent representation |
| No worker representatives | One-sided perspectives |
| No consumer advocates | Missing voice |

### Ideological Capture

**Dominant Economic Paradigm**

| Belief | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| Inflation is primary evil | Employment secondary |
| Markets self-correct | Underestimate intervention needs |
| Asset bubbles hard to identify | Excuse for inaction |
| Distributional effects "not our job" | Ignores inequality impact |

**Personnel Pipeline**

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| PhD economists dominate | Narrow methodology |
| Finance industry revolving door | Industry viewpoint |
| Limited diversity | Blind spots |
| Academic conformity | Groupthink |

**Cognitive Capture**

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Shared worldview with banks | Sympathetic regulation |
| Social networks | Wall Street relationships |
| Career incentives | Don't alienate future employers |
| Intellectual frameworks | Market-friendly models |

### Information Asymmetries

**Fed vs. Public**

| Area | Imbalance |
|------|-----------|
| Economic data | Fed has more resources |
| Policy deliberations | Largely secret |
| Financial system knowledge | Fed sees inside |
| Research capacity | Overwhelming advantage |

**Fed vs. Congress**

| Area | Imbalance |
|------|-----------|
| Technical expertise | Fed far more |
| Staff resources | Fed vastly larger |
| Real-time information | Fed ahead |
| Modeling capacity | Congress relies on Fed |

### Political Economy

**Why Reform Is Difficult**

| Actor | Interest |
|-------|----------|
| Banks | Like current system |
| Asset owners | Benefit from easy money |
| Incumbent politicians | Fear disrupting status quo |
| Financial media | Close to Wall Street |

**Who Loses from Current System**

| Group | How they lose |
|-------|--------------|
| Workers | Job losses in downturns |
| Savers | Low interest rates |
| Renters | Asset inflation |
| Young people | Wealth concentration |
| Future generations | Debt burdens |

### Tool Limitations

**Blunt Instruments**

| Tool | Limitation |
|------|------------|
| Interest rates | Affect whole economy, not targeted |
| QE | Benefits asset owners disproportionately |
| Forward guidance | Depends on credibility |
| Regulatory tools | Separate from monetary policy |

**Transmission Mechanism Problems**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Banks may not lend | Credit channel blocked |
| Companies may not invest | Uncertainty matters more |
| Consumers may not spend | Balance sheet repair |
| Global capital flows | Policy leakage |

### Mandate Ambiguity

**Dual Mandate Tensions**

| Tension | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Employment vs. inflation | Often conflict |
| Short-term vs. long-term | Trade-offs unclear |
| National vs. global | Spillovers |
| Stability vs. distribution | Not in mandate |

**Missing Mandates**

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Financial stability | Implicit, not explicit |
| Inequality | Not considered |
| Climate change | Contested |
| Housing affordability | Not addressed |

### Accountability Deficits

**Congressional Oversight Weaknesses**

| Weakness | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Technical complexity | Members don't understand |
| Deference to experts | Limited questioning |
| No real power | Can't overrule decisions |
| Partisan division | Inconsistent oversight |

**Public Accountability Gaps**

| Gap | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| Low public awareness | No pressure |
| Complex communication | Inaccessible |
| Delayed information | Can't react in time |
| No direct elections | No accountability mechanism |

### Systemic Factors

**Financialization of Economy**

| Trend | Impact on Fed |
|-------|---------------|
| Financial sector growth | More systemic risk |
| Asset price importance | Fed must consider markets |
| Corporate debt levels | Sensitivity to rates |
| Household debt | Same |

**Globalization**

| Factor | Constraint |
|--------|------------|
| Dollar as reserve currency | Global responsibilities |
| Capital mobility | Policy leakage |
| International coordination | Limits autonomy |
| Currency competition | New pressures |

**Technology**

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| High-frequency trading | Market structure changes |
| Fintech | New players outside system |
| Cryptocurrency | Potential competition |

### Crisis Dynamics

**Emergency Power Expansion**

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Crisis creates precedent | Powers never fully retracted |
| Each crisis expands authority | Ratchet effect |
| Markets expect intervention | Moral hazard |
| Political pressure intense | Hard to resist |

**Bailout Expectations**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| "Too big to fail" | Risk-taking encouraged |
| Socialized losses | Private gains |
| Wealth protection | Inequality reinforced |
| Democratic deficit | Trillions without vote |
