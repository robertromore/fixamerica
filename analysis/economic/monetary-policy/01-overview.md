# Monetary Policy: Overview

## Executive Summary

Monetary policy—the management of the money supply and interest rates by the Federal Reserve—profoundly shapes the American economy. The Fed's decisions affect employment, inflation, asset prices, credit availability, and the distribution of wealth. Yet this immense power is exercised by unelected officials with limited public accountability, raising fundamental questions about democratic governance of economic policy.

## The Core Problem

| Aspect | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| Accountability gap | Unelected officials make decisions affecting millions |
| Distributional effects | Monetary policy systematically benefits asset owners |
| Transparency limits | Key decisions made behind closed doors |
| Mandate constraints | Dual mandate may be insufficient for modern economy |
| Independence tensions | Fed faces political pressure despite formal independence |
| Crisis response | Emergency powers lack adequate oversight |

## Why It Matters

**For Economic Stability**

- Interest rate decisions shape business investment and hiring
- Inflation management affects purchasing power of wages
- Credit conditions determine access to mortgages and loans
- Financial stability policies affect systemic risk

**For Inequality**

- Quantitative easing inflates asset prices, benefiting wealthy
- Low interest rates hurt savers, especially retirees
- Tight money causes unemployment, hitting workers first
- Credit access varies dramatically by race and income

**For Democracy**

- Trillions of dollars allocated with minimal public input
- Technical complexity limits meaningful oversight
- Revolving door between Fed and Wall Street
- Regional Fed banks controlled by private banks

## Scope

**This Topic Covers**

## Key Questions

1. How should the Fed balance employment and price stability?
2. Who benefits and who loses from current monetary policy?
3. Is Fed independence compatible with democratic accountability?
4. Should the Fed have broader or narrower responsibilities?
5. How should the Fed address inequality and climate change?

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Federal funds rate | Interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans |
| Quantitative easing (QE) | Fed purchasing assets to inject money into economy |
| Dual mandate | Fed's legal obligation to pursue maximum employment and stable prices |
| FOMC | Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates |
| Reserve requirements | Minimum reserves banks must hold against deposits |
| Lender of last resort | Fed's role providing emergency liquidity in crises |
| Inflation targeting | Explicitly targeting a specific inflation rate (currently 2%) |

## The Stakes

**Current Reality**

- Fed balance sheet expanded from $900 billion (2008) to $9 trillion (2022)
- Interest rate decisions affect trillions in credit markets
- QE contributed to asset price inflation and wealth inequality
- Fed emergency powers activated without congressional approval

**What's at Risk**
