# Economic Reform: Overview

The American economy has become a machine that generates extraordinary wealth while failing to deliver broadly shared prosperity. Over the past four decades, productivity has nearly doubled while median wages have stagnated. The wealthiest 1% now own more than the bottom 50% combined. Corporate profits have reached record highs while small businesses struggle to compete against monopolistic giants. Financial speculation has outpaced productive investment. The tax system increasingly favors wealth over work. And economic mobility, once the hallmark of the American Dream, has declined to levels below most peer nations.
