# Economic Reform: History

## Origins

### The Gilded Age (1870s-1900s)

The first era of extreme inequality and corporate power established patterns that would recur:

**Robber Barons and Trusts**
- Rockefeller (Standard Oil), Carnegie (steel), Morgan (finance), Vanderbilt (railroads)
- Trusts controlled entire industries, crushing competition
- Workers faced dangerous conditions, low wages, no protections
- Wealth concentration reached levels not seen again until 2010s

**Labor Struggles**
- Violent suppression of strikes (Haymarket, Homestead, Pullman)
- Unions fought for basic rights against corporate and government power
- 12-14 hour days, child labor, no safety standards common
- Workers had little bargaining power against dominant employers

**Progressive Response**
- Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) attempted to curb monopolies
- Muckraking journalists exposed corporate abuses
- Progressive movement pushed for reform
- Tension between capital and labor defined the era

### Pre-Depression Economy (1920s)

The Roaring Twenties saw boom followed by bust:

- Stock market speculation reached extreme levels
- Wealth concentrated heavily at the top
- Agricultural sector already in depression
- Banking system unstable and poorly regulated
- Income inequality peaked before the crash

### The Great Depression (1929-1941)

The catastrophic collapse that reshaped American economic policy:

| Metric | Peak Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| Unemployment | 25% |
| Bank failures | 9,000+ |
| GDP decline | -30% |
| Stock market drop | -89% |
| Farm foreclosures | Millions |

The Depression demonstrated that markets left unregulated could fail catastrophically, destroying lives and threatening democracy itself.

## The New Deal and Postwar Order (1933-1970s)

### New Deal Transformation (1933-1938)

Franklin Roosevelt's response to the Depression created the modern economic framework:

**Financial Reform**
- Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial and investment banking
- FDIC created to insure deposits and prevent bank runs
- SEC established to regulate securities markets
- Federal Reserve powers expanded

**Labor Rights**
- National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) protected organizing
- Fair Labor Standards Act established minimum wage, overtime, 40-hour week
- Union membership surged from 11% to 35%
- Workers gained bargaining power for first time

**Social Insurance**
- Social Security provided retirement security
- Unemployment insurance cushioned job loss
- Progressive income tax with high marginal rates
- Framework for safety net established

**Competition Policy**
- Antitrust enforcement reinvigorated
- Utilities and monopolies regulated
- Corporate power checked

### The Great Compression (1940s-1970s)

The postwar era saw broadly shared prosperity unprecedented in American history:

**Economic Growth for All**

| Metric | 1947-1973 |
|--------|-----------|
| Real GDP growth (annual avg) | 3.8% |
| Real median family income growth | 3.0% annually |
| Bottom 20% income growth | 3.1% annually |
| Top 5% income growth | 2.4% annually |
| Income inequality | Declining |

**Strong Labor Movement**
- Union membership peaked at 35% in 1954
- Manufacturing jobs paid middle-class wages
- Single earner could support a family
- Defined benefit pensions common

**High Tax Rates**
- Top marginal rate 91% through 1963
- Corporate taxes generated 32% of federal revenue
- Estate tax applied broadly
- Progressive system funded public investment

**Regulated Finance**
- Glass-Steagall kept banks conservative
- Interest rate ceilings limited competition
- Savings and loans funded mortgages
- Financial sector small and stable

**Strong Antitrust**
- DOJ and FTC actively challenged mergers
- Courts applied strict per se rules
- Corporate concentration remained low
- Small business could compete

**Public Investment**
- Interstate highway system built
- GI Bill expanded higher education
- Research funding drove innovation
- Infrastructure investment high

### Cracks in the System (1970s)

By the 1970s, the postwar consensus faced mounting challenges:

**Stagflation**
- Oil shocks of 1973 and 1979
- Inflation reached double digits
- Unemployment rose simultaneously
- Traditional Keynesian tools seemed ineffective

**Deindustrialization Begins**
- Japanese and European competition intensified
- Steel, auto, textile industries struggled

- Trade deficits emerged

**Business Mobilization**
- Lewis Powell memo (1971) called for corporate political engagement
- Business Roundtable formed (1972)
- Corporate PACs proliferated
- Chamber of Commerce expanded influence

## The Neoliberal Turn (1980-Present)

### Reagan Revolution (1980s)

Ronald Reagan's election marked a fundamental shift in economic policy:

**Tax Cuts**
- Top marginal rate cut from 70% to 28%
- Capital gains rates slashed
- Corporate taxes reduced
- Deficits exploded but "starve the beast" strategy accepted

**Deregulation**
- Financial industry deregulation began
- Antitrust enforcement weakened
- Environmental and labor regulations reduced
- Free market ideology ascendant

**Union Busting**
- PATCO strike broken (1981)
- NLRB turned hostile to labor
- Right-to-work laws spread
- Union membership began steep decline

**The Reagan Narrative**
- "Government is the problem, not the solution"
- Trickle-down economics: benefits for wealthy would reach all
- Free markets as solution to economic problems
- Individual responsibility over collective action

### Financialization (1980s-2000s)

The financial sector grew to dominate the economy:

**Deregulation Cascade**
- S&L deregulation led to crisis (1980s)
- Glass-Steagall weakened then repealed (1999)
- Derivatives remained unregulated
- Leverage limits loosened

**Wall Street Ascendant**
- Hostile takeovers and leveraged buyouts
- Shareholder primacy doctrine
- Stock options aligned executive pay with share price
- Quarterly earnings pressure intensified

**Financial Innovation**
- Securitization and derivatives exploded
- Credit default swaps created systemic risk
- Shadow banking outside regulation
- Complexity outpaced oversight

### Globalization Accelerates (1990s-2000s)

Trade policy prioritized capital mobility over worker protection:

**Trade Agreements**
- NAFTA (1994) integrated North American economies
- WTO entry for China (2001) opened trade
- Bilateral agreements proliferated
- Capital gained freedom to move; labor did not

**The China Shock**
- 2-3 million manufacturing jobs lost to China trade
- Entire communities devastated
- Promised transition support largely failed
- Political consequences still unfolding

**Offshoring and Outsourcing**
- Production moved to low-wage countries
- Supply chains stretched globally
- Corporate profits increased
- Workers in traded sectors suffered

### Technology and Concentration (2000s-Present)

New economy brought new forms of concentration:

**Platform Monopolies**
- Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple achieved dominance
- Network effects created winner-take-all markets
- Traditional antitrust seemed inadequate
- Data became new source of power

**Mergers Unchallenged**
- "Chicago School" antitrust focused only on consumer prices
- Mergers approved with minimal scrutiny
- Industries consolidated across the board
- New business formation declined

## Key Turning Points

### The 2008 Financial Crisis

The culmination of three decades of financial deregulation:

**The Collapse**
- Housing bubble burst
- Lehman Brothers failed
- Credit markets froze
- Global economy teetered

**Bailouts and Response**
- Wall Street received $700 billion bailout
- Homeowners received far less help
- No major executives prosecuted
- "Too big to fail" banks got bigger

**Aftermath**
- Slowest recovery since Great Depression
- Wealth destroyed for middle class; quickly recovered for wealthy
- Inequality accelerated after crisis
- Political anger fueled populism on left and right

### Occupy Wall Street (2011)

Changed the conversation about inequality:

- "We are the 99%" framing entered public discourse
- Inequality became mainstream political issue
- Progressive economic ideas gained visibility
- Though short-lived, shifted national debate

### The Pandemic (2020-2021)

Exposed and accelerated existing trends:

- Essential workers risked lives for poverty wages
- Billionaire wealth surged during crisis
- Small businesses failed while big corporations thrived
- Government showed it could act when motivated
- Brief moment of worker power quickly faded

## Lessons from the Past

### What Works

**Strong Labor Movements**
- The period of greatest shared prosperity (1940s-1970s) coincided with highest union density
- Worker bargaining power translated directly to wage gains
- Decline of unions correlates with stagnation of wages

**Progressive Taxation**
- High marginal rates did not prevent strong economic growth
- Revenue funded public investment that benefited all
- Current low rates for capital income exacerbate inequality

**Robust Antitrust**
- Active enforcement kept markets competitive
- Small business could compete against larger rivals
- Concentration correlates with reduced dynamism

**Financial Regulation**
- Boring banking meant stable banking
- Separation of functions prevented conflicts
- Deregulation led predictably to crisis

**Public Investment**
- GI Bill, highways, research funding drove growth
- Investment in people and infrastructure paid returns
- Disinvestment has long-term costs

### What Doesn't Work

**Trickle-Down Economics**
- Tax cuts for wealthy have not lifted all boats
- Benefits concentrated at top rather than spreading
- Deficits used to justify cutting programs for everyone else

**Deregulation Without Accountability**
- Markets need rules to function fairly
- Without oversight, corporate power grows unchecked
- Financial deregulation created crisis

**Trade Without Transition**
- Gains from trade went to capital, costs to labor
- Promised adjustment assistance was inadequate
- Affected communities never recovered

**Bailouts Without Reform**
- 2008 bailout saved system but not accountability
- Moral hazard encouraged more risk-taking
- Banks now bigger than before crisis

### Patterns That Repeat

1. **Concentration leads to political power**: Economic monopolies become political monopolies, shaping rules in their favor

2. **Crisis creates opportunity for change**: New Deal, Dodd-Frank, pandemic response all followed crises

3. **Gains can be reversed**: Postwar progress was systematically dismantled over decades

4. **Ideology shapes policy**: The shift from New Deal consensus to neoliberal consensus shows ideas matter

5. **Organizing works**: Both business (1970s) and labor (1930s) used organization to achieve goals
