# Root Causes of Regulatory Failure

## Overview

The deregulation that led to the 2008 crisis and ongoing financial abuses did not happen by accident. It resulted from deliberate campaigns by the financial industry to reshape the rules in their favor, enabled by ideological shifts, political dynamics, and structural features of American governance that make capture nearly inevitable without sustained countervailing pressure.

## The Political Economy of Deregulation

### Money in Politics

The financial sector is the largest source of campaign contributions:

| Sector | Total Contributions (2020 Cycle) | Rank |
|--------|--------------------------------|------|
| Finance/Insurance/Real Estate | $2.9 billion | 1st |
| Health | $1.1 billion | 2nd |
| Communications/Electronics | $867 million | 3rd |
| Energy/Natural Resources | $408 million | 4th |

**Specific Examples:**

- Citigroup spent $100+ million lobbying for Glass-Steagall repeal
- Financial sector gave $1.7 billion in federal contributions (1998-2008)
- Top recipients on key committees received 3x average contributions
- After voting to deregulate derivatives, Phil Gramm became UBS Vice Chairman

### The Revolving Door

The movement of personnel between regulators and industry creates:

- Regulators who anticipate future employment avoid aggressive enforcement
- Industry insiders who become regulators bring industry perspectives
- Institutional knowledge about regulatory weak points
- Personal relationships that soften adversarial dynamics

**Key Revolving Door Patterns:**

| Direction | Example | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Regulator → Industry | Eric Holder → Covington & Burling | "Too big to jail" policy |
| Industry → Regulator | Hank Paulson (Goldman) → Treasury | Bailout prioritized Wall Street |
| Regulator → Industry → Regulator | Gary Gensler | More complex; some reformed |
| Congressional staff → Lobbying | 50%+ of financial committee staff | Policy expertise captured |

### Lobbying Infrastructure

The financial industry maintains a permanent army of lobbyists:

- 5 lobbyists per member of Congress focused on financial regulation
- $500+ million annual lobbying spending
- Former regulators and staff as "strategic advisors"
- Dominance of comment letter processes (10:1 industry vs. public interest)

## Ideological Capture

### The Efficient Markets Hypothesis

Academic finance provided intellectual justification for deregulation:

**Core Claims:**

- Markets process information efficiently
- Prices reflect true value
- Regulation interferes with efficient outcomes
- Sophisticated parties don't need protection

**Reality:**

- Markets exhibit bubbles, herding, and irrational behavior
- Information asymmetries are pervasive
- "Sophisticated parties" like pension funds were defrauded
- Unregulated markets produced catastrophic instability

### Regulatory Philosophy Shift

| Era | Dominant Philosophy | Assumption |
|-----|--------------------| ------------|
| 1930s-1970s | Skepticism of markets | Markets fail without oversight |
| 1980s-2000s | Market fundamentalism | Markets self-correct, regulation harmful |
| Post-2008 | Partial return to skepticism | Incomplete recognition of market failures |

### The Chicago School's Influence

Ideas from the University of Chicago economics department shaped deregulation:

- Deregulation is always efficiency-enhancing
- Transaction costs analysis justified complex derivatives
- "Law and economics" movement influenced judges
- Cost-benefit analysis weighted against regulation

These ideas were promoted through:

- Funded academic positions
- Judicial education programs
- Think tank research
- Media commentary

## Structural Factors

### Fragmented Regulation

The U.S. financial regulatory system is uniquely fragmented:

| Regulator | Primary Jurisdiction |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Federal Reserve | Bank holding companies, monetary policy |
| OCC | National banks |
| FDIC | State banks, deposit insurance |
| SEC | Securities, investment advisers |
| CFTC | Derivatives, commodities |
| CFPB | Consumer financial products |
| State regulators | Insurance, state-chartered banks, money transmitters |
| FHFA | Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac |

**Problems with Fragmentation:**

- Regulatory arbitrage: Institutions choose most favorable regulator
- Gaps: Activities fall between regulatory jurisdictions
- Inconsistency: Same products regulated differently
- Lobbying leverage: Industry can play regulators against each other
- Information silos: No comprehensive systemic view

### Regulatory Competition

Before 2008, regulators competed for "clients":

- OCC and OTS competed to attract bank charters
- Revenue came from regulated institutions' fees
- Light-touch regulation attracted more institutions
- Race to the bottom in supervision and enforcement

### Underfunding

Regulators lack resources to match industry:

| Comparison | SEC Staff | Wall Street Employees |
|------------|----------|----------------------|
| 2000 | 3,235 | 191,000 |
| 2007 | 3,477 | 191,000 |
| 2023 | 4,500 | 195,000 |

| Comparison | SEC Budget | JPMorgan Legal/Compliance Budget |
|------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 2023 | $2.2 billion | Estimated $3+ billion |

### Information Asymmetry

Regulators are systematically outmatched:

- Industry has better data on its own activities
- Complex financial products are designed to be opaque
- Rapid innovation outpaces regulatory understanding
- Industry can hire away top regulatory talent

## Political Dynamics

### Bipartisan Consensus for Deregulation

Both parties supported financial deregulation:

**Democratic Support:**

- Clinton administration championed Glass-Steagall repeal
- Robert Rubin and Larry Summers led deregulation effort
- Financial sector became major Democratic donor base
- "New Democrats" embraced market-friendly policies

**Republican Support:**

- Ideological commitment to deregulation
- Phil Gramm sponsored key deregulatory legislation
- George W. Bush administration reduced enforcement
- Industry contributions funded Republican campaigns

### No Organized Countervailing Force

Unlike industries facing consumer advocacy, financial regulation lacked:

- No equivalent to consumer product safety movement
- Victims of financial abuse are dispersed
- Complexity obscures understanding of harm
- Benefits of deregulation are concentrated (industry), costs diffuse (public)

### Short-Termism

Political incentives work against financial stability:

- Crises are infrequent; benefits of prevention are invisible
- Deregulation produces immediate profits; costs are delayed
- Politicians leave office before consequences materialize
- "This time is different" reasoning dismisses historical warnings

## Industry Strategy

### Manufacturing Uncertainty

The industry deploys tactics parallel to tobacco and climate denial:

1. **Fund contrary research**: Academic papers questioning regulation
2. **Emphasize uncertainty**: "We can't know if regulation works"
3. **Propose alternatives**: Self-regulation, voluntary codes
4. **Delay tactics**: Request more study, challenge processes
5. **Incremental erosion**: Small changes that cumulatively weaken rules

### Regulatory Arbitrage

When regulations apply:

- Move activities to unregulated subsidiaries
- Restructure transactions to fall outside rules
- Relocate to jurisdictions with weaker oversight
- Create new products that technically avoid regulations

### Litigation Strategy

Industry uses courts to:

- Challenge regulations on cost-benefit grounds
- Delay implementation through procedural challenges
- Create uncertainty that chills enforcement
- Establish precedents limiting regulatory authority

### Coalition Building

Industry builds alliances to oppose regulation:

- Chamber of Commerce amplifies industry positions
- Small banks used as human shields against rules targeting megabanks
- "Job creation" rhetoric appeals to labor concerns
- "Access to credit" framing appeals to consumer advocates

## Cultural Factors

### Wall Street Prestige

The financial sector has captured cultural imagination:

- Top graduates from elite schools flock to finance
- Wealth = wisdom assumption pervades policy debates
- Financial executives treated as experts on all economic matters
- "What's good for Wall Street is good for America" narrative

### Normalization of Practices

Practices that would be seen as scandalous elsewhere are normalized:

- Executive compensation reaching $100M+ annually
- Fees extracting wealth from retail customers
- Conflicts of interest in investment advice
- Leveraged speculation with implicit government backstop

### Erosion of Ethical Norms

Industry surveys reveal:

| Survey Finding | Percentage |
|----------------|-----------|
| "Unethical or illegal conduct is necessary for success" | 24% |
| "Aware of wrongdoing in the workplace" | 26% |
| Would engage in insider trading if unlikely to be caught | 28% |
| "Financial services professionals put their own interests ahead of clients" | 53% (public view) |

## Conclusion: Systemic Capture

The root cause of regulatory failure is systemic, not personal. Individual regulators may be well-intentioned, but they operate within structures that systematically favor industry interests:

1. **Resources**: Industry has more money, staff, data, and expertise
2. **Incentives**: Career incentives favor accommodation over confrontation
3. **Information**: Industry controls information about its own activities
4. **Politics**: Both parties depend on industry campaign contributions
5. **Ideology**: Dominant economic thinking favors deregulation
6. **Structure**: Fragmented regulation enables arbitrage and capture

Reform requires not just new rules but new structures that alter these underlying dynamics. Tinkering at the margins cannot overcome forces this deeply entrenched.
