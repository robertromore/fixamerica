## International Comparison

| Issue | U.S. Approach | European Approach | UK Approach |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Bank structure | No separation requirement | Ring-fencing in some countries | Ring-fencing required |
| Capital requirements | Basel III implementation | Basel III implementation | Basel III implementation |
| Consumer protection | CFPB (agency) | Varies by country | FCA conduct regulation |
| Derivatives | Central clearing, swap execution | EMIR clearing requirements | UK EMIR |
| Crypto | Enforcement-led, no comprehensive law | MiCA comprehensive framework | Evolving framework |
| Climate risk | Contested disclosure rules | Mandatory disclosures, taxonomy | Climate stress tests |

## Gaps in Current Framework

### Structural Vulnerabilities

1. **Fragmented Regulation**: Multiple agencies with overlapping/conflicting mandates
2. **Regulatory Arbitrage**: Activities shift to less regulated entities
3. **Shadow Banking Growth**: Nonbank lending largely unregulated
4. **Too Big to Fail Persists**: Largest banks even larger
5. **Enforcement Resource Gap**: Regulators outmatched by industry

### Emerging Risks

1. **Private Credit Opacity**: Rapid growth with minimal oversight
2. **Crypto Volatility**: Unclear regulatory framework
3. **Climate Transition**: Physical and transition risks not addressed
4. **Leveraged Lending**: CLO market approaching pre-crisis levels
5. **AI in Finance**: Algorithmic trading and lending raise new issues

### Political Constraints

1. **Industry Lobbying**: Continuous pressure to weaken rules
2. **Judicial Hostility**: Courts limiting agency authority
3. **Congressional Gridlock**: No significant reform legislation
4. **Revolving Door**: Personnel movement undermines independence

## Conclusion

The current regulatory framework is stronger than the pre-2008 regime but weaker than it was before 2017 rollbacks. Significant gaps remain, particularly in nonbank oversight, private credit, and structural reform. The system remains vulnerable to the same dynamics that produced the last crisis—regulatory arbitrage, political capture, and the ever-present tension between financial innovation and consumer protection.
