# Reform Solutions for Financial Regulation

## Overview

Effective financial reform requires addressing both the immediate symptoms of regulatory failure and the underlying dynamics that produce capture and instability. This chapter presents a comprehensive reform agenda, from structural changes to targeted interventions, drawing on evidence from the pre-deregulation era, international examples, and academic research.

## Structural Reform

### Restore Glass-Steagall Separation

**The Core Principle:**
Institutions that hold federally insured deposits should not engage in speculative trading or investment banking activities. The combination creates conflicts of interest, moral hazard, and systemic risk.

**Implementation:**
- Prohibit FDIC-insured banks from securities underwriting and dealing
- Prohibit FDIC-insured banks from derivatives dealing (beyond hedging)
- Prohibit FDIC-insured banks from proprietary trading
- Prohibit affiliation between commercial banks and investment banks
- Five-year transition period for divestiture

**Expected Benefits:**
- Eliminates implicit government subsidy for speculation
- Reduces interconnection and contagion risk
- Restores traditional lending focus
- Simplifies regulation and supervision

**Evidence:**
- 1933-1999: No systemic banking crises
- Canada (more separation): Avoided 2008 crisis
- Academic studies confirm mixing increased risk

### Break Up Too-Big-to-Fail Banks

**The Problem:**
Banks deemed "too big to fail" receive implicit government guarantees, creating moral hazard and competitive advantages. They also wield disproportionate political influence.

**Implementation:**
- Hard cap on bank size (e.g., 3% of GDP or $700 billion in assets)
- Graduated capital requirements that make size costly
- Mandatory divestiture for banks exceeding limits
- Prohibition on future mergers that would create TBTF institutions

**Expected Benefits:**
- Eliminates TBTF implicit guarantee
- Reduces systemic risk
- Increases competition
- Reduces political power concentration

**Evidence:**
- IMF estimates TBTF subsidy at $100+ billion annually
- Smaller banks demonstrate comparable efficiency
- Concentrated banking systems show higher crisis frequency

### Unified Regulation

**The Problem:**
Fragmented regulation enables regulatory arbitrage and creates gaps in oversight.

**Options:**

| Model | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Single regulator | One agency for all financial regulation | UK (pre-2013) |
| Twin peaks | Separate prudential and conduct regulators | Australia |
| Functional consolidation | Consolidate by function, not charter | Academic proposals |

**Recommended Approach:**
- Merge OCC, FDIC supervision, and Fed bank supervision into single prudential regulator
- Maintain CFPB for conduct/consumer protection
- Merge SEC and CFTC for securities and derivatives
- FSOC for macro-prudential coordination

## Consumer Protection

### Strengthen the CFPB

**The Problem:**
The CFPB has been subject to political attacks, funding challenges, and leadership changes that undermine its mission.

**Implementation:**
- Statutory funding floor (not subject to appropriations)
- For-cause removal protection for Director (if constitutional)
- Expanded examination authority over fintech
- Explicit authority over data brokers and AI lending

**Priority Rules:**
- Cap payday loan interest at 36% APR (military rate)
- Prohibit overdraft fees exceeding actual transaction
- Require plain-language disclosures
- Mandate servicer duty to modify distressed loans

### Postal Banking

**The Problem:**
40 million Americans are unbanked or underbanked, leaving them vulnerable to predatory alternatives.

**Implementation:**
- Authorize USPS to offer basic banking services
- Checking and savings accounts
- Small-dollar lending at cost-plus pricing
- Bill payment and check cashing
- No credit offerings (avoid federal lending decisions)

**Expected Benefits:**
- Universal access to basic banking
- Competition for predatory lenders
- Leverage existing post office network
- Revenue diversification for USPS

### Fiduciary Duty for All Advice

**The Problem:**
Broker-dealers can legally recommend products that benefit them, not clients.

**Implementation:**
- Uniform fiduciary standard for all investment advice
- Apply to broker-dealers, insurance agents, bank representatives
- Eliminate "suitability" lesser standard
- Strengthen enforcement and private right of action

## Derivatives and Shadow Banking

### Close the Derivatives Loopholes

**The Problem:**
While Dodd-Frank required central clearing for most swaps, exemptions and end-user carve-outs create vulnerabilities.

**Implementation:**
- Eliminate inter-affiliate transaction exemptions
- Expand clearing requirements to all standardized derivatives
- Increase margin requirements for uncleared swaps
- Position limits on speculative derivatives
- Transaction tax on derivative trades (see below)

### Regulate Shadow Banking

**The Problem:**
Nonbank lenders, money market funds, and other shadow banks pose systemic risks without prudential oversight.

**Implementation:**
- Capital requirements for nonbank mortgage lenders
- Liquidity requirements for money market funds (or convert to floating NAV)
- Margin lending oversight expansion
- Private credit fund disclosure and stress testing
- FSOC designation authority for nonbank SIFIs (restore)

## Accountability and Enforcement

### Criminal Prosecution of Individuals

**The Problem:**
Corporate fines without individual accountability provide insufficient deterrent.

**Implementation:**
- Require DOJ to document why no individual prosecution
- Enhanced resources for financial fraud prosecution
- Whistleblower protections and rewards expansion
- Longer statutes of limitation for financial fraud
- Revive Yates Memo requiring individual focus

### Clawback Executive Compensation

**The Problem:**
Executives retain massive compensation even when their institutions require bailouts or fail.

**Implementation:**
- Mandatory clawback for executives of failed or bailed-out institutions
- Extend lookback period to 5-7 years
- Apply to all forms of compensation (deferred, stock, bonuses)
- Cover both individual and institution-wide failures

### Strengthen SEC and CFTC

**Current Resource Gap:**

| Agency | Budget Request | Industry Compliance Spending |
|--------|---------------|------------------------------|
| SEC | $2.4 billion | $40+ billion industry-wide |
| CFTC | $400 million | $10+ billion industry-wide |

**Implementation:**
- Double SEC and CFTC budgets
- Self-funding from industry fees
- Enhanced technology and data analytics
- Competitive pay to reduce talent drain

## Credit Rating Agency Reform

### The Problem

Rating agencies are paid by issuers they rate, creating inherent conflicts.

### Solutions

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| Investor-pays model | Investors pay for ratings | Aligns incentives | Free-rider problem |
| Public utility | Government or quasi-public raters | Eliminates conflict | Political influence |
| Random assignment | Randomly assign among approved raters | Reduces shopping | May reduce quality |
| Eliminate references | Remove ratings from regulation | Market discipline | Information loss |

**Recommended:** Hybrid approach:
- Random assignment for initial rating
- Investor-funded independent credit assessment
- Remove ratings from capital requirements (replace with internal models + disclosure)
- Liability for grossly negligent ratings

## Cryptocurrency and Fintech

### Comprehensive Digital Asset Framework

**Current Gap:**
Regulatory uncertainty creates risks for consumers and advantages for bad actors.

**Implementation:**
- Clear jurisdictional lines between SEC and CFTC
- Registration requirements for all crypto intermediaries
- Stablecoin bank-like regulation (reserves, capital)
- Consumer protection rules for retail crypto
- Prohibition on bank investments in volatile crypto

### Fintech Charter

**The Debate:**
Should fintech companies get bank charters without full bank regulation?

**Recommended Approach:**
- Full bank regulation for any entity accepting deposits
- Payments-only charter with limited activities
- CFPB jurisdiction over all consumer fintech
- State coordination for lending fintech

## Private Equity and Hedge Fund Oversight

### Enhanced Disclosure

**Implementation:**
- Portfolio company leverage disclosure
- Fee and expense transparency
- Performance reporting standards
- Political contribution disclosure

### Carried Interest Tax Reform

**The Problem:**
Private equity profits taxed as capital gains (20%) rather than income (37%).

**Implementation:**
- Tax carried interest as ordinary income
- Apply to all investment manager incentive compensation
- Close recharacterization loopholes

### Leverage Limits

**Implementation:**
- Cap leverage at portfolio companies
- Restrict dividend recapitalizations
- Limit use of debt for acquisitions of essential services (hospitals, nursing homes)

## Financial Transaction Tax

### Overview

A small tax on financial transactions can:
- Reduce high-frequency speculation
- Generate substantial revenue
- Fund regulatory capacity
- Discourage excessive trading

### Implementation

| Transaction Type | Proposed Rate | Revenue Estimate |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Stock trades | 0.1% | $50-100 billion/year |
| Bond trades | 0.01% | $20-40 billion/year |
| Derivatives | 0.01% of notional | $30-60 billion/year |

### Precedents

- UK stamp duty: 0.5% on stocks
- EU FTT proposals: 0.1% stocks, 0.01% derivatives
- Pre-1966 U.S. had transaction taxes

## Bank Merger Reform

### The Problem

Decades of consolidation have reduced competition and created TBTF institutions.

### Implementation

- Presumptive denial for mergers creating banks over $100 billion
- Enhanced community benefit requirements
- Extended public comment periods
- Post-merger monitoring and divestitures if conditions not met
- Climate risk assessment in merger review

## Prevention and Early Warning

### Living Wills That Work

**Implementation:**
- Annual resolution plans
- Credible and not "aspirational"
- Automatic restrictions if plans inadequate
- Regular testing of resolution procedures

### Enhanced Stress Testing

**Implementation:**
- More severe adverse scenarios
- Include climate transition scenarios
- Annual testing for all large institutions
- Public disclosure of results

### Macroprudential Tools

**Implementation:**
- Counter-cyclical capital buffers (automatic)
- Loan-to-value limits (housing)
- Debt-to-income limits (housing)
- Sectoral capital requirements
