# The Problem Exposed: Failures of Financial Deregulation

## The 2008 Financial Crisis: A Preventable Catastrophe

The 2008 financial crisis was not a natural disaster or an unforeseeable "black swan" event. It was the predictable result of deliberate policy choices that dismantled the regulatory framework protecting Americans from financial predation and systemic risk.

## How the System Failed

### The Subprime Mortgage Machine

The crisis originated in the housing market, where deregulation created a toxic chain:

```
Mortgage Brokers → Banks → Investment Banks → Investors
      ↓               ↓           ↓              ↓
  (No oversight)  (Securitization) (Leverage)  (Mispriced risk)
```

**Step 1: Predatory Origination**
- Mortgage brokers earned fees for volume, not quality
- "No-doc" and "liar loans" required no income verification
- Adjustable rates with teaser periods masked true costs
- Regulators at OCC and OTS preempted state consumer protection laws

**Step 2: Securitization Without Accountability**
- Banks sold mortgages immediately, eliminating stake in performance
- "Originate to distribute" model severed traditional lending relationships
- Mortgage-backed securities mixed toxic loans with legitimate ones

**Step 3: Rating Agency Failure**
- Moody's, S&P, and Fitch rated junk securities as AAA
- Issuers paid for ratings, creating conflict of interest
- Complex models used flawed assumptions about default correlation
- $3.2 trillion in securities would be downgraded

**Step 4: Derivative Amplification**
- Credit default swaps "insured" securities without capital reserves
- AIG wrote $440 billion in CDS contracts with no ability to pay claims
- Synthetic CDOs created multiple bets on the same underlying mortgages
- Total derivative exposure reached $600+ trillion notional value

**Step 5: Leverage Without Limits**
- 2004 SEC rule change allowed 30:1+ leverage at investment banks
- Banks held $1 of capital for every $30+ of risk
- Any price decline wiped out capital cushion

## Specific Regulatory Failures

### The Federal Reserve

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Refused to use authority to regulate mortgage lending under HOEPA | Predatory loans proliferated |
| Kept interest rates artificially low 2002-2004 | Fueled housing bubble |
| Dismissed housing bubble warnings | No preemptive action |
| Failed to supervise bank holding companies effectively | Excessive risk-taking |

### The SEC

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| 2004 net capital rule exemption | Investment banks overleveraged |
| Inadequate oversight of broker-dealers | Widespread fraud undetected |
| Failed to act on Madoff warnings | $65 billion Ponzi scheme |
| Understaffed and outmatched | Captured by industry |

### The OCC and OTS

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Preempted state predatory lending laws | Stripped consumer protections |
| Competed for bank "clients" with light-touch regulation | Race to the bottom |
| OTS oversight of AIG, Countrywide, IndyMac, WaMu | All failed or required bailout |
| "Deference" to bank risk management | Rubber-stamped reckless practices |

### Congress

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Gramm-Leach-Bliley (Glass-Steagall repeal) | Enabled megabank conglomerates |
| Commodity Futures Modernization Act | Unregulated derivatives |
| Blocking Brooksley Born's derivatives regulation | CDS market exploded |
| Defunding SEC and other regulators | Inadequate enforcement capacity |

## The Warnings That Were Ignored

### Brooksley Born and Derivatives

In 1998, CFTC Chair Brooksley Born proposed regulating over-the-counter derivatives. The response:

- Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, and SEC Chair Arthur Levitt pressured her to withdraw
- Congress passed legislation prohibiting CFTC from regulating derivatives
- Born resigned; the unregulated derivatives market grew to $600+ trillion
- Ten years later, unregulated derivatives nearly destroyed the global economy

### FBI Mortgage Fraud Warnings

In 2004, the FBI publicly warned of an "epidemic" of mortgage fraud that could cause a financial crisis. The response:

- No significant increase in enforcement resources
- No policy changes to address predatory lending
- Warnings were dismissed as alarmist

### Academic and Analyst Warnings

Multiple economists and analysts predicted the crisis:

| Person | Warning | Year |
|--------|---------|------|
| Dean Baker | Housing bubble would burst, recession would follow | 2002 |
| Robert Shiller | Housing prices showed "irrational exuberance" | 2005 |
| Nouriel Roubini | Predicted housing-led recession and financial crisis | 2006 |
| Michael Burry | Bet against subprime securities | 2005 |

These warnings were dismissed because:
- They contradicted the industry's interest in continued profits
- Regulators had adopted the ideology of market self-correction
- Political pressure prevented acknowledging problems before the election

## The Bailout: Socializing Losses

When the system collapsed, the response prioritized financial institutions over homeowners:

### What Wall Street Got

| Program | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| TARP (direct capital injections) | $700 billion authorized |
| Federal Reserve lending facilities | $7.7 trillion in secret loans |
| AIG bailout | $182 billion |
| Fannie/Freddie conservatorship | $190 billion |
| FDIC guarantees | $1.5 trillion in debt guarantees |

### What Homeowners Got

| Program | Amount | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| HAMP (mortgage modification) | $50 billion allocated | Only $22 billion spent |
| Homes modified | 1.8 million | 10 million foreclosures still occurred |
| Principal reduction | Minimal | Banks preferred foreclosure |

### The Double Standard

**For Banks:**
- Immediate, massive support
- No executives prosecuted
- Bonuses continued
- Institutions deemed "too big to fail"

**For Homeowners:**
- Means-tested programs with extensive paperwork
- Banks incentivized to delay and deny modifications
- "Moral hazard" concerns invoked to limit relief
- Millions lost homes while banks received bailouts

## Fraud Without Consequences

### Documented Wrongdoing

| Institution | Violation | Fine | Criminal Prosecutions |
|-------------|-----------|------|----------------------|
| Bank of America | Mortgage fraud, securities fraud | $76.1 billion | 0 individual executives |
| JPMorgan Chase | Mortgage fraud, money laundering | $43.7 billion | 0 individual executives |
| Citigroup | Mortgage fraud, tax violations | $19.6 billion | 0 individual executives |
| Wells Fargo | Mortgage fraud, fake accounts | $17.8 billion | 0 individual executives |
| Goldman Sachs | Securities fraud (Abacus) | $5.1 billion | 0 individual executives |

### The Holder Doctrine

Attorney General Eric Holder articulated the "too big to jail" philosophy:

> "I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy."

This represented a fundamental abandonment of the rule of law—corporations became immune from criminal prosecution due to their size and systemic importance.

### Comparison with S&L Crisis

| Metric | S&L Crisis (1980s) | 2008 Crisis |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Scale of losses | $160 billion | $22 trillion |
| Criminal referrals | 30,000+ | 0 from SEC |
| Prosecutions | 1,000+ | Fewer than 50 |
| Executives imprisoned | 800+ | 1 (Kareem Serageldin) |

## Ongoing Vulnerabilities

Despite Dodd-Frank, the financial system remains fragile:

### Too Big to Fail Is Worse

| Metric | 2008 | 2024 |
|--------|------|------|
| Top 5 banks' share of assets | 44% | 54% |
| JPMorgan assets | $1.8 trillion | $3.9 trillion |
| Derivatives at top 4 banks | $200 trillion | $234 trillion |

### Regulatory Capture Continues

- Former regulators continue to move to industry positions
- Industry groups dominate regulatory comment processes
- Enforcement resources remain inadequate
- Dodd-Frank has been partially rolled back

### New Risks Have Emerged

- Leveraged lending has reached pre-crisis levels
- CLO (Collateralized Loan Obligation) market has grown to $1 trillion
- Shadow banking (non-bank lenders) now originates most mortgages
- Cryptocurrency remains largely unregulated
- Private credit markets have exploded with minimal oversight

## Conclusion

The 2008 crisis demonstrated that financial deregulation is not a victimless policy experiment. It transferred trillions of dollars from ordinary Americans to the financial sector, destroyed millions of families' wealth, and faced no meaningful accountability. The same dynamics that caused the crisis—industry influence over regulation, perverse incentives, excessive leverage, and opacity—remain substantially in place.
