# Financial Regulation

Financial regulation encompasses the laws, rules, and oversight mechanisms designed to maintain the stability of the financial system, protect consumers from predatory practices, and prevent the concentration of economic power that undermines democratic governance. The 2008 financial crisis exposed catastrophic failures in regulatory frameworks that had been systematically weakened over decades, resulting in trillions of dollars in losses, millions of foreclosures, and a near-collapse of the global economy.
