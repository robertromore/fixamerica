## Federal Legislation

### 1. 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act

#### Purpose

To restore the separation between commercial banking and investment banking activities, reducing systemic risk and conflicts of interest.

#### Draft Text

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "21st Century Glass-Steagall Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:
    (1) The combination of commercial and investment banking activities 
        contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent 
        taxpayer bailouts.
    (2) The repeal of the Banking Act of 1933 (Glass-Steagall) by the 
        Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 eliminated structural protections 
        that had maintained financial stability for over six decades.
    (3) Institutions holding federally insured deposits receive an 
        implicit government guarantee that should not subsidize 
        speculative activities.
    (4) The Volcker Rule has proven insufficient to prevent conflicts 
        of interest and excessive risk-taking.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to—
    (1) separate traditional banking activities from speculative 
        trading and investment banking;
    (2) reduce systemic risk to the financial system;
    (3) protect taxpayers from future bailouts of speculative losses; and
    (4) eliminate conflicts of interest between commercial banking and 
        securities activities.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON AFFILIATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Effective 5 years after the date of enactment of this 
Act, a depository institution may not—
    (1) be or become an affiliate of any insurance company, securities 
        entity, or swap entity;
    (2) be in common ownership or control with any insurance company, 
        securities entity, or swap entity; or
    (3) engage in any activity that would cause such depository 
        institution to qualify as an insurance company, securities 
        entity, or swap entity.

(b) EXCEPTION FOR HEDGING.—Subsection (a) shall not prohibit a 
depository institution from—
    (1) engaging in derivatives transactions solely to hedge the 
        institution's own interest rate, foreign currency, credit, or 
        commodity exposures arising from traditional banking activities;
    (2) underwriting or dealing in obligations of the United States, 
        general obligations of States and municipalities, or obligations 
        of government-sponsored enterprises; or
    (3) purchasing securities for its own investment portfolio, 
        provided such securities are not acquired for resale.

    (1) any insured depository institution as defined in section 3 of 
        the Federal Deposit Insurance Act;

    (1) any swap dealer registered under the Commodity Exchange Act; or
    (2) any security-based swap dealer registered under the Securities 
        Exchange Act of 1934.

SEC. 5. DIVESTITURE REQUIREMENTS.

(a) TRANSITION PERIOD.—Any depository institution that, on the date of 
enactment of this Act, does not comply with section 3 shall have 5 
years from such date to come into compliance.

(b) DIVESTITURE PLAN.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, any depository institution subject to subsection (a) 
shall submit to the appropriate Federal banking agency a plan for 
divestiture that describes how the institution will come into 
compliance within the 5-year transition period.

(c) REGULATORY GUIDANCE.—Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the appropriate Federal banking agencies shall

        such violation, whichever is greater.

(b) CHARTER REVOCATION.—The appropriate Federal banking agency may 
revoke the charter of any depository institution that fails to come 
into compliance with section 3 within the 5-year transition period.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect immediately upon enactment.
```

#### Explanation

**Key Features:**
- Restores the core Glass-Steagall separation between commercial and investment banking
- Five-year transition period allows orderly divestiture
- Preserves legitimate hedging activities for bank risk management
- Substantial penalties for non-compliance

**Differences from Original Glass-Steagall:**
- Explicitly covers derivatives and swap activities
- Covers bank holding company structures
- Modernized definitions for current market structure

#### Constitutional Considerations

The legislation is within Congress's power under the Commerce Clause to regulate banking and financial activities. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld Congress's authority to structure and regulate the banking system.

#### Anticipated Challenges

1. **Industry Arguments:** Banks will argue separation is unnecessary, costly, and would harm competitiveness
2. **Implementation:** Complex corporate structures will require careful regulatory guidance
3. **Transition:** Five years may be insufficient for largest institutions

#### Refinements

Consider adding:
- Extended transition for institutions above $1 trillion
- Specific guidance on valuation of divested entities
- Employee protection provisions during restructuring

### 2. Wall Street Tax Act

#### Purpose

To impose a modest tax on financial transactions, reducing excessive speculation and generating revenue for regulatory enforcement and public investment.

#### Draft Text

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Wall Street Tax Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds the following:
    (1) High-frequency trading and excessive speculation contribute to 
        market volatility without adding productive value to the economy.
    (2) The financial sector has grown from 3 percent of GDP in the 
        1950s to over 8 percent today, directing resources toward 
        speculation rather than productive investment.
    (3) Financial transaction taxes are successfully employed in the 
        United Kingdom, France, Italy, and other developed economies.
    (4) Revenue from such taxes can fund regulatory enforcement, 
        infrastructure investment, and deficit reduction.

SEC. 3. IMPOSITION OF TAX ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 36 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subchapter:

"SUBCHAPTER E—TAX ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

"SEC. 4475. TAX ON SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS.

"(a) IMPOSITION OF TAX.—There is hereby imposed a tax on each 
covered transaction with respect to any security.

"(b) COVERED TRANSACTION.—For purposes of this section, the term 
'covered transaction' means—
    "(1) any purchase of a security if—
        "(A) such purchase occurs on a trading facility located in the 
            United States; or
        "(B) the purchaser or seller is a United States person; and
    "(2) any other transaction in a security the economic substance of 
        which is equivalent to a purchase.

"(c) TAX RATES.—
    "(1) STOCKS.—In the case of a covered transaction with respect to 
        a stock, the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be equal to 
        0.1 percent of the value of such transaction.
    "(2) BONDS.—In the case of a covered transaction with respect to a 
        bond or other debt instrument, the tax imposed by subsection 
        (a) shall be equal to 0.01 percent of the value of such 
        transaction.
    "(3) DERIVATIVES.—In the case of a covered transaction with respect 
        to a derivative, the tax imposed by subsection (a) shall be 
        equal to 0.01 percent of the notional principal amount of such 
        derivative.

"(d) EXCEPTIONS.—
    "(1) INITIAL ISSUANCE.—The tax imposed by subsection (a) shall not 
        apply to the initial issuance of any security.
    "(2) TAX-ADVANTAGED RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.—The tax imposed by 
        subsection (a) shall not apply to any transaction by or on 
        behalf of—
        "(A) any qualified retirement plan as defined in section 4974(c);
        "(B) any individual retirement account or annuity; or
        "(C) any State or local government retirement plan.
    "(3) MARKET MAKERS.—The Secretary may by regulation provide 
        reduced rates or exemptions for bona fide market-making 
        activities, provided that such reduced rates do not create 
        opportunities for tax avoidance.

"(e) LIABILITY.—
    "(1) IN GENERAL.—The tax imposed by this section shall be paid by 
        the trading facility or broker through which the transaction 
        is executed.
    "(2) JOINT LIABILITY.—Each party to the transaction shall be 
        jointly and severally liable for the tax if not paid by the 
        trading facility or broker.

"SEC. 4476. ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES.

"(a) IN GENERAL.—If the Secretary determines that a transaction or 
series of transactions has been structured with a principal purpose 
of avoiding the tax imposed by section 4475, such transaction or 
transactions shall be recharacterized and taxed according to their 
economic substance.

"(b) OFFSHORE TRANSACTIONS.—Any transaction that would be subject to 
tax under section 4475 if executed in the United States shall be 
subject to such tax if executed offshore by or on behalf of a United 
States person."

(b) CLERICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of subchapters for chapter 36 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the 
following:

    "SUBCHAPTER E. TAX ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS"

SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF REVENUES.

Revenues collected pursuant to this Act shall be deposited in the 
general fund of the Treasury and shall be available for—
    (a) appropriation to the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
        Commodity Futures Trading Commission for enhanced enforcement 
        and market surveillance (first $500,000,000 annually);
    (b) appropriation to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
        (next $200,000,000 annually); and
    (c) general purposes.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

The amendments made by this Act shall apply to transactions occurring 
after the date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this 
Act.
```

#### Explanation

**Key Features:**
- Tax rates are low enough to not impede legitimate transactions
- Higher rate on stocks reflects higher speculation concerns
- Retirement savings explicitly exempted
- Anti-avoidance provisions prevent offshore structuring
- Dedicated funding for regulatory agencies

**Revenue Estimate:**
- Stock transactions: $50-80 billion annually
- Bond transactions: $20-40 billion annually
- Derivative transactions: $30-50 billion annually
- Total: $100-170 billion annually

#### Constitutional Considerations

Congress has broad taxing authority under Article I, Section 8. Financial transaction taxes do not raise significant constitutional issues.

### 3. Predatory Lending Prevention Act

#### Purpose

To establish a national usury limit, prohibit predatory lending practices, and protect consumers from exploitative financial products.

#### Draft Text

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Predatory Lending Prevention Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds the following:
    (1) Payday loans, auto title loans, and similar products typically 
        carry annual percentage rates of 300 to 500 percent.
    (2) These products trap borrowers in cycles of debt, with the 
        average payday borrower taking 8 loans per year.
    (3) Predatory lending extracts an estimated $9 billion annually 
        from low-income Americans.
    (4) The Military Lending Act successfully protects servicemembers 
        with a 36 percent rate cap.
    (5) All Americans deserve the same protection from predatory 
        lending as military servicemembers.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL USURY LIMIT.

(a) RATE CAP.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including 
section 521 of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary 
Control Act of 1980 (12 U.S.C. 1831d) and section 85 of the National 
Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 85), no creditor may impose an annual percentage 
rate greater than 36 percent with respect to any extension of consumer 
credit.

(b) CALCULATION OF APR.—For purposes of this section, the annual 
percentage rate shall be calculated in accordance with regulations 
promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and shall 
include—
    (1) all interest;
    (2) all fees charged in connection with the extension of credit, 
        including—
        (A) application fees;
        (B) origination fees;
        (C) credit insurance premiums;
        (D) debt cancellation fees;
        (E) fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the 
            credit; and
        (F) late fees and prepayment penalties; and
    (3) any other charge or fee imposed as a condition of extending 
        credit.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITED PRACTICES.

(a) LOAN FLIPPING.—No creditor may refinance a consumer credit 
transaction if, within the previous 60 days, the creditor or an 
affiliated creditor extended credit to the same borrower, unless the 
refinancing is in the borrower's interest.

(b) MANDATORY ARBITRATION.—No creditor may require, as a condition 
of extending consumer credit, that the borrower agree to submit any 
dispute to binding arbitration.

(c) BALLOON PAYMENTS.—No creditor may require any balloon payment 
in connection with a consumer credit transaction with a term of less 
than 5 years.

(d) WAGE ASSIGNMENTS.—No creditor may require, as a condition of 
extending consumer credit, an assignment of wages.

(e) UNAUTHORIZED DEBITING.—No creditor may debit a borrower's bank 
account for repayment without prior authorization for each specific 
payment.

(f) VEHICLE DISABLING.—No creditor may require installation of or 
use a vehicle disabling device or GPS tracking device as a condition 
of extending credit for a motor vehicle.

SEC. 5. ABILITY TO REPAY.

(a) IN GENERAL.—No creditor may extend consumer credit unless the 
creditor makes a reasonable determination, based on verified and 
documented information, that the consumer has the ability to repay 
the credit obligation.

(b) MINIMUM STANDARDS.—In making the determination required by 
subsection (a), the creditor shall at minimum—
    (1) obtain and verify the consumer's income or assets;
    (2) obtain and verify the consumer's current debt obligations;
    (3) determine that the consumer has sufficient residual income 
        to meet basic living expenses while repaying the credit 
        obligation; and
    (4) document the basis for the determination in the credit file.

SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) CFPB ENFORCEMENT.—The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau shall 
have authority to enforce this Act.

(b) STATE ENFORCEMENT.—The attorney general of any State may bring 
an action in the name of the State to enforce this Act.

(c) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.—Any person injured by a violation of 
this Act may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction 
for—
    (1) actual damages;
    (2) statutory damages of not less than $5,000 per violation;
    (3) punitive damages;
    (4) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; and
    (5) any other appropriate relief.

(d) CRIMINAL PENALTIES.—Any person who willfully and knowingly 
violates section 3 or 4 of this Act shall be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned 
not more than 1 year, or both.

SEC. 7. PREEMPTION.

(a) NO PREEMPTION OF STRONGER STATE LAWS.—This Act shall not be 
construed to preempt any State law that provides greater protection 
to consumers than is provided by this Act.

(b) PREEMPTION OF WEAKER STATE LAWS.—This Act shall preempt any 
State law that permits annual percentage rates greater than 36 
percent.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment.
```

#### Explanation

**Key Features:**
- 36% APR cap (same as Military Lending Act)
- Comprehensive calculation of APR including all fees
- Prohibited practices address common predatory techniques
- Ability-to-repay requirement prevents irresponsible lending
- Strong enforcement through CFPB, states, and private right of action
- Expressly preempts state laws that are weaker (not stronger)

#### Constitutional Considerations

The 36% rate cap would apply to state-chartered as well as federally-chartered institutions under Congress's Commerce Clause authority. The cap explicitly overrides existing preemption statutes that allowed banks to "export" higher rates from favorable states.

## Regulatory Framework Recommendations

### Enhanced Stress Testing (Federal Reserve)

The Federal Reserve should:
1. Increase the severity of stress scenarios to include 40%+ declines in asset values
2. Include climate transition scenarios in stress testing
3. Require annual stress tests for all banks over $100 billion
4. Publish detailed stress test results including bank-by-bank data
5. Automatically impose enhanced capital requirements on banks that perform poorly

### Living Will Enhancement (FDIC/Fed)

Living will requirements should:
1. Require annual submission (not biennial)
2. Include specific liquidity and operational continuity plans
3. Require tested resolution procedures (not just paper plans)
4. Trigger automatic restrictions if plans are inadequate
5. Include interconnection analysis for all major counterparties

### CFPB Rulemaking Priorities

1. **Overdraft Fees**: Limit to actual cost of service (approximately $3-5 per transaction)
2. **Credit Card Late Fees**: Cap at $8 (current proposal)
3. **Earned Wage Access**: Treat as credit subject to TILA disclosure
4. **Data Broker Regulation**: Require consent and accuracy standards
5. **AI/Algorithmic Lending**: Require explainability and disparate impact testing

### SEC Market Structure

1. **Payment for Order Flow**: Prohibit or heavily restrict
2. **Dark Pools**: Require meaningful price improvement
3. **Retail Execution Quality**: Enhanced disclosure requirements
4. **Private Fund Disclosure**: Quarterly fee and performance reporting
5. **Crypto Exchanges**: Require SEC registration as securities exchanges

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

- **Commerce Clause**: Congress has broad authority to regulate financial institutions and transactions
- **Taxing Power**: Financial transaction tax is well within Congress's taxing authority
- **Necessary and Proper**: Enforcement mechanisms and penalties are constitutional

### Preemption Issues

- **National Banks**: Federal law preempts most state regulation of national banks
- **State-Chartered Institutions**: States retain primary authority
- **Strategy**: Focus state laws on state-chartered institutions; seek federal legislation for national reach

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Agency Enforcement**: Primary enforcement through CFPB, SEC, banking agencies
- **State AG Authority**: Preserve parallel state enforcement
- **Private Right of Action**: Essential for practical enforcement and deterrent effect
- **Whistleblower Provisions**: Incentivize internal reporting of violations

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Charter shopping | Banks could convert to national charter to escape state usury laws | High |
| Affiliate structures | Activities prohibited to banks could be conducted through affiliates | High |
| True lender doctrine evasion | Banks could rent charters to fintech lenders | High |
| Offshore booking | Transactions could be booked through foreign subsidiaries | Medium |
| Definition gaming | Activities could be restructured to fall outside regulatory definitions | Medium |
| Fee recharacterization | Interest could be disguised as fees not included in APR | Medium |
| Tribal sovereignty lending | Lenders claim tribal sovereign immunity | Medium |
| Regulatory delay | Industry challenges could delay implementation for years | Medium |
| De minimis exceptions | Large transactions structured as multiple small ones | Low |
| Grandfathering exploitation | Existing structures preserved indefinitely | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Underfunding of regulators | Enforcement capacity insufficient | Appropriations dependence |
| Fragmented regulation | Regulatory arbitrage persists | Historical agency structure |
| Political capture | Reform reversed by subsequent administrations | Revolving door, campaign finance |
| Constitutional challenges | Litigation delays implementation | Current judicial philosophy |
| Preemption doctrine | Federal law limits state consumer protection | Supremacy Clause interpretation |
| Complexity | Industry can find workarounds faster than regulators | Information asymmetry |
| Too Big to Fail still exists | Implicit guarantees remain | Political power of megabanks |
| International coordination gap | Firms can relocate to weaker jurisdictions | Limits of U.S. jurisdiction |
| Enforcement discretion | Laws not enforced depending on administration | Executive power structure |
| Private credit growth | New risks emerge outside regulatory perimeter | Activity vs. entity regulation |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Address Charter Shopping**: Require any bank that converts from state to national charter to continue complying with state consumer protection laws for 5 years; prohibit conversion solely to evade state law.

2. **Close Affiliate Loopholes**: Define "affiliate" broadly to include any entity under common control or with significant shared revenue; apply prohibitions to entire corporate family.

3. **Strengthen True Lender Doctrine**: Codify that the entity with "predominant economic interest" in a loan is the true lender, regardless of nominal origination; apply state rate caps accordingly.

4. **Address Offshore Booking**: Apply regulations to any transaction with a U.S. counterparty or affecting U.S. markets, regardless of booking location; require booking transparency.

5. **Anti-Definition Gaming**: Grant regulators authority to treat "substantially similar" activities as covered; include catch-all provisions for economically equivalent transactions.

6. **Comprehensive APR Calculation**: Define APR to include all fees and charges, with presumptive inclusion and narrow exceptions; prohibit unbundling designed to evade rate caps.

7. **Address Tribal Lending**: Clarify that state consumer protection laws apply to all lending to state residents, regardless of claimed sovereign immunity; coordinate with tribal authorities.

8. **Expedited Judicial Review**: Establish expedited review procedures for constitutional challenges; stay orders should not automatically halt enforcement.

9. **Self-Funding for Regulators**: Ensure SEC, CFTC, and CFPB are funded through industry assessments not subject to appropriations.

10. **Living Wills with Teeth**: Require automatic structural remedies if living wills are found non-credible; give regulators authority to require divestiture.

### General Implementation Concerns

**Enforcement Resources:**
- Current regulatory budgets are inadequate for comprehensive enforcement
- Industry spends 10-20x more on compliance/evasion than regulators spend on oversight
- Technology gap leaves regulators unable to monitor high-speed trading and complex structures
- Staff turnover (revolving door) depletes institutional expertise

**Political Sustainability:**
- Reforms can be reversed by subsequent administrations
- Industry lobbying is continuous; reform advocacy is episodic
- Economic Growth Act of 2018 showed rapid erosion of Dodd-Frank
- Building durable coalitions requires sustained investment

**Coordination Challenges:**
- Multiple agencies with overlapping jurisdictions create gaps and inconsistencies
- Information sharing among agencies remains inadequate
- International coordination necessary but difficult to achieve
- State-federal coordination essential but often contentious

**Emerging Risks:**
- Private credit market growing rapidly outside regulatory perimeter
- AI in lending creates new discrimination and manipulation risks
- Climate transition poses unprecedented financial stability challenges
- Crypto/stablecoin failures show continued regulatory gaps
