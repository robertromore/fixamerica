# Historical Context of Financial Regulation

## The Pre-Regulation Era (1900-1929)

Before the Great Depression, American financial markets operated with minimal federal oversight. This laissez-faire approach produced repeated crises:

### Major Pre-Depression Crises

| Year | Crisis | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1907 | Bankers' Panic | Bank runs nationwide, J.P. Morgan personally organized bailout |
| 1920-21 | Post-WWI Recession | 500+ banks failed, deflation crisis |
| 1929 | Stock Market Crash | Beginning of Great Depression |

The 1929 crash and subsequent Depression revealed how interconnected and vulnerable the financial system had become. By 1933, nearly 10,000 banks had failed, wiping out the savings of millions of Americans.

## The New Deal Regulatory Framework (1933-1980)

### Glass-Steagall Act (1933)

The Banking Act of 1933, commonly known as Glass-Steagall, established fundamental structural reforms:

**Key Provisions:**
- **Separation of commercial and investment banking**: Banks holding deposits could not engage in securities underwriting or trading
- **FDIC creation**: Federal deposit insurance protected ordinary savers
- **Regulation Q**: Interest rate caps prevented destructive competition for deposits
- **Prohibited bank affiliations**: Commercial banks could not affiliate with securities firms

**Rationale:** The mixing of commercial and investment banking had created conflicts of interest where banks pushed risky securities on depositors and used deposit funds for speculation. Separation eliminated these conflicts.

### Securities Acts (1933-1934)

- **Securities Act of 1933**: Required disclosure of material information for securities offerings
- **Securities Exchange Act of 1934**: Created the SEC, regulated secondary trading, prohibited manipulation

### Bank Holding Company Act (1956)

Restricted bank holding companies from engaging in non-banking activities, preventing the conglomeration that had contributed to the 1929 crash.

### Results of New Deal Regulation

| Metric | Pre-Regulation (1900-1933) | Post-Regulation (1933-1980) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Bank failures (annual avg.) | 500+ | 15 |
| Major financial crises | 6 | 0 |
| Real wage growth | Volatile | Steady 2%+ annually |
| Income inequality | High/rising | Declining |

## The Deregulation Era (1980-2008)

### Depository Institutions Deregulation Act (1980)

- Phased out interest rate ceilings (Regulation Q)
- Raised FDIC insurance limits
- Allowed thrifts to make commercial loans

### Garn-St. Germain Act (1982)

- Further deregulated savings and loans
- Allowed adjustable-rate mortgages
- **Result**: S&L crisis of the late 1980s, costing taxpayers $124 billion

### Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act (1994)

- Allowed nationwide banking
- Accelerated bank consolidation
- Number of banks fell from 14,000 to under 5,000

### Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (1999)

**The Repeal of Glass-Steagall**

This legislation effectively dismantled the Depression-era separation of banking activities:

- Allowed commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies to consolidate
- Created "financial holding companies" that could engage in all financial activities
- Passed with strong bipartisan support after intense Wall Street lobbying

**Key Supporters and Their Post-Government Careers:**

| Official | Role in Passage | Subsequent Employment |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Robert Rubin | Treasury Secretary | Citigroup ($126M compensation) |
| Larry Summers | Deputy Treasury Secretary | D.E. Shaw hedge fund |
| Phil Gramm | Senate sponsor | UBS Vice Chairman |

### Commodity Futures Modernization Act (2000)

- Explicitly prohibited regulation of over-the-counter derivatives
- Exempted credit default swaps from oversight
- Passed in lame-duck session with no debate
- **Result**: AIG's unregulated CDS portfolio required $180 billion bailout

### SEC Net Capital Rule Change (2004)

- Allowed investment banks to dramatically increase leverage
- Major banks went from 12:1 to 30:1+ leverage
- All five banks that received the exemption either failed, were acquired, or converted to bank holding companies by 2008

## Post-Crisis Re-Regulation (2010-2016)

### Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act (2010)

Major provisions included:
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
- Volcker Rule (partial trading restrictions)
- Orderly Liquidation Authority
- Derivatives clearing requirements
- Stress testing for large banks

**Limitations:**
- Did not restore Glass-Steagall separation
- Did not break up too-big-to-fail banks
- Included numerous exemptions and loopholes
- Implementation delegated to agencies subject to capture

### Regulatory Rollback (2017-2020)

- **Economic Growth Act (2018)**: Exempted banks under $250 billion from enhanced oversight
- **CFPB weakening**: Enforcement actions dropped 75%
- **Volcker Rule loosening**: Expanded permitted trading activities
- **Stress test relaxation**: Reduced frequency and rigor

## Lessons from History

1. **Regulation works**: The half-century of stability following Glass-Steagall was not coincidental
2. **Deregulation creates risk**: Every major relaxation of financial rules preceded a crisis
3. **Industry capture is real**: Regulators and legislators consistently moved to lucrative industry positions after enabling deregulation
4. **Memory fades**: Each generation forgets the lessons of the previous crisis
5. **Incremental erosion**: Financial regulation rarely fails in one dramatic moment; it's weakened gradually until crisis reveals the damage
