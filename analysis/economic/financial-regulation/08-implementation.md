# Implementation: Achieving Financial Regulatory Reform

## Overview

Financial reform faces formidable opposition from an industry with vast resources and political influence. This chapter addresses how to build coalitions, sequence reforms, navigate legal obstacles, and sustain momentum against well-funded resistance.

## Political Landscape Assessment

### Stakeholder Analysis

| Stakeholder | Position | Power | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|-------|----------|
| Megabanks (JPM, BofA, Citi, Wells, Goldman) | Strongly opposed | Very high | Delay, dilute, capture |
| Regional banks | Mixed (oppose TBTF subsidy, oppose regulation) | Moderate | Split from megabanks on TBTF |
| Community banks | Support some reforms (TBTF, competition) | Low individually, organized moderate | Coalition partner |
| Credit unions | Support consumer protection, oppose overreach | Low-moderate | Coalition partner |
| Hedge funds/PE | Strongly opposed | High | Fund opposition research, lobbying |
| Fintech | Mixed (wants access, not regulation) | Growing | Potential split |
| Consumer advocates | Strongly support | Low-moderate | Core coalition |
| Labor unions | Support | Moderate | Coalition partner |
| Progressive Democrats | Strongly support | Growing | Congressional leadership |
| Moderate Democrats | Mixed | Declining | Potential swing votes |
| Republicans | Generally opposed | Significant | Focus on populist elements |
| State AGs | Often support enforcement | Moderate | Enforcement partners |
| State regulators | Mixed | Varies by state | Implementation partners |

### Political Windows for Reform

**Crisis-Driven Reform:**

- 2008-2010: Dodd-Frank passed after crisis
- Future crisis: Will create reform window
- SVB/Signature (2023): Minor window opened

**Non-Crisis Pathways:**

- Sustained advocacy building
- Scandal-driven (Wells Fargo fake accounts, etc.)
- Regulatory action during favorable administrations
- State-level reform creating federal pressure

## Coalition Building

### Core Coalition

**Natural Allies:**

- Consumer advocacy organizations (PIRG, Consumer Federation, etc.)
- Labor unions (AFL-CIO, SEIU, teachers)
- Community development organizations
- Civil rights groups (disproportionate impact on minorities)
- Small business associations
- Community banks and credit unions

### Expanding the Coalition

**Populist Right:**

- Messaging: "Too big to fail" = crony capitalism
- Champions: Some libertarian-leaning Republicans
- Issues: Break up big banks, end bailouts
- Caution: May not support consumer protection

**Business Interests:**

- Main Street businesses harmed by concentration
- Businesses seeking fair access to capital
- Companies harmed by financial instability
- Pension funds concerned about investment advice

**State and Local Officials:**

- Mayors dealing with foreclosure impacts
- State AGs pursuing enforcement
- State treasurers with fiduciary concerns
- Local officials addressing payday lending

### Coalition Maintenance

**Challenges:**

- Different priorities among allies
- Industry attempts to split coalition
- Resource disparities vs. opposition
- Burnout from long campaigns

**Strategies:**

- Regular coordination meetings
- Clear decision-making processes
- Shared messaging discipline
- Celebrating incremental wins
- Building personal relationships

## Sequencing Reforms

### Phase 1: Regulatory Action (Immediate)

Reforms achievable through agency action without new legislation:

| Reform | Agency | Authority |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| CFPB enforcement increase | CFPB | Existing Dodd-Frank authority |
| Stricter bank merger review | Fed, OCC, FDIC | Existing approval authority |
| Stress test enhancement | Fed | Dodd-Frank authority |
| SIFI designation (nonbanks) | FSOC | Dodd-Frank Section 113 |
| Volcker Rule enforcement | Multiple | Existing rules |
| Crypto enforcement | SEC, CFTC | Securities/commodities laws |

### Phase 2: Administrative Rules (1-2 Years)

New rules through notice-and-comment rulemaking:

| Rule | Agency | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| Overdraft fee limits | CFPB | Rulemaking underway |
| Credit card late fee cap | CFPB | Rulemaking underway |
| Payday rate cap | CFPB | Requires prioritization |
| Private fund disclosure | SEC | Finalized, litigation pending |
| Climate disclosure | SEC | Finalized, litigation pending |
| Bank merger guidelines | Fed/OCC/FDIC | Proposed |

### Phase 3: Incremental Legislation (2-4 Years)

Bills that may attract bipartisan support:

| Bill | Approach | Bipartisan Potential |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| Credit rating reform | Reduce reliance on ratings | Moderate |
| SEC/CFTC funding | Industry-funded increase | Moderate |
| Bank merger reform | Enhanced scrutiny | Low-moderate |
| Clawback requirements | Executive compensation | Moderate |
| Crypto framework | Clear jurisdiction | Moderate |

### Phase 4: Structural Reform (5+ Years)

Major legislation requiring sustained political capital:

1. **21st Century Glass-Steagall Act**
2. **Too Big to Fail reform/breakups**
3. **Regulatory consolidation**
4. **Financial transaction tax**
5. **Postal banking**

**Trigger Events:**

- Next financial crisis
- Major scandal
- Sustained grassroots pressure
- Political realignment

## State-Level Implementation

### State Authority

States retain significant financial regulatory authority:

| Area | State Authority |
|------|-----------------|
| State-chartered banks | Primary supervision |
| Insurance | Full regulation |
| Securities | Blue sky laws |
| Consumer protection | State UDAP laws |
| Payday/auto lending | Interest rate caps |
| Foreclosure | Process and protections |
| Money transmission | Licensing |

### Model State Reforms

**Interest Rate Caps:**

- 36% APR cap on consumer lending
- Model: Military Lending Act extended to all
- States enacted: 18+ states with meaningful caps

**Foreclosure Protection:**

- Mediation requirements
- Dual-tracking prohibition
- Just-cause requirements
- Model: California, Nevada reforms

**Payday Lending Reform:**

- Database to prevent stacking
- Cooling-off periods
- Payment plan requirements
- Model: Colorado reform

**Anti-Predatory Lending:**

- Ability-to-repay requirements
- Prepayment penalty bans
- Loan flipping prohibition
- Model: North Carolina, Massachusetts

### Preemption Challenges

**Federal preemption limits state action:**

- OCC has preempted state laws for national banks
- Dodd-Frank partially restored state authority
- Ongoing litigation over preemption scope

**Strategies:**

- Focus on non-preempted areas (state-chartered institutions)
- Challenge excessive preemption in courts
- Federal legislation limiting preemption
- Target nonbank lenders (generally not preempted)

## Legal Challenges and Responses

### Anticipated Industry Litigation

| Challenge | Basis | Response |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Cost-benefit analysis insufficient | Administrative law | Build robust economic record |
| Agency authority exceeded | Major questions doctrine | Congressional clarification |
| CFPB structure unconstitutional | Separation of powers | Seila Law resolved removal; funding upheld |
| State laws preempted | Supremacy clause | Dodd-Frank anti-preemption provisions |
| Rules arbitrary/capricious | APA | Thorough rulemaking record |

### Building Legal Resilience

**Robust Rulemaking Records:**

- Extensive public comment analysis
- Economic impact studies
- Alternatives consideration
- Stakeholder engagement

**Legislative Clarity:**

- Explicit congressional authorization
- Clear standards and definitions
- Express grant of rulemaking authority
- Limited agency discretion where possible

**Litigation Strategy:**

- Defend rules vigorously
- Strategic venue selection
- Amicus coordination
- Appellate strategy planning

## Sustaining Reform

### Against Erosion

**Historical Pattern:**

- Crisis → Reform → Complacency → Deregulation → Crisis

**Counter-Strategies:**

- Build institutional stakeholders (CFPB, investor groups)
- Create economic interests in regulation (compliance industry, consumer advocates)
- Embed reforms in statute (not just rules)
- Sunset provisions that require affirmative re-deregulation
- Automatic triggers for enhanced regulation

### Watchdog Infrastructure

**Congressional Oversight:**

- Financial services committee staff capacity
- GAO financial regulation expertise
- Congressional Budget Office analysis

**Independent Monitoring:**

- Academic research funding
- Consumer advocacy capacity
- Investigative journalism support
- Whistleblower protections and rewards

### Public Engagement

**Ongoing Communication:**

- Annual "state of financial regulation" reports
- Consumer education on rights and risks
- Accessible complaint systems
- Media engagement on enforcement

## Conclusion

Implementing meaningful financial reform requires strategic patience combined with readiness to capitalize on windows of opportunity. Building and maintaining coalitions, sequencing reforms strategically, navigating legal challenges, and sustaining vigilance against erosion are all essential elements. The industry's advantages in resources can be partially offset by organizing, public engagement, and the moral clarity that comes from advocating for an economy that works for everyone, not just the financial elite.
