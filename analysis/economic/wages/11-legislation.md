# Wages: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Comprehensive wage reform requires coordinated federal and state legislation addressing minimum wage, overtime, worker classification, wage theft, and pay equity. This document provides draft legislation for key reforms, with particular attention to closing loopholes and strengthening enforcement mechanisms. The legislative approach recognizes that the federal Fair Labor Standards Act establishes a floor that states can exceed, and that enforcement capacity is as important as substantive standards.

## Federal Legislation

### Raise the Wage Act

**Purpose**: Increase the federal minimum wage to $17/hour, eliminate the tipped minimum wage, index to median wages, and eliminate subminimum wages for workers with disabilities.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Raise the Wage Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour since
    July 24, 2009, the longest period without an increase
    since the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in 1938.
(2) If the minimum wage had kept pace with productivity since
    1968, it would be over $24 per hour today.
(3) The federal minimum wage at current levels leaves a
    full-time worker with two children below the federal
    poverty line.
(4) Over 30 states and 40 cities have raised their minimum
    wages above the federal level, demonstrating the need
    for federal action.
(5) Research consistently shows that moderate minimum wage
    increases do not cause significant job losses and reduce
    poverty.
(6) The tipped minimum wage of $2.13 per hour, unchanged
    since 1991, results in poverty rates for tipped workers
    double that of other workers.

SEC. 3. MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards
    Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) is amended to read as
    follows:

    "(1) except as otherwise provided in this section, not
    less than—
        "(A) $9.50 an hour, beginning on the first day of the
            third month that begins after the date of enactment
            of the Raise the Wage Act of 2025;
        "(B) $11.00 an hour, beginning 1 year after such
            first day;
        "(C) $13.00 an hour, beginning 2 years after such
            first day;
        "(D) $15.00 an hour, beginning 3 years after such
            first day;
        "(E) $17.00 an hour, beginning 4 years after such
            first day; and
        "(F) beginning on the date that is 5 years after such
            first day, and annually thereafter, the amount
            determined by the Secretary under subsection (i);".

(b) DETERMINATION BY SECRETARY.—Section 6 of such Act is
    amended by adding at the end the following:

    "(i)(1) Each year, by not later than October 1, the
    Secretary shall determine the minimum wage rate applicable
    under subsection (a)(1)(F) by increasing the annual minimum
    wage rate by the annual percentage increase, if any, in the
    median hourly wage of all employees as published by the
    Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    "(2) In calculating the annual percentage increase under
    paragraph (1), the Secretary shall compare such median
    hourly wage most recently published with such median hourly
    wage for the period prior to such most recent publication.
    "(3) If the minimum wage rate determined under paragraph
    (1) would result in a minimum wage rate lower than the
    minimum wage rate in effect at the time of such
    determination, the Secretary shall not adjust the minimum
    wage rate.
    "(4) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register
    by November 1 of each year the minimum wage rate determined
    under this subsection.".

SEC. 4. ELIMINATION OF TIPPED MINIMUM WAGE.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 3(m)(2)(A) of the Fair Labor Standards
    Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(m)(2)(A)) is amended by striking
    the second sentence and all that follows through the period
    at the end and inserting the following:

    "The wage required to be paid to a tipped employee shall be—
        "(i) for the 1-year period beginning on the first day of
            the first month that begins after the date of
            enactment of the Raise the Wage Act of 2025, $6.00
            an hour;
        "(ii) for each succeeding 1-year period until the wage
            required under this clause equals the wage rate in
            effect under section 6(a)(1), an amount equal to the
            amount in effect under this clause for the preceding
            year, increased by—
            "(I) $2.00 an hour; or
            "(II) if a $2.00 increase would result in an amount
                in excess of the wage rate in effect under
                section 6(a)(1), an amount equal to such wage
                rate in effect under section 6(a)(1); and
        "(iii) for each year after the year in which the wage
            required under this clause first equals the wage
            rate in effect under section 6(a)(1), an amount
            equal to such wage rate in effect under section
            6(a)(1).".

(b) TIPS RETAINED BY EMPLOYEE.—Section 3(m)(2)(A) of such Act,
    as amended by subsection (a), is further amended by adding
    at the end the following: "Tips are the property of the
    employee. Employers may not take any portion of an
    employee's tips, except pursuant to a valid tip pooling
    arrangement among employees who customarily receive tips.".

SEC. 5. ELIMINATION OF SUBMINIMUM WAGES FOR WORKERS WITH
         DISABILITIES.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act
    of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 214(c)) is repealed.

(b) PHASE-OUT.—The repeal under subsection (a) shall take
    effect 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act.
    During such 3-year period, the Secretary of Labor shall—
    (1) provide technical assistance to entities holding
        certificates under section 14(c) to transition to
        competitive integrated employment; and
    (2) issue regulations to ensure compliance.

206(g)) is repealed.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

Except as otherwise provided, this Act shall take effect on the
first day of the first month that begins after the date of
enactment of this Act.

### Paycheck Fairness Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen the Equal Pay Act to close loopholes, improve enforcement, and address gender and race-based wage discrimination.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Paycheck Fairness Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Women working full time earn, on average, 82 cents for
    every dollar earned by men, a gap that has barely moved
    in two decades.
(2) Black women earn 63 cents and Latina women earn 55 cents
    for every dollar earned by white men.
(3) The Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not been effective in
    closing the wage gap due to limited enforcement
    mechanisms and broad employer defenses.

SEC. 3. BONA FIDE FACTOR DEFENSE.

Section 6(d)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29
U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) is amended by striking "(iv) a differential
based on any other factor other than sex" and inserting:

    "(iv) a differential based on a bona fide factor other
    than sex, such as education, training, or experience,
    that—
        "(I) is not based upon or derived from a sex-based
            differential in compensation;
        "(II) is job-related with respect to the position in
            question;
        "(III) is consistent with business necessity; and
        "(IV) accounts for the entire differential in
            compensation at issue.
    An employer may not rely on this defense if the employee
    demonstrates that an alternative employment practice exists
    that would serve the same business purpose without producing
    the differential and that the employer has refused to
    adopt.".

SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION.

(a) PROHIBITION.—No employer shall discharge, or in any other
    manner discriminate against, any employee because such
    employee—
    (1) inquired about, discussed, or disclosed the wages of
        the employee or another employee;
    (2) opposed any act or practice made unlawful by this
        section; or
    (3) made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated
        in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or
        hearing under this section.

(b) WAGES.—Nothing in this section shall require an employee to
    disclose their wages.

SEC. 5. SALARY HISTORY.

(a) PROHIBITION.—An employer shall not—
    (1) rely on the wage history of a prospective employee in
        considering the prospective employee for employment or
        in determining the wages for such prospective employee;
    (2) seek the wage history of a prospective employee; or
    (3) require that a prospective employee's prior wages
        satisfy minimum or maximum criteria as a condition of
        employment.

(b) VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE.—If a prospective employee voluntarily
    discloses wage history, the employer shall not rely on such
    history in determining wages.

SEC. 6. ENHANCED REMEDIES.

(a) COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES.—Section 16(b) of the
    Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 216(b)) is
    amended by adding at the end: "Any employer who violates
    section 6(d) shall be liable to the employee or employees
    affected in the amount of their unpaid wages, and in an
    additional amount as compensatory damages, and, where the
    employer acted with malice or reckless indifference, in an
    additional amount as punitive damages.".

(b) CLASS ACTIONS.—Employees alleging violations of section 6(d)
    of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 may proceed as a
    class action pursuant to the procedures of Rule 23 of the
    Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

SEC. 7. PAY DATA COLLECTION.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
    shall require employers with 100 or more employees to
    submit data on employee compensation, disaggregated by
    sex, race, and ethnicity, job category, and hiring,
    termination, and promotion rates.

(b) REPORT.—Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment,
    and annually thereafter, the Commission shall publish a
    report analyzing pay disparities using data collected under
    this section.

SEC. 8. EMPLOYER SALARY TRANSPARENCY.

(a) JOB POSTINGS.—Employers with 15 or more employees shall
    include the salary range for any position in any job
    posting.

(b) RANGE REQUIREMENTS.—Salary ranges disclosed under this
    section shall have a maximum that is no more than 120
    percent of the minimum.

(c) PENALTIES.—Violations of this section shall be subject to
    civil penalties of not less than $1,000 and not more than
    $10,000 per violation.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Narrows "bona fide factor" defense that employers use to justify pay gaps
- **Section 4**: Protects workers who discuss pay, enabling informal enforcement
- **Section 5**: Bans salary history inquiries that perpetuate past discrimination
- **Section 6**: Provides meaningful remedies including compensatory and punitive damages
- **Section 7**: Requires pay data collection to identify systemic discrimination
- **Section 8**: Requires salary transparency in job postings

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Business burden | Phase-in, exemption for small employers |
| First Amendment (salary history) | Narrowly tailored to discrimination prevention |
| Privacy concerns | Aggregated data, not individual disclosure |
| Enforcement capacity | EEOC funding increase |

### Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen enforcement against wage theft through enhanced penalties, private enforcement, and prevention mechanisms.

**Draft Text**:

    inserting after "violation of section 15" the following:
    ", or any employer who willfully violates the minimum wage
    or overtime provisions of section 6 or 7 and such violation
    results in unpaid wages exceeding $50,000 in a calendar
    year or involves 10 or more employees,".

(c) TREBLE DAMAGES.—Section 16(b) of such Act is amended by
    striking "in an additional equal amount as liquidated
    damages" and inserting "in an additional amount equal to
    two times such unpaid wages as liquidated damages".

SEC. 4. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

Section 6 of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 (29 U.S.C. 255)

### Worker Classification and Protection Act

**Purpose**: Establish the ABC test as the federal standard for worker classification across all labor and employment laws.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Worker Classification and

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Approximately 10-30 percent of employers misclassify
    employees as independent contractors.
(2) Misclassification costs workers billions in lost wages
    and benefits annually.
(3) Misclassification deprives federal and state governments
    of billions in tax revenue.

    inconsistent and difficult to apply.
(5) The ABC test adopted by California and other states
    provides a clear, administrable standard.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) EMPLOYEE.—For purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
    the National Labor Relations Act, the Internal Revenue
    Code, and all other federal labor, employment, and tax
    laws, the term "employee" means any individual who performs
    services for a hiring entity, except as provided in
    subsection (b).

    an independent contractor only if the hiring entity
    demonstrates that all of the following conditions are
    satisfied:

        connection with the performance of the work, both under
        the contract for the performance of the work and in fact;

(a) IN GENERAL.—There shall be a rebuttable presumption that
    any individual performing services for a hiring entity is
    an employee.

(b) BURDEN.—The burden of proof to establish independent
    contractor status shall be on the hiring entity.

SEC. 5. JOINT EMPLOYER LIABILITY.

(a) STANDARD.—For purposes of determining liability under any
    federal labor or employment law, two or more persons shall
    be considered joint employers if each exercises control
    over the working conditions of the employee, either directly
    or indirectly.

(b) FACTORS.—In determining whether an entity exercises control,
    the following factors shall be considered:
    (1) power to hire or fire the employee;
    (2) supervision and control of work schedules;
    (3) determination of the rate and method of payment;
    (4) maintenance of employment records;
    (5) authority over working conditions and standards; and

    (1) the employee for all wages, benefits, and protections
        denied due to misclassification;
    (2) the Department of Labor for a civil penalty of not
        less than $5,000 per misclassified worker; and
    (3) the Internal Revenue Service for unpaid employment
        taxes plus interest and penalties.

(b) WILLFUL VIOLATIONS.—For willful violations, penalties shall
    be trebled.

SEC. 8. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Any worker who is misclassified as an
    independent contractor may bring a civil action against
    the hiring entity.

### Overtime Expansion Act

**Purpose**: Modernize overtime rules by raising the salary threshold, strengthening the duties test, and providing automatic updates.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Overtime Expansion Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The overtime salary threshold has eroded from covering
    65 percent of salaried workers in 1975 to 15 percent today.
(2) If the threshold had kept pace with wage growth since
    1975, it would be over $70,000 today.
(3) Millions of low-paid salaried workers work 50 or more
    hours per week without overtime pay.
(4) The "duties test" exemptions have been expanded far
    beyond their original intent.

SEC. 3. SALARY THRESHOLD.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Labor shall issue regulations
    under section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act
    (29 U.S.C. 213(a)(1)) providing that no employee may be
    classified as exempt from the overtime requirements unless
    the employee receives—
    (1) effective one year after enactment, a salary of not
        less than $58,656 per year;
    (2) effective two years after enactment, a salary of not
        less than $68,000 per year; and
    (3) effective three years after enactment, a salary of
        not less than $75,000 per year.

(b) AUTOMATIC UPDATING.—Beginning in the fourth year after
    enactment and annually thereafter, the salary threshold
    shall be automatically updated to equal the 40th percentile
    of full-time salaried workers nationally.

(c) REGIONAL THRESHOLDS.—For employers in Census regions with
    median wages exceeding 120 percent of the national median,
    the threshold shall be the 40th percentile for that region.

SEC. 4. DUTIES TEST REFORM.

(a) PRIMARY DUTY.—For an employee to be classified as exempt,
    the employee must spend more than 50 percent of working
    time performing exempt duties.

(b) EXECUTIVE EXEMPTION.—The "executive" exemption shall apply
    only to employees who—
    (1) have the authority to hire and fire employees or
        whose recommendations on hiring, firing, and promotion
        are given particular weight;
    (2) customarily and regularly direct the work of two or
        more full-time employees; and
    (3) manage a recognized department or subdivision.

(c) ADMINISTRATIVE EXEMPTION.—The "administrative" exemption
    shall apply only to employees who—

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Phases in threshold increase to $75,000, then indexes automatically
- **Section 3(c)**: Higher thresholds in high-cost regions
- **Section 4**: Tightens duties tests to prevent abuse
- **Section 5**: Allows comp time only with strong worker protections
- **Section 6**: Meaningful penalties for misclassification

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Business adjustment | 3-year phase-in |
| Regional cost variation | Regional adjustments |
| Court challenges | Regulatory authority clear |
| Small business | Threshold high enough that small businesses have few exempt employees |

PART 541--DEFINING AND DELIMITING THE EXEMPTIONS FOR EXECUTIVE,
ADMINISTRATIVE, PROFESSIONAL, COMPUTER AND OUTSIDE SALES EMPLOYEES

SS 541.100 Salary Level Test.

(a) To qualify for exemption under this part, an employee must
    be compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than:
    (1) $58,656 per year ($1,128 per week), effective [date];
    (2) Updated annually to equal the 40th percentile of
        full-time salaried workers nationally.

(b) REGIONAL ADJUSTMENT.—In Census regions where the median
    weekly earnings of full-time salaried workers exceeds 120%
    of the national median, the salary threshold shall be the
    40th percentile for that region.

### Worker Classification Guidance

**Existing Authority**: FLSA, NLRA, Internal Revenue Code

**Draft Regulation**:

```text
PART 795--EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR CLASSIFICATION

SS 795.100 Standard for Classification.

(a) For purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act, an individual
    providing services to a hiring entity is an employee unless
    the hiring entity demonstrates that all of the following
    conditions are satisfied:

    (1) CONDITION A.—The individual is free from control and
        direction in connection with the performance of the work,
        both under the contract for the performance of the work
        and in fact.

    (2) CONDITION B.—The individual performs work that is outside
        the usual course of the hiring entity's business.

    (3) CONDITION C.—The individual is customarily engaged in an
        independently established trade, occupation, or business
        of the same nature as the work performed.

(b) BURDEN OF PROOF.—The hiring entity bears the burden of proof
    to establish independent contractor status.

SS 795.105 Condition A—Freedom from Control.

(a) An individual is not free from control if the hiring entity:
    (1) Sets the individual's hours of work;
    (2) Requires the individual to work a minimum number of hours;
    (3) Prevents the individual from working for competitors;
    (4) Requires the individual to perform work personally;
    (5) Sets the rate of pay;
    (6) Provides equipment, tools, or materials; or
    (7) Dictates the manner and means of work performance.

(b) The existence of any of the factors in paragraph (a) creates
    a presumption that the individual is not free from control.

SS 795.110 Condition B—Outside Usual Course of Business.

(a) Work is outside the usual course of business if the work:
    (1) Is not integral to the hiring entity's business; and
    (2) Would not ordinarily be performed by employees of the
        hiring entity.

(b) EXAMPLES.—A software company hiring a plumber to fix pipes is
    engaging someone outside its usual course of business. A
    ride-share company classifying drivers as contractors is not,
    as drivers are integral to the company's business.

SS 795.115 Condition C—Independently Established Business.

(a) To be customarily engaged in an independently established
    business, the individual must:
    (1) Hold themselves out to the public as available for work;
    (2) Have business cards, website, or advertising;
    (3) Maintain their own tools and equipment;
    (4) Set their own rates;
    (5) Provide services to multiple clients; and
    (6) Have opportunity for profit or loss.

(b) Performing work solely for one hiring entity is strong
    evidence that the individual is not customarily engaged in
    an independently established business.
```

## Legal Considerations

| State laws | Police power authority |

**Due Process**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Notice requirements | Reasonable regulation of employment |
| Penalties | Enhanced penalties for knowing violations |
| Criminal liability | Mens rea requirement satisfies due process |

### Preemption Questions

**Federal-State Relationship**

| Area | Preemption Status |
|------|-------------------|
| Minimum wage | States can exceed federal floor |
| Overtime | States can provide greater protection |
| Classification | States can adopt stricter tests |
| Enforcement | Concurrent jurisdiction |

**State-Local Relationship**

| Status | States |
|--------|--------|
| Local authority preserved | CA, IL, NY, NJ, CO |
| State preemption | TX, FL, GA, NC + 22 others |
| Mixed | Varies by issue |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Level | Enforcement |
|-------|-------------|
| Federal DOL | Investigation, civil action, criminal referral |
| State agencies | State law enforcement |
| Private action | Individual and class actions |
| Qui tam | Private enforcement on government's behalf |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

**Recommended Provisions**:

- Automatic adjustment of wage thresholds annually
- GAO review of enforcement effectiveness every 5 years
- Congressional testimony by DOL annually on compliance rates
- Data collection on violations and recovery

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Raise the Wage Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Piece-rate work | Employers shift to piece rates to disguise hourly pay | High |
| Hour manipulation | Reduce recorded hours while maintaining work | High |
| Benefits reduction | Cut benefits to offset wage increases | Medium |
| Contractor conversion | Misclassify employees as contractors | High |
| Tip credit gaming | Claim tip credit when tips insufficient | Medium |
| Small employer exemption | Structure as multiple small entities | Medium |
| Training wage abuse | Extend "training" periods | Low |
| Geographic arbitrage | Move operations to lower-wage states | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Phase-in period allows erosion | Real value declines during phase-in | Compromise for passage |
| Regional variation not addressed | Same minimum in low and high-cost areas | Political simplicity |
| Enforcement capacity inadequate | Violations continue | Separate appropriations |
| No private enforcement enhancement | Workers bear burden of enforcement | Limited scope |
| Tipped wage phase-out too slow | Workers continue at subminimum | Industry pressure |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Piece-rate manipulation**: Require hourly equivalent calculation; minimum hourly guarantee regardless of piece rate; enhanced penalties for manipulation
2. **Hour manipulation**: Require electronic timekeeping; worker-controlled clock-in/out; penalties for off-the-clock work
3. **Benefits reduction**: Prohibit reducing total compensation as result of wage increase; track benefits alongside wages
4. **Contractor conversion**: Tie to Worker Classification Act; enhanced penalties during transition period
5. **Tip credit abuse**: Eliminate tip credit entirely (already in bill); require daily tip reconciliation
6. **Small employer fragmentation**: Aggregate related employers under common control; piercing rules
7. **Training wage abuse**: Eliminate (already in bill); cap training periods at 30 days for any employer using exception
8. **Geographic arbitrage**: Accept as consequence of floor approach; states can exceed federal minimum

### Paycheck Fairness Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Bona fide factor" redefinition | Courts may interpret broadly | High |
| Salary history workarounds | Use benefits, "total compensation" questions | Medium |
| Job title manipulation | Create unique titles to avoid comparisons | High |
| Geographic pay differentials | Claim location justifies disparities | Medium |
| Performance pay systems | Subjective evaluations perpetuate bias | High |
| Pay data aggregation | Report data at level that obscures disparities | Medium |
| Voluntary disclosure gaming | Encourage applicants to "volunteer" history | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Private company exemption | Most workers at private companies | SEC authority limits |
| Enforcement relies on complaints | Systemic discrimination continues | Resource constraints |
| No mandatory pay audits | Employers don't examine own practices | Political compromise |
| Intersectional analysis missing | Race/gender interactions not captured | Data limitations |
| Small employer exemption | 15-employee threshold excludes many workers | Small business concerns |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Bona fide factor redefinition**: Provide detailed regulatory guidance; require documented business necessity; create safe harbor for specific factors
2. **Salary history workarounds**: Define "wage history" to include all compensation; prohibit benefit history inquiries
3. **Job title manipulation**: Focus enforcement on job duties, not titles; require comparator analysis by function
4. **Geographic differentials**: Require cost-of-living analysis; cap geographic adjustments at documented differences
5. **Performance pay**: Require objective criteria; audit performance ratings for bias; limit discretionary adjustments
6. **Pay data aggregation**: Require reporting at job category level; define standard categories; penalties for gaming
7. **Voluntary disclosure**: Presume coercion; require written acknowledgment; prohibit any reliance on volunteered information

### Wage Theft Prevention and Wage Recovery Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Corporate shells | Use shell companies to avoid liability | High |
| Bankruptcy abuse | File bankruptcy to avoid wage claims | High |

| Individual liability requires knowledge | Hard to prove | Due process requirements |
| Criminal prosecution rare | Weak deterrent | DOJ priorities |
| Recovery still low | Most stolen wages unrecovered | Enforcement capacity |
| Class action barriers | Arbitration clauses | Supreme Court precedent |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Corporate shells**: Require registration of beneficial owners; pierce corporate veil for wage claims; successor liability
2. **Bankruptcy abuse**: Make wage claims non-dischargeable; priority status in bankruptcy; director liability survives
3. **Records destruction**: Spoliation penalties; adverse inference; criminal obstruction charges
4. **Witness intimidation**: Whistleblower protections; anonymous reporting; criminal penalties for intimidation
5. **Settlement coercion**: Require attorney review; cooling-off period; court approval for class settlements
6. **Jurisdictional gaps**: Federal coordination; interstate compacts; long-arm jurisdiction for wage claims
7. **Time-barring**: Extend limitations to 6 years; toll during ongoing violations; discovery rule

### Worker Classification and Protection Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Prong B manipulation | Structure business to make work "outside usual course" | High |
| Sham businesses | Help workers establish fake independent businesses | High |
| Multiple platforms | Work for multiple platforms to appear independent | Medium |

| Enforcement coordination difficult | Multiple agencies | Bureaucratic structure |
| No portable benefits alternative | Workers lose all protections if classified as contractor | Binary system |
| State preemption uncertainty | May conflict with state laws | Federalism |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Prong B manipulation**: Define "usual course" to include any work necessary to deliver company's service; look to economic reality
2. **Sham businesses**: Require genuine business activity; minimum revenue from multiple clients; reject single-client "businesses"
3. **Multiple platforms**: Look at each relationship separately; aggregate hours across platforms for benefits purposes
4. **Franchise restructuring**: Look through corporate structure to economic control; brand-based liability
5. **Arbitration clauses**: Prohibit mandatory arbitration for classification claims; class action waivers void
6. **Industry carve-outs**: Strong presumption against exemptions; narrow, documented business necessity
7. **Definition gaming**: Substance over form; multi-factor analysis; regulatory authority to clarify

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Underfunded enforcement | Mandatory appropriations tied to workforce size |
| Judicial hostility | Careful drafting; defend in courts; constitutional arguments |
| Political reversibility | Index provisions automatically; build public support |
| Coordination gaps | Interagency task forces; data sharing requirements |
| State preemption | Explicit no-preemption clauses; federal floor |
| Arbitration epidemic | Federal Arbitration Act reform; carve-out for worker claims |
| Gig economy growth | Technology-neutral definitions; regular updates |

#### Monitoring Requirements

| Metric | Frequency | Entity |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Minimum wage compliance | Quarterly | WHD |
| Overtime violations | Quarterly | WHD |
| Misclassification audits | Annual | WHD/IRS |
| Wage theft recovery | Annual | WHD |
| Pay gap data | Annual | EEOC |
| CEO pay ratios | Annual | SEC |
| Union wage premium | Annual | BLS |
