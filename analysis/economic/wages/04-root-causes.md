# Wages: Root Causes

## Structural Factors

### Decline of Worker Bargaining Power

**Union Density Collapse**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Private sector union rate | 6.0% (down from 35% in 1950s) |
| Union wage premium lost | $1.56/hour for median worker |
| Spillover effects lost | Non-union wages also fall |
| Threat effect eliminated | Employers don't fear organizing |

**Causes of Union Decline**

| Cause | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Taft-Hartley Act (1947) | Enabled right-to-work laws, restricted organizing |
| NLRB hostile appointments | Pro-employer rulings, slow elections |
| Employer resistance | Illegal firings (1 in 5 organizers), captive meetings |
| Right-to-work laws | 27 states, free-rider problem |
| Deindustrialization | Loss of heavily-unionized manufacturing |

### Monopsony Power

**Labor Market Concentration**

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Markets with dominant employer | 60% of labor markets |
| Wage suppression from concentration | 15-25% lower than competitive |
| Non-compete agreements | 18% of workers (30 million) |
| No-poach agreements | Common in franchises |

**Evidence of Monopsony**

| Indicator | Data |
|-----------|------|
| Minimum wage increases don't reduce employment | Meta-analysis of 138 studies |
| Employers don't compete aggressively for workers | Wage posting, not bidding |
| Workers don't leave for higher wages | Low mobility despite wage gaps |
| Job search costs | Average job search: 5 months |
