# Wages: Overview

## Executive Summary

America faces a wages crisis that has eroded the economic security of working families for decades. While productivity has surged since the 1970s, workers' wages have stagnated, creating a growing gap between what workers produce and what they earn. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, unchanged since 2009, has lost over 30% of its purchasing power to inflation. Meanwhile, the tipped minimum wage remains at $2.13 per hour federally, and millions of workers face misclassification, wage theft, and erosion of overtime protections. Addressing America's wage problems requires comprehensive reform across minimum wage policy, overtime rules, worker classification, and enforcement mechanisms.
