# Economic Inequality: Root Causes

## Structural Causes

### Policy Choices That Increased Inequality

The most fundamental cause of rising inequality is not technology, globalization, or natural market forces alone. Policy choices over four decades systematically transferred income and wealth upward.

**Tax Policy**

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Top income tax rate: 70% → 37% | Less redistribution |
| Capital gains rate: 35% → 20% | Investment income taxed less |
| Corporate rate: 46% → 21% | More profits to shareholders |
| Estate tax weakened | Dynastic wealth preserved |
| Tax expenditures favor wealthy | Deductions worth more to high earners |

**Labor Policy**

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Union organizing restrictions | Worker power declined |
| Minimum wage erosion | Wage floor collapsed |
| Overtime rules weakened | More unpaid work |
| Right-to-work spread | Union finances undermined |
| Gig worker classification | Benefits avoided |

**Financial Deregulation**

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Glass-Steagall repeal | Riskier finance |
| Derivatives unregulated | Financial sector grew |
| Merger standards relaxed | Corporate concentration |
| Executive pay deductibility | Stock options exploded |
| Shareholder primacy | Workers deprioritized |

### The Decline of Labor Power

The collapse of union membership is one of the most significant causes of inequality:

**The Numbers**

- 1954: 35% of workers unionized
- 1980: 23%
- 2023: 10% (6% private sector)

**Why It Matters**

- Unions compressed wages within firms
- Unions raised wages for non-union workers (threat effect)
- Unions advocated for progressive policy
- Union decline correlates almost perfectly with rising inequality

**Causes of Union Decline**

- Taft-Hartley Act (1947) restricted organizing
- PATCO firing (1981) signaled open season
- Right-to-work laws spread
- NLRB enforcement weakened
- Employer resistance tactics
- Manufacturing decline
- Service sector harder to organize

### Shareholder Primacy Revolution

In the 1970s, a new corporate philosophy emerged:

**The Old Model**

- Companies served multiple stakeholders
- Workers, communities, shareholders all mattered
- Executive pay relatively modest
- Long-term investment prioritized

**The New Model**

- Shareholder value as sole purpose
- Stock price became the metric
- Executive pay tied to stock
- Short-term results rewarded
- Workers became costs to minimize

**Effects**

- CEO pay exploded (20:1 → 350:1)
- Stock buybacks grew (over $1 trillion/year)
- Investment in workers and equipment declined
- Layoffs became routine profit strategy
- Inequality within firms increased

### Market Concentration

Corporate consolidation has increased across most industries:

**The Trend**

- Two-thirds of industries more concentrated since 2000
- Four firms often control 50%+ of market
- Monopoly profits exceed $1 trillion annually
- Labor share of income has fallen

**Effects on Inequality**

- Market power allows extracting higher profits
- Less competition for workers
- Monopsony power suppresses wages
- Profits flow to shareholders (disproportionately wealthy)
- Entrepreneurship and entry blocked

## Economic Causes

### Skill-Biased Technological Change

Technology has disproportionately benefited high-skill workers:

**The Theory**

- Computers complement high-skill workers
- Automation replaces routine tasks
- Returns to education increased
- Polarization of job market

**Evidence**

- College premium doubled since 1980
- Middle-skill jobs hollowed out
- High-wage and low-wage jobs grew; middle shrank
- Tech sector creates vast wealth for few

**Limitations of This Explanation**

- Doesn't explain why other countries with same technology have less inequality
- Technology is shaped by policy choices
- Who benefits from technology is a political question
- Automation could reduce inequality with different policies

### Globalization

International trade and capital mobility have affected workers:

**Mechanisms**

- Competition with low-wage countries
- Offshoring of manufacturing
- Capital can move; workers cannot
- "Race to bottom" on taxes and regulation

**Effects**

- Manufacturing employment fell from 32% (1953) to 8% (2023)
- Rust Belt communities devastated
- Downward pressure on wages
- Benefits flow to shareholders and consumers

**Limitations of This Explanation**

- Other countries manage globalization with less inequality
- Policy choices determine who benefits and who is protected
- China trade shock was policy choice
- Could invest in adjustment assistance (we chose not to)

### Financialization

The financial sector has grown dramatically:

**The Trend**

- Finance share of GDP: 3% (1950) → 8% (2020)
- Finance share of profits: 10% (1980) → 30%+ (peak)
- Financial assets dwarf real economy

**Effects on Inequality**

- Financial sector compensation extremely high
- Wealth extraction from productive economy
- Boom-bust cycles harm regular workers
- Speculation rewarded over production
- Capital income taxed less than labor income

### Winner-Take-All Markets

Many markets now produce extreme inequality:

**Examples**

- Top athletes, entertainers earn millions while most earn little
- Tech platforms: first-mover advantage, network effects
- Law, finance, consulting: tournament structure
- CEO market: belief that talent is scarce

**Causes**

- Technology enables scale (one person reaches billions)
- Network effects create monopolies
- Superstar economics
- Executive pay ratchet effect

## Political Causes

### Money in Politics

Campaign finance and lobbying create a feedback loop:

**The Cycle**

1. Wealthy fund campaigns and lobbying
2. Politicians responsive to funders
3. Policies favor wealthy
4. Wealthy get wealthier
5. More money to fund politics

**Evidence**

- Gilens & Page: Policy reflects wealthy preferences, not public's
- Congressional donors far wealthier than voters
- Lobbying produces massive returns (up to 22,000%)
- Tax policy particularly responsive to donors

See [Political: Campaign Finance](../../political/campaign-finance/04-root-causes.md) for more.

### Partisan Divergence

The two parties have diverged on economic policy:

**Republican Position**

- Tax cuts (especially for wealthy and corporations)
- Deregulation
- Opposition to minimum wage increases
- Right-to-work support
- Benefit cuts

**Democratic Position (Historically)**

- More progressive taxes
- Labor-friendly (but weakened post-1990s)
- Minimum wage increases
- Benefit expansion
- But also embraced deregulation, trade deals

**The Result**

- Inequality increases more under Republican administrations
- But both parties contributed to some inequality-increasing policies
- Political polarization makes reform harder

### Filibuster and Gridlock

Structural barriers prevent reform:

**The Problem**

- 60 votes needed in Senate for most legislation
- Even popular reforms blocked
- Status quo bias embedded
- Existing inequality perpetuated

**Examples**

- PRO Act (labor reform): House passed, Senate blocked
- Minimum wage increase: Majority supports, blocked
- Wealth tax: Popular, no chance of passage

## Cultural Causes

### Meritocracy Ideology

The belief that inequality reflects merit:

**The Belief**

- "If you work hard, you'll succeed"
- Wealth reflects contribution to society
- Poor must have done something wrong
- Redistribution is unfair to producers

**The Reality**

- Birth circumstances predict outcomes
- Luck plays enormous role
- Structural barriers exist
- "Self-made" billionaires often had advantages

**Effects**

- Reduces support for redistribution
- Shames those who struggle
- Justifies extreme wealth
- Blame falls on individuals, not systems

### Race and Inequality

Racial attitudes shape views on redistribution:

**The Pattern**

- Support for programs lower when perceived as benefiting minorities
- Southern strategy: race used to divide working class
- Welfare coded as racial issue
- Cross-racial solidarity undermined

**Evidence**

- More diverse countries tend to have weaker safety nets
- Framing programs as helping "deserving" vs. "undeserving"
- Dog-whistle politics

### Individualism

American culture emphasizes individual over collective:

**The Tension**

- Individual success stories celebrated
- Collective solutions viewed suspiciously
- "Socialism" as epithet
- Government intervention suspect

**Effects**

- Preference for market solutions
- Resistance to taxation
- Limited support for universal programs
- Charity over solidarity

### Multiple Locks on Equality

| Level | Lock |
|-------|------|
| Constitutional | Property rights, limited federal power |
| Political | Money in politics, filibuster |
| Economic | Market power, wealth concentration |
| Cultural | Meritocracy ideology, racial divisions |
| Geographic | Winner-take-all cities, struggling regions |

### Breaking the Cycle

Despite multiple locks, change is possible:

**Potential Break Points**

1. **Political reform**: Reduce money in politics
2. **Labor revival**: Rebuild worker power
3. **Tax reform**: More progressive taxation
4. **Antitrust enforcement**: Reduce market power
5. **Public investment**: Create opportunities
6. **Movement building**: Shift public discourse
7. **Crisis**: Create reform windows

## Why This Matters

Understanding root causes reveals:

1. **Not inevitable**: Inequality is policy choice
2. **Multiple causes**: No single fix
3. **Politics central**: Reform requires political change
4. **Race and class linked**: Must address both
5. **Structural change needed**: Individual solutions insufficient

## Education and Opportunity Inequality

Educational inequality is both a driver and consequence of economic inequality. The education system, rather than serving as the great equalizer, often reinforces and perpetuates existing disparities.

### Achievement Gaps Established Early

Inequality in educational outcomes begins before children enter school and compounds over time:

| Life Stage | Low-Income Experience | High-Income Experience | Gap |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----|
| Birth-3 years | Limited vocabulary exposure, less enrichment | Rich language environment, structured activities | 30 million word gap by age 3 |
| Pre-K | Only 34% have access to quality programs | Universal access through private programs | Kindergarten readiness gap of 34 points |
| Elementary | Higher teacher turnover, fewer resources | Stable, experienced teachers, full offerings | Achievement gaps widen each year |
| High school | 78% graduation rate | 94% graduation rate | 16-point gap |
| College | 29% degree completion (low-income) | 66% degree completion (high-income) | 37-point gap |

These gaps compound: children from wealthy families receive more educational investment at every stage, and each stage builds on the last.

### College Access Disparities by Income

Higher education, once seen as the pathway to mobility, increasingly reinforces class stratification:

| Barrier | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Legacy admissions | Children of alumni 4x more likely to be admitted at elite schools |
| Early decision | Advantages those who don't need to compare financial aid packages |
| Test preparation | $10,000+ packages give wealthy students 100+ point SAT advantages |
| Unpaid internships | Only accessible to those who can afford to work for free |
| Geographic access | Poor students less likely to apply to selective schools |
| Information gaps | First-generation students lack guidance on applications, financial aid |

Elite colleges enroll more students from the top 1% than the bottom 50% combined.

### Student Debt Burden by Income Level

Student debt exacerbates inequality rather than alleviating it:

| Income Group | Average Debt | Repayment Outcomes |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Lowest quintile | $30,000 | 49% default rate within 12 years |
| Second quintile | $28,000 | 32% default rate |
| Middle quintile | $27,000 | 21% default rate |
| Fourth quintile | $26,000 | 11% default rate |
| Highest quintile | $22,000 | 4% default rate |

The paradox: Lower-income students often borrow more (lacking family resources) yet earn less after graduation (attending less selective schools, lacking networks), creating a debt trap that prevents wealth accumulation.

### Education as Both Symptom and Solution

**Education reflects inequality:**

- School funding tied to property taxes perpetuates geographic inequality
- Wealthy parents can supplement public education or exit to private schools
- College access depends heavily on family resources and information

**Education can reduce inequality if:**

- Funding is equalized across districts and states
- Universal high-quality pre-K closes early gaps
- Higher education becomes affordable without crushing debt
- Vocational pathways provide middle-class incomes without degrees

The education system currently operates as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of advantage. Reforming it is essential for reducing economic inequality.
