# Economic Inequality: Current State

## The Problem Today

### America's Exceptional Inequality

Among developed nations, the United States stands out for the extremity of its economic inequality. While inequality has risen in most wealthy countries, America has experienced a far more dramatic divergence between the rich and everyone else.

**Before 1980**

- Broadly shared growth
- Strong middle class
- Progressive taxation
- Regulated financial sector
- Strong unions

**After 1980**

- Growth captured by top earners
- Stagnant middle-class wages
- Regressive tax changes
- Financial deregulation
- Union decline

### CEO-to-Worker Pay

| Year | CEO-to-Worker Pay Ratio |
|------|------------------------|
| 1965 | 20:1 |
| 1978 | 31:1 |
| 1995 | 123:1 |
| 2000 | 376:1 |
| 2021 | 351:1 |

Average CEO compensation at top 350 firms: $27.8 million (2021).

### Racial Wealth Gap

| Race/Ethnicity | Median Family Wealth | Ratio to White |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| White | $188,200 | 1.0x |
| Black | $24,100 | 0.13x (13 cents on dollar) |
| Hispanic | $36,100 | 0.19x |
| Asian | $191,000 | 1.0x (but wide internal variation) |

### Gender Pay Gap

| Demographic | Earnings per Dollar White Men Earn |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| White women | $0.79 |
| Black women | $0.63 |
| Hispanic women | $0.57 |
| Asian women | $0.87 |
| All women (average) | $0.84 |

### Geographic Inequality

| Region Type | Median Income | Trend |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Major metro areas | $85,000+ | Rising |
| Small metro areas | $65,000 | Stagnant |
| Rural areas | $52,000 | Declining |

### Poverty Rates

| Category | Poverty Rate | Deep Poverty Rate (<50% poverty line) |
|----------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Overall | 11.5% | 4.7% |
| Children | 16.3% | 7.2% |
| Elderly | 10.3% | 3.1% |
| Black | 19.5% | 8.9% |
| Hispanic | 17.1% | 6.8% |
| White | 8.6% | 3.4% |

### Social Mobility

| Metric | U.S. | Nordic Countries |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Intergenerational earnings elasticity | 0.47 | 0.20-0.25 |
| Probability of bottom-to-top quintile | 7.5% | 11-14% |
| Probability of staying in bottom quintile | 33% | 25% |

(Higher elasticity = lower mobility; parent income predicts child income more)

## Impact Analysis

### On Working Families

**Wage Stagnation**

- Real wages for non-supervisory workers: essentially flat since 1973
- Productivity up 59.7% since 1979; wages up 15.8%
- Gap represents $50 trillion transferred to top 1%

**Cost of Living**

- Housing costs rising faster than incomes
- Healthcare costs consuming larger share of income
- Education costs creating debt burden
- Childcare costs unaffordable for many

**Work Hours**

- Americans work 400+ more hours/year than Europeans
- Two-income trap: families need two earners for middle-class life
- Less time for family, community, civic engagement

### On the Middle Class

**Shrinking Middle**

| Year | Share of Adults in Middle Class |
|------|--------------------------------|
| 1971 | 61% |
| 2021 | 50% |

**Falling Behind**

- Middle-class income share declined from 62% (1970) to 42% (2020)
- Upper-income households captured most of the difference
- Wealth accumulation even more skewed

**Insecurity**

- 40% of Americans can't cover $400 emergency expense
- Retirement savings inadequate for most
- Job security declined; gig economy growth
- Healthcare tied to employment

### On Low-Income Americans

**Working Poor**

- Millions work full-time but remain below poverty line
- Minimum wage ($7.25 federal) has lost 40%+ purchasing power
- No paid leave, unpredictable schedules
- Benefits (health, retirement) unavailable

**Deep Poverty**

- 17+ million Americans in deep poverty (<$14,000/year for family of 4)
- Concentrated among children, people with disabilities
- Limited safety net compared to peer nations

### On Racial Minorities

**Compounding Disadvantages**

- Lower wages for same work
- Less access to wealth-building (homeownership, investments)
- Discrimination in hiring, lending, housing
- Less intergenerational wealth transfer

**The Math of the Racial Wealth Gap**

- At current pace, would take 228 years to close Black-white wealth gap
- Homeownership gap actually widened in some periods
- COVID-19 widened gaps further

### On Economic Growth

**Aggregate Effects**

- Inequality reduces consumer demand
- Money at top saved, not spent
- Investment shifts to financial assets over productive capacity
- Reduces returns to education for many

**Research Findings**

- IMF: High inequality associated with shorter growth spells
- OECD: Rising inequality cost 5-9 percentage points of GDP growth
- Standard & Poor's: Inequality is drag on growth

## Recent Developments

### COVID-19 Impact

**Wealth Gains for Top**

- Billionaire wealth increased by $1.8 trillion during pandemic
- Top 1% gained $6.5 trillion in wealth (2020-2021)
- Stock market gains disproportionately benefited wealthy

**Losses for Bottom**

- Low-wage workers most likely to lose jobs
- Essential workers faced health risks, often without hazard pay
- Women disproportionately exited workforce
- Racial disparities in deaths and economic impact

### Inflation Effects (2021-2023)

- Low-income households spend larger share on necessities
- Food and energy price increases hit hardest at bottom
- Wage gains offset by price increases for many
- Asset holders protected by appreciating assets

### Policy Changes

**American Rescue Plan (2021)**

- Expanded child tax credit temporarily cut child poverty in half
- Stimulus checks provided brief relief
- Unemployment benefits expanded
- But most provisions expired

**Inflation Reduction Act (2022)**

- Some progressive elements (minimum corporate tax)
- But limited direct impact on inequality
- Drug pricing provisions help some seniors

### Wage Developments

**Positive Trends**

- Tight labor market produced some wage gains (2021-2023)
- Low-wage workers saw above-average increases
- Some compression at bottom of distribution

**Limitations**

- Gains often offset by inflation
- Structural inequality unchanged
- Wealth gap continued widening
- Geographic and racial disparities persist

## Current Reform Landscape

### Active Efforts

**Federal Level**

- PRO Act (labor organizing) passed House, blocked in Senate
- Build Back Better (weakened to Inflation Reduction Act)
- Minimum wage increase proposals stalled
- Wealth tax proposals discussed but not enacted

**State and Local**

- Minimum wage increases in many states/cities
- Some states implementing paid leave
- Local earned income tax credits
- Affordable housing initiatives

### Public Opinion

| Issue | Support |
|-------|---------|
| Raise minimum wage to $15 | 62% |
| Tax the wealthy more | 64% |
| Reduce income inequality | 66% |
| Corporations pay fair share | 79% |

### Research and Advocacy

**Key Research Centers**

- Economic Policy Institute
- Washington Center for Equitable Growth
- Institute for Policy Studies
- Brookings Institution

**Advocacy Organizations**

- Fight for $15
- Economic Security Project
- SEIU and other unions
- Jobs with Justice

## Key Takeaways

1. **Inequality at historic levels**: Top 1% share of income near 1920s peak
2. **Wealth even more concentrated**: Top 0.1% owns as much as bottom 90%
3. **Mobility has declined**: U.S. now less mobile than many European countries
4. **Racial and gender gaps persist**: Structural barriers compound over generations
5. **Middle class shrinking**: Both in numbers and share of national income
6. **Geographic divergence growing**: Metros thriving while rural areas decline
7. **Policy choices matter**: Other countries achieve more equality with similar economies
8. **COVID widened gaps**: Pandemic accelerated existing trends
