## Their Messaging

### "Economic Growth" Frame

**The Argument**

- Inequality is price of growth
- Redistribution harms economy
- Rising tide lifts all boats
- Focus on growth, not distribution

**Reality**

- Shared growth happened 1945-1975
- Inequality actually harms growth (IMF, OECD)
- "Rising tide" hasn't lifted middle class
- Distribution is separate from growth

**Counter-Message**

> "The economy grew faster and for everyone during America's most equal period. Inequality is holding back growth, not creating it."

### "Earned It" Meritocracy

**The Argument**

- Wealthy earned their wealth
- Taking it is unfair
- Everyone has equal opportunity
- Success reflects hard work and talent

**Reality**

- Birth circumstances predict outcomes
- Luck plays enormous role
- Structural barriers exist
- Inheritance increasingly important

**Counter-Message**

> "Nobody earns a billion dollars alone. They rely on workers, infrastructure, and a society that made their success possible. We're asking them to pay it back."

### "Government Can't" Incompetence

**The Argument**

- Government programs fail
- Bureaucracy wastes money
- Private sector more efficient
- Redistribution creates dependency

**Reality**

- Social Security, Medicare highly efficient
- Other countries achieve better outcomes
- Private sector has its own inefficiencies
- Safety net reduces poverty where robust

**Counter-Message**

> "Social Security is one of the most successful programs in American history. We know how to reduce poverty when we choose to."

### "Personal Responsibility" Individualism

**The Argument**

- People should take care of themselves
- Dependency is moral failing
- Individual choices, not systems, determine outcomes
- Helping people hurts them

**Reality**

- Structural barriers limit individual choices
- "Personal responsibility" harder with fewer resources
- Successful people had advantages
- Collective action created middle class

**Counter-Message**

> "Personal responsibility matters, but people also need a fair shot. Nobody chooses where they're born or what opportunities they have access to."

### "Socialism" Fear

**The Argument**

- Any redistribution leads to socialism
- Venezuela/Cuba comparisons
- Government control destroys freedom
- Slippery slope to tyranny

**Reality**

- Peer nations have more redistribution, remain free
- Nordics are capitalist countries
- U.S. had more redistribution in past
- Social democracy ≠ socialism

**Counter-Message**

> "Nobody's proposing socialism. We're proposing returning to the policies that built the middle class. That's not radical; that's what worked."

## Weaknesses
