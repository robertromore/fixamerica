# Economic Inequality: Overview

## Executive Summary

Economic inequality in America has reached levels not seen since the Gilded Age. The gap between the wealthy and everyone else has widened dramatically over the past four decades, fundamentally reshaping American society. The richest 1% now own more wealth than the entire middle class, while half of Americans have essentially no net worth. This concentration of economic power translates directly into political power, undermining democratic representation and creating a self-reinforcing cycle where the wealthy shape policies that further increase their wealth.

Inequality manifests across multiple dimensions: income, wealth, race, gender, and geography. The racial wealth gap leaves Black families with one-tenth the wealth of white families. Women still earn roughly 84 cents for every dollar men earn. Rural communities have been hollowed out while metropolitan areas accumulate wealth. And perhaps most troubling, social mobility has declined so sharply that the American Dream of upward mobility is now more achievable in Europe than in America.

## The Core Problem

### The Great Divergence

From 1945 to 1980, economic growth was broadly shared. Productivity gains translated into wage gains across the income spectrum. The middle class expanded, and the gap between rich and poor narrowed.

Then something changed.

| Period | Bottom 50% Income Growth | Top 1% Income Growth |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| 1946-1980 | +102% | +47% |
| 1980-2018 | +1% | +226% |

Since 1980, almost all income gains have flowed to the top. The bottom half of Americans saw virtually no real income growth over four decades.

### Multiple Dimensions of Inequality

**Income Inequality**

- Top 1% earns 20%+ of all income
- CEO-to-worker pay ratio: 350:1 (was 20:1 in 1965)
- Minimum wage has lost 40%+ of purchasing power since 1968

**Wealth Inequality**

- Top 1% owns more wealth than entire middle class (middle 60%)
- Top 0.1% owns as much as bottom 90%
- Bottom 50% has essentially zero net worth (often negative)

**Racial Inequality**

- Median Black family wealth: $24,100
- Median white family wealth: $188,200 (8x higher)
- Hispanic family wealth gap similar

**Gender Inequality**

- Women earn 84 cents per dollar men earn
- Gap larger for women of color
- Motherhood penalty vs. fatherhood premium

**Geographic Inequality**

- Coastal metros prospering; rural areas declining
- "Deaths of despair" concentrated in left-behind regions
- Educational and health outcomes diverging

## By the Numbers

### Income Distribution

| Group | Share of Total Income |
|-------|----------------------|
| Top 1% | 20.5% |
| Top 10% | 46.9% |
| Middle 40% | 41.5% |
| Bottom 50% | 11.6% |

### Wealth Distribution

| Group | Share of Total Wealth |
|-------|----------------------|
| Top 1% | 32.3% |
| Top 10% | 69.8% |
| Middle 40% | 27.9% |
| Bottom 50% | 2.6% |

### Key Metrics

| Metric | U.S. Value | Developed Country Average |
|--------|------------|---------------------------|
| Gini coefficient (income) | 0.39 | 0.30 |
| Top 1% income share | 20.5% | 10-12% |
| Intergenerational earnings elasticity | 0.47 | 0.20-0.30 |
| Child poverty rate | 17.5% | 10% |

## Key Concepts

### Measuring Inequality

**Gini Coefficient**

- Scale of 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (one person has everything)
- U.S.: 0.39 (high by developed nation standards)
- Nordic countries: 0.25-0.28

**Income vs. Wealth**

- Income: What you earn (wages, salaries, investment returns)
- Wealth: What you own minus what you owe (net worth)
- Wealth inequality is more extreme than income inequality

**Quintiles and Percentiles**

- Population divided into equal groups by income or wealth
- Top 1%, top 10%, bottom 50% are common comparisons
- Movement between quintiles measures mobility

### Types of Inequality

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Market income inequality** | Before taxes and transfers |
| **Disposable income inequality** | After taxes and transfers |
| **Wealth inequality** | Distribution of net worth |
| **Opportunity inequality** | Access to education, jobs, mobility |
| **Political inequality** | Unequal influence over policy |

## Framework for Analysis

### The Inequality Cycle

+------------------+     +-------------------+     +------------------+
|  Wealth          |     |  Political        |     |  Policy          |
|  Concentration   | --> |  Influence        | --> |  Choices         |
+------------------+     +-------------------+     +------------------+
       ^                                                    |
       |                                                    |
       +----------------------------------------------------+
                    Policies increase wealth concentration

```

### Causes of Rising Inequality

| Category | Mechanisms |
|----------|------------|
| **Policy** | Tax cuts for wealthy, deregulation, weakened unions |
| **Technology** | Automation, skill-biased change, winner-take-all |
| **Globalization** | Offshoring, trade competition, capital mobility |
| **Institutions** | Declining union power, eroded minimum wage |
| **Finance** | Financialization, shareholder primacy, executive pay |

## Why This Matters

### For Economic Growth

- Inequality reduces consumer demand
- Concentrates investment in financial assets rather than productive capacity
- Reduces human capital development
- Creates boom-bust cycles

### For Democracy

- Wealth translates to political power
- Policy reflects preferences of wealthy, not public
- Cynicism and disengagement increase
- Legitimacy of democratic institutions undermined

### For Social Cohesion

- Increases "deaths of despair"
- Erodes social trust
- Fuels political extremism
- Geographic and social sorting

### For Future Generations

- Declining mobility means birth determines fate
- "Opportunity hoarding" by wealthy families
- Intergenerational wealth perpetuates advantage
- American Dream becomes American Myth
