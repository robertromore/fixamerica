# Economic Inequality: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Criteria for Evaluating Reforms

| Criterion | Definition | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Reduces inequality** | Measurably narrows income/wealth gaps | Direct metric of success |
| **Promotes mobility** | Increases movement between income levels | Restores American Dream |
| **Supports growth** | Compatible with economic dynamism | Avoids zero-sum framing |
| **Politically viable** | Can build majority support | Perfect solutions must pass |
| **Enforceable** | Can be implemented and monitored | Avoids loopholes and evasion |
| **Durable** | Can withstand political changes | Long-term impact |

### The Framework

There's no single solution to inequality. A comprehensive approach addresses multiple causes:

1. **Pre-distribution**: Fix markets to produce more equal outcomes
2. **Redistribution**: Transfer resources after the fact
3. **Opportunity**: Invest in education, healthcare, infrastructure
4. **Power**: Change who makes decisions

## Policy Proposals

### Tier 1: Tax Reform

**Progressive Income Tax Reform**

*Key Provisions*

- Raise top marginal rate to 50-70%
- Tax capital gains as ordinary income
- Eliminate stepped-up basis at death
- Close carried interest loophole
- Strengthen earned income tax credit

*Evidence*

- Top rates were 70-91% during Great Compression

*Advantages*

- Direct revenue for public investment
- Constitutional (16th Amendment)
- Administrative capacity exists
- Progressive distribution

*Challenges*

- Requires congressional action
- Evasion and avoidance strategies
- Capital flight concerns (overstated)
- Political opposition

**Wealth Tax**

*How It Works*

- Annual tax on net worth above threshold (e.g., $50 million)
- 2% on wealth $50M-$1B
- 3%+ on wealth above $1B
- Applies to all assets

*Evidence*

- Multiple countries have had wealth taxes
- Switzerland maintains one successfully
- U.S. had de facto wealth tax on real estate
- Concentration has increased without it

*Advantages*

- Directly addresses wealth concentration
- Substantial revenue ($3 trillion over 10 years per Warren proposal)

- Market-based (not government transfers)
- Creates countervailing power to corporations
- Raises non-union wages too

*Challenges*

- Blocked by Senate filibuster
- Employer resistance
- Changing economy (gig, remote work)

- Reduces competition on wages
- Levels playing field for employers
- Compresses wage distribution

### Tier 3: Public Investment and Services

- Debt burden affects wealth-building
- Other countries have free/low-cost higher education

**Healthcare Reform**

*Options*

- Medicare for All (single payer)
- Public option
- ACA expansion
- Prescription drug price negotiation

*Connection to Inequality*

- Medical costs are major cause of bankruptcy
- Healthcare tied to employment creates insecurity
- Health outcomes correlate with income
- Universal coverage reduces inequality

### Tier 4: Social Insurance and Safety Net

**Child Allowance**

*How It Would Work*

- Monthly payment per child (e.g., $300/month)
- Universal or means-tested

## Structural Reforms

### Campaign Finance Reform

**The Connection**

Wealthy interests shape policy to increase inequality. Reducing money in politics is necessary for other reforms.

See [Campaign Finance: Solutions](../../political/campaign-finance/07-solutions.md).

### Electoral Reform

**The Connection**

Unrepresentative political system blocks popular reforms. More democratic elections could enable economic reform.

See [Electoral Reform: Solutions](../../political/electoral-reform/07-solutions.md).

### Constitutional Amendment

**For Equality**

Some reforms may require constitutional change:

- Wealth tax (if courts block)
- Corporate constitutional rights
- Economic rights (FDR's second bill of rights concept)

## What Has Worked Elsewhere

### Nordic Countries

| Policy | Approach | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Taxes | High, progressive | Gini: 0.25-0.28 |
| Labor | Strong unions, sectoral bargaining | Low wage inequality |
| Services | Universal healthcare, childcare, education | Opportunity equality |
| Safety net | Robust, universal | Low poverty |

### Germany

| Policy | Approach | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Codetermination | Worker board representation | Compressed wage distribution |
| Training | Vocational apprenticeships | Middle-skill jobs preserved |
| Industrial policy | Support manufacturing | Less deindustrialization |
| Unions | Sectoral bargaining | Wage compression |

### Historical United States

| Period | Policies | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1945-1975 | High taxes, strong unions, GI Bill | Great Compression |
| New Deal | Social Security, labor rights | Middle class creation |

## Trade-offs

### Growth vs. Equality

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| "Redistribution hurts growth" | IMF, OECD: inequality harms growth |
| "High taxes reduce investment" | No evidence of threshold effect |
| "Other countries grow slower" | Germany, Nordics competitive |

**Reality**: Trade-off is overstated. Inequality harms growth; shared prosperity promotes it.

### Efficiency vs. Equity

| Consideration | Analysis |
|---------------|----------|
| Some inequality incentivizes work | Yes, but extreme inequality unnecessary |
| Transfers create disincentives | Evidence of strong work disincentives is weak |
| Programs have overhead | But market failures have costs too |

**Reality**: Some trade-off exists but magnitude often overstated

### Universal vs. Targeted

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Universal | Political durability, no stigma | Higher cost |
| Targeted | Lower cost, focused on need | Cliff effects, stigma |

**Recommendation**: Generally favor universal with some targeting through taxation.

## Recommendations
