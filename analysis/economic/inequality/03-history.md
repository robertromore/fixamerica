# Economic Inequality: History

## Origins

### The American Paradox

America was founded on ideals of equality yet built on profound inequalities. The Declaration of Independence proclaimed all men "created equal" while slavery generated vast wealth for some through the exploitation of others. Understanding inequality today requires understanding these contradictions from the beginning.

**Colonial Era**

- Landed gentry vs. indentured servants
- Slavery created wealth concentration
- Property requirements for voting
- Regional economic differences

**Early Republic**

- Founders debated property and democracy
- Jefferson's yeoman farmer ideal vs. Hamilton's commercial vision
- Gradual expansion of suffrage (for white men)
- Persistent rural/urban divides

### The First Gilded Age (1870s-1900s)

Industrialization created unprecedented wealth concentration:

**The Robber Barons**

- Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan, Vanderbilt
- Monopolies in oil, steel, railroads, finance
- Vast fortunes while workers earned subsistence wages
- Top 1% owned 45% of all wealth by 1890s

**Working Conditions**

- 60-80 hour work weeks
- Child labor widespread
- No workplace safety
- No unemployment insurance
- Company towns, debt peonage

**Response**

- Labor organizing (Knights of Labor, AFL)
- Progressive movement
- Muckraking journalism
- Antitrust legislation (Sherman Act)

### The Progressive Era (1900-1920)

First major attempt to address inequality:

**Reforms**

- Trust-busting (Roosevelt)
- Progressive income tax (16th Amendment, 1913)
- Direct election of senators (17th Amendment)
- Labor protections begin
- Women's suffrage (19th Amendment, 1920)

**Limitations**

- Reforms incomplete
- Jim Crow South untouched
- Limited union rights
- Immigration restrictions
- 1920s saw inequality rise again

## Key Turning Points

### The Great Depression and New Deal (1929-1945)

**The Crash**

- 1929 stock market collapse
- Unemployment reached 25%
- Widespread poverty and homelessness
- Bank failures wiped out savings

**New Deal Response**

| Program | Purpose | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Social Security | Retirement security | Foundation of safety net |
| Wagner Act | Union organizing rights | Labor power increased |
| FDIC | Protect bank deposits | Financial stability |
| Minimum wage | Wage floor | Reduced poverty |
| WPA/CCC | Jobs programs | Direct employment |
| Progressive taxes | Revenue and redistribution | Top rates reached 94% |

**Lasting Impact**

- Created middle class foundation
- Established principle of government intervention
- Progressive taxation became norm
- But excluded agricultural and domestic workers (disproportionately Black)

### The Great Compression (1945-1975)

**The Golden Age of Shared Prosperity**

For three decades after World War II, America experienced historically low inequality with broad-based growth:

**Key Factors**

- Strong unions (35% of workers)
- High marginal tax rates (top rate 91%)
- GI Bill expanded opportunity (for white veterans)
- Manufacturing jobs with good wages
- Corporate culture of shared prosperity
- Regulated financial sector

**The Numbers**

| Metric | 1950 | 1975 |
|--------|------|------|
| Top 1% income share | 11% | 8% |
| Union membership | 35% | 25% |
| Top marginal tax rate | 91% | 70% |
| CEO-to-worker pay | 20:1 | 22:1 |

**Important Caveat**

This prosperity was not equally shared:

- African Americans excluded from many benefits
- Women faced workplace discrimination
- Redlining prevented Black homeownership
- South remained poorer and more unequal
- "Middle class" often meant white families

### The Civil Rights Era (1954-1968)

**Legislative Gains**

- Civil Rights Act (1964)
- Voting Rights Act (1965)
- Fair Housing Act (1968)
- Economic opportunity programs

**Economic Progress**

- Black poverty rate fell from 55% (1959) to 32% (1969)
- Integration opened some economic opportunities
- Great Society programs expanded safety net
- But structural barriers remained

### The Great Divergence Begins (1975-1990)

**What Changed**

Starting in the mid-1970s, the trends reversed:

| Factor | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Union membership | 35% (1954) | 20% (1980) → 10% (2023) |
| Top tax rate | 70% | 28% (1988) |
| Financial regulation | Tight | Deregulated |
| Executive pay | Moderate | Explosive growth |
| Manufacturing | Dominant | Declining |

**Policy Shifts**

- Volcker Fed raised rates (1979-1982)
- Reagan tax cuts (1981, 1986)
- Air traffic controllers fired (1981)
- Financial deregulation began
- Antitrust enforcement relaxed

**Intellectual Shifts**

- Keynesianism questioned
- Monetarism and supply-side economics
- Shareholder value doctrine emerged
- "Greed is good" cultural shift

## Lessons from the Past

### Lesson 1: Policy Choices Shape Inequality

Inequality is not natural or inevitable. Policy choices created both the Great Compression and the Great Divergence:

**Policies That Reduced Inequality**

- Progressive taxation
- Strong labor rights
- Social insurance programs
- Regulated finance
- Public investment

**Policies That Increased Inequality**

- Tax cuts for wealthy
- Union weakening
- Deregulation
- Benefit cuts
- Austerity

### Lesson 2: Politics Determines Policy

The policies that shape inequality reflect political power:

- Post-Depression: Labor and middle class had power
- Post-1980: Business and wealthy gained power
- Money in politics reinforces inequality cycle

### Lesson 3: Growth and Equality Can Coexist

The Great Compression proves it's possible:

- 1945-1975: Strong growth AND declining inequality
- Not a zero-sum tradeoff
- Shared prosperity created consumer demand
- Investment in people paid returns

### Lesson 4: Race and Class Are Intertwined

Throughout American history:

- Racial exclusion limited gains for all workers
- Southern strategy divided working class
- Segregation undermined solidarity
- Addressing inequality requires addressing racism

### Lesson 5: Change Requires Crisis and Organization

Major reforms came after crises:

- Progressive Era: Panic of 1907, industrial conditions
- New Deal: Great Depression
- Civil Rights: Moral crisis, organized movement
- Post-1980: Crisis of stagflation, organized business

**Implication**: Reform requires both crisis and organized movements to succeed.

## Historical Parallels

### Then vs. Now

| First Gilded Age (1890s) | Second Gilded Age (2020s) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Railroad barons | Tech billionaires |
| Trust monopolies | Platform monopolies |
| Company towns | Gig economy |
| Yellow journalism | Social media misinformation |
| Immigration scapegoating | Immigration scapegoating |
| Labor organizing | Labor organizing revival |
| Progressive movement | Reform movements |

### What Made Reform Possible Then

**Progressive Era**

- Cross-class coalitions
- Investigative journalism
- Constitutional amendments
- State-level experimentation
- Two-party competition for reform voters

**New Deal**

- Economic catastrophe
- Mass unemployment created urgency
- Organized labor power
- Democratic supermajority
- Popular mandate for change

## What History Teaches

1. **Inequality is a choice**: Not inevitable; shaped by policy
2. **Change is possible**: We've had more equal periods
3. **Multiple factors matter**: Taxes, labor, finance, politics
4. **Crises create opportunity**: But only if organized to seize it
5. **Race and class intersect**: Can't address one without other
6. **Progress can reverse**: Requires constant vigilance
7. **Both parties have contributed**: To both good and bad periods
8. **International context matters**: Global forces interact with domestic policy
