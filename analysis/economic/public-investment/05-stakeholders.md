# Public Investment: Stakeholders

## Overview

Public investment affects virtually everyone, but some groups have more direct stakes and more political power than others. Understanding stakeholder interests is essential for building coalitions that can overcome barriers to investment.

## Primary Beneficiaries

### Workers and Families

| Stake | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Students | Education quality, opportunities |
| Workers | Skills development, job quality |
| Parents | Child care, school facilities |
| Job seekers | Workforce training access |

**Position**: Strongly benefit from public investment but diffuse interests make organizing difficult. Most powerful when organized through unions, community groups, or issue campaigns.

**Small and Medium Businesses**

| Stake | Impact |
|-------|--------|
