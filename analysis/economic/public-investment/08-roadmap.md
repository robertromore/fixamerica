# Public Investment: Roadmap

## Overview

Achieving the public investment levels America needs requires a multi-phase strategy that builds political support, establishes financing mechanisms, improves execution capacity, and delivers results that generate momentum for continued investment.

## Strategic Approach

### Theory of Change

**The Investment Trap**:
- Underinvestment leads to deterioration
- Deterioration erodes public trust
- Eroded trust makes investment harder
- Cycle continues

**Breaking the Cycle**:
1. Demonstrate successful execution
2. Build broad political coalitions
3. Establish sustainable financing
4. Create constituencies for investment
5. Generate returns that fund more investment

### Key Leverage Points
