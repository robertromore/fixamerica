# Public Investment: Root Causes

## Why America Underinvests

The United States consistently underinvests in public goods compared to peer nations. This isn't an accident—it results from structural, political, and ideological factors that create systematic bias against long-term public investment.

## Political Economy Failures

### The Visibility Problem

Public investment suffers from an asymmetry that undermines political support:

| Investment Phase | Visibility | Political Impact |
|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Spending | Highly visible | Criticized as waste |
| Construction disruption | Highly visible | Generates complaints |
| Successful operation | Invisible (things work) | No political reward |
| Deferred maintenance | Invisible (gradual decay) | No political cost |
| Infrastructure failure | Highly visible | Blame diffused |

Politicians get punished for spending on investment but receive no reward when investments succeed. This creates systematic bias toward cutting investment.

### Short-Term Political Incentives

**Election Cycles vs. Investment Horizons**

| Political Horizon | Investment Horizon |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| House members: 2 years | Infrastructure: 30-50 years |
| Senators: 6 years | R&D: 10-20 years |
| Presidents: 4-8 years | Education: 15-25 years |

Benefits of public investment materialize long after politicians leave office. Costs are immediate.

**Budget Process Bias**

- Annual appropriations favor short-term spending
- Investment competes with entitlements and consumption
- Capital budgets (standard in private sector) not used federally
- Multi-year commitments difficult to make

### Concentrated Costs, Diffuse Benefits

Public investment typically has:

- **Concentrated costs**: Specific industries, taxpayers, or communities bear direct costs
- **Diffuse benefits**: Gains spread across entire economy over long periods

This creates a political economy problem:

| Actors | Incentive | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Those who pay | Strong incentive to oppose | Organize, lobby |
| Those who benefit | Weak individual incentive | Free ride |
| Politicians | Respond to organized interests | Minimize investment |

### Geographic Mismatch

Infrastructure investments often benefit regions beyond their location:

- Interstate highway benefits national commerce, but costs fall on specific states
- Basic research at universities benefits global economy, but state pays
- Port improvements benefit entire supply chain, but locality funds

Without federal coordination, localities underinvest relative to national benefit.

## Structural Factors

### Federalism and Fragmentation

America's fragmented governmental structure impedes investment:

**Multiple Jurisdictions**

| Level | Infrastructure Role | Revenue Capacity |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Federal | 25% of public investment | Strongest (income tax) |
| State | 40% | Medium (sales, income) |
| Local | 35% | Weakest (property tax) |

No single level has both authority and resources for coordinated investment.

**Coordination Failures**

- Cross-state infrastructure requires complex negotiations
- Metropolitan areas fragmented across many jurisdictions
- Regional planning weak or nonexistent
- "Race to the bottom" on taxes undermines investment capacity

### Revenue Constraints

**Declining Revenue Base**

| Factor | Effect on Investment |
|--------|---------------------|
| Property tax limits (Prop 13, etc.) | Local governments revenue-constrained |
| Gas tax not indexed to inflation | Highway Trust Fund depleted |
| Corporate tax avoidance | Reduced federal capacity |
| Tax competition | Pressure to cut rates |

**Debt Aversion**

- Many states have balanced budget requirements
- Aversion to long-term borrowing, even for investments
- Federal debt ceiling creates uncertainty
- Anti-debt ideology even when borrowing rates favorable

### Entitlement Crowding

Mandatory spending consumes an increasing share of federal budget:

| Category | 1970 | 2023 |
|----------|------|------|
| Entitlements | 31% | 63% |
| Discretionary (incl. investment) | 62% | 26% |
| Net interest | 7% | 11% |

As entitlements grow, discretionary spending—including investment—gets squeezed.

## Ideological Factors

### Anti-Government Sentiment

A distinctive feature of American political culture:

| Belief | Effect on Investment |
|--------|---------------------|
| Government is inherently wasteful | Skepticism of public spending |
| Private sector always more efficient | Preference for privatization |
| Lower taxes are always better | Resistance to revenue for investment |
| Debt is morally wrong | Opposition to borrowing for investment |

These beliefs, more prevalent in the U.S. than peer nations, create political barriers to public investment.

### Market Fundamentalism

**The "Crowding Out" Narrative**

The argument that government investment displaces more efficient private investment:

| Claim | Counter-Evidence |
|-------|------------------|
| Government borrows funds that private sector would use | Interest rates remained low despite deficits |
| Private sector would invest if government didn't | Private infrastructure investment minimal |
| Government distorts market signals | Markets under-provide public goods |
| Taxes reduce private investment | Correlation weak in data |

While crowding out can occur in specific circumstances, the evidence suggests it has not been a major constraint on private investment in recent decades.[^1]

**Supply-Side Economics**

The belief that tax cuts drive growth better than public investment:

| Prediction | Actual Outcome |
|------------|----------------|
| Tax cuts pay for themselves | Deficits increased |
| Growth accelerates after cuts | Growth unchanged or slower |
| Investment increases | Corporate investment flat |

Despite repeated failures, supply-side ideology continues to influence policy.

### Privatization Bias

**Preference for Private Provision**

| Assumption | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Private always more efficient | Depends on sector and competition |
| Market competition ensures quality | Many infrastructure markets are monopolies |
| Profit motive drives innovation | Public R&D drives breakthrough innovation |
| User fees are more fair | Excludes those who can't pay |

Privatization has delivered mixed results:

| Privatized Service | Outcome |
|-------------------|---------|
| Prisons | Higher costs, worse outcomes |
| Water systems | Mixed; some failures |
| Toll roads | Some bankruptcies |
| Rail (UK) | Required re-nationalization |
| Medicare Advantage | Higher costs than traditional Medicare |

## Institutional Failures

### Weak Planning Capacity

**Degraded Government Capacity**

| Institution | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Office of Technology Assessment | Abolished (1995) |
| Federal planning agencies | Minimal |
| State planning capacity | Variable, often weak |
| Project management expertise | Shortage |

Without planning capacity, government can't effectively identify and execute investments.

### Procurement Dysfunction

**Cost Overruns and Delays**

U.S. infrastructure costs far exceed international benchmarks:

| Project Type | U.S. Cost (per mile) | International Benchmark |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Subway construction | $1-2 billion | $200-500 million |
| Light rail | $200-400 million | $50-100 million |
| Highway | $10-50 million | $5-15 million |

Causes include:

- Complex environmental review processes
- Litigation and legal challenges
- Fragmented project management
- Weak procurement expertise
- Political interference in project design
- Excessive labor costs and work rules

**Time to Complete**

| Project | Time to Complete |
|---------|------------------|
| Golden Gate Bridge (1937) | 4 years |
| Interstate System | 35 years |
| Second Avenue Subway (3 stations) | 10+ years |
| California High-Speed Rail | 20+ years (ongoing) |

Faster construction in the past suggests institutional degradation.

### Campaign Finance Effects

**Who Funds Campaigns**

| Interest | Campaign Contribution | Investment Position |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Real estate | Major donor | Opposes property taxes |
| Oil and gas | Major donor | Opposes public transit |
| Pharmaceuticals | Major donor | Opposes R&D that competes |
| Finance | Major donor | Opposes public banking |

Campaign finance creates bias toward donor interests, which often oppose public investment.

## Market Failures That Require Public Investment

### Public Goods

Classic economic theory identifies goods that markets underprovide:

| Characteristic | Definition | Example |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Non-excludable | Can't prevent use | National defense, basic research |
| Non-rival | One person's use doesn't reduce others' | Knowledge, GPS signals |

Markets underprovide these goods because firms can't capture returns.

### Externalities

Investments with benefits beyond direct users:

| Investment | External Benefit | Market Response |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Education | Educated workforce, civic participation | Underinvestment |
| Basic research | Spillovers to entire economy | Minimal private provision |
| Public health | Disease prevention benefits all | Underinvestment |
| Infrastructure networks | Connectivity benefits all users | Private monopolies or underinvestment |

### Natural Monopolies

Some infrastructure is most efficiently provided by single provider:

| Sector | Natural Monopoly Characteristic |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Water systems | Inefficient to duplicate pipes |
| Electricity transmission | Single grid most efficient |
| Railroads (many routes) | High fixed costs, low marginal costs |
| Broadband (last mile) | Inefficient to duplicate |

Private monopolies underinvest or charge excessive prices without regulation.

### Coordination Failures

Some investments only valuable if coordinated:

| Investment | Coordination Requirement |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Electric vehicle charging | Chicken-egg with EV adoption |
| Broadband in rural areas | Insufficient customers to justify private investment |
| Basic research | Firms can't coordinate to fund |
| Regional transportation | Multiple jurisdictions must cooperate |

Markets fail to solve coordination problems without public leadership.

## Why Other Countries Invest More

### Different Political Structures

| Feature | U.S. | High-Investment Countries |
|---------|------|--------------------------|
| Federalism | Fragmented | More centralized |
| Electoral system | Single-member districts | Proportional representation |
| Campaign finance | Private-dominated | Public financing |
| Government capacity | Weak | Stronger |

### Different Ideologies

| Belief | U.S. | Europe/Asia |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Government role | Minimal | Active developmental state |
| Public goods | Skepticism | Acceptance |
| Collective action | Individualism | More collectivist |
| Long-term planning | Weak tradition | Stronger |

### Different Institutions

| Institution | U.S. | High-Investment Countries |
|-------------|------|--------------------------|
| Planning agencies | Weak | Strong |
| Infrastructure banks | None (until recently) | Common |
| Capital budgets | No | Yes |
| Multi-year commitments | Difficult | Normal |

## Summary: The Underinvestment Trap

America underinvests because:

1. **Political incentives** reward short-term thinking and punish visible spending
2. **Fragmented structure** prevents coordinated investment
3. **Ideological beliefs** delegitimize public action
4. **Institutional weakness** leads to poor execution
5. **Special interests** block reforms that would enable investment
6. **Market failures** require public action that ideology rejects

These factors reinforce each other, creating a trap that is difficult to escape.
