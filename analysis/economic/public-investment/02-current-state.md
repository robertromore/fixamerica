# Public Investment: Current State

## The Problem Today

### America's Infrastructure Report Card

The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) grades U.S. infrastructure every four years. The 2021 report card gave America a **C-minus**—up from D-plus in 2017, but still indicating serious deficiencies across nearly every category.[^1]

|----------|-------|---------------|
| Aviation | D+ | $115 billion |
| Bridges | C | $125 billion |
| Broadband | C | $65 billion |
| Dams | D | $64 billion |
| Drinking Water | C- | $105 billion |
| Energy | C- | $208 billion |
| Hazardous Waste | D+ | $21 billion |
| Inland Waterways | D+ | $17 billion |
| Levees | D | $80 billion |
| Ports | B- | $21 billion |
| Public Parks | D+ | $44 billion |

## Research and Development

### Federal R&D Spending Decline

| Era | Federal R&D as % of GDP |
|-----|------------------------|
| 1964 (peak) | 2.0% |
| 1980 | 1.2% |
| 2000 | 0.8% |
| 2023 | 0.7% |

Federal R&D spending has been cut in half as a share of the economy since its post-Sputnik peak.[^2]

### Composition Shift

| Category | Federal Share (1960s) | Federal Share (2020s) |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Basic research | 70% | 25% |
| Applied research | 50% | 15% |
| Development | 40% | 20% |

The private sector has increased R&D, but almost entirely in development—applied work close to market. Basic research, which creates breakthrough innovations, has declined most.[^3]

### Global Competition
