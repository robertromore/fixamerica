# Public Investment: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Public investment reform requires legislation at multiple levels to establish sustainable funding mechanisms, improve project delivery, create strategic investment frameworks, and ensure equitable distribution of benefits. This document provides draft legislation for federal and state action, along with analysis of potential loopholes and rectification procedures.

## Federal Legislation

### American Investment Act

**Purpose**: Establish a comprehensive framework for federal public investment, including a national infrastructure bank, increased R&D funding, and sustainable financing mechanisms.

**Draft Text**:

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "American Investment Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States has underinvested in public infrastructure
    for decades, resulting in deteriorating roads, bridges, water
    systems, and other critical assets.
(2) Federal research and development spending as a share of GDP
    has declined by more than half since the 1960s, threatening
    American technological leadership.
(3) Public investment generates significant economic returns,
    with infrastructure investment returning an estimated $1.50
    to $2.00 for every dollar invested.
(4) Private markets systematically underinvest in public goods
    due to externalities, network effects, and the inability to
    capture diffuse benefits.
(5) International competitors, particularly China, are investing
    heavily in infrastructure and technology, threatening American
    competitiveness and national security.

## State Model Legislation

### State Infrastructure Investment Act (Model)

**Purpose**: Model legislation for states to establish infrastructure investment programs, including state infrastructure banks and dedicated funding mechanisms.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Infrastructure Investment Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Legislature finds that:
    (1) The State's infrastructure is in need of significant
        investment to maintain and improve roads, bridges, water

    (2) Federal funding alone is insufficient to meet the State's
        infrastructure needs.
    (3) A State infrastructure bank can leverage limited public
        resources to finance infrastructure projects efficiently.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause**

Federal infrastructure and R&D programs are authorized under the Spending Clause (Art. I, § 8, cl. 1), which gives Congress broad power to spend for the "general welfare."

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| General welfare requirement | Infrastructure and R&D clearly serve general welfare |
| Conditions on grants | Must be related to federal interest; not coercive |
| State sovereignty | States can decline participation |

**Commerce Clause**

Industrial policy measures may be challenged under Commerce Clause limitations:

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Domestic content requirements | Challenged under dormant Commerce Clause |
| Buy America provisions | Upheld for federal procurement |
| State requirements | Subject to strict scrutiny |

### Trade Agreement Considerations

**WTO Compatibility**

| Measure | WTO Issue | Response |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Domestic content | Potential TRIMS violation | Security exceptions; renegotiation |
| Subsidies | Potentially actionable | Structure as R&D, regional development |
| Procurement preferences | GPA obligations | Invoke security exceptions |

**Existing Trade Agreements**

| Agreement | Issue | Response |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| USMCA | Procurement provisions | Renegotiate; invoke exceptions |
| Bilateral agreements | Investment protections | Careful program design |

### Takings and Property Rights

Infrastructure development may raise takings issues:

| Issue | Legal Framework |
|-------|-----------------|
| Eminent domain | Just compensation required |
| Regulatory takings | Penn Central balancing test |
| Physical takings | Per se compensation |

### Environmental Law

Infrastructure projects must comply with:

| Statute | Requirements |
|---------|--------------|
| NEPA | Environmental review |
| Clean Water Act | Permits, mitigation |
| Clean Air Act | Conformity, permits |
| Endangered Species Act | Consultation, mitigation |
| Historic Preservation Act | Section 106 review |

Permitting reform must be balanced against environmental protection.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### American Investment Act

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | How Exploited | Severity |
|----------|---------------|----------|

| Political cycles | All programs | Long-term authorization; trust fund structure |
| Appropriations uncertainty | Discretionary programs | Mandatory spending; dedicated revenues |
| Implementation capacity | All government investment | Capacity building; hiring authority |
| Capture by incumbents | Industrial policy | New entrant support; competitive processes |
| Measurement gaming | Equity and outcome metrics | Independent verification; third-party audit |
| Trade challenges | Domestic content | Security exceptions; allied coordination |

**Monitoring Requirements**:

| R&D spending by region | Annual | NSF |
| Strategic sector capacity | Annual | Commerce |
| Equity outcomes | Annual | CEQ |
| Employment outcomes | Quarterly | Labor |
| Project cost and schedule | Quarterly | Administering agencies |

| GAO audits | Annual program audits |
| Whistleblower protection | Strong protections and rewards |
| Public transparency | All project data publicly available |
| Performance benchmarks | Clawback for underperformance |
| Independent evaluation | Academic evaluation required |

**Enforcement Hierarchy**:

1. Administrative enforcement (agency action)
2. Inspector General investigation
3. Congressional oversight
4. Judicial review
5. Public accountability through transparency
