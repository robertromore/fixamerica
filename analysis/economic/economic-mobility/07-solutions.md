# Economic Mobility: Solutions

## Overview

Restoring economic mobility requires simultaneous action on multiple fronts: early childhood, education, housing, wealth-building, criminal justice, and labor markets. No single intervention is sufficient, but evidence shows each of these approaches works when properly funded and implemented.

## Early Childhood Investments

### Universal Pre-K (Ages 3-4)

**Evidence base**: Perry Preschool, Abecedarian, Oklahoma pre-K, Boston pre-K

| Program | Long-term Effects |
|---------|-------------------|
| Perry Preschool | 7:1 return on investment; 40%+ reduction in incarceration |
| Abecedarian | 4x more likely to complete college; 2x earnings |
| Oklahoma universal pre-K | 30% test score gains |
| Boston public pre-K | Sustained gains through high school |

**Key elements for effectiveness**:

- Universal (not just low-income) to reduce stigma and build political support
- Full-day programs (part-day insufficient)
- Qualified, well-compensated teachers
- Small class sizes (1:8 ratio for ages 3-4)

**Cost**: $10,000-15,000 per child per year
**Estimated return**: 7:1 to 13:1 over lifetime

### Expand Early Head Start (Ages 0-3)

Currently serves only 7% of eligible children.

| Reform | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Universal eligibility for low-income | Serve all 2.4 million eligible children |
| Increase quality standards | Match best practices from research |
| Extend to full day | Currently many programs are part-time |
| Include comprehensive services | Health, nutrition, parent support |

**Cost**: $50 billion annually (full funding)
**Evidence**: Early Head Start shows cognitive and behavioral gains

### Home Visiting Programs

**Models with evidence**:

- Nurse-Family Partnership: Nurse visits from pregnancy through age 2
- Parents as Teachers: Parent educators provide support
- Healthy Families America: Targets at-risk families

| Effect | Magnitude |
|--------|-----------|
| Child abuse/neglect | 50% reduction |
| ER visits | 35% reduction |
| School readiness | 25% improvement |
| Maternal employment | 15% increase |

**Cost**: $3,000-5,000 per family per year

### Paid Family Leave

**The gap**: U.S. is only OECD country without national paid leave

| Country | Paid Leave |
|---------|------------|
| United States | 0 weeks (federal) |
| Canada | 35 weeks |
| Germany | 58 weeks |
| Sweden | 68 weeks |
| OECD average | 18 weeks |

**Benefits**:

- Improved infant health and development
- Higher breastfeeding rates
- Maternal employment retention
- Father involvement
- Reduced infant mortality

**Recommended**: 12 weeks paid at 80% of wages, funded by payroll tax

## Educational Opportunity

### School Finance Equalization

Current system: Property taxes fund local schools, creating massive disparities

| Reform Approach | Model States |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Foundation formula | Guarantees minimum per-pupil funding |
| Weighted student funding | More money follows disadvantaged students |
| District consolidation | Reduces between-district inequality |
| State takeover of funding | Eliminates local property tax reliance |

**Evidence**: Court-ordered equalization in states like New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Kansas improved outcomes for low-income students by 10-20%.

### Integration

**Methods**:

- Magnet schools with integration goals
- Controlled choice programs
- Regional consolidation
- Inter-district transfers with transportation

**Evidence**: Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment showed children who moved to low-poverty neighborhoods earned 31% more as adults.

| Barrier to Integration | Solution |
|------------------------|----------|
| Exclusionary zoning | State preemption of local zoning |
| School district boundaries | Regional districts, inter-district choice |
| White flight | Gradual integration, magnet schools |
| Transportation | Funded transportation for transfers |

### College Access and Affordability

**Problem**: College costs have tripled in real terms since 1990

| Reform | Model |
|--------|-------|
| Free community college | Tennessee Promise, New York Excelsior |
| Debt-free public university | Proposed but not implemented |
| Pell Grant expansion | Increase to cover tuition + living expenses |
| Income-driven repayment reform | Cap payments at 5% of discretionary income |
| Reform for-profit regulation | Gainful employment rules, program integrity |

**Recommended package**:

1. Free community college for all
2. Tuition-free public university for families under $125,000
3. Double Pell Grant (to ~$14,000)
4. Automatic income-driven repayment
5. Crack down on for-profit predation

**Cost**: $80-100 billion annually

### Affirmative Action in Admissions

Following Supreme Court restrictions, alternative approaches:

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Class-based affirmative action | Preferences for low-income students |
| Place-based preferences | Preferences for students from high-poverty areas |
| Top X% plans | Guarantee admission to top percentage of each high school |
| Eliminating legacy preferences | Remove advantage for alumni children |
| Test-optional admissions | Reduce SAT/ACT emphasis |

## Housing and Neighborhoods

### Zoning Reform

**Problem**: 75% of residential land in U.S. metros is zoned single-family only

| Reform | Where Enacted |
|--------|---------------|
| Eliminate single-family zoning | Minneapolis, Oregon, California |

| Transit-oriented development | Many states |
| Affordable housing mandates | Inclusionary zoning in 500+ jurisdictions |
| Override local zoning | Massachusetts Chapter 40B, California SB 35 |

**Key reform**: State preemption of exclusionary local zoning

### Housing Mobility Programs

| Moving to Opportunity | +31% adult earnings for young children who moved |

| Third 25% | $20,000 |
