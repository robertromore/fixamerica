# Economic Mobility: History

## Overview

The history of economic mobility in America is a story of three eras: the promise of opportunity in the founding mythology, the genuine (if unequal) mobility of the mid-20th century, and the closing of pathways since 1980. Understanding this history reveals that high mobility is not automatic--it requires deliberate policy choices that the nation has abandoned.

## Colonial and Early Republic (1607-1860)

### The Opportunity Myth

The American colonies were marketed as lands of opportunity, contrasting with the rigid class structures of Europe. There was some truth to this:

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Land availability | Abundant land (seized from Native peoples) enabled farming without aristocratic landlords |
| Labor scarcity | High wages due to labor shortages; skilled artisans in demand |
| Legal structure | No formal aristocracy or primogeniture requirements |
| Immigration selection | Migrants were often risk-takers seeking opportunity |

**However, the opportunity narrative was always partial and exclusionary:**

- **Enslaved Africans**: 20% of the colonial population had zero mobility by design
- **Indentured servants**: Many never completed terms due to death or extended service
- **Women**: Legal coverture eliminated independent economic status
- **Native Americans**: Systematically dispossessed of land and livelihood
- **Property requirements**: Voting and full citizenship required property ownership

### The Jeffersonian Vision

Thomas Jefferson articulated an agrarian vision of opportunity:

> "The small land holders are the most precious part of a state."

Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase (1803) and land policies aimed to create a nation of independent yeoman farmers. The Homestead Act (1862) would later formalize this vision.

**Limits of the vision**:
- Dependent on continuous expansion into Native lands
- Excluded those who could not afford to relocate
- Ignored industrial transformation underway

## Gilded Age (1865-1900)

### Rise of Industrial Capitalism

The post-Civil War era saw:

| Development | Mobility Impact |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Industrialization | Created new wealth but also brutal factory conditions |
| Urbanization | Cities offered opportunity but also slums and exploitation |
| Immigration waves | Millions arrived; some rose, many remained in poverty |
| Robber barons | Extreme concentration of wealth at the top |

### The Horatio Alger Myth

Horatio Alger's "rags to riches" novels (1867-1899) defined American mobility mythology. His stories of bootblacks and newsboys becoming businessmen through "pluck and luck" established an enduring cultural template.

**The reality**:
- Alger's heroes typically rose through patronage of wealthy benefactors
- Statistical mobility in the Gilded Age was lower than mythology suggested
- Most immigrants remained in the working class for generations
- Geographic mobility substituted for economic mobility--moving west rather than up

### Post-Reconstruction Black America

Emancipation promised opportunity but reality intervened:

| Promise | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "40 acres and a mule" | Land redistribution abandoned; most freedpeople became sharecroppers |
| Citizenship | Black Codes and later Jim Crow restricted economic participation |
| Education | Freedmen's Bureau schools systematically underfunded |
| Political power | Disenfranchisement completed by 1900 |

**The failure to provide economic foundation at emancipation created wealth gaps that persist today.**

## Progressive Era and Early 20th Century (1900-1929)

### Reform and Regulation

The Progressive Era addressed some barriers to mobility:

| Reform | Mobility Impact |
|--------|-----------------|
| Antitrust (Sherman, Clayton Acts) | Reduced monopoly power, opened markets |
| Labor protections | Child labor laws, worker safety regulations |
| Public education expansion | High school became standard for middle class |
| Immigration restrictions (1924) | Reduced labor competition but also closed opportunity for others |

### The Great Migration

From 1910-1970, approximately 6 million Black Americans left the South for northern and western cities. This represented a massive exercise in seeking opportunity:

**Gains**:
- Escape from Jim Crow violence and political disenfranchisement
- Higher wages in industrial jobs
- Access to better schools and services
- Political participation restored

**Limitations**:
- Residential segregation in northern cities
- Discrimination in unions and skilled trades
- Racial covenants and redlining
- Northern de facto segregation replaced southern de jure segregation

## The Great Compression (1940-1970)

### The Golden Age of Mobility

The mid-20th century represents the peak of American economic mobility:

| Metric | 1940-1970 Period |
|--------|------------------|
| Absolute mobility | 92% (1940 birth cohort) |
| Income inequality (Gini) | Declined from 0.45 to 0.35 |
| Wage growth (bottom 90%) | 3.5% annually |
| Union membership | Peaked at 35% |
| College enrollment | Tripled |

**This was not accidental.** It resulted from deliberate policies:

### New Deal Foundations

| Policy | Mobility Effect |
|--------|-----------------|
| Social Security (1935) | Prevented downward mobility in old age |
| Fair Labor Standards Act (1938) | Minimum wage, overtime, child labor prohibition |
| Wagner Act (1935) | Enabled union organizing |
| GI Bill (1944) | Opened college and homeownership to millions |
| Federal Housing Administration | Made mortgages accessible (but with racial exclusions) |

### Post-War Investment

| Investment | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| GI Bill education benefits | 7.8 million veterans attended college or training |
| Highway system | Enabled suburban development and mobility |
| Research and development | Created technology industries |
| Public university expansion | State universities became accessible |
| Progressive taxation | Top marginal rates above 90% funded investment |

### Who Was Included

**The golden age had stark racial limits:**

| Benefit | White Access | Black Access |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| GI Bill housing | FHA-backed mortgages in suburbs | Redlined out of most programs |
| GI Bill education | Universities open | Many universities segregated |
| Union membership | Full access | Excluded from many trades |
| Social Security | Full coverage | Agricultural/domestic workers excluded |
| Suburban homeownership | Racial covenants enforced | Restricted to urban ghettos |

**White mobility in this era was subsidized by the state; Black exclusion from those subsidies is the origin of today's wealth gap.**

### Women in the Golden Age

Women's mobility was also constrained:

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Marriage bars | Many employers fired women upon marriage |
| Educational tracking | Directed toward "female" occupations |
| Credit discrimination | Could not obtain credit without male co-signer |
| Occupational segregation | Limited to teaching, nursing, clerical work |

## Civil Rights Era (1954-1975)

### Opening Doors

The Civil Rights Movement directly addressed mobility barriers:

| Legislation | Mobility Impact |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Brown v. Board (1954) | Desegregated schools (slowly, incompletely) |
| Civil Rights Act (1964) | Prohibited employment discrimination |
| Voting Rights Act (1965) | Enabled political participation |
| Fair Housing Act (1968) | Prohibited housing discrimination |
| Equal Credit Opportunity Act (1974) | Prohibited credit discrimination |

### Black Economic Progress

The period 1960-1980 saw genuine gains:

| Metric | 1960 | 1980 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Black-white income ratio | 55% | 64% | +9 points |
| Black college enrollment | 4% | 11% | +7 points |
| Black poverty rate | 55% | 32% | -23 points |
| Black homeownership | 38% | 44% | +6 points |

**Convergence stalled after 1980 and in some measures reversed.**

### War on Poverty

Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs targeted mobility:

| Program | Status Today |
|---------|--------------|
| Head Start | Underfunded but surviving |
| Medicare | Successful, popular |
| Medicaid | Expanded under ACA |
| Food Stamps (SNAP) | Successful, attacks ongoing |
| Job Corps | Reduced funding |
| Community Action | Largely dismantled |

## The Great Divergence (1980-Present)

### Policy Shifts

Beginning in 1980, policy reversed course:

| Pre-1980 | Post-1980 |
|----------|-----------|
| Progressive taxation | Tax cuts concentrated at top |
| Union support | Union busting |
| Manufacturing investment | Financialization, offshoring |
| Public investment | Austerity, privatization |
| Universal programs | Means-tested programs |

### Results

| Metric | 1980 | 2020 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Top 1% income share | 10% | 21% | +11 points |
| Union membership | 23% | 10% | -13 points |
| College wage premium | 40% | 80% | +40 points |
| Absolute mobility | 92% (1940) | 50% (1980) | -42 points |
| CEO-worker pay ratio | 30:1 | 350:1 | 12x increase |

### Mass Incarceration

The war on drugs and tough-on-crime policies created a new mobility barrier:

| Year | Incarceration Rate (per 100,000) |
|------|----------------------------------|
| 1970 | 160 |
| 1990 | 460 |
| 2010 | 740 |
| 2020 | 630 |

**The U.S. went from incarceration rates similar to other democracies to the highest in the world.** This disproportionately affected Black and brown communities, destroying mobility for millions of families.

### The Chetty Revolution

Raj Chetty's research (2013-present) transformed understanding of mobility:

**Key findings**:
1. Place matters enormously--where you grow up predicts outcomes
2. Racial gaps persist controlling for income
3. Mobility has declined primarily due to inequality, not growth
4. Some places achieve high mobility--it is not inevitable
5. Early childhood is the critical period

This research provided the empirical foundation for evidence-based policy.

## Lessons from History

### What Created High Mobility

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Shared growth | Rising tide that actually lifted boats |
| Universal programs | GI Bill, Social Security, public education |
| Worker power | Unions compressed wage distribution |
| Public investment | Infrastructure, research, education |
| Regulatory constraint | Antitrust, financial regulation |

### What Destroyed Mobility

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Inequality | Gains concentrated at top |
| Disinvestment | Public goods defunded |
| Deunionization | Worker power destroyed |
| Mass incarceration | Millions excluded from economy |
| Racialized exclusion | Historic gains undermined |

### The Selective Memory Problem

American mythology remembers the 1950s as a golden age of mobility while forgetting:
- It was built on explicit government intervention
- It required high taxes on the wealthy
- It was racially exclusive
- It required strong unions
- It was created, not natural

**The policies that created mid-century mobility are now labeled "socialism" when proposed today.**
