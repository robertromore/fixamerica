# Economic Mobility: Opposition

## Overview

Proposals to increase economic mobility face determined opposition from those who benefit from the status quo, those who genuinely believe in individual responsibility ideology, and those who fear change. Understanding these opposition arguments--and their flaws--is essential for effective advocacy.

## Ideological Opposition

### "Mobility Is Already High"

**The Argument**: America remains the land of opportunity; anyone who works hard can succeed; the American Dream is alive.

| Claim | Evidence Against |
|-------|------------------|
| "Rags to riches happens all the time" | Only 7.5% move from bottom to top quintile |
| "Immigrants prove mobility works" | Immigrant selection effect; second generation often stagnates |
| "I know people who made it" | Anecdotes don't represent statistics |
| "Surveys show people believe in mobility" | Belief doesn't make it true |

**Counter**: International comparisons show U.S. ranks near bottom in mobility. Raj Chetty's data is comprehensive and damning. The American Dream is a myth sustained by selective memory and survivor bias.

### "Inequality Isn't the Problem"

**The Argument**: Focus on mobility, not equality. A rising tide lifts all boats. Inequality is the price of growth.

| Claim | Evidence Against |
|-------|------------------|
| "Growth benefits everyone" | 90% of income gains since 1980 went to top 10% |
| "Inequality motivates achievement" | Great Gatsby Curve shows inequality reduces mobility |
| "Nordic countries have lower growth" | False; comparable or higher growth rates |
| "Redistribution kills incentives" | No evidence high taxes reduce growth |

**Counter**: The Great Gatsby Curve demonstrates that inequality and immobility are connected. Countries with less inequality have more mobility. The "rising tide" stopped lifting middle-class boats 40 years ago.

### "Personal Responsibility, Not Systemic Factors"

**The Argument**: Success comes from choices--education, work ethic, family structure. Poverty is caused by bad choices, not systems.

| Claim | Evidence Against |
|-------|------------------|
| "Just get an education" | Educational access is determined by birth circumstances |
| "Stay married, don't have kids young" | Family structure is effect, not just cause, of poverty |
| "Work hard and you'll succeed" | Poor people work more hours than rich people |
| "Don't do drugs or commit crimes" | Addiction and criminality correlate with childhood adversity |

**Counter**: "Choices" are constrained by circumstances. A child born in a poor neighborhood with failing schools and no healthcare does not have the same choices as a child born wealthy. Blaming individuals for systemic failures is intellectually dishonest.

### "Government Programs Make Things Worse"

**The Argument**: Welfare creates dependency. Government intervention distorts markets. Private charity is more effective.

| Claim | Evidence Against |
|-------|------------------|
| "Welfare creates dependency" | No evidence of widespread dependency; benefits are inadequate |
| "Markets allocate opportunity best" | Markets replicate and amplify existing inequality |
| "Government is inefficient" | Medicare has lower overhead than private insurance |
| "Private charity can handle it" | Charity totals ~$500B; federal anti-poverty spending is $1T |

**Counter**: The most mobile societies (Nordic countries) have the largest governments. American safety net is among the weakest in the developed world--and mobility is lowest. The "dependency" argument has no empirical support.

## Material Self-Interest Opposition

### Suburban Homeowner Opposition

**What they say**: "We worked hard for our homes. We don't want our property values to decline. We moved here for the schools."

**What they mean**: "We benefit from exclusion and don't want to share."

| Stated Concern | Actual Interest |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "Protect property values" | Maintain scarcity premium |
| "Preserve neighborhood character" | Exclude lower-income, minority families |
| "Protect our schools" | Hoard educational resources |
| "Prevent congestion/parking issues" | Rationalize exclusion |

**Counter**: Regional prosperity benefits everyone. Exclusionary communities create traffic (workers must commute from far away), reduce economic dynamism, and harm their own children by limiting exposure to diversity.

### Elite University Opposition

**What they say**: "We value diversity but must maintain excellence. Legacy admissions support our mission. We provide generous financial aid."

**What they mean**: "We benefit from exclusivity and wealthy alumni."

| Stated Concern | Actual Interest |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "Academic standards" | Selectivity as marketing |
| "Financial sustainability" | Legacy giving |
| "Holistic admissions" | Discretion to favor wealthy |
| "Demonstrated interest" | Screen out poor students who can't visit |

**Counter**: Elite institutions claim to value diversity while practices systematically favor the wealthy. Legacy admissions have no academic justification. Holistic admissions is a black box that produces racially and economically skewed results.

### Wealthy Opposition to Taxation

**What they say**: "High taxes punish success. Death taxes destroy family businesses. We already pay most of the taxes."

**What they mean**: "We want to transmit advantage to our children without constraint."

| Stated Concern | Actual Interest |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "Punishes success" | Preserve unearned inheritance |
| "Double taxation" | Avoid any taxation of capital |
| "Family businesses destroyed" | 99.9% of estates not affected |
| "We create jobs" | Wealth concentration is the problem |

**Counter**: Concentrated wealth is inherently anti-mobility. Inheritance is not "earned" by the recipient. Estate tax affects only the very wealthiest 0.1%. Family farm/business arguments are almost entirely mythological.

### Criminal Justice Industry Opposition

**What they say**: "Public safety requires incarceration. Criminals made choices. Victims deserve justice."

**What they mean**: "We profit from incarceration."

| Stated Concern | Actual Interest |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "Public safety" | Prison contracts, jobs |
| "Personal responsibility" | Continue filling beds |
| "Victims' rights" | Not actually served by mass incarceration |
| "Rehabilitation doesn't work" | No investment in rehabilitation |

**Counter**: Mass incarceration has not improved public safety--crime rates are uncorrelated with incarceration rates. The U.S. incarcerates at 6x European rates with similar or higher crime. Incarceration destroys mobility for millions.

## Political Opposition

### Conservative Opposition

**Core arguments**:
1. Markets, not government, create opportunity
2. Social programs create dependency
3. Individual choices, not systems, determine outcomes
4. Redistribution is unfair to those who "earned" their wealth

**Funding sources**: Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, American Enterprise Institute, funded by Koch network, Olin Foundation, Bradley Foundation

**Political expression**: Opposition to increased spending, tax increases, affirmative action, desegregation efforts

### Moderate/Centrist Opposition

**Core arguments**:
1. Change is risky; incremental reform is better
2. Programs must be "evidence-based" (requiring impossibly high standards)
3. Can't afford major new investments
4. Need bipartisan support (knowing it won't come)

**Effect**: Constant dilution of proposals; compromise to ineffectiveness; means-testing that stigmatizes and excludes

**Political expression**: Support for "opportunity" rhetoric without funding commitment; emphasis on education without structural change

### NIMBY Opposition

**Core arguments**:
1. Local control is democratic
2. Community character matters
3. Density brings problems
4. "We were here first"

**Funding sources**: Local homeowner associations, real estate industry, suburban political machines

**Political expression**: Opposition to zoning reform, affordable housing mandates, regional planning

## Rhetorical Strategies

### Dog Whistles

| Phrase | Actual Meaning |
|--------|----------------|
| "Welfare queen" | Black women gaming the system |
| "Inner city" | Black neighborhoods |
| "Culture of poverty" | Poor people's values are deficient |
| "Personal responsibility" | Blame the poor |
| "School choice" | Escape from integration |
| "Neighborhood character" | White and wealthy |

### Misdirection

| Misdirection | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| "Education is the answer" | Ignore structural barriers |
| "Marriage promotion" | Blame family structure, not economics |
| "Financial literacy" | Blame poor people's budgeting |
| "Entrepreneurship" | Ignore need for capital, networks |

### False Trade-offs

| False Trade-off | Reality |
|-----------------|---------|
| "Equality vs. growth" | Equality enhances growth |
| "Helping poor vs. helping middle class" | Both can be helped |
| "Opportunity vs. outcomes" | Outcomes reveal opportunity |
| "Merit vs. equity" | System blocks merit for many |

## Countering Opposition

### For Individual Responsibility Arguments

- Acknowledge the role of individual effort while insisting on fair starting points
- Use concrete examples: "Should a child's future depend on their zip code?"
- Emphasize equality of opportunity, not outcomes
- Ask: "What would you do if born into those circumstances?"

### For Anti-Government Arguments

- Point to successful government programs: GI Bill, Social Security, Medicare
- Note that the most mobile countries have larger governments
- Emphasize that markets are created by governments
- Ask: "What's the private sector alternative?"

### For Suburban Opposition

- Emphasize regional economic benefits
- Point to research showing diverse communities benefit everyone
- Appeal to values of fairness and the American Dream
- Propose solutions that add housing without changing existing neighborhoods

### For Fiscal Concerns

- Calculate costs of immobility (crime, health, lost productivity)
- Show return on investment of proven programs
- Propose funding through wealth taxes, not middle-class taxes
- Emphasize long-term savings from prevention

## Building Unlikely Alliances

| Potential Ally | Shared Interest | Approach |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Business community | Workforce quality | Frame mobility as economic development |
| Libertarians | Criminal justice reform | Emphasize freedom from state oppression |
| Religious conservatives | Family values | Frame poverty as family stressor |
| Suburban moderates | Opportunity for own children | Show mobility benefits everyone |
| Fiscal conservatives | Reduce poverty spending | Emphasize investment over dependency |
