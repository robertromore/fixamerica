# Economic Mobility: Root Causes

## Overview

The decline of economic mobility in America is not mysterious. It results from identifiable structural factors that systematically advantage those born into privilege while creating barriers for everyone else. These causes are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, creating a system that perpetuates inequality across generations.

## Residential Segregation

### The Neighborhood Effect

Where you grow up determines your life outcomes more than almost any other factor:

| Neighborhood Characteristic | Impact on Adult Income |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Moving from poor to rich neighborhood (childhood) | +10-12 percentile points |
| Each year in better neighborhood (before age 23) | +0.5 percentile points |
| Racial segregation level | -3-5 percentile points |
| Poverty concentration | -2-4 percentile points |

**Neighborhoods transmit advantage or disadvantage through:**
- School quality
- Peer effects and networks
- Exposure to violence and trauma
- Access to jobs and services
- Role models and expectations

### How Segregation Is Maintained

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Exclusionary zoning | Single-family requirements, lot minimums, height limits |
| School district boundaries | Wealthy neighborhoods create separate districts |
| Real estate steering | Agents direct families to "appropriate" neighborhoods |
| Mortgage discrimination | Continued disparities in lending |
| NIMBYism | Residents block affordable housing |
| Infrastructure investment | Public resources concentrated in wealthy areas |

### The Opportunity Hoarding Problem

Wealthy communities systematically exclude others:

| Exclusion Tool | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| Property taxes fund schools | Rich districts have $20,000+ per pupil; poor districts under $10,000 |
| Minimum lot sizes | 2-5 acre minimums make housing unaffordable |
| Permit restrictions | Apartments, townhomes prohibited in 75% of residential land |
| Historic preservation | Used to block density and new construction |

**This is not accidental.** These policies were designed to maintain class and racial segregation.

## Educational Inequality

### Unequal Schools

School quality varies dramatically by neighborhood:

| Factor | Low-Income Schools | High-Income Schools |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Per-pupil spending | $11,000 | $25,000+ |
| Teacher experience | 50% < 5 years | 15% < 5 years |
| Teacher turnover | 22% annually | 8% annually |
| Advanced courses | Few or none | Full offerings |
| Counselor ratio | 1:500+ | 1:200 |
| Facilities | Often deteriorating | Modern, well-equipped |

### The Preparation Gap

By the time children reach school, gaps already exist:

| Measure | Low-Income | High-Income | Gap |
|---------|------------|-------------|-----|
| Kindergarten readiness | 42% | 76% | 34 points |
| Summer learning loss | -2 months/year | +1 month/year | 3 months/year |
| Reading proficiency (Grade 4) | 21% | 56% | 35 points |
| High school graduation | 78% | 94% | 16 points |

### Higher Education Barriers

| Barrier | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Legacy admissions | Children of alumni 4x more likely to be admitted at elite schools |
| Early decision | Advantages those who don't need financial aid comparison |
| Test prep industry | $10,000+ packages give wealthy students edge |
| Unpaid internships | Only accessible to those who can afford to work free |
| Geographic proximity | Poor students less likely to apply to selective schools |

**Elite colleges reinforce class stratification rather than disrupting it.**

## Wealth Concentration

### Wealth Begets Wealth

| Starting Wealth | Advantages Conferred |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Inheritance | Direct transfer of resources |
| Home down payment | Parents fund entry to wealth-building |
| Education funding | No debt burden at graduation |
| Risk tolerance | Can start businesses, take risks |
| Network access | Connections to opportunity |
| Geographic flexibility | Can relocate for opportunity |

### The Compounding Problem

| Scenario | Result After 30 Years |
|----------|----------------------|
| Start with $50,000, 7% return | $380,000 |
| Start with $0, save $200/month, 7% return | $227,000 |
| Start with $50,000, save $200/month, 7% return | $607,000 |

**Starting wealth creates a permanent advantage that labor cannot overcome.**

### Tax Advantages for Wealth

| Tax Provision | Who Benefits |
|---------------|--------------|
| Capital gains rate (20%) | Those with investment income |
| Step-up in basis at death | Heirs pay no tax on lifetime gains |
| Estate tax exemption ($12.9M) | Only 0.1% of estates taxed |
| Carried interest loophole | Private equity managers |
| 401(k)/IRA limits | Those with income to save |
| Mortgage interest deduction | Homeowners (larger for bigger mortgages) |

## Labor Market Discrimination

### Documented Disparities

Audit studies reveal systematic discrimination:

| Study Finding | Magnitude |
|---------------|-----------|
| "White" names vs "Black" names on resumes | 50% more callbacks for white names |
| Criminal record effect (white applicant) | 17% reduction in callbacks |
| Criminal record effect (Black applicant) | 28% reduction in callbacks |
| Black applicants without criminal record | Same callbacks as white applicants with record |

### Occupational Segregation

| Occupation Category | White | Black | Hispanic |
|-----------------------|-------|-------|----------|
| Management | 86% | 8% | 9% |
| Construction trades | 72% | 6% | 30% |
| Healthcare practitioners | 77% | 12% | 8% |
| Service occupations | 58% | 17% | 22% |
| Building/grounds cleaning | 42% | 13% | 44% |

**High-paying jobs remain disproportionately white, while Black and Hispanic workers are concentrated in lower-paid sectors.**

### Network-Based Hiring

| Hiring Method | Share of Jobs Filled |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Referrals/networks | 50-70% |
| Online applications | 20-30% |
| Recruiters | 10-15% |
| Other | 5-10% |

**When most jobs are filled through networks, those with access to professional networks (predominantly white, wealthy) have enormous advantages.**

## Mass Incarceration

### The Incarceration Crisis

| Statistic | United States | OECD Average |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Incarceration rate | 630 per 100,000 | 115 per 100,000 |
| Black male incarceration rate | 2,300 per 100,000 | N/A |
| Lifetime incarceration risk (Black men) | 1 in 3 | N/A |
| Lifetime incarceration risk (White men) | 1 in 17 | N/A |

### Effects on Mobility

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Lost wages during incarceration | Average 2 years lost income |
| Reduced earnings post-release | 40% lower wages, 50% less work |
| Collateral consequences | 40,000+ legal barriers to employment, housing, benefits |
| Family destabilization | Children of incarcerated parents earn 25% less |
| Disenfranchisement | Millions cannot vote |
| Student aid ineligibility | Drug convictions bar financial aid |

### Geographic Concentration

Incarceration is concentrated in the same neighborhoods that already face immobility:

| Neighborhood Characteristic | Correlation with Incarceration Rate |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Poverty rate | +0.65 |
| Residential segregation | +0.58 |
| Unemployment rate | +0.52 |
| Single-parent families | +0.48 |

**Incarceration removes earners from communities already lacking resources, creating a downward spiral.**

## Healthcare Insecurity

### Health as Mobility Barrier

| Health Event | Mobility Impact |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Serious illness without insurance | 50% experience medical bankruptcy |
| Childhood chronic illness | 25% lower adult earnings |
| Mental health condition | 40% less likely to complete college |
| Disability onset | 30% drop in family income |

### The Insurance Gap

| Coverage Status | Share of Population | Health Outcomes |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Employer insurance | 55% | Best access |
| Medicare/Medicaid | 35% | Variable access |
| Uninsured | 9% | Delayed care, worse outcomes |
| Underinsured | 22% | High cost barriers |

**Health shocks push families into poverty; lack of healthcare prevents recovery.**

## Early Childhood Deprivation

### The Critical Period

Brain development in the first five years shapes lifetime outcomes:

| Factor | Low-Income Children | High-Income Children |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Words heard daily | 600 | 2,000+ |
| Vocabulary at age 3 | 525 words | 1,100 words |
| Chronic stress exposure | High | Low |
| Food insecurity | 1 in 6 | 1 in 50 |
| Quality childcare access | 9% | 50%+ |

### Maternal and Infant Health

| Outcome | U.S. | OECD Average |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Maternal mortality | 24 per 100,000 | 7 per 100,000 |
| Infant mortality | 5.4 per 1,000 | 3.5 per 1,000 |
| Low birthweight | 8% | 6% |
| Premature birth | 10% | 7% |

**The U.S. has worse maternal and infant health than peer countries, with poor and Black mothers bearing the greatest burden.**

## Policy Design Failures

### Why Programs Fail to Build Mobility

| Design Flaw | Examples | Effect |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Benefits cliffs | Medicaid, SNAP, childcare subsidies | Disincentive to earn more |
| Asset limits | Welfare programs | Prevents wealth building |
| Time limits | TANF | Arbitrary cutoffs regardless of need |
| Complex enrollment | All programs | Eligible families don't receive benefits |
| Stigmatization | Welfare programs | Discourages participation |
| Means testing | Most U.S. programs | Administrative burden, excludes near-poor |

### Fragmented Support

| Life Stage | Support Available | Gap |
|------------|-------------------|-----|
| Prenatal | Limited Medicaid | No universal healthcare |
| 0-3 years | Head Start (7% coverage) | No universal childcare |
| 3-5 years | Pre-K (34% coverage) | Not universal |
| K-12 | Public school (unequal quality) | No equalization |
| 18-22 | Some financial aid | Unaffordable college |
| Working age | Limited safety net | No universal support |

**Other developed countries provide continuous support; the U.S. provides fragmented, inadequate, stigmatized programs.**

## Structural Racism

### How Race Compounds Other Factors

Every barrier to mobility is worse for Black Americans:

| Factor | White Experience | Black Experience |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Neighborhood quality | Moderate segregation | Hypersegregation |
| School quality | Variable | Systematically worse |
| Wealth inheritance | Some | Minimal |
| Employment discrimination | Limited | Pervasive |
| Incarceration risk | 1 in 17 | 1 in 3 |
| Healthcare access | Better | Worse |
| Lending discrimination | Limited | Pervasive |

### The Historical Overhang

| Historical Policy | Ongoing Effect |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Slavery | Wealth gap, geographic concentration |
| Sharecropping | Agricultural exclusion |
| Jim Crow | Regional underdevelopment |
| Redlining | Neighborhood quality, homeownership |
| Urban renewal | Community destruction |
| Mass incarceration | Family destabilization |

**Race is not a separate factor--it amplifies every other barrier.**

## Summary: The Mobility-Killing System

These root causes form an interlocking system:

```
Residential Segregation
        ↓
Unequal Schools → Limited Human Capital
        ↓
Employment Discrimination → Lower Wages
        ↓
No Wealth Accumulation → Cannot Help Children
        ↓
Children Born into Same Conditions
        ↓
Cycle Repeats
```

**Breaking this cycle requires attacking multiple points simultaneously, not one reform at a time.**
