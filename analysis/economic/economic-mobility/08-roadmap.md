# Economic Mobility: Roadmap

## Overview

Restoring economic mobility in America requires a multi-decade commitment across federal, state, and local levels. This roadmap presents a sequenced strategy that builds political momentum through quick wins, establishes institutional capacity, and ultimately achieves systemic transformation.

## Strategic Principles

### Sequencing Logic

1. **Start with universal programs**: They build broader political coalitions than targeted programs
2. **Lead with children**: Everyone supports opportunity for children; harder to oppose
3. **Build on success**: Demonstrate effectiveness before expanding
4. **State laboratories first**: Test approaches at state level before federal
5. **Multiple fronts simultaneously**: No single intervention is sufficient

### Political Constraints

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Senate filibuster | Prioritize budget reconciliation-eligible items |
| SCOTUS hostility | Design around constitutional limits |
| State resistance | Build coalitions in friendly states first |
| Funding limits | Phase in programs, demonstrate ROI |
| Opposition messaging | Lead with opportunity, not redistribution |

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-3)

### Federal Actions (Unified Government)

## Political Strategy

### Messaging Framework

**Core message**: "Every child deserves a fair shot, no matter their zip code or their parents' bank account."

| Frame | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Opportunity | Appeals across political spectrum |
| Children | Hardest to oppose |
| American Dream | Invokes shared values |
| Waste of talent | Economic argument |
| Fairness | Moral argument |

**Avoid**:

- "Redistribution" (triggers opposition)
- "Reparations" (divisive until groundwork laid)
- "Socialism" (let opponents say it, don't own it)
- Technical jargon (IGE, quintiles, etc.)

### Coalition Maintenance

| Constituency | Priority Issue |
|--------------|----------------|
| Black communities | Racial equity, reparations consideration |
| Working class | Jobs, wages, healthcare |
| Suburban moderates | Education, property values |
| Youth | Student debt, climate |
| Seniors | Social Security, Medicare |

### Opposition Anticipation

| Attack | Response |
|--------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | Investment pays for itself; costs of inaction higher |
| "Big government" | GI Bill was big government; it worked |
| "Personal responsibility" | We're creating conditions for responsibility |
| "Socialism" | Opportunity is the most American value |
| "Forced integration" | Expanding choice, not forcing |

## Risk Factors

|------|------------|
| Losing unified government | Front-load reconciliation, lock in programs |
| Judicial hostility | Design within constitutional limits |

### Implementation Risks

| Bureaucratic failure | Build capacity, simplify administration |
| Unintended consequences | Pilot testing, gradual rollout |
| Cost overruns | Conservative estimates, contingencies |

### External Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Economic recession | Programs become more needed and popular |
| Pandemic/crisis | Demonstrate value of safety net |
| Technological disruption | Adapt programs to changing economy |
| Climate impacts | Integrate with climate adaptation |

## Success Criteria

| Timeframe | Criterion |

| Year 1 | Major legislation passed |
| Year 3 | Programs operational, initial results positive |
| Year 6 | Expansion based on evidence; state adoption spreading |
| Year 10 | Measurable mobility improvements |
| Year 20 | Generational change; U.S. in top half internationally |
