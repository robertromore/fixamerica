# Economic Mobility: Current State

## Overview

The United States today offers far less economic mobility than its mythology suggests. Children's economic futures are largely determined by their parents' income, their neighborhood, and their race--not by their talent or effort. This represents both a betrayal of American ideals and a tremendous waste of human potential.

## Measuring Mobility

### Intergenerational Elasticity (IGE)

The IGE measures how strongly parents' income predicts children's income. A value of 0 means no relationship (perfect mobility); 1 means complete inheritance (no mobility).

| Country | IGE | Interpretation |
|---------|-----|----------------|
| Denmark | 0.15 | High mobility |
| Canada | 0.19 | High mobility |
| Germany | 0.32 | Moderate mobility |
| France | 0.41 | Moderate mobility |
| **United States** | **0.47** | **Low mobility** |
| United Kingdom | 0.50 | Low mobility |

**The U.S. intergenerational elasticity of 0.47 means that nearly half of income differences persist across generations.** A child born to parents earning $50,000 would, on average, earn about $25,000 more than a child born to parents earning $25,000--even after controlling for their own abilities and choices.

### Absolute Mobility

Absolute mobility measures whether children earn more than their parents did at the same age, adjusted for inflation.

| Birth Year | Percent Earning More Than Parents |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| 1940 | 92% |
| 1950 | 79% |
| 1960 | 68% |
| 1970 | 61% |
| 1980 | 50% |
| 1990 (projected) | 45% |

**The share of Americans earning more than their parents has fallen by nearly half in 40 years.** This decline is primarily due to rising inequality rather than slowing GDP growth. If growth had been distributed as evenly as in the 1940-1970 period, 80% of the 1980 cohort would exceed their parents' income.

### Transition Probabilities

The probability of reaching different income quintiles based on birth quintile:

| Born in Bottom Fifth | Reach Top Fifth | Stay in Bottom Fifth |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| United States | 7.5% | 33.7% |
| Denmark | 11.7% | 25.2% |
| Canada | 13.5% | 26.8% |
| United Kingdom | 9.0% | 30.3% |

**An American child born poor has less than an 8% chance of becoming rich--and a one-in-three chance of remaining poor.** These are worse odds than in peer countries.

## Geographic Variation

### The Opportunity Atlas

Raj Chetty's research reveals enormous variation in mobility across the United States. Some places function as "opportunity deserts" while others reliably lift children out of poverty.

**Best Places for Upward Mobility** (Expected income rank for child born at 25th percentile):

| Location | Expected Income Rank |
|----------|----------------------|
| Dunn County, ND | 60th percentile |
| Sioux County, IA | 58th percentile |
| Lincoln County, SD | 56th percentile |
| Slope County, ND | 55th percentile |
| Hyde County, SD | 54th percentile |

**Worst Places for Upward Mobility**:

| Location | Expected Income Rank |
|----------|----------------------|
| Shannon County, SD (Pine Ridge) | 17th percentile |
| Todd County, SD (Rosebud) | 18th percentile |
| Oglala Lakota County, SD | 19th percentile |
| Baltimore City, MD | 24th percentile |
| East St. Louis, IL | 25th percentile |

**Key finding**: A child born poor in Dunn County, ND will, on average, reach the 60th percentile of income--essentially entering the upper-middle class. A child born poor in Baltimore will remain in the 24th percentile--barely escaping deep poverty.

### What Predicts High-Mobility Places?

Chetty's research identifies five factors strongly correlated with upward mobility:

| Factor | Correlation with Mobility |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Less residential segregation | +0.37 |
| Less income inequality | +0.32 |
| Better schools (test scores) | +0.31 |
| More two-parent families | +0.29 |
| More social capital | +0.28 |

**Notably absent**: Local tax rates, government spending levels, and labor market conditions show weak correlations. **Place matters because of social and institutional factors, not just economics.**

## Racial Disparities

### The Black-White Mobility Gap

Perhaps the most disturbing finding of mobility research is the persistence of racial gaps even controlling for family income.

**Expected adult income rank for children by race and parental income**:

| Parental Income Percentile | White Children | Black Children | Gap |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----|
| 25th (poor) | 46th | 35th | 11 points |
| 50th (middle) | 55th | 42nd | 13 points |
| 75th (upper-middle) | 63rd | 50th | 13 points |
| 100th (wealthy) | 75th | 58th | 17 points |

**Black children from wealthy families have the same average adult income as white children from poor families.** This is not a class issue alone--it is fundamentally about race.

### Downward Mobility by Race

Black children also experience more downward mobility:

| Scenario | Black | White |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Born rich (top quintile), stay rich | 18% | 41% |
| Born rich, fall to bottom quintile | 19% | 7% |
| Born middle (third quintile), fall to bottom | 23% | 13% |

**Black families cannot maintain wealth across generations at the same rate as white families.** High-income Black families regress to the mean much faster.

### Black Men vs. Black Women

The mobility gap is driven primarily by Black men:

| Parental Income Percentile | Black Men | White Men | Black Women | White Women |
|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 25th | 34th | 45th | 36th | 46th |
| 75th | 48th | 63rd | 52nd | 63rd |

**Black women have similar or slightly better outcomes than white women.** The crisis is concentrated among Black men, who face unique barriers: discrimination in labor markets, mass incarceration, police violence, and fewer neighborhood role models.

### Hispanic and Asian Mobility

| Group | Intergenerational Mobility | Notes |
|-------|---------------------------|-------|
| Asian American | Higher than white | Selection effects: immigrants are high-achieving |
| Hispanic | Moderate (converging) | Second generation shows significant gains |
| White | Baseline | Varies significantly by class and region |
| Black | Much lower | Persistent across all income levels |
| Native American | Lowest | Concentrated poverty on reservations |

## Education Gaps

### School Quality by Neighborhood

School quality varies enormously by neighborhood wealth:

| Neighborhood Income Quintile | Average Test Score (Percentile) |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Bottom 20% | 32nd |
| Second 20% | 42nd |
| Middle 20% | 50th |
| Fourth 20% | 58th |
| Top 20% | 68th |

**A child in a poor neighborhood attends a school that performs at the 32nd percentile--36 points lower than a child in a wealthy neighborhood.** This gap has remained roughly constant for decades.

### College Completion by Parental Income

| Parental Income Quartile | College Enrollment | Bachelor's by Age 25 |
|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Bottom 25% | 50% | 11% |
| Second 25% | 60% | 19% |
| Third 25% | 72% | 36% |
| Top 25% | 84% | 58% |

**A child from a wealthy family is five times more likely to complete college than a child from a poor family.** This gap has widened over time as college has become more expensive and competitive.

### Elite College Access

Representation at "Ivy Plus" institutions (Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, Duke, Chicago):

| Parental Income | Share of Students | Share of Population |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Top 1% | 15% | 1% |
| Top 10% | 67% | 10% |
| Bottom 50% | 4% | 50% |

**Elite colleges have more students from the top 1% than the bottom 50%.** These institutions are engines of elite reproduction, not social mobility.

## Wealth and Homeownership

### Homeownership by Race

| Race | Homeownership Rate | Median Home Equity |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| White | 74% | $230,000 |
| Black | 44% | $110,000 |
| Hispanic | 49% | $130,000 |
| Asian | 61% | $250,000 |

**Black families have half the homeownership rate of white families and less than half the home equity.** This reflects decades of redlining, discrimination, and exclusionary zoning.

### Wealth by Race

| Race | Median Family Wealth | Mean Family Wealth |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| White | $188,200 | $983,400 |
| Black | $24,100 | $142,500 |
| Hispanic | $36,100 | $165,500 |

**The median Black family has 13 cents for every dollar of white family wealth.** This gap has not meaningfully narrowed since the Civil Rights era and prevents wealth transfer across generations.

### Intergenerational Wealth Transfers

| Parental Wealth Quintile | Probability Child Receives Inheritance | Median Inheritance |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Top 20% | 52% | $195,000 |
| Fourth 20% | 43% | $78,000 |
| Middle 20% | 36% | $46,000 |
| Second 20% | 28% | $24,000 |
| Bottom 20% | 16% | $5,000 |

**Wealthy families transmit wealth directly through inheritance, not just through human capital.** This makes the "born on third base" metaphor literal.

## Early Childhood

### Brain Development and Income

| Measure | Low-Income Children | High-Income Children |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Words heard by age 3 | 30 million fewer | Baseline |
| Vocabulary at age 3 | 525 words | 1,100 words |
| Kindergarten readiness | 42% ready | 76% ready |

**The opportunity gap opens before children enter school.** Low-income children arrive at kindergarten already behind and rarely catch up.

### Early Childhood Program Access

| Program | Coverage of Eligible Children |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Head Start | 36% |
| Early Head Start | 7% |
| State Pre-K (3-4 year olds) | 34% |
| High-quality childcare | 9% (low-income families) |

**Most low-income children lack access to early childhood programs.** This contrasts sharply with peer countries where universal pre-K is the norm.

## Incarceration and Mobility

### Incarceration Rates

| Group | Incarceration Rate (per 100,000) |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| White men | 400 |
| Hispanic men | 1,000 |
| Black men | 2,300 |

**Black men are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of white men.** This has devastating effects on mobility.

### Effect of Parental Incarceration

| Outcome | Child of Incarcerated Parent | Child of Non-Incarcerated Parent |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| High school graduation | 68% | 85% |
| Adult employment | 72% | 83% |
| Adult poverty rate | 28% | 15% |

**Parental incarceration cuts mobility in half.** It destabilizes families, reduces income, and traumatizes children.

## Student Debt

### Debt by Family Income

| Parental Income Quartile | Average Debt at Graduation | Default Rate (10-year) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Bottom 25% | $32,000 | 22% |
| Second 25% | $29,000 | 14% |
| Third 25% | $26,000 | 8% |
| Top 25% | $21,000 | 4% |

**Poor students borrow more and default more.** Student debt has become a barrier to mobility rather than an enabler of it.

### Debt by Race

| Race | Average Student Debt | Default Rate (12-year) |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Black | $52,000 | 49% |
| White | $30,000 | 21% |
| Hispanic | $33,000 | 31% |

**Black graduates have 73% more debt and more than double the default rate of white graduates.** For-profit college targeting and discrimination in labor markets exacerbate this.

## Summary Statistics

| Measure | United States | Denmark | Canada |
|---------|---------------|---------|--------|
| Intergenerational elasticity | 0.47 | 0.15 | 0.19 |
| Bottom-to-top quintile probability | 7.5% | 11.7% | 13.5% |
| Absolute mobility (1980 cohort) | 50% | ~70% | ~65% |
| Racial income gap persistence | >90% | N/A | ~60% |
| Early childhood program access | 34% | >95% | >70% |

**The United States is an outlier among developed nations in low mobility, and the gap is widening.**
