# Economic Mobility: Overview

## Executive Summary

The American Dream--the promise that anyone can rise through hard work regardless of their origins--is increasingly a myth. The United States, once a leader in upward mobility, now ranks near the bottom among developed nations. A child born into the bottom fifth of the income distribution has only a 7.5% chance of reaching the top fifth--worse odds than in most European countries and Canada.

Economic mobility has declined dramatically since the mid-20th century. For Americans born in 1940, 92% earned more than their parents. For those born in 1980, only 50% do. This is not primarily about individual effort or talent--it is about structural barriers: residential segregation, unequal education, lack of healthcare, mass incarceration, discrimination, and the hoarding of opportunity by the wealthy.

The research is clear: where you are born, who your parents are, and the color of your skin predict your economic future far more than your choices or abilities. This is not inevitable. Countries with stronger social safety nets, universal education, and more equal societies have much higher mobility. The policies that would restore mobility are known. What is lacking is political will.

## Scope

### What This Subtopic Covers

- **Intergenerational mobility**: How economic status transmits across generations
- **Geographic variation**: Why some places enable mobility and others trap people in poverty
- **Absolute vs relative mobility**: The difference between doing better than your parents and moving up in the distribution
- **Racial disparities**: How race interacts with class to determine outcomes
- **Pathways and barriers**: Education, homeownership, incarceration, discrimination
- **Early childhood**: Critical period that shapes lifetime outcomes
- **International comparisons**: How the U.S. compares to other developed nations

### What This Subtopic Does Not Cover

- **Wealth inequality**: Covered in [Wealth Distribution](../wealth-distribution/01-overview.md)
- **Labor market dynamics**: Covered in [Labor Policy](../../labor/01-overview.md)
- **Tax policy**: Covered in [Taxation](../taxation/01-overview.md)
- **Social safety net programs**: Covered in [Social Policy](../../social/01-overview.md)

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Intergenerational elasticity** | Correlation between parents' and children's income; higher values mean less mobility |
| **Absolute mobility** | Probability of earning more than your parents in real terms |
| **Relative mobility** | Probability of moving to a different position in the income distribution |
| **Opportunity Atlas** | Database mapping mobility by neighborhood, developed by Chetty et al. |
| **Great Gatsby Curve** | Relationship between inequality and immobility--more unequal countries have less mobility |
| **Neighborhood effects** | Impact of where you grow up on lifetime outcomes |
| **Human capital** | Skills, education, health, and other personal attributes that affect earning ability |

## Key Questions

1. **How do we measure economic mobility?** What do the different metrics tell us about opportunity in America?

2. **Why has absolute mobility declined?** What changed between the 1940 and 1980 birth cohorts?

3. **Why does place matter so much?** What makes some neighborhoods "opportunity deserts" and others engines of advancement?

4. **How do race and mobility intersect?** Why do Black children from wealthy families often end up poorer than white children from poor families?

5. **What role does education play?** Is it still the great equalizer, or has it become another barrier?

6. **What policies actually increase mobility?** What does evidence show works?

## Why This Matters

The mobility crisis undermines the foundational American promise:

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Anyone can make it with hard work" | Birth circumstances explain most of lifetime earnings |
| "Education is the great equalizer" | School quality varies enormously by neighborhood wealth |
| "The American Dream is alive" | U.S. ranks 27th in intergenerational mobility |
| "Poverty is a choice" | Escaping poverty requires overcoming stacked odds |
| "Meritocracy rewards talent" | Talent without resources is systematically wasted |
| "Each generation does better" | Half of today's children will earn less than their parents |

**This is not about envy or redistribution.** It is about whether the country offers genuine opportunity or merely the illusion of it. Immobility is economically inefficient--talent is wasted, innovation foregone, growth diminished. It is also socially corrosive--people who believe the system is rigged have less faith in institutions and democracy.

## The Opportunity

Mobility can be restored:

- **Proven interventions exist**: Early childhood programs, housing mobility, education investments all work
- **Geographic experiments show the way**: Some places achieve high mobility; their policies can be replicated
- **Research provides a roadmap**: Chetty and others have mapped precisely where and why mobility occurs
- **Bipartisan appeal**: Opportunity is a value shared across the political spectrum
- **Economic benefits**: Higher mobility means higher growth, lower social costs
