# Trade Policy: Opposition

## Who Opposes Trade Reform

Trade policy reform faces opposition from multiple directions: free trade advocates resist any protection; protectionists resist any opening; and specific interests oppose reforms that affect them.

## Arguments Against Trade Protection

### Economic Arguments

**"Tariffs Hurt Consumers"**

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Tariffs are a tax on consumers | True, but jobs/wages matter too |
| Higher prices hurt poor most | Job losses also hurt poor |
| Inflation risk | Can be managed with targeting |
| Retaliation reduces exports | True risk; requires strategy |

**"Protectionism Failed Before"**

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Smoot-Hawley caused Depression | Worsened, didn't cause; context matters |
| Protectionism leads to inefficiency | Some inefficiency acceptable for resilience |
| Can't pick winners | Can identify strategic sectors |
| Comparative advantage works | Only with realistic adjustment |

**"Trade Creates Wealth"**

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Trade increases GDP | Yes, but distribution matters |
| Specialization efficient | Efficiency isn't everything |
| Export jobs are good jobs | But import-competing jobs lost |
| Consumers benefit | Workers are consumers too |

### Economic Analysis

| Claim | Evidence | Counter-Evidence |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Trade deficits don't matter | Standard macro theory | Persistent deficits = lost capacity |
| Jobs would be lost anyway | Technology narrative | China shock was trade-specific |
| Trade adjustment works | Economic models | Empirical evidence of failure |
| Free trade optimal | Theoretical conditions | Conditions don't hold |

## Arguments Against Industrial Policy

### "Government Can't Pick Winners"

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Solyndra failures | Successful programs exist too (DARPA, NIH) |
| Political allocation | Can be insulated from politics |
| Lobbyist capture | Risk exists; requires safeguards |
| Market knows best | Markets fail in strategic sectors |

### "Industrial Policy Is Wasteful"

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Subsidies distort markets | True, but strategic goals matter |
| Cronyism inevitable | Design can limit |
| Other countries' IP fails | China's IP has succeeded in some areas |
| Money better spent elsewhere | Security has value |
