# Trade Policy: Root Causes

## Why Policy Has Failed Workers

American trade policy has consistently benefited corporations and consumers while imposing concentrated costs on workers and communities. This is not accident but design—rooted in structural features of policymaking, economic ideology, and political economy.

## Systemic Factors

### Corporate Capture of Trade Policy

**The Revolving Door**:

| Role | Trade Policy Influence |
|------|----------------------|
| U.S. Trade Representative | Often from business/law firms |
| Trade advisory committees | Dominated by corporate reps |
| Negotiators | Move to lobbying after government |
| Think tanks | Corporate-funded research |

**Trade Advisory Committee Composition (Pre-Reform)**:

| Committee Type | Corporate Reps | Labor Reps | Public Interest |
|----------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Industry SACs | 90%+ | <5% | <5% |
| ACTPN | 85%+ | <10% | <5% |
| ATAC | 95%+ | <5% | <5% |

**Result**: Trade agreements drafted to maximize corporate preferences.

### Economic Ideology

**The Free Trade Consensus**:

| Belief | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Trade always net beneficial | True in aggregate, devastating for losers |
| Workers will adjust | Adjustment far harder than assumed |
| Comparative advantage works | Assumes factors immobile; they're not |
| Markets allocate efficiently | Ignores market failures, power imbalances |
| Rising tide lifts all boats | Tide concentrated gains at top |

**Professional Failure**:

- Economists dismissed distributional concerns
- Models assumed perfect adjustment
- Empirical evidence ignored until too late
- "China Shock" forced reassessment
- Admission: "We got it wrong"

### Political Economy

**Concentrated Benefits, Diffuse Costs**:

| Interest | Organization | Political Power |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Importing corporations | Highly organized | Massive lobbying |
| Export industries | Well organized | Significant lobbying |
| Consumers | Diffuse | Almost none |
| Displaced workers | Geographically dispersed | Weak voice |
| Communities | Local | No national lobby |

**Why Losers Lose**:

- Job losses happen over years (less visible)
- Workers scattered across industries/regions
- No "displaced worker" lobby
- Union decline weakened labor voice
- Media focused on consumer savings

### Asymmetric Information

| Information Advantage | Holder | Effect |
|----------------------|--------|--------|
| Agreement details | Negotiators, corporations | Public can't evaluate |
| Economic modeling | Think tanks | Biased assumptions hidden |
| Impact studies | Agencies, academics | Often after-the-fact |
| Adjustment costs | Not tracked | Ignored in decisions |

## Structural Problems

### Trade Promotion Authority (Fast Track)

**How It Works**:

- President negotiates
- Congress can only vote yes/no
- No amendments allowed
- Limited debate time

**Problems**:

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Executive dominance | Congress marginalized |
| Corporate access | Business shapes negotiations |
| Labor exclusion | Worker interests ignored |
| Transparency | Negotiations secret |
| Urgency | No time for analysis |

### WTO Dispute Resolution

**Structural Weaknesses**:

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Slow process | 2-5 years for resolution |
| Weak remedies | Only future compliance |
| No damages | Past harm uncompensated |
| Appellate Body paralysis | Appeals blocked since 2019 |
| Enforcement gaps | Winners can't enforce |

### Currency Manipulation Tolerance

**Why Currency Manipulation Persisted**:

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Treasury reluctance | Fear of retaliation, market disruption |
| Corporate interests | Cheap imports benefited importers |
| Macroeconomic trade-offs | Low interest rates, cheap goods |
| Diplomatic concerns | Don't anger trading partners |
| Legal complexity | Hard to define "manipulation" |

**Effects of Overvalued Dollar**:

- U.S. exports more expensive
- Imports cheaper
- Manufacturing disadvantage
- Persistent trade deficits
- Job losses

### Intellectual Property Overreach

**IP Provisions in Trade Agreements**:

| Provision | Corporate Benefit | Public Cost |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Extended patents | Pharma profits | Higher drug prices |
| ISDS for IP | Corporate enforcement | Sovereignty concerns |
| Criminal penalties | Strong protection | Chilling effects |
| Data exclusivity | Generic delays | Access problems |

**Who Shapes IP Policy**:

- Pharmaceutical industry
- Entertainment industry
- Technology industry
- NOT consumers, generics, public health

## Political Failures

### Bipartisan Abandonment of Workers

**Democratic Failures**:

- Clinton: NAFTA, China PNTR
- Obama: TPP pursuit
- Assumed gains would trickle down
- Relied on TAA (inadequate)
- Lost working-class voters

**Republican Failures**:

- Pushed free trade aggressively
- Opposed worker protections
- Blocked TAA funding
- Prioritized corporate interests
- Then pivoted to populism (Trump)

### Adjustment Assistance Failure

**Trade Adjustment Assistance Problems**:

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Underfunding | ~$800M annually vs. billions needed |
| Narrow eligibility | Many displaced workers don't qualify |
| Training failures | Programs often ineffective |
| Geographic limits | Workers can't relocate |
| Duration limits | Benefits end too soon |
| Healthcare gaps | Insurance support inadequate |

**What Would Have Been Needed**:

- Universal adjustment assistance
- Wage insurance for career
- Robust healthcare (not tied to employer)
- Community investment
- Place-based policies
- Decades of support

### Enforcement Neglect

**Why Trade Agreements Go Unenforced**:

| Provision | Enforcement Reality |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Labor standards | Almost never enforced |
| Environmental standards | Rarely enforced |
| IP protection | Selectively enforced (for corporations) |
| Currency manipulation | Treasury won't act |
| Subsidies | WTO slow/ineffective |
| Market access | Slow progress |

**Enforcement Resources**:

| Agency | Trade Enforcement Budget | Adequate? |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------|
| USTR | ~$70M | No |
| ITC | Limited | No |
| Commerce (trade remedies) | Limited | No |
| CBP (enforcement) | Customs focus | Trade secondary |

## Ideological Blindness

### Comparative Advantage Assumptions

**What Theory Assumes**:

| Assumption | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Factors can't move across borders | Capital highly mobile |
| Full employment | Displaced workers often never re-employed |
| Adjustment is quick | Takes decades, if ever |
| Countries have different endowments | China had labor AND targeted industries |
| No economies of scale | Scale matters enormously |
| No industrial policy | China has aggressive industrial policy |

### National Security Neglect

**Ignored Until Too Late**:

| Risk | Recognition |
|------|-------------|
| Pharmaceutical dependence | COVID-19 revealed |
| PPE dependence | COVID-19 revealed |
| Semiconductor dependence | 2021 shortage revealed |
| Rare earth dependence | Clean energy transition revealed |
| Defense industrial base | Gradual awareness |

**Why Security Ignored**:

- Trade economists don't think about security
- Security establishment didn't track supply chains
- Corporate interests in China investment
- "End of history" complacency
- Cheap imports popular

### China Miscalculation

**The Grand Miscalculation**:

| Assumption | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Trade would liberalize China | Strengthened CCP legitimacy |
| WTO would constrain China | China gamed rules |
| China would follow market principles | State capitalism intensified |
| Technology transfer was acceptable | IP theft massive |
| Engagement would work | Competition intensified |

## Contributing Factors

### Media Coverage

**Trade Coverage Failures**:

| Bias | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Consumer focus | "Lower prices" framing |
| Abstract economics | Job losses not personalized |
| Corporate sources | Business perspective dominated |
| Complexity | Trade deals not explained |
| Short-term focus | Long-term effects ignored |

### Academic Economics

**Professional Failures**:

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Model assumptions | Unrealistic adjustment |
| Distributional neglect | Focused on aggregate gains |
| Political economy blindness | Ignored power dynamics |
| Data limitations | Didn't track actual impacts |
| Ideology | Free trade as article of faith |

**Belated Reassessment**:

- Autor, Dorn, Hanson (2013): China shock far worse than predicted
- Rodrik: Trade agreements overreached
- Summers: "Responsible nationalism" needed
- Blanchard: Globalization went too far

### Union Decline

**Labor's Weakened Voice**:

| Year | Union Density | Trade Policy Influence |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1970 | 27% | Significant voice |
| 1990 | 16% | Declining influence |
| 2010 | 12% | Marginalized |
| 2023 | 10% | Minimal |

**Chicken and Egg**:

- Trade policy weakened unions
- Weaker unions couldn't influence trade policy
- Downward spiral

## Feedback Loops

### Race to the Bottom

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Low-wage competition | U.S. wages stagnate |
| Tax competition | Corporate taxes cut |
| Regulatory competition | Standards weakened |
| Union avoidance | Bargaining power declines |

### Political Alienation

| Effect | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Working-class abandonment | Lost faith in both parties |
| Geographic concentration | Swing state impacts |
| Cultural resentment | Elite vs. forgotten |
| Populist opening | Trump, Sanders |
| Policy instability | Lurching between approaches |
