# Trade Policy: History

## Origins

### The Protectionist Era (1789-1934)

**Early American Trade Policy**

| Era | Dominant Policy | Rationale |
|-----|-----------------|-----------|
| 1789-1860 | High tariffs | Revenue, infant industry protection |
| 1861-1913 | Very high tariffs | Industrial development, Republican dominance |
| 1913-1922 | Moderate reduction | Democratic reforms, income tax |
| 1922-1934 | Return to high tariffs | Post-WWI nationalism |

**Key Early Tariffs**:

| Tariff | Year | Average Rate | Purpose |
|--------|------|--------------|---------|
| Tariff Act | 1789 | 8% | Revenue |
| Tariff of 1816 | 1816 | 25% | Infant industry |
| Tariff of 1828 | 1828 | 62% | "Tariff of Abominations" |
| McKinley Tariff | 1890 | 48% | Industrial protection |
| Smoot-Hawley | 1930 | 45% | Depression response |

**Smoot-Hawley Disaster (1930)**:

- Raised tariffs on 20,000+ goods
- Trading partners retaliated
- World trade collapsed 65%
- Deepened Great Depression
- Discredited protectionism for generations

## Key Turning Points

### The Bretton Woods System (1944-1971)

**Post-WWII Architecture**:

| Institution | Purpose | U.S. Role |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| IMF | Currency stability | Dominant voice |
| World Bank | Development lending | Major funder |
| GATT | Trade liberalization | Leader |
| Dollar standard | Reserve currency | Central position |

**Key Features**:

- Fixed exchange rates (pegged to dollar)
- Dollar convertible to gold at $35/oz
- U.S. as industrial powerhouse
- Marshall Plan rebuilds allies
- Gradual tariff reduction through GATT

### GATT Era (1947-1994)

**Major GATT Rounds**:

| Round | Years | Tariff Cuts | Participants |
|-------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Geneva | 1947 | 35% | 23 |
| Annecy | 1949 | 2% | 13 |
| Torquay | 1950-51 | 3% | 38 |
| Geneva | 1956 | 4% | 26 |
| Dillon | 1960-61 | 4% | 26 |
| Kennedy | 1964-67 | 35% | 62 |
| Tokyo | 1973-79 | 33% | 102 |
| Uruguay | 1986-94 | 38% | 123 |

**Results**: Average tariffs on manufactured goods fell from 40% to under 5%.

### Nixon Shock (1971)

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| End gold convertibility | Dollar floats |
| 10% import surcharge | Protectionist signal |
| Pressure on allies | Revalue currencies |

**Consequences**:

- End of Bretton Woods fixed rates
- Beginning of currency volatility
- Dollar remains reserve currency
- Trade imbalances become possible

## Timeline

### 1970s: New Challenges

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1971 | Nixon Shock; first U.S. trade deficit since 1893 |
| 1973 | Oil embargo; commodity shock |
| 1974 | Trade Act of 1974 (fast track, Section 301) |
| 1979 | Tokyo Round concludes; new trade tools |

**Trade Act of 1974**:

- Created "fast track" (Trade Promotion Authority)
- Section 301: Unfair trade practices remedy
- Expanded Trade Adjustment Assistance
- Generalized System of Preferences for developing countries

### 1980s: Trade Deficits and Japan

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1981 | Japan voluntary export restraints (auto) |
| 1985 | Plaza Accord (dollar devaluation) |
| 1987 | Semiconductor Agreement with Japan |
| 1988 | Omnibus Trade Act (Super 301) |

**Japan Trade War**:

| Issue | U.S. Response |
|-------|--------------|
| Auto imports | Voluntary export restraints |
| Semiconductor dumping | Trade agreement, tariffs |
| Currency manipulation | Plaza Accord |
| Market access | Structural Impediments Initiative |

**Lessons**:

- Managed trade can work short-term
- Japan eventually opened markets
- Manufacturing still declined
- Bilateral deals have limits

### 1990s: NAFTA and WTO

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1992 | NAFTA signed |
| 1994 | NAFTA implemented; WTO created |
| 1995 | WTO dispute settlement begins |
| 1999 | China PNTR debate begins |

**NAFTA (1994)**

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Tariff elimination | Gradual phase-out |
| Investment protections | ISDS disputes |
| Rules of origin | Content requirements |
| Labor side agreement | Weak enforcement |
| Environmental side agreement | Weak enforcement |

**Promised Benefits**:

- Export growth to Mexico
- 200,000 new jobs (administration claim)
- Rising wages in Mexico reducing immigration

**Actual Results**:

- Trade deficit with Mexico emerged
- 500,000-750,000 job losses (Economic Policy Institute)
- Mexican wages stagnated
- Maquiladora expansion

### 2000s: The China Shock

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2000 | PNTR for China passed |
| 2001 | China joins WTO |
| 2002 | Steel tariffs (withdrawn after WTO ruling) |
| 2005 | Chinese imports surge |

**China WTO Accession**

| Promise | Reality |
|---------|---------|

**The "China Shock" (2000-2010)**:

| Metric | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Chinese imports | +400% |
| Manufacturing employment | -33% (5.5M jobs) |
| Trade deficit with China | $83B to $273B |
| Import penetration | Doubled in many sectors |

**Academic Reassessment**:

- Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013): 2.4 million jobs lost
- Adjustment costs far higher than predicted
- Regional devastation underestimated
- "Economics profession got it wrong"

### 2010s: Trade Frustration Builds

| 2018 | Steel/aluminum tariffs (Section 232) |
| 2019 | USMCA signed |

**Trans-Pacific Partnership**:

- 12 countries; 40% of world GDP
- Designed to contain China
- Strong IP provisions
- Investor-state dispute settlement
- Labor provisions (strongest ever)
- Defeated by bipartisan opposition

**Trump Trade Policy**:

### What Failed

### Recurring Patterns

| Pattern | Examples |
