# Trade Policy: Current State

## The Problem Today

### Trade Balance

The United States runs persistent, large trade deficits:

**Goods Trade Balance (2023)**

| Category | Exports | Imports | Balance |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Total goods | $2.0T | $3.1T | -$1.1T |
| China | $148B | $427B | -$279B |
| European Union | $368B | $554B | -$186B |
| Mexico | $323B | $476B | -$153B |
| Canada | $353B | $421B | -$68B |
| Japan | $80B | $143B | -$63B |

**Services Trade Balance (2023)**

| Category | Exports | Imports | Balance |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Total services | $924B | $678B | +$246B |
| Travel | $181B | $150B | +$31B |
| Financial services | $146B | $41B | +$105B |
| IP licensing | $123B | $50B | +$73B |

The U.S. runs a surplus in services but a massive deficit in goods, reflecting deindustrialization.

### Manufacturing Employment

| Year | Manufacturing Jobs | Share of Total Employment |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1979 (peak) | 19.4 million | 22% |
| 2000 | 17.3 million | 13% |
| 2010 (trough) | 11.5 million | 9% |
| 2023 | 12.9 million | 8% |

Manufacturing employment has stabilized but at historically low levels.

### Geographic Concentration

**Most Affected Regions**:

| Region | Manufacturing Job Loss (2000-2020) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Midwest "Rust Belt" | 1.5+ million |
| Appalachian coal/steel | 300,000+ |
| Southern textiles (NC, SC, GA) | 400,000+ |
| New England manufacturing | 200,000+ |

**Least Affected**:

- Technology hubs (SF, Seattle, Austin)
- Finance centers (NYC, Chicago)
- Energy regions (Texas, Gulf Coast)
- Government centers (DC metro)

## Key Statistics

### Trade Dependency

| Product Category | Import Reliance | Primary Source |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Consumer electronics | 90%+ | China |
| Apparel | 95%+ | Asia |
| Pharmaceuticals (API) | 80%+ | China, India |
| Rare earth elements | 80%+ | China |
| Computer components | 75%+ | Asia |
| Motor vehicles | 40%+ | Mexico, Japan, Korea |
| Steel | 25%+ | Various |

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

**Critical Dependencies on China**:

| Category | Chinese Market Share |
|----------|---------------------|
| Rare earths (processed) | 87% |
| Solar panels | 80%+ |
| Lithium-ion batteries | 60%+ |
| Active pharmaceutical ingredients | 40%+ |
| Personal computers | 80%+ |
| Telecommunications equipment | 50%+ |

### Tariff Rates

**Average Applied Tariffs (2023)**:

| Country/Region | Average Tariff on U.S. Goods | U.S. Tariff on Their Goods |
|----------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| China (pre-trade war) | 8% | 3% |
| China (current) | 21%+ | 19%+ |
| European Union | 5% | 3% |
| Japan | 4% | 3% |
| Mexico (USMCA) | ~0% | ~0% |
| Canada (USMCA) | ~0% | ~0% |

### Trade Adjustment Assistance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual TAA certifications | ~1,000 petitions |
| Workers certified annually | ~100,000 |
| Average weekly benefit | ~$350 |
| Completion rate (training) | 40% |
| Re-employment rate | 74% |
| Wage replacement (re-employed) | 85% of prior wage |

TAA reaches only a fraction of trade-affected workers and provides inadequate support.

## Impact

### On Workers

**Wage Effects**:

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Manufacturing wage premium | Declined 50% since 1980s |
| Import-competing sector wages | Stagnant or declining |
| College wage premium | Widened |
| Geographic wage divergence | Increased |

**Non-Wage Effects**:

| Effect | Magnitude |
|--------|-----------|
| Health insurance loss | 1+ million workers lost employer coverage |
| Pension loss | Defined benefit plans disappeared |
| Community decline | Thousands of towns hollowed out |
| Opioid crisis correlation | Strong in trade-affected regions |
| Mortality rate increase | "Deaths of despair" in affected areas |

### On Communities

**Trade-Affected Counties** (2000-2015):

| Metric | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Population | -5% average |
| Labor force participation | -3 percentage points |
| Disability enrollment | +40% |
| Transfer payments share | +15% |
| Property values | -20% average |
| Tax base | Severely eroded |

### On National Security

**Strategic Vulnerabilities Exposed**:

| FDI in manufacturing | $50B/year | $100B+ |
| Semiconductor announcements | Minimal | $200B+ committed |

## Current Debates

### Tariff Policy

| Reduce tariffs | Traditional free traders, importers | Lower costs, reduce inflation |
| Targeted tariffs only | Moderate position | Strategic focus, limit costs |

### Industrial Policy

| Position | Advocates | Argument |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Aggressive intervention | Both parties (new consensus) | Strategic sectors need support |
| Market-led approach | Libertarians, some economists | Government picks losers |
| Ally coordination | Biden administration | Friend-shoring, supply chain security |

### China Policy

| Position | Advocates | Argument |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Full decoupling | National security hawks | Eliminate strategic risk |
| Targeted decoupling | Current policy | Focus on critical sectors |
| Engagement | Traditional business | Maintain economic benefits |
| Containment | Foreign policy establishment | Limit Chinese power |

## The Gap Between Problem and Solution

| The Problem | The Status Quo | What's Needed |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Massive trade deficits | Persist despite tariffs | Comprehensive manufacturing strategy |
| Worker displacement | TAA inadequate | Robust adjustment assistance |
| Supply chain vulnerability | Recognized but slow response | Systematic reshoring/diversification |
| China competition | Piecemeal response | Coordinated strategy |
| Enforcement gaps | WTO dysfunctional | New enforcement mechanisms |
| Labor/environmental arbitrage | Standards unenforced | Trade agreement reform |
