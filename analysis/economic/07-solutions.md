# Economic Reform: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Values for Economic Reform

**Broadly Shared Prosperity**

- Economic growth should benefit all, not just those at the top
- The gains from productivity should flow to workers, not only owners
- No one working full-time should live in poverty

**Fair Contribution**

- Those who benefit most from society should contribute most
- Tax burdens should reflect ability to pay
- Corporations should pay for the infrastructure and institutions they use

**Competitive Markets**

- Competition keeps prices low, quality high, and innovation strong
- Market power should be checked, not allowed to dominate
- Small business should have a fair chance against giants

**Worker Power and Dignity**

- Workers deserve voice in workplace decisions
- Labor is not merely a cost to be minimized
- Good jobs provide security, not just income

**Long-Term Thinking**

- Investment in future generations matters
- Short-term extraction must give way to sustainable growth
- Environmental and social costs must be accounted for

**Democratic Control**

- Economic power should not translate automatically to political power
- Citizens should shape economic rules, not just wealthy donors
- Transparency and accountability in economic governance

| Feasibility | Is this politically and administratively achievable? |
| Durability | Will this withstand reversal and workarounds? |
| Popular support | Does the public support this? |
| Coalition potential | Can this build a winning coalition? |
