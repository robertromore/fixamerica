# Small Business: Overview

Small businesses form the backbone of the American economy, representing 99.9% of all U.S. businesses and employing nearly half the private workforce. Yet these enterprises face mounting challenges from concentrated corporate power, rising costs, restricted capital access, and regulatory complexity that threatens their survival and the economic diversity they provide. Understanding the small business landscape is essential to addressing economic inequality, preserving competitive markets, and maintaining pathways to economic mobility.
