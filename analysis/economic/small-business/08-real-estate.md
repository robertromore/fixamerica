# Small Business: Commercial Rent and Real Estate Costs

## The Space Problem

Commercial real estate costs are among the largest fixed expenses for small businesses, often second only to labor. Rising rents, unfavorable lease terms, and the financialization of commercial property have created significant barriers to small business formation, survival, and growth. This chapter examines the commercial real estate landscape and its impact on small business.

## The Commercial Real Estate Landscape

### Market Scale

**U.S. Commercial Real Estate**:

- Total value: $20+ trillion
- Office space: 6 billion square feet
- Retail space: 15 billion square feet
- Industrial space: 18 billion square feet
- Small business share: Difficult to quantify (often sublease or smaller spaces)

### Ownership Concentration

Commercial real estate has become increasingly concentrated and institutionalized:

**Ownership Shifts**:

| Owner Type | Share of Commercial RE |
|------------|----------------------|
| REITs | 15% |
| Institutional investors | 25% |
| Private equity | 12% |
| Foreign investors | 6% |
| High net worth individuals | 20% |
| Small/local investors | 22% |

**Trend**: Local ownership declining, institutional ownership increasing

## Small Business Space Needs

### Space by Business Type

| Business Type | Typical Space Need | Location Priority |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Restaurant | 1,500-5,000 sq ft | High visibility |
| Retail shop | 800-3,000 sq ft | Foot traffic |
| Professional services | 500-2,000 sq ft | Professional area |
| Light manufacturing | 2,000-10,000 sq ft | Industrial zone |
| Home-based (transition) | 200-500 sq ft | Flexible |
| Co-working | 50-200 sq ft/person | Urban center |

### Space Cost Burden

**Rent as Percentage of Revenue**:

| Business Type | Target | Actual Average | Distress Level |
|---------------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Retail | 5-8% | 10-15% | 15%+ |
| Restaurant | 6-10% | 12-18% | 18%+ |
| Services | 4-8% | 8-12% | 12%+ |
| Manufacturing | 3-6% | 5-10% | 10%+ |

**Urban vs. Suburban vs. Rural**:

| Location | Avg. Rent/sq ft | Rent Burden |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Urban core | $40-200+ | 15-25% of revenue |
| Suburban | $20-60 | 8-15% of revenue |
| Small town | $10-30 | 6-12% of revenue |
| Rural | $5-15 | 4-8% of revenue |

## Cost Drivers

### Rent Increases

**Historical Trends**:

| Period | Annual Rent Growth | CPI Growth | Premium |
|--------|-------------------|------------|---------|
| 1990-2000 | 4.2% | 2.8% | +1.4% |
| 2000-2010 | 3.1% | 2.4% | +0.7% |
| 2010-2020 | 3.8% | 1.8% | +2.0% |
| 2020-2023 | 5.5%* | 6.2% | Volatile |

*Highly variable by market and property type

**Hot Market Examples** (pre-pandemic peaks):

| Market | 10-Year Rent Increase |
|--------|----------------------|
| San Francisco | +85% |
| New York | +65% |
| Seattle | +75% |
| Austin | +95% |
| Denver | +70% |

### Triple Net (NNN) Leases

Many commercial leases are "triple net," meaning tenants pay:

| Cost Component | Description | Typical Annual Cost |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Base rent | Rent for space | Quoted rate |
| CAM (Common Area Maintenance) | Shared maintenance | $5-15/sq ft |
| Property taxes | Passed through | $3-12/sq ft |
| Insurance | Building insurance | $1-3/sq ft |
| **Total Occupancy Cost** | | **40-60% above base rent** |

**The NNN Surprise**:
Many small business owners sign leases based on quoted rent, only to discover actual costs are 40-60% higher when NNN charges are added.

### Build-Out Costs

**Tenant Improvement Costs** (per square foot):

| Build-Out Level | Cost/sq ft | Examples |
|-----------------|------------|----------|
| Basic (paint, carpet) | $15-30 | Office |
| Standard | $50-100 | Retail |
| Restaurant (basic) | $150-250 | Fast casual |
| Restaurant (full) | $300-500 | Full service |
| Medical/dental | $150-300 | Healthcare |
| Manufacturing | $75-200 | Light industrial |

**Who Pays**:

- Landlord TI allowance: Often $10-50/sq ft
- Tenant responsibility: Balance (often substantial)
- Small business challenge: May not survive build-out period

## Lease Term Challenges

### Unfavorable Standard Terms

Standard commercial leases often include terms that disadvantage small tenants:

| Lease Provision | Landlord Benefit | Tenant Risk |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Personal guarantee | Collects from owner personally | Unlimited liability |
| Acceleration clause | Full lease due on default | Catastrophic exposure |
| COLA increases | Automatic rent increases | Budget unpredictability |
| Radius restriction | Limits competition | Restricts growth |
| Exclusive use (not granted) | Can rent to competitors | Competition in same building |
| Demolition clause | Can terminate for redevelopment | Sudden displacement |
| Relocation clause | Can move tenant | Forced to inferior space |

### Lease Length vs. Business Needs

| Lease Length | Landlord Preference | Small Business Reality |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 1-2 years | Avoids unless necessary | Needs flexibility early |
| 3-5 years | Standard | Often too long for startup |
| 5-10 years | Preferred | Excessive commitment |
| 10+ years | Ideal | Rarely appropriate |

**The Catch-22**:

- Short lease: Higher rent, less security, no TI allowance
- Long lease: Trapped if business fails, personal liability

### Personal Guarantees

**The Personal Guarantee Problem**:

- 85% of small business commercial leases require personal guarantees
- Guarantee often covers entire lease term
- Business failure = personal bankruptcy
- Limits entrepreneurship willingness

**Guarantee Terms**:

- Full lease value (e.g., $240,000 for 5-year, $4,000/month lease)
- All costs including legal fees
- Often survives business closure
- May extend to spouse

## The Displacement Crisis

### Gentrification and Small Business

Small businesses in gentrifying neighborhoods face particular challenges:

**Displacement Pattern**:

1. Neighborhood "discovered" by investors
2. Property values and rents increase
3. Long-term leases expire
4. Rents double or triple at renewal
5. Existing businesses cannot afford new rents
6. Replaced by chains or higher-margin businesses
7. Community character destroyed

**Examples**:

- Harlem: Hundreds of Black-owned businesses displaced since 2000
- San Francisco Mission District: 60%+ of Latino businesses lost
- Brooklyn: Entire commercial corridors transformed
- Austin: East Austin gentrification displaced minority businesses

### Commercial Rent Control Debates

**Arguments For**:

- Preserves community businesses
- Prevents displacement
- Maintains neighborhood character
- Supports small business stability

**Arguments Against**:

- Discourages property investment
- Reduces new development
- Creates market distortions
- May increase rents for new tenants

**Current Status**:

- Few jurisdictions have commercial rent stabilization
- San Francisco: Proposition F defeated (2020)
- New York: Limited programs in some areas
- Oakland: Commercial rent registry discussed

## The Vacancy Paradox

### High Rents + High Vacancy

Many urban areas experience simultaneous high rents and high vacancy:

**Why Landlords Keep Spaces Empty**:

- Tax benefits from depreciation
- Waiting for "right" tenant (national chain)
- Holding for development/sale
- Speculative valuation
- Better to write off loss than accept lower rent

**Vacancy Rates** (pre-pandemic):

| Area Type | Vacancy Rate | Asking Rent Trend |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Prime urban | 5-10% | Increasing |
| Secondary urban | 10-15% | Flat |
| Suburban retail | 8-12% | Flat |
| Strip mall | 12-18% | Declining |

### Warehouse Clause Leases

Some property owners sign "warehouse leases" allowing vacancy:

- Lease with shell company
- Nominal rent paid
- Triggers tax write-offs
- Property appears "leased" not vacant
- No actual commercial use

## Post-Pandemic Disruption

### Office Market Collapse

**Remote Work Impact**:

- Office vacancy: 12-20%+ in major markets
- Sublease space flooding market
- Values down 25-40% in some markets
- Conversion to residential challenging

**Small Business Implications**:

- Potential for cheaper office space
- But many buildings not suitable for small tenants
- Downtown foot traffic down
- Business district economics disrupted

### Retail Reconfiguration

**Trends**:

- Experiential retail emphasis
- Smaller footprints
- Pop-up and short-term leases more available
- Some malls converting to mixed use
- Ghost kitchens taking commercial space

## Solutions and Alternatives

### Community Land Trusts

Community Land Trusts (CLTs) can hold commercial property:

**How It Works**:

- Nonprofit acquires property
- Maintains permanent affordability
- Leases to local businesses at below-market rates
- Community control over commercial mix

**Examples**:

- Boston: Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative
- Oakland: East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative
- Multiple cities exploring commercial CLTs

### Commercial Rent Assistance Programs

**Government Programs**:

| Program | Description | Availability |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Federal: None | No ongoing federal program | N/A |
| State: Varies | California, NY have limited programs | Rare |
| Local: Limited | Some cities have small programs | Very limited |
| COVID relief | Temporary pandemic programs | Expired |

### Small Business-Friendly Landlords

**Finding Better Deals**:

- Local/individual landlords more flexible
- Non-profit property owners
- Community development corporations
- Small business incubators
- Shared/co-working spaces

### Cooperative Ownership

**Models**:

- Business owner cooperatives purchase buildings
- Multiple businesses share ownership
- Community shares in commercial development
- Workers own their workplace

### Municipal Intervention

**Policy Tools**:

- Vacancy taxes (force use or pay penalty)
- Land value taxes (discourage speculation)
- Inclusionary commercial zoning
- Community benefit agreements
- Small business preference in city-owned space
- Commercial rent subsidies

## Recommendations

### For Small Business Owners

1. **Negotiate everything** - Lease terms are more flexible than presented
2. **Limit personal guarantee** - Time limits, caps, "good guy" clauses
3. **Understand total costs** - Calculate full NNN occupancy cost
4. **Build in flexibility** - Sublease rights, early termination options
5. **Consider alternatives** - Co-working, incubators, pop-ups
6. **Get professional help** - Commercial real estate attorneys

### For Policymakers

**Immediate Actions**:

1. Create small business lease assistance programs
2. Implement vacancy taxes in high-cost markets
3. Provide technical assistance for lease negotiation
4. Require clearer lease cost disclosure

**Structural Reforms**:

1. Limit personal guarantee requirements
2. Support commercial land trusts
3. Include commercial space in affordable development
4. Create public markets and small business hubs
5. Study commercial rent stabilization

### For Communities

1. Support local commercial property ownership
2. Advocate for vacant storefront accountability
3. Create merchant associations
4. Document displacement and publicize
5. Pressure local government for action

## Commercial Real Estate and Small Business Health

### The Connection

Commercial real estate costs directly affect:

- **Business formation**: High costs prevent startups
- **Business survival**: Rent burden leads to failure
- **Business growth**: Cannot afford to expand
- **Community vitality**: Displacement destroys neighborhoods
- **Economic diversity**: Only chain stores can afford prime space

### A Different Approach

Countries with healthier small business sectors often have:

- Stronger tenant protections
- Public markets and commercial space
- Limitations on commercial real estate speculation
- Community ownership models
- Active anti-vacancy policies

## Conclusion

Commercial real estate costs have become a major barrier to small business success. The financialization of property, unfavorable lease terms, and lack of policy attention to commercial affordability have created conditions where only well-capitalized businesses can access suitable space. Addressing this requires both tenant protection reforms and alternative ownership models that keep commercial space accessible to small and local businesses.
