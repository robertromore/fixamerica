        price would eliminate competition in the relevant market.

SECTION 6. SMALL BUSINESS PROCUREMENT PROTECTION.
(a) BUNDLING PROHIBITION.—Federal agencies shall not bundle contracts

    quarterly the actual subcontracting performed by small businesses,

#### Explanation

This legislation addresses the competitive disadvantages facing small businesses by:

1. **Platform Accountability**: Creating clear rules against self-preferencing and data exploitation by dominant platforms
2. **Robinson-Patman Revival**: Requiring FTC to actually enforce price discrimination laws
3. **Procurement Reform**: Preventing contract bundling that excludes small businesses
4. **Private Enforcement**: Enabling small businesses to enforce their rights in court

#### Legal Challenges

- Commerce Clause challenges to platform provisions (likely upheld under *Wickard v. Filburn* analysis)
- First Amendment arguments regarding platform curation (distinguish from content moderation)
- Vagueness challenges to "self-preferencing" (mitigated by detailed definition)
- Arbitration clause conflicts with private right of action (FAA preemption issues)

#### Refinements Needed

- Clarify interplay with state antitrust laws
- Address algorithms specifically
- Consider safe harbor for platforms making good faith compliance efforts
- Define remedies for data exploitation violations

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Personal guarantee workarounds | Landlords require guarantors other than business owner | Medium |
| MCA product restructuring | Alternative products created to evade lending classification | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|

### General Implementation Concerns

|---------|------------|
| Agency capture | Rotate enforcement personnel; whistleblower protections |
| Judicial hostility | Clear congressional intent; detailed findings |
| Industry adaptation | Sunset and review provisions; agency rulemaking authority |
| State variation | Provide floor, not ceiling; encourage state innovation |
| Political sustainability | Bipartisan framing; business constituency building |
| Resource adequacy | Mandatory appropriations; fee-funding options |
| Measurement challenges | Required data collection; annual reporting |
| Unintended consequences | Phased implementation; pilot programs |

## Constitutional Considerations

### Commerce Clause

- Platform regulation: Strong basis under substantial effects doctrine
- Lending regulation: Established precedent for financial regulation
- Franchise regulation: Interstate commerce clearly affected

### Due Process

- Notice requirements: Ample in proposed legislation
- Hearing rights: Provided through administrative and judicial processes
- Vagueness: Detailed definitions address concerns

### Taking Claims

- Regulatory taking: Unlikely given reasonable relationship to public interest
- Franchise relationship modifications: Prospective application avoids impairment

### Contract Clause

- Prospective application: Does not impair existing contracts
- Reasonable regulation: Franchise industry already subject to extensive regulation

### First Amendment

- Commercial speech: Disclosure requirements permissible
- Association: Protected, but commercial relationships subject to regulation
