# Small Business: Health Insurance Costs

## The Healthcare Burden

Health insurance represents one of the most significant challenges facing small businesses in America. Unlike large employers who can spread risk across thousands of employees, small businesses face volatile premiums, limited plan choices, and administrative burdens that make offering health coverage difficult or impossible. This chapter examines the health insurance landscape for small employers and explores solutions.

## The Scale of the Problem

### Coverage Rates by Business Size

| Firm Size | Offering Health Insurance | Workers with Offer |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 3-9 employees | 35% | 42% |
| 10-24 employees | 56% | 64% |
| 25-49 employees | 71% | 77% |
| 50-99 employees | 85% | 88% |
| 100-199 employees | 93% | 94% |
| 200+ employees | 99% | 97% |

**The Gap**: 25 million Americans work at businesses too small to offer health insurance or where they don't qualify for coverage.

### Cost Comparison

| Firm Size | Annual Family Premium | Employee Share | Employer Share |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|
| <200 employees | $23,500 | $7,000 (30%) | $16,500 (70%) |
| 200+ employees | $22,100 | $5,800 (26%) | $16,300 (74%) |
| Difference | +$1,400 | +$1,200 | +$200 |

**Per Employee Cost Differential**:
- Small employer: $6,900/employee (single), $16,500/employee (family)
- Large employer: $6,100/employee (single), $16,300/employee (family)
- Small business premium: 10-13% higher

## Why Small Business Insurance Costs More

### Risk Pool Problems

**Small Risk Pools**:
- One sick employee can dramatically increase premiums
- Annual renewal becomes lottery
- No ability to self-insure or spread risk
- Experience rating punishes small groups

**Example**:
A 10-employee company where one employee has cancer:
- Year 1: $6,000/employee premium
- Year 2 (post-diagnosis): $9,000/employee premium (+50%)
- Must absorb or pass to employees

### Administrative Costs

| Cost Component | Small Group | Large Group |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Claims administration | 8-10% | 2-4% |
| Broker commissions | 4-6% | 1-3% |
| Underwriting | 3-5% | 1-2% |
| Regulatory compliance | 2-3% | 0.5-1% |
| **Total Admin** | **17-24%** | **4.5-10%** |

### Limited Bargaining Power

- Small businesses cannot negotiate rates
- Take-it-or-leave-it pricing
- Fewer plan options
- Limited network choices
- No leverage over carriers

### Volatility

**Premium Increases** (Annual Averages):

| Period | Small Group | Large Group |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 2010-2015 | 8.4% | 5.2% |
| 2015-2020 | 5.8% | 3.9% |
| 2020-2023 | 7.2% | 4.8% |

**Year-to-Year Variation**:
- Small groups: 0-30%+ annual swings
- Large groups: 2-8% predictable increases

## The Impact on Small Business

### Hiring Decisions

Small business owners report health insurance costs affect:
- **Whether to hire**: 42% delayed hiring due to insurance costs
- **Who to hire**: Preference for applicants with spouse coverage
- **Full-time vs. part-time**: 30%+ keep workers under hours threshold
- **Compensation levels**: Lower wages to offset insurance costs

### Competitiveness

**Recruiting Disadvantage**:
- Cannot match large employer benefits
- Lose candidates to companies with better coverage
- Particularly acute for skilled workers
- Healthcare becomes competitive disadvantage

### Owner Coverage

**Self-Employed and Small Business Owner Coverage**:
- 24% of self-employed are uninsured (vs. 8% of employees)
- Many pay individual market rates ($15,000-25,000/family)
- Pre-ACA: Many denied coverage for pre-existing conditions
- ACA improved but costs remain high

### Financial Stress

**Health Insurance as Business Expense**:

| Business Size | Insurance as % of Payroll |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| <10 employees | 15-25% |
| 10-24 employees | 12-18% |
| 25-49 employees | 10-15% |
| 50-99 employees | 8-12% |
| 100+ employees | 6-10% |

## Current Options for Small Businesses

### Traditional Group Insurance

**How It Works**:
- Purchase through broker or direct from carrier
- Experience rated based on employee health
- Annual renewal with potential rate changes
- Minimum participation requirements (usually 70%+)

**Limitations**:
- Expensive for small groups
- Volatile premiums
- Limited carrier choices in many markets
- Administrative burden

### SHOP Marketplace

The Small Business Health Options Program under the ACA:

**Design Intent**:
- Pool small business risk
- Provide tax credits for smallest businesses
- Increase plan choice
- Simplify administration

**Reality**:
- Limited carrier participation
- Tax credit eligibility narrow (≤25 employees, avg salary ≤$56,000)
- Not significantly cheaper than direct purchase
- Enrollment remains low (~230,000 employers)

### Association Health Plans (AHPs)

**Concept**: Allow small businesses to band together through associations to purchase coverage

**Trump Administration Expansion (2018)**:
- Broadened AHP rules
- Allowed looser association definitions
- Permitted experience rating

**Problems**:
- Court struck down parts of rule (2019)
- Cherry-picking concerns (healthy groups leave regular market)
- Limited adoption
- Uncertain regulatory status

### Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs)

**Individual Coverage HRA (ICHRA)** (2020):
- Employer provides tax-free allowance
- Employees purchase individual market coverage
- No group plan required
- Any size employer eligible

**Advantages**:
- Predictable costs for employer
- Employee choice of plans
- No minimum contribution requirements
- Works with ACA subsidies (with limits)

**Disadvantages**:
- Employees must navigate individual market
- Coverage may be more expensive
- Administrative complexity
- Tax treatment complex

**Qualified Small Employer HRA (QSEHRA)**:
- For employers <50 employees with no group plan
- Maximum contribution: $5,850 (individual) / $11,800 (family) (2023)
- Employees purchase individual coverage
- Tax-advantaged

### Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs)

**How It Works**:
- PEO becomes co-employer
- Small business joins PEO's larger risk pool
- Access to large group rates
- PEO handles administration

**Statistics**:
- 175,000+ small businesses use PEOs
- 4 million workers in PEO arrangements
- Can save 10-20% on benefits costs

**Limitations**:
- Loss of some control
- Co-employment raises liability questions
- Not available in all industries
- Minimum employee requirements

### Health Care Sharing Ministries

**What They Are**:
- Religious-based sharing of medical expenses
- Not insurance; no guaranteed coverage
- Members share eligible expenses
- Exempt from ACA individual mandate

**Considerations**:
- Lower monthly costs ($200-500/month)
- Not regulated as insurance
- Pre-existing conditions often excluded
- Lifestyle requirements (religious observance)
- No guarantee of payment

### Self-Funding (Partial)

**Level-Funded Plans**:
- Fixed monthly payments
- Insurance company handles claims
- Potential refund if claims low
- Stop-loss protection

**Advantages**:
- Predictable costs
- Potential savings if healthy group
- Some flexibility in plan design
- Not subject to all state mandates

**Risks**:
- May pay more if claims high
- Renewal based on experience
- Complex to understand

## The ACA's Impact on Small Business

### Positive Effects

- Pre-existing condition protections
- Essential health benefits standardization  
- Young adult coverage on parent plans
- No annual or lifetime limits
- Dependent coverage options

### Challenges Created

- 50+ employee mandate complications
- Administrative reporting requirements
- Some premium increases in individual market
- Employer reporting (1094-C, 1095-C)

### The 50-Employee Cliff

Businesses at 49 employees face significant costs if they grow:

**At 50 Employees Must**:
- Offer affordable coverage or face penalty
- Affordable = <9.12% of household income (2023)
- Penalty: $2,880/employee (after first 30) if no offer
- Penalty: $4,320/employee if coverage unaffordable

**Perverse Incentive**:
Many businesses deliberately stay below 50 employees to avoid mandate

## International Comparison

### Other Approaches

| Country | System | Small Business Impact |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Canada | Single payer | No employer responsibility |
| Germany | Multi-payer | Employer/employee split, regulated |
| UK | NHS | No employer responsibility |
| France | Social insurance | Employer contribution to public system |
| Australia | Hybrid | Universal public + optional private |

### The Competitive Disadvantage

American small businesses face costs that international competitors do not:
- $6,000-17,000/employee that Canadian competitors don't pay
- Administrative burden that foreign competitors avoid
- Hiring decisions distorted by coverage considerations
- Employee mobility limited by "job lock"

## Reform Options

### Public Option

**How It Would Help Small Business**:
- Compete with private insurers
- Drive down premiums
- Provide option in areas with few carriers
- Benchmark for reasonable pricing

### Medicare Expansion

**Medicare for All** impacts:
- Eliminate employer responsibility entirely
- Level playing field with large employers
- Remove coverage from compensation equation
- Financed through taxes rather than premiums

**Medicare Buy-In** (Age 55+):
- Remove oldest, most expensive workers from pools
- Lower premiums for remaining group
- Transition step toward broader coverage

### State-Level Solutions

**State Innovations**:

| State | Program | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Colorado | Public Option | State-run option planned |
| Washington | Public Option | State-contracted plans |
| Vermont | Single Payer (attempted) | Legislation passed, not implemented |
| California | CalCare (proposed) | Single payer legislation pending |

### Market Reforms

**Reinsurance Programs**:
- Government covers highest-cost claims
- Reduces premiums for all
- State programs showing 10-20% savings

**Rate Review**:
- Strengthen review of premium increases
- Public justification requirements
- Transparency in pricing

### Small Business-Specific Solutions

**Enhanced Tax Credits**:
- Expand eligibility beyond current limits
- Increase credit percentage
- Make credits refundable

**Multi-Employer Purchasing**:
- Enable genuine pooling across small businesses
- Geographic or industry-based pools
- State-facilitated arrangements

**Simplified Administration**:
- Streamlined reporting requirements
- Combined enrollment systems
- Reduced compliance burden

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Expand SHOP tax credit** eligibility and amount
2. **Fund state reinsurance** programs
3. **Simplify ICHRA** administration
4. **Reduce reporting burden** for smallest employers
5. **Increase QSEHRA** contribution limits

### Structural Reforms

1. **Create public option** available to all employers
2. **Enable genuine multi-employer pooling**
3. **Provide refundable credits** for small business coverage
4. **Reduce administrative costs** through standardization
5. **Address prescription drug costs** driving premiums

### Long-Term Solutions

1. **Decouple coverage from employment** through universal systems
2. **Level playing field** with international competitors
3. **Eliminate coverage considerations** from hiring decisions
4. **End job lock** that traps workers

## Conclusion

Health insurance costs represent a structural disadvantage for small businesses that no market reform can fully address. The fundamental problem—tying health coverage to employment while requiring small businesses to bear the same responsibility as large employers—creates inherent inequities. True solutions require either genuine pooling mechanisms that spread risk broadly or, more fundamentally, separating health coverage from employment altogether.
