# Small Business: Entrepreneurship Rates and Demographics

## The State of Entrepreneurship

Entrepreneurship—the creation of new businesses—is fundamental to economic dynamism, innovation, and opportunity. Yet entrepreneurship rates in America have declined significantly over the past four decades, with particularly pronounced disparities across demographic groups. This chapter examines who starts businesses, why rates are declining, and what can be done to revitalize entrepreneurship.

## Declining Entrepreneurship

### Historical Trends

**Business Formation Rates**:

| Period | Annual Startup Rate | Net New Firms |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1980-1985 | 12.5% | +150,000/year |
| 1985-1990 | 12.2% | +140,000/year |
| 1990-1995 | 11.1% | +100,000/year |
| 1995-2000 | 11.8% | +120,000/year |
| 2000-2005 | 10.2% | +60,000/year |
| 2005-2010 | 9.1% | -20,000/year |
| 2010-2015 | 8.4% | +40,000/year |
| 2015-2020 | 8.2% | +30,000/year |
| 2020-2023 | 10.5%* | Volatile |

*Post-COVID surge, sustainability uncertain

### Business Dynamism Decline

| Metric | 1980 | 2000 | 2020 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Startup rate | 12.5% | 10.2% | 8.4% |
| Young firm share of employment | 19% | 14% | 10% |
| Job reallocation rate | 18% | 14% | 11% |
| Exit rate | 10% | 9% | 8% |

**Significance**: Declining dynamism means fewer new jobs, less innovation, and reduced economic mobility.

### Post-COVID Surge

The pandemic triggered a significant increase in new business applications:

| Year | New Business Applications | Change |
|------|--------------------------|--------|
| 2019 | 3.5 million | Baseline |
| 2020 | 4.4 million | +27% |
| 2021 | 5.4 million | +54% |
| 2022 | 5.1 million | +46% |
| 2023 | 4.8 million | +37% |

**Cautions**:

- Applications ≠ actual businesses
- Many "pandemic businesses" have since closed
- Sustainability of surge uncertain
- Different types of businesses (e-commerce, gig)

## Who Starts Businesses

## The Future of Entrepreneurship

### Trends to Watch

**Positive Signs**:

- Post-COVID application surge
- Growing interest in local/independent businesses
- Rise of e-commerce lowering some barriers
- Increased attention to entrepreneurship policy

**Concerns**:

- Sustainability of recent gains uncertain
- Demographic disparities persisting
- Market concentration limiting opportunities
- Climate disruption affecting small business

### What's at Stake

Entrepreneurship matters because it provides:

- **Economic mobility**: Path from worker to owner
- **Innovation**: New ideas and products
- **Competition**: Check on corporate power
- **Community**: Local ownership and investment
- **Resilience**: Economic diversity

## Conclusion

The decline in entrepreneurship represents a fundamental threat to American economic dynamism and opportunity. While recent data shows encouraging signs, structural barriers—particularly for minorities, women, and young people—remain formidable. Reversing these trends requires addressing underlying inequalities in wealth, healthcare, education, and market access, not just providing more programs for aspiring entrepreneurs.
