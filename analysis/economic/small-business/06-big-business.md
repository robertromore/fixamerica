# Small Business: Big Business Competition

## The Concentration Problem

Small businesses increasingly compete not in free markets but against dominant corporations with overwhelming advantages in capital, technology, data, and political influence. This chapter examines how corporate concentration harms small business competitiveness and what can be done to restore market balance.

## The Rise of Corporate Dominance

### Market Concentration Trends

Over the past four decades, American markets have become dramatically more concentrated:

**Economy-Wide Concentration**:

| Metric | 1980 | 2000 | 2023 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Share of revenue to top 100 firms | 33% | 40% | 46% |
| Share of employment at firms 500+ | 51% | 52% | 54% |
| Average industry concentration (HHI) | 1,200 | 1,800 | 2,200 |
| Number of publicly traded companies | 7,000+ | 7,500+ | 4,300 |

### Sector-by-Sector Concentration

| Sector | Top 4 Firm Market Share | Change Since 1997 |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Airlines | 65% | +25 points |
| Wireless Telecom | 98% | +30 points |
| General Merchandise | 82% | +20 points |
| Internet Search | 92% | N/A (new industry) |
| Social Media | 80% | N/A (new industry) |
| E-commerce | 50%+ | N/A (new industry) |
| Banking (deposits) | 44% | +22 points |
| Hospitals (per market) | 70%+ | +25 points |
| Health Insurance (per market) | 80%+ | +20 points |

## Amazon: The Everything Store Problem

### Scale and Scope

Amazon has become the most significant competitive threat to small retailers:

**Amazon's Reach**:
- 38% of U.S. e-commerce (more than next 9 competitors combined)
- 200+ million Prime members globally (160+ million U.S.)
- $500+ billion annual retail revenue
- 1.5 million employees
- Third-party sellers: 60% of units sold, 2 million+ active sellers

### Predatory Practices

**Self-Preferencing**:
Amazon uses its platform control to favor its own products:
- Amazon products appear first in search results
- "Amazon's Choice" badge steers customers
- Buy Box manipulation favors Amazon listings
- Data from sellers used to launch competing products

**Private Label Expansion**:
- 400+ Amazon private label brands
- Copies successful third-party products
- Undercuts on price using platform data
- Categories destroyed: batteries, cables, basics, baby products

**Example: The Amazon Basics Strategy**
1. Third-party seller establishes successful product
2. Amazon collects data on sales, margins, search terms
3. Amazon launches "Amazon Basics" version at lower price
4. Amazon promotes its version, demotes competitor
5. Original seller's sales collapse
6. Repeat across thousands of categories

### Fees and Dependency

**Cost to Sell on Amazon**:

| Fee Type | Typical Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| Referral fee | 8-15% of sale |
| FBA fulfillment | 15-25% of sale |
| Advertising (increasingly mandatory) | 10-20% of sale |
| Storage fees | $0.75-2.40/cubic foot |
| Other fees | 2-5% of sale |
| **Total** | **40-65% of sale** |

**Seller Dependency**:
- 60% of third-party sellers say Amazon is essential to their business
- Average seller gets 50%+ of revenue from Amazon
- 37% of sellers have only Amazon channel
- Sellers cannot survive without Amazon, cannot thrive with it

### Impact on Small Retail

**Store Closures Since 2000**:
- 100,000+ retail stores closed
- 5,000+ shopping malls at risk
- 40% of toy stores closed
- 60% of bookstores closed
- Small town Main Streets devastated

**The Amazon Effect by Category**:

| Category | Small Business Impact |
|----------|----------------------|
| Books | 60% of independent bookstores closed since 1990s |
| Toys | Toys "R" Us bankruptcy, thousands of small toy stores closed |
| Electronics | Best Buy dominant, small shops largely gone |
| Office Supplies | Staples/Office Depot duopoly, independents extinct |
| Sporting Goods | Sports Authority bankruptcy, independents struggling |

## Walmart: The Main Street Killer

### Scale of Impact

Walmart's impact on small business preceded and parallels Amazon's:

**Walmart Statistics**:
- $600+ billion annual revenue
- 4,700+ U.S. stores
- 1.6 million U.S. employees
- 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of Walmart
- 25% of grocery market share

### Documented Effects

**The Walmart Effect Study Findings**:

| Study Finding | Source |
|---------------|--------|
| Counties with Walmart: 44% drop in retail establishments | Iowa State (2008) |
| Small town loses 47% of retail trade within 10 years of Walmart | Various studies |
| Neighboring counties also see retail decline | Economic Geography |
| Wages in retail drop 5-10% after Walmart entry | UC Berkeley |
| Property values decline in Walmart-affected areas | Real estate studies |

### Buyer Power and Supplier Squeeze

Walmart's scale gives it enormous leverage over suppliers:

**Supplier Demands**:
- Annual price reductions required
- Vendors must adopt Walmart's IT systems
- Penalties for delivery failures
- Exclusive products demanded
- Margin transparency required

**Small Supplier Impact**:
- Walmart often demands prices below cost to sell elsewhere
- Suppliers become dependent on single customer
- Innovation squeezed out by margin pressure
- Domestic manufacturing uneconomical

## The Platform Problem

### Google and Local Business

Google controls how consumers find local businesses:

**Google's Local Dominance**:
- 92% search market share
- Google Maps: 80%+ of navigation app usage
- Google Business Profiles essential for visibility
- Algorithm changes can destroy small businesses overnight

**Issues for Small Business**:
- Fake reviews harm legitimate businesses
- Algorithm changes unpredictable
- Ad costs continuously increase
- Google self-preferences own services
- No transparency in ranking

### Facebook/Meta and Small Business Marketing

**Marketing Dependency**:
- 200 million businesses use Facebook tools
- Average small business spends $2,000-15,000/month on Facebook ads
- Algorithm changes reduce organic reach to <5%
- Increasing "pay to play" requirement
- Ad prices have increased 90% since 2020

### Delivery Platforms

**Restaurant Impact**:

| Platform | Commission Rate | Annual Fees |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| DoorDash | 15-30% | N/A |
| Uber Eats | 15-30% | N/A |
| Grubhub | 15-30% | $99-399/month |

**Effects**:
- Restaurant margins: 3-5% (before delivery)
- Delivery commissions: 15-30%
- Net result: Many restaurants lose money on delivery
- But opting out means losing customers

**Other Issues**:
- Platforms control customer data
- Can launch competing "ghost kitchens"
- Surge pricing harms restaurants
- Rating systems create anxiety and manipulation

## Private Equity and Roll-Ups

### The Roll-Up Strategy

Private equity firms are consolidating previously fragmented industries:

**How It Works**:
1. PE fund identifies fragmented industry
2. Acquires multiple small businesses in sector
3. Combines operations, cuts costs (often labor)
4. Creates regional/national dominant player
5. Either sells to larger PE or goes public

**Affected Industries**:
- Veterinary practices: 20%+ now PE-owned
- Dental practices: 15%+ PE-owned
- Dermatology: 20%+ PE-owned
- HVAC and plumbing: Rapid consolidation
- Auto repair: Growing PE presence
- Funeral homes: 20%+ corporately owned

### Impact on Competition

**Before PE Roll-Up**:
- Many independent providers
- Local relationships
- Price competition
- Innovation diversity

**After PE Roll-Up**:
- One or few dominant players
- Standardized (often reduced) service
- Higher prices
- Barriers to new entry

**Example: Veterinary Care**
- Independent vet clinics: 55% in 2010, 35% in 2023
- Average vet visit cost: Up 50% since 2010
- Wait times: Increasing
- Rural access: Declining

## Anti-Competitive Practices

### Predatory Pricing

Dominant firms can price below cost to drive out competitors:

**Legal Status**: Technically illegal, but nearly impossible to prove under current standards

**Examples**:
- Amazon routinely sells popular items below cost
- Uber/Lyft subsidized rides for years to destroy taxis
- Walmart known for loss leaders that destroy competitors

### Exclusive Dealing

**Definition**: Supplier or distributor agreements that lock out competitors

**Small Business Impact**:
- Cannot access best products or brands
- Distribution channels blocked
- Supplier relationships captured by dominant buyer

### Tying and Bundling

**Definition**: Requiring purchase of one product to get another

**Examples**:
- Microsoft Office bundled with Windows (historically)
- Amazon Prime bundles streaming, shipping, etc.
- Google apps pre-installed on Android

### Raising Rivals' Costs

Dominant firms can use various tactics to increase competitors' costs:
- Patent trolling and IP litigation
- Hiring away key employees
- Acquiring critical suppliers
- Lobbying for regulatory barriers

## Legal Framework Failures

### The Chicago School Takeover

Since the 1980s, antitrust law has focused narrowly on consumer prices:

**Old Standard** (pre-1980):
- Market structure matters
- Multiple competitors valued
- Small business protection explicit goal
- Variety of harms recognized

**New Standard** (post-1980):
- Only consumer prices matter
- Efficiency is paramount
- Size is fine if prices low
- Predatory pricing nearly impossible to prove

### Key Case Law Problems

| Case | Year | Effect |
|------|------|--------|
| *Reiter v. Sonotone* | 1979 | Emphasized consumer welfare |
| *Matsushita v. Zenith* | 1986 | Made predatory pricing claims nearly impossible |
| *Brooke Group v. Brown & Williamson* | 1993 | Required proof of recoupment |
| *Leegin v. PSKS* | 2007 | Allowed vertical price fixing |
| *Ohio v. American Express* | 2018 | Protected two-sided platforms |

### Robinson-Patman Act Abandonment

The Robinson-Patman Act (1936) prohibited price discrimination that harmed small business:
- Made it illegal to give large buyers better prices
- Protected small retailers from buyer power
- Enforced actively through 1970s
- DOJ has brought zero cases since 1972
- FTC cases declined from hundreds annually to near zero

## Economic Effects

### Innovation Impact

Concentration reduces innovation:
- Startup rate declined as concentration increased
- Young firms' share of employment: Down from 19% (1982) to 10% (2018)
- New business formation: Lowest on record before pandemic
- Venture capital concentrated in fewer firms

### Wage Effects

Concentration enables wage suppression:
- Labor market concentration associated with 10-20% lower wages
- Non-compete agreements spread to low-wage workers
- No-poach agreements between franchises
- Monopsony power in local labor markets

### Regional Inequality

Concentration concentrates wealth geographically:
- Corporate headquarters cluster in few cities
- Small towns lose anchor businesses
- Tax base erodes in affected communities
- "Brain drain" to corporate centers

## Reform Approaches

### Reinvigorated Antitrust

**Merger Reform**:
- Stricter merger review
- Structural presumptions against concentration
- Prohibition on killer acquisitions
- Break-up authority for existing monopolies

**Conduct Reform**:
- Revive Robinson-Patman enforcement
- Ban self-preferencing by platforms
- Prohibit predatory pricing
- Limit exclusive dealing

### Platform-Specific Regulation

**Proposed Rules**:
- Separation of platform and commerce (no selling on own platform)
- Data portability and interoperability
- Algorithmic transparency
- Non-discrimination in access and ranking
- Limits on acquisitions

### Support for Small Business

**Countermeasures**:
- Cooperative purchasing programs
- Small business procurement preferences
- Community wealth building initiatives
- Public option alternatives (banking, etc.)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Revive Robinson-Patman Act** enforcement
2. **Block mega-mergers** in concentrated industries
3. **Investigate platform practices** for antitrust violations
4. **Regulate delivery platform commissions**
5. **Require data portability** for platform sellers

### Structural Reforms

1. **Structural separation** of platforms from commerce
2. **Break up** dominant platforms with conflicts of interest
3. **Prohibit roll-ups** in already-consolidated industries
4. **Create public alternatives** to private platform power

### Community-Level Action

1. **Local purchasing preferences** in government contracts
2. **Zoning restrictions** on big box development
3. **Local banking** and community investment
4. **Cooperative development** support
5. **Buy local campaigns** with real investment

## Conclusion

The decline of small business is not a natural market outcome—it is the result of policy choices that allowed and encouraged corporate concentration. Dominant firms use their power not just to win in markets but to rewrite the rules of competition itself. Restoring competitive markets requires recognizing that small business vitality is a public good worthy of protection, not merely collateral damage in the pursuit of efficiency.
