# Small Business: Franchise Relationships and Power Imbalance

## The Franchise Model

Franchising represents a significant segment of the small business economy, with approximately 785,000 franchise establishments employing 8.7 million workers. While franchising offers a path to business ownership with brand recognition and proven systems, the relationship between franchisors and franchisees is characterized by profound power imbalances that often leave franchisees with substantial risk but limited control.

## Understanding Franchising

### What Is a Franchise?

A franchise is a license granted by a company (franchisor) to an individual or group (franchisee) to conduct business under the franchisor's trademarks and operating system.

**Key Elements**:
- Use of franchisor's trademark and brand
- Operating system and business format
- Ongoing relationship with fees and obligations
- Geographic territory (often exclusive)
- Training and support (varies widely)

### Scale of Franchising

**Overall Statistics**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Franchise establishments | 785,000 |
| Direct employment | 8.7 million |
| Annual output | $827 billion |
| Industries with franchises | 300+ |
| Franchise brands | 4,000+ |

### Top Franchise Sectors

| Sector | Establishments | Employment | Output |
|--------|----------------|------------|--------|
| Quick Service Restaurants | 196,000 | 4.2 million | $250 billion |
| Table/Full Service Restaurants | 45,000 | 890,000 | $55 billion |
| Business Services | 104,000 | 780,000 | $72 billion |
| Personal Services | 87,000 | 410,000 | $35 billion |
| Retail Food | 52,000 | 320,000 | $40 billion |
| Lodging | 34,000 | 590,000 | $95 billion |
| Automotive | 25,000 | 195,000 | $28 billion |
| Commercial & Residential Services | 65,000 | 380,000 | $45 billion |

## The Power Imbalance

### Contract Terms Favor Franchisors

Franchise agreements are drafted by franchisors and are largely non-negotiable:

**Typical One-Sided Terms**:

| Term | Franchisor Benefit | Franchisee Risk |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Unilateral modification | Can change operations anytime | Must comply or face termination |
| Encroachment | Can open competing locations | Territory devalued |
| Sourcing requirements | Profit from supplies | Pay above-market prices |
| Non-compete clauses | Retain market control | Cannot open competing business |
| Termination at will | Easy exit from relationship | Lose entire investment |
| Mandatory arbitration | Avoid jury trials | Limited legal remedies |
| Venue selection | Home court advantage | Travel for disputes |

### Financial Extraction

**Fee Structure**:

| Fee Type | Typical Range | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Initial franchise fee | $10,000-50,000 | One-time payment to start |
| Royalty fee | 4-12% of gross sales | Ongoing, regardless of profit |
| Advertising fee | 1-4% of gross sales | National marketing fund |
| Technology fee | $500-2,000/month | Required systems |
| Training fee | $2,000-10,000 | Initial and ongoing |
| Renewal fee | $5,000-25,000 | To extend agreement |

**Cost of Goods Markup**:
Many franchisors require purchase of supplies, equipment, and inventory from approved suppliers at inflated prices:
- Food costs: 10-30% above market
- Equipment: 20-50% above market
- Uniforms and supplies: 15-40% above market
- Real estate (when landlord is franchisor): 15-30% premium

### Information Asymmetry

**What Franchisors Know**:
- Detailed unit-level economics across system
- Success and failure rates by location
- Actual revenue and profit potential
- Market saturation levels

**What Franchisees Don't Get**:
- Unit-level financial performance data (often not disclosed)
- Accurate success/failure rates
- Pending encroachment plans
- Actual market saturation

**FDD Disclosure Limitations**:
The Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) is required but often inadequate:
- Item 19 (financial performance) is optional
- Only 60% of franchisors provide any earnings data
- Data often cherry-picked or misleading
- Historical information, not forward-looking
- Litigation history may be incomplete

## Specific Harmful Practices

### Encroachment

Franchisors can open new locations (company-owned or franchised) that compete with existing franchisees:

**Forms of Encroachment**:
- New franchise units nearby
- Company-owned stores in territory
- Alternative channels (grocery, gas stations)
- Digital sales that bypass franchisees
- Ghost kitchens under same brand

**Example**: A pizza franchise has territorial "protection" but the franchisor:
- Opens delivery-only ghost kitchen in territory
- Sells same pizza through grocery stores
- Allows national delivery that ships into territory
- Opens new franchises just outside technical boundary

### Churning

Some franchisors profit from franchisee failure:

**The Churn Model**:
1. Collect $50,000 franchise fee
2. Franchisee opens, struggles
3. Franchisor provides minimal support
4. Franchisee fails after 2-3 years
5. Franchisor resells location to new franchisee
6. Repeat

**Evidence of Churning**:
- High franchisee turnover rates (some systems: 30%+ annual)
- Consistent franchise fee income despite failures
- Minimal investment in franchisee success
- Short average franchisee tenure

### Vicarious Liability Shifting

Franchisors maintain control over operations while disclaiming employment relationships:

**The Control Without Responsibility Model**:
- Franchisors dictate wages, schedules, uniforms, procedures
- But claim franchisees are the "employers"
- When workers sue for wage theft, franchisor claims independence
- When customers are harmed, franchisor disclaims liability

**Labor Violations in Franchises**:
- Wage theft endemic in fast food franchises
- 89% of fast food investigations found violations
- $200 million in back wages recovered (2010-2020)
- But franchisors rarely held accountable

### No-Poach and Non-Compete Agreements

**No-Poach Clauses**:
Until recently, many franchise agreements prohibited franchisees from hiring workers from other locations of the same brand:
- Workers couldn't move to better-paying locations
- Suppressed wages across system
- Antitrust concerns led to state bans

**Non-Compete Clauses**:
Prevent franchisees from:
- Opening competing businesses
- Working for competitors
- Sharing knowledge with competitors
- Often extend years after relationship ends

### Mandatory Purchasing

Franchisees must purchase from franchisor-approved suppliers:

| Item | Market Price | Franchise Price | Markup |
|------|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| Food products | $1.00 | $1.20-1.50 | 20-50% |
| Packaging | $0.10 | $0.15-0.20 | 50-100% |
| Equipment | $10,000 | $15,000-20,000 | 50-100% |
| Technology | $500/mo | $800-1,500/mo | 60-200% |
| Insurance | Market rate | +25-50% | Kickbacks |

### Termination and Non-Renewal

Franchisors can terminate relationships for minor violations:

**Common Termination Triggers**:
- Minor operational compliance issues
- Late fee payments
- Failure to remodel on franchisor's schedule
- Declining to adopt new programs
- Bad franchisor-franchisee relationship

**Consequences of Termination**:
- Total loss of investment ($100,000-2,000,000)
- No compensation for built goodwill
- Non-compete prevents similar business
- Personal guarantee debt remains
- Often cannot sell to recover value

## Legal Framework

### Federal Regulation

**FTC Franchise Rule**:
Requires disclosure via Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) but:
- No private right of action
- FTC enforcement rare
- No substantive protections
- Registration not required federally

**Deficiencies**:
- No earnings claims requirement
- No relationship protections
- No termination standards
- No territorial protections
- Arbitration allowed

### State Franchise Laws

**Registration States** (14 states require FDD filing):
California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin

**Relationship Law States** (vary in protections):

| State | Good Cause Termination | Transfer Rights | Encroachment Limits |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| California | Yes | Limited | No |
| Iowa | Yes | Yes | Limited |
| Wisconsin | Yes | Limited | No |
| New Jersey | Yes | Limited | No |
| Minnesota | Yes | Yes | No |
| Connecticut | Yes | Limited | No |

### Judicial Treatment

Courts generally enforce franchise agreements as written:
- Arbitration clauses upheld
- One-sided terms enforced
- Good faith obligations weak
- Franchisees lose majority of cases

## Case Studies

### McDonald's

**Scale**: 14,000+ U.S. locations, 93% franchised

**Franchisee Issues**:
- Rent and royalties consume 15-20% of sales
- Mandatory remodels every 10 years: $500,000-1,000,000
- Equipment purchases at markup
- Digital sales directed to company at franchisee expense
- Territory not protected from delivery overlap

### Subway

**Scale**: 20,000+ U.S. locations (peak: 27,000+)

**Documented Problems**:
- Massive overexpansion cannibalized sales
- Average unit volume dropped 25%+ from peak
- Franchisees losing money while system grew
- Headquarters moved overseas (tax avoidance)
- Development agents pushed growth over viability

### Hotel Franchises

**Issues Specific to Hotels**:
- PIPs (Property Improvement Plans) mandatory and expensive
- Brand requirements change frequently
- OTA commissions (15-30%) reduce franchisee margins
- Franchisor loyalty programs cost franchisees
- Rate parity requirements limit pricing freedom

### 7-Eleven

**Documented Practices**:
- Franchisees reported average take-home of $35,000-50,000/year
- 14-18 hour days common
- Mandatory inventory purchases
- Cash register controls by franchisor
- High fees on gross receipts, not profits

## The Franchisee Perspective

### Financial Reality

**Average Franchisee Economics** (quick service restaurant):

| Line Item | Amount | % of Revenue |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Gross Revenue | $1,000,000 | 100% |
| Cost of Goods | $320,000 | 32% |
| Labor | $280,000 | 28% |
| Royalty Fee | $60,000 | 6% |
| Advertising Fee | $40,000 | 4% |
| Rent | $80,000 | 8% |
| Other Operating | $120,000 | 12% |
| **Net Income** | **$100,000** | **10%** |
| Owner Labor (if working) | $50,000 | 5% |
| **Return on Investment** | **$50,000** | **~10% on $500K investment** |

**Risk-Adjusted Reality**:
- 10% return on capital for 50+ hour weeks
- Risk of total loss if terminated
- No equity buildup (brand belongs to franchisor)
- Limited exit options

### Why People Still Buy Franchises

Despite the risks, franchises remain attractive because:
- Brand recognition reduces marketing challenge
- Proven system reduces learning curve
- Training and support (varies)
- Financing easier (SBA loans available)
- Lower failure rate than independent startup (though data contested)

## Reform Proposals

### Federal Legislation Needed

**Franchise Relationship Act** (proposed):
1. Good cause termination requirement
2. Fair renewal standards
3. Encroachment limitations
4. Transfer rights
5. Supplier choice options
6. Earnings disclosure mandate
7. Association rights

### State-Level Reforms

**Model State Legislation**:
- Good cause termination
- Right to associate
- Churning prohibition
- Sourcing alternatives
- Arbitration limitations
- Transfer approval standards

### FTC Rule Strengthening

**Needed Updates**:
1. Mandatory earnings disclosures (Item 19 required)
2. Unit-level economics disclosure
3. Franchisee survival rates
4. Encroachment history
5. Private right of action
6. Relationship standards

### Industry Self-Reform

**Franchisor Best Practices**:
- Franchisee advisory councils with real power
- Transparent unit economics
- Reasonable termination standards
- Fair transfer rights
- Territorial protections
- Reasonable sourcing requirements

## Recommendations

### For Prospective Franchisees

1. **Consult franchise attorney** before signing
2. **Talk to existing and former franchisees** (Item 20 contact list)
3. **Demand Item 19 disclosure** (walk away if refused)
4. **Calculate total costs** including all fees and markups
5. **Understand territory rights** precisely
6. **Review termination provisions** carefully
7. **Assess franchisor financial health**

### For Policymakers

1. **Pass federal franchise relationship law**
2. **Strengthen FTC Franchise Rule**
3. **Enable class action rights** against franchisors
4. **Require unit-level disclosure**
5. **Ban no-poach agreements** nationwide
6. **Limit mandatory arbitration**

### For Existing Franchisees

1. **Join or form franchisee associations**
2. **Document all franchisor violations**
3. **Network with other franchisees**
4. **Know your legal rights** under state law
5. **Plan exit strategy** early

## Conclusion

Franchising represents a significant and often overlooked form of power imbalance in the economy. While presented as entrepreneurship, many franchisees are more accurately described as employees who bear all the risk but have little control. Reform requires recognizing that franchise agreements are not arms-length contracts between equals but relationships where one party holds overwhelming power over the other.
