# Small Business: Access to Capital and Credit

## The Financing Gap

Access to capital is consistently cited as the primary challenge facing small businesses. Despite representing 99.9% of all businesses, small enterprises receive only a fraction of available credit. This chapter examines the capital access landscape, identifies barriers, and explores solutions to the persistent financing gap.

## The Scale of the Problem

### Credit Demand vs. Supply

**Annual Small Business Credit Demand**: Approximately $1.4 trillion
**Annual Credit Supply to Small Businesses**: Approximately $700 billion
**Financing Gap**: $600-700 billion annually

### Loan Approval Disparities

| Lender Type | Approval Rate | Average Amount | Time to Funding |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Big Banks | 14.2% | $493,000 | 60-90 days |
| Small Banks | 19.1% | $148,000 | 30-45 days |
| Credit Unions | 20.5% | $87,000 | 30-45 days |
| Online Lenders | 24.3% | $50,000 | 1-7 days |
| SBA Loans | 52% (of applicants) | $417,000 | 45-90 days |
| Alternative Lenders | 56.2% | $27,000 | 1-3 days |

### Application Rates and Outcomes

**Who Applies for Credit**:

- 43% of small businesses sought financing in past year
- 25% did not apply due to discouragement (believed they would be rejected)
- 18% applied but were denied
- 57% received full amount requested
- 25% received partial funding
- 18% received no funding

## Types of Capital

### Debt Financing

**Traditional Bank Loans**:

- Term loans (1-10 year repayment)
- Lines of credit (revolving)
- Equipment financing
- Commercial real estate loans
- SBA-guaranteed loans

**Alternative Lending**:

- Online term loans
- Merchant cash advances
- Invoice factoring
- Revenue-based financing
- Peer-to-peer lending

### Equity Financing

**Friends and Family**: $60 billion annually
**Angel Investors**: $25 billion annually
**Venture Capital**: $330 billion annually (but only 0.5% goes to true small businesses)
**Private Equity**: Primarily acquisitions, not growth capital

### Other Sources

| Source | Annual Volume | Typical Use |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Personal Savings | $100+ billion | Startup capital |
| Credit Cards | $80 billion | Working capital |
| Home Equity | $50 billion | Startup/expansion |
| Crowdfunding | $17 billion | Product launch |
| Microloans | $2 billion | Very small businesses |

## Barriers to Capital Access

### Bank Consolidation

The dramatic consolidation of the banking industry has severely impacted small business lending.

**Community Bank Decline**:

- 1985: 15,000+ community banks
- 2000: 9,000 community banks
- 2023: 4,500 community banks

**Impact on Lending**:

- Community banks provide 60% of small business loans but hold only 15% of banking assets
- When community banks are acquired, small business lending in affected areas drops 20-40%
- Large banks allocate less than 5% of assets to small business lending

### Relationship Banking Erosion

| Era | Lending Model | Approval Basis |
|-----|---------------|----------------|
| Pre-1980 | Relationship | Character, local knowledge |
| 1980-2000 | Hybrid | Relationship + credit score |
| 2000-Present | Algorithmic | Credit score, collateral, cash flow |

**Problems with Algorithmic Lending**:

- Doesn't capture business potential
- Penalizes businesses without long credit histories
- Cannot assess character or management quality
- Favors asset-heavy over service businesses

### Collateral Requirements

Most bank loans require collateral exceeding the loan amount:

| Loan Type | Typical Collateral Requirement |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Equipment Loan | 100% of loan value in equipment |
| Working Capital | 100-150% in receivables/inventory |
| Term Loan | 100-200% in business/personal assets |
| Commercial RE | 75-80% LTV maximum |

**Who This Excludes**:

- Service businesses (no hard assets)
- New businesses (no accumulated assets)
- Businesses in leased spaces
- Owners without home equity

### Credit Score Dependence

| Credit Score | Loan Approval Odds | Interest Rate Premium |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 750+ | 65% | +0-2% over prime |
| 700-749 | 45% | +2-4% over prime |
| 650-699 | 25% | +4-8% over prime |
| 600-649 | 10% | +8-15% over prime |
| Below 600 | 3% | Alternative lenders only |

### Regulatory Barriers

Post-2008 regulations, while important for financial stability, increased lending costs:

- **Dodd-Frank compliance costs**: $10,000-50,000 per loan in processing
- **Basel III capital requirements**: Discourage small business lending (higher risk weights)
- **Stress testing**: Doesn't include small business lending in performance metrics

## Demographic Disparities

### Race and Ethnicity

**Loan Approval Rates by Race**:

| Race/Ethnicity | Application Rate | Approval Rate | Average Amount |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| White | 45% | 60% | $210,000 |
| Asian | 42% | 52% | $185,000 |
| Hispanic | 38% | 41% | $142,000 |
| Black | 46% | 29% | $87,000 |

**Contributing Factors**:

- Historical wealth disparities (less collateral)
- Lower credit scores (historical discrimination)
- Less access to banking relationships
- Geographic concentration in underbanked areas
- Implicit bias in lending decisions

### Gender Disparities

| Metric | Women-Owned | Men-Owned |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Loan Approval Rate | 31% | 47% |
| Average Loan Size | $68,000 | $142,000 |
| Interest Rate (average) | 8.2% | 7.1% |
| Collateral Required | 118% | 102% |
| Application Rate | 38% | 48% |

### Geographic Disparities

**Credit Deserts**:

- 1,200+ counties have no community bank presence
- Rural areas have 50% fewer lending options
- Low-income urban neighborhoods: 15% fewer bank branches than 2008

**Regional Approval Rates**:

| Region | Approval Rate | Community Banks per 100,000 |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Northeast | 42% | 4.2 |
| Midwest | 48% | 6.1 |
| South | 39% | 4.8 |
| West | 44% | 3.9 |

## Alternative Lending: Lifeline or Trap?

### Growth of Alternative Lenders

Alternative and online lending has exploded since 2010:

| Year | Alternative Lending Volume | Market Share |
|------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 2010 | $2 billion | 1% |
| 2015 | $15 billion | 6% |
| 2020 | $65 billion | 15% |
| 2023 | $120 billion | 22% |

### Comparison of Terms

| Lender Type | APR Range | Term | Speed | Hidden Fees |
|-------------|-----------|------|-------|-------------|
| Bank Term Loan | 5-10% | 3-10 years | 45-90 days | Minimal |
| SBA Loan | 7-11% | 7-25 years | 30-90 days | Minimal |
| Online Term Loan | 15-45% | 1-5 years | 1-7 days | Common |
| Merchant Cash Advance | 40-350%* | 3-18 months | 1-3 days | Significant |
| Invoice Factoring | 15-40%* | Ongoing | 1-2 days | Common |

*Effective APR when fees are annualized

### Predatory Practices

**Merchant Cash Advances**:

- Not technically loans, so not covered by lending laws
- Daily or weekly automatic payments
- "Factor rates" obscure true cost
- Confession of judgment clauses
- Stacking multiple advances leads to debt spiral

**Warning Signs of Predatory Lending**:

- Factor rates instead of APR disclosure
- Mandatory daily/weekly payment
- Personal guarantees plus UCC liens
- Prepayment penalties
- Automatic renewal clauses

## The Venture Capital Myth

### VC Reality for Small Business

Venture capital is often discussed as a solution, but:

| VC Statistic | Reality |
|--------------|---------|
| Companies funded annually | ~12,000 |
| Companies seeking funding | 1+ million |
| Funding rate | <1% |
| Geographic concentration | 75% in CA, NY, MA |
| Sector concentration | 80%+ in tech/biotech |
| Founder demographics | 77% white, 94% male |

### Misalignment with Small Business

Most small businesses are unsuitable for VC:

| VC Requirement | Small Business Reality |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 10x return potential | Steady, modest growth |
| Rapid scaling | Local/regional focus |
| Exit in 5-7 years | Generational ownership |
| Disruptive technology | Traditional services/products |
| Board seats, control | Owner independence valued |

## Solutions and Alternatives

### Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)

CDFIs provide an alternative to both traditional banks and predatory lenders:

**Current Scale**:

- 1,300+ certified CDFIs
- $222 billion in assets
- Serve 30 million people in underserved communities

**Advantages**:

- Mission-driven (not profit-maximizing)
- Relationship-based lending
- Technical assistance included
- Lower default rates than expected
- Geographic focus on underserved areas

**Limitations**:

- Limited capital (need 10x current funding)
- Cannot achieve scale individually
- Reliant on federal funding

### State and Local Programs

| Program Type | Examples | Typical Terms |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| State Revolving Loan Funds | CA SSBCI, NY SB Loan Fund | 3-7% interest, 5-10 year terms |
| Loan Guarantee Programs | State guarantees on bank loans | 50-80% guarantee |
| Microenterprise Grants | City/county grants | $5,000-50,000 |
| IDA Programs | Matched savings accounts | 2:1 to 4:1 match |
| Linked Deposit Programs | State deposits in local banks | Reduced rates |

### Credit Union Expansion

Credit unions are expanding small business lending:

- 2010: $38 billion in small business loans
- 2023: $80 billion in small business loans
- Member Business Loan cap raised to 27.5% of assets (2017)
- Higher approval rates than banks
- More flexible terms

### Public Banking

Public banks could transform small business lending:

**Bank of North Dakota Model**:

- Partners with local banks on small business loans
- Buys down interest rates
- Provides loan guarantees
- Student loan refinancing frees capital

**Potential Impact**:

- Estimated $50+ billion in additional lending capacity if 10 states created public banks
- Lower interest rates through reduced profit requirements
- Countercyclical lending during downturns

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Expand CDFI Fund to $10 billion annually** (current: $300 million)
2. **Create federal small business lending facility** modeled on pandemic programs
3. **Regulate merchant cash advances** as loans
4. **Require APR disclosure** for all business credit products
5. **Increase SBA microloan cap** from $50,000 to $150,000

### Structural Reforms

1. **Revise capital requirements** to reduce risk weight for small business loans
2. **Create community reinvestment requirements** for online lenders
3. **Establish public banking options** in underserved states
4. **Expand credit union business lending** authority
5. **Develop alternative credit scoring** for thin-file borrowers

### Support Programs

1. **Technical assistance funding** tied to lending programs
2. **Guarantee programs** targeting minority and women entrepreneurs
3. **Startup capital matching** through state IDA programs
4. **Patient capital** programs for slow-growth businesses

## Conclusion

The capital access problem is solvable. It requires recognizing that market forces alone will not serve small business needs, that algorithmic lending cannot replace relationship banking, and that public investment in lending infrastructure is essential. The $600 billion annual financing gap represents both a market failure and a policy choice—one that can be changed.
