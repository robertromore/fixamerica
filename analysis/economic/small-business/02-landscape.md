# Small Business: Landscape and Definitions

## Understanding the Small Business Universe

The term "small business" encompasses an extraordinarily diverse range of enterprises, from solo freelancers working from home to manufacturing firms employing hundreds of workers. This chapter provides a comprehensive map of the small business landscape, including how businesses are defined, measured, and categorized across different contexts.

## Official Definitions

### SBA Size Standards

The Small Business Administration maintains industry-specific size standards that determine eligibility for federal programs, contracting preferences, and regulatory exemptions.

**Employee-Based Standards**:

| Industry Sector | Maximum Employees |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Most Manufacturing | 500 |
| Most Retail | 100-500 |
| Most Services | 100-500 |
| Construction (General) | 1,000 |
| Agriculture | 500 |
| Wholesale Trade | 100-250 |

**Revenue-Based Standards**:

| Agriculture | $1-17.5 million |
| Construction (Specialty) | $16.5 million |
| Health Care | $8-35 million |

### Problems with Current Definitions

**"Small" Businesses That Aren't Small**:
- A 499-employee manufacturer is hardly "small" by common understanding
- Private equity-backed companies can exploit size standards through affiliate rules
- Restaurant chains with thousands of locations qualify as "small" if each is separately owned

**Recommended Distinctions**:

| Category | Employee Count | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| Self-Employed | 0 | No employees |
| Micro | 1-9 | Very small, often family |
| Small | 10-49 | True small businesses |
| Medium | 50-249 | Established enterprises |
| Large | 250+ | Major employers |
