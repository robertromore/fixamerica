# Small Business: Overview

## Introduction

Small businesses form the backbone of the American economy, representing 99.9% of all U.S. businesses and employing nearly half the private workforce. Yet these enterprises face mounting challenges from concentrated corporate power, rising costs, restricted capital access, and regulatory complexity that threatens their survival and the economic diversity they provide. Understanding the small business landscape is essential to addressing economic inequality, preserving competitive markets, and maintaining pathways to economic mobility.

## Why This Issue Matters

### Economic Impact

Small businesses are not merely economic units—they are community anchors, innovation incubators, and the primary vehicle for wealth building among middle-class Americans. Their health directly affects:

**Employment and Wages**: Small businesses employ 46.4% of private sector workers—approximately 61.7 million Americans. They create two-thirds of net new jobs and often provide entry-level opportunities for workers transitioning into the labor force.

**Economic Diversity**: Local ownership keeps dollars circulating within communities. Studies show that for every $100 spent at a local business, $68 stays in the local economy compared to $43 for chain stores.

**Innovation**: Small businesses produce 16 times more patents per employee than large firms. They are responsible for approximately 43% of U.S. high-tech employment.

**Community Stability**: Main Street businesses fund local schools, support community organizations, and maintain the social fabric that makes neighborhoods livable.

### Current State of Crisis

The small business sector faces existential pressures:

- **Declining Formation**: Business startup rates have fallen from approximately 12-13% of all firms annually in the 1980s to around 8% today
- **Increasing Concentration**: The share of employment at large firms (500+ employees) has grown from 51% in 1988 to over 54% today
- **Pandemic Devastation**: Over 200,000 establishments permanently closed during COVID-19, with minority-owned businesses suffering disproportionately
- **Rising Costs**: Commercial rent, health insurance, and regulatory compliance costs consume ever-larger shares of revenue

## Key Definitions

### What Constitutes a "Small Business"?

The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines small businesses using industry-specific standards based on:

- **Employee Count**: Most common threshold is fewer than 500 employees, though this varies by industry from 100 to 1,500
- **Annual Revenue**: Ranges from $1 million to $41.5 million depending on industry
- **NAICS Codes**: Each industry classification has specific size standards

**For this analysis**, we focus primarily on businesses with:

- Fewer than 100 employees (true small businesses)
- Fewer than 20 employees (very small/micro businesses)
- Self-employed individuals with no employees

### Types of Small Businesses

| Category | Size | Count | % of Total |
|----------|------|-------|------------|
| Nonemployer | 0 employees | 27.1 million | 81.0% |
| Micro | 1-9 employees | 5.0 million | 14.9% |
| Small | 10-99 employees | 1.2 million | 3.6% |
| Medium | 100-499 employees | 0.14 million | 0.4% |

## Historical Context

### The Golden Age of Small Business (1945-1980)

The post-war period represented peak small business vitality:

- **Anti-Monopoly Enforcement**: Vigorous antitrust action prevented excessive concentration
- **Banking Regulation**: Geographic restrictions on banks maintained local lending relationships
- **Fair Trade Laws**: Robinson-Patman Act enforced price discrimination protections
- **Community Investment**: Local banks reinvested deposits in community businesses

### The Consolidation Era (1980-Present)

Systematic policy changes undermined small business competitiveness:

**1980s Deregulation**:

- Savings & loan deregulation eliminated community banking
- Antitrust enforcement declined dramatically
- Robinson-Patman Act enforcement essentially ceased

**1990s-2000s Concentration**:

- Bank consolidation reduced small business lending
- Big-box retail expansion destroyed Main Street commerce
- Walmart effect: average small town lost 47% of retail trade within 10 years of Walmart opening

**2010s Platform Monopolies**:

- Amazon's market dominance restructured retail
- Platform dependency created new vulnerability
- Algorithmic pricing and self-preferencing harmed third-party sellers

## The Scale of the Challenge

### Business Formation Decline

| Decade | New Business Rate | Net New Firms |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1980s | 12-13% annually | Positive |
| 1990s | 10-11% annually | Declining positive |
| 2000s | 9-10% annually | Near zero |
| 2010s | 8-9% annually | Often negative |
| 2020s | Volatile | COVID recovery unclear |

### Market Concentration by Sector

| Sector | Top 4 Firm Share | Change Since 1997 |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| General Merchandise | 82% | +20 points |
| Commercial Banking | 59% | +27 points |
| Book Stores | 71% | +35 points |
| Pharmacies | 66% | +22 points |
| Office Supplies | 89% | +41 points |

## Affected Populations

### Who Runs Small Businesses?

**By Demographics**:

- 22.7% women-owned businesses (but only 4.3% of revenue)
- 18.7% minority-owned businesses
- Veterans own 2.5 million businesses
- Immigrants are 80% more likely to start businesses

**By Generation**:

- Average small business owner age: 50.3 years
- Millennial ownership: 9% (lowest rate for any generation at same age)
- Gen X: 26%
- Baby Boomers: 41%

### Geographic Distribution

Small business density varies significantly:

**Highest Rates**: Montana, Wyoming, Vermont, Maine, Colorado
**Lowest Rates**: Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia

Rural areas have higher per capita small business rates but face greater closure risks.
