# Consumer Debt: Root Causes

## Overview

America's consumer debt crisis results from the convergence of multiple structural factors: stagnant wages, rising essential costs, financial system deregulation, inadequate safety nets, and deliberate policy choices that shifted financial risk onto individuals. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective solutions.

## Structural Causes

### Wage Stagnation

The fundamental driver of consumer debt is the gap between income and expenses.

**The Wage-Productivity Disconnect**

| Period | Productivity Growth | Wage Growth | Gap |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|-----|
| 1948-1973 | 96% | 91% | 5% |
| 1973-2023 | 81% | 15% | 66% |

**If Wages Had Kept Pace**

- Median hourly wage would be $28+ (vs. $23 actual)
- Median household income would be $100,000+ (vs. $75,000)
- Annual shortfall per household: $15,000-25,000
- This gap is filled by: debt

**Why Wages Stagnated**

1. Union decline (33% to 10% private sector)
2. Globalization and offshoring
3. Technology replacing workers
4. Minimum wage erosion
5. Monopsony in labor markets
6. Shareholder primacy shifting surplus to capital

### Essential Cost Inflation

Costs of necessities have risen faster than incomes and general inflation.

**Education Costs**

| Year | Public 4-Year Tuition | Private 4-Year Tuition | % of Median Income |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 1980 | $2,100 | $9,500 | 4% / 18% |
| 2000 | $4,300 | $21,000 | 8% / 40% |
| 2024 | $11,300 | $43,000 | 15% / 57% |

**Healthcare Costs**

| Year | Per Capita Spending | % of GDP | Uncompensated Care |
|------|--------------------| ---------|-------------------|
| 1980 | $1,100 | 8.9% | $10 billion |
| 2000 | $4,800 | 13.3% | $35 billion |
| 2024 | $14,600 | 17.3% | $90 billion |

**Housing Costs**

| Year | Median Home Price | Price-to-Income Ratio |
|------|------------------|----------------------|
| 1980 | $64,000 | 2.8x |
| 2000 | $165,000 | 3.3x |
| 2024 | $412,000 | 5.5x |

**Childcare Costs**

- Average annual cost: $10,000-$20,000+ per child
- Exceeds public college tuition in most states
- Not covered by most assistance programs
- Forces families into debt or out of workforce

### Financial System Design

The financial system is designed to profit from debt.

**Interest Rate Deregulation**

- Marquette National Bank v. First of Omaha (1978) eliminated state rate caps
- Banks can now charge unlimited interest
- Relocated to states with no limits (Delaware, South Dakota)
- Created incentive to lend to high-risk borrowers at high rates

**Information Asymmetry**

| Lender Advantage | Consumer Disadvantage |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Sophisticated pricing models | Limited financial education |
| Hidden fees and terms | Complexity by design |
| Behavioral manipulation | Cognitive biases exploited |
| Legal resources | No access to justice |

**Credit Scoring System**

- Opaque algorithms consumers don't understand
- Errors common, disputes difficult
- Penalizes poverty (thin files, medical debt)
- Self-reinforcing: bad scores lead to worse terms

### Inadequate Safety Net

Americans lack protections that would prevent debt in other countries.

**Healthcare Comparison**

| Country | Universal Coverage | Medical Debt | Medical Bankruptcy |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| United States | No | $220 billion | 500,000/year |
| Canada | Yes | Minimal | Near zero |
| Germany | Yes | Minimal | Near zero |
| UK | Yes | Minimal | Near zero |

**Education Comparison**

| Country | Public University Cost | Student Debt/GDP |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|
| United States | $11,300/year | 7.5% |
| Germany | $0 | 0% |
| France | $200/year | Minimal |
| Norway | $0 | Minimal |

**Unemployment/Emergency Support**

| Country | Replacement Rate | Duration | Emergency Fund Access |
|---------|-----------------|----------|----------------------|
| United States | 45% | 26 weeks | 40% can't cover $400 |
| Germany | 67% | Up to 2 years | Stronger savings |
| Denmark | 90% | 2 years | Universal support |

## Policy Drivers

### Bankruptcy "Reform"

The 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act:

**Changes Made**

| Pre-2005 | Post-2005 |
|----------|-----------|
| Easier Chapter 7 access | Means test restricts access |
| Student loans dischargeable (with difficulty) | Private student loans non-dischargeable |
| Fresh start philosophy | Punitive approach |
| State law variations | Federal uniformity |

**Consequences**

- Fewer bankruptcies, but more debt traps
- Student loans become permanent
- Creditors emboldened
- Debtors left without exit

### Student Loan Policy

**Federal Policy Created Crisis**

| Policy Choice | Alternative | Impact |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Loans instead of grants | Grant-based aid | $1.7 trillion in debt |
| No interest caps | Subsidized or capped rates | Billions in interest |
| For-profit eligibility | Public/nonprofit only | Widespread fraud |
| Unlimited graduate borrowing | Reasonable limits | Law/medical debt crisis |
| Non-dischargeability | Normal bankruptcy | No relief option |

**State Disinvestment**

| Year | State Funding per Student | Tuition Share |
|------|--------------------------|---------------|
| 1980 | 75% of costs | 25% |
| 2000 | 60% of costs | 40% |
| 2024 | 40% of costs | 60% |

### Healthcare Finance Policy

**Why Medical Debt Exists**

1. No universal coverage (30 million uninsured)
2. High deductibles ($1,700 average)
3. Surprise billing (somewhat addressed by No Surprises Act)
4. Price opacity
5. Aggressive collections

**Insurance System Problems**

| Issue | Mechanism | Debt Result |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Coverage gaps | 30M uninsured | Full bill exposure |
| High deductibles | Cost shifting to patients | Out-of-pocket burden |
| Network exclusions | In/out-of-network | Surprise bills |
| Prior authorization | Denials | Delayed/denied care |
| Lifetime/annual caps | Coverage limits | Catastrophic exposure |

### Predatory Lending Enablement

**Regulatory Failures**

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Preemption of state usury laws | 400% APR payday loans |
| Weak CFPB enforcement (Trump era) | Reduced accountability |
| OCC preemption rules | Banks escape state oversight |
| Regulatory arbitrage | Lenders exploit gaps |

**Industry Political Power**

- Financial services: $2.8 billion in lobbying (2000-2020)
- Campaign contributions shape legislation
- Revolving door between regulators and industry
- State-level lobbying against rate caps

## Market Failures

### Behavioral Economics

Lenders exploit cognitive biases:

**Common Exploited Biases**

| Bias | Exploitation | Debt Impact |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Present bias | Low initial payments | Future payment shock |
| Optimism bias | "I'll pay it off quickly" | Long-term debt trap |
| Complexity aversion | Don't read fine print | Hidden fees/terms |
| Anchoring | Focus on monthly payment | Ignore total cost |
| Status quo bias | Auto-enrollment, auto-renewal | Persistent debt |

### Information Problems

**Consumer Knowledge Gaps**

| Concept | Consumer Understanding |
|---------|----------------------|
| Compound interest | 30% understand well |
| APR meaning | 45% understand |
| Credit score factors | 40% understand |
| Loan amortization | 25% understand |
| Total cost of credit | 35% can calculate |

**Deliberate Obscurity**

- 30+ page credit card agreements
- Variable rate complexity
- Fee schedules buried
- Terms change without notice

### Competition Failures

**Why Markets Don't Discipline Lenders**

| Market Failure | Explanation |
|----------------|-------------|
| Switching costs | Hard to change lenders mid-loan |
| Reputation opacity | Lender practices not visible |
| Distressed borrowing | Desperate borrowers accept any terms |
| Search friction | Comparison shopping difficult |
| Product complexity | Can't compare unlike products |

## Inequality Dynamics

### Wealth Begets Wealth, Debt Begets Debt

**The Matthew Effect in Finance**

| If You Have Wealth | If You Have Debt |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Better credit scores | Worse credit scores |
| Lower interest rates | Higher interest rates |
| Access to better products | Predatory products only |
| Can weather emergencies | Emergencies create more debt |
| Investment returns | Interest payments |

### Racial Wealth Gap Perpetuation

**Historical Exclusion**

| Era | Policy/Practice | Debt Legacy |
|-----|-----------------|-------------|
| Pre-1968 | Redlining | Excluded from homeownership |
| 1970s-90s | Reverse redlining | Targeted for predatory loans |
| 1990s-2008 | Subprime targeting | Foreclosure crisis |
| Present | Algorithmic discrimination | Higher rates, less access |

**Current Disparities**

| Factor | Black Borrowers | White Borrowers |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Average mortgage rate | 0.3% higher | Baseline |
| Credit card APR | 3% higher | Baseline |
| Loan denial rate | 2x higher | Baseline |
| Subprime share | 30% higher | Baseline |

### Intergenerational Transmission

**How Debt Passes Down**

1. Less parental support for education
2. Co-signing creates shared liability
3. Less inheritance to offset debt
4. Education about finances limited
5. Network effects (who you know)

## Systemic Issues

### The Debt-Dependency Economy

**How the Economy Requires Debt**

| Requirement | Why Debt-Dependent |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Human capital | Education costs require loans |
| Transportation | Car required for most jobs |
| Housing | Home prices exceed savings capacity |
| Health maintenance | Insurance gaps, high costs |
| Basic consumption | Wages insufficient |

### Financialization

**Finance Sector Growth**

| Year | Finance Share of GDP | Finance Share of Profits |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| 1950 | 2.8% | 10% |
| 1980 | 4.9% | 16% |
| 2000 | 7.3% | 30% |
| 2020 | 8.3% | 25% |

**Impact on Debt**

- Financial innovation creates new debt products
- Securitization distances lenders from consequences
- Quarterly profit pressure drives origination volume
- Debt becomes commodity to be traded

### Employer Benefits Erosion

**Shifting Costs to Workers**

| Benefit | 1980 | 2024 | Debt Impact |
|---------|------|------|-------------|
| Pension coverage | 38% | 15% | Retirement debt |
| Health insurance (employer-paid share) | 80% | 70% | Medical debt |
| Paid leave | Minimal | Still minimal | Emergency debt |
| Education assistance | Growing | Limited | Student debt |

## Root Cause Summary

### Proximate Causes

- Low wages relative to costs
- High essential prices (education, healthcare, housing)
- Predatory lending practices
- Inadequate consumer protection
- Bankruptcy restrictions

### Structural Causes

- Financial deregulation since 1970s
- Decline of labor power
- Privatization of public goods
- Winner-take-all economy
- Political capture by financial interests

### Ideological Causes

- Individualism over collective provision
- Market fundamentalism
- Moral framing of debt as personal failure
- Resistance to "big government" solutions

## Why the Problem Persists

### Political Economy

| Interest | Stake | Political Power |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| Financial industry | Profits from debt | High (lobbying, campaign finance) |
| Debtors | Relief from debt | Low (diffuse, stigmatized) |
| Taxpayers | Cost of relief | Moderate (competing priorities) |
| Employers | Low-wage workforce | High (business lobby) |

### Ideological Barriers

- "Personal responsibility" framing
- Fear of moral hazard
- Deficit hawkism
- Anti-government sentiment
- Racial resentment (debt relief seen as benefiting minorities)

### Path Dependency

- Existing systems hard to change
- Transition costs high
- Stakeholder lock-in
- Incremental reform difficult when system designed for extraction

## Key Takeaways

1. **Wage-cost gap fundamental**: Debt fills income-expense mismatch
2. **Deregulation enabled crisis**: Policy choices, not market forces
3. **Safety net gaps create debt**: Healthcare, education, emergencies
4. **System designed for extraction**: Profitable to keep people in debt
5. **Racial disparities structural**: Historical exclusion compounds
6. **Political power imbalanced**: Creditors organized, debtors diffuse
7. **Ideology reinforces status quo**: Personal responsibility narrative
