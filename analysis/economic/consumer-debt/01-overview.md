# Consumer Debt: Overview

## Executive Summary

Consumer debt in America has reached crisis proportions, with total household debt exceeding $17 trillion and student loan debt alone surpassing $1.7 trillion. This debt burden falls disproportionately on younger Americans, people of color, and those with lower incomes, creating a drag on economic mobility, homeownership, entrepreneurship, and family formation. While some debt enables wealth-building (mortgages) or human capital investment (education), much of America's consumer debt reflects predatory lending practices, inadequate wages, healthcare costs, and an economy that requires borrowing for basic necessities.
