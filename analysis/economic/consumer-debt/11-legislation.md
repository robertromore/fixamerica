    servicer performance, opaque terms, and predatory for-profit

    nationwide, circumventing state usury laws.
(5) Payday, title, and high-cost installment loans with APRs of 200-

(6) High-cost lending concentrates in communities of color, perpetuating
    the racial wealth gap.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Supreme Court's 1978 decision in Marquette National Bank v.
    First of Omaha effectively preempted state usury laws.

        marketing, or servicing the loan; or

(b) BANK PARTNERSHIP RULE.—Notwithstanding the originating entity, a
    loan shall be subject to the usury laws of the borrower's state.

(a) VALID WHEN MADE.—The interest rate permissible on a loan is
    determined at origination; provided that the loan was made in
    compliance with applicable usury laws.

(b) NO LAUNDERING.—If a loan was void or unenforceable under state
    usury law, sale or assignment does not cure the defect.

SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT.

**Preemption**

| Area | Analysis |
|------|----------|
| Bank interest rates | Marquette may require amendment |
| State usury laws | Floor-not-ceiling preserves state authority |
| CFPB rules | Express non-preemption where desired |
