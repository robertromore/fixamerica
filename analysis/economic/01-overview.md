# Economic Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

The American economy has become a machine that generates extraordinary wealth while failing to deliver broadly shared prosperity. Over the past four decades, productivity has nearly doubled while median wages have stagnated. The wealthiest 1% now own more than the bottom 50% combined. Corporate profits have reached record highs while small businesses struggle to compete against monopolistic giants. Financial speculation has outpaced productive investment. The tax system increasingly favors wealth over work. And economic mobility, once the hallmark of the American Dream, has declined to levels below most peer nations.

This is not an accident. It is the predictable result of policy choices made over decades: tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, deregulation that allows corporate consolidation, trade policies that prioritize capital over labor, weakened antitrust enforcement, and the systematic undermining of worker bargaining power. These choices were made by a political system increasingly captured by wealthy donors and corporate interests.

Economic reform is essential not only for fairness but for democracy itself. Extreme economic inequality translates directly into political inequality, as the wealthy use their resources to shape policy in their favor. Breaking this cycle requires fundamental reforms to taxation, antitrust, financial regulation, labor policy, and the rules that govern markets.

## Key Questions

1. **Why has economic growth stopped benefiting most Americans?** What policy changes caused the divergence between productivity and wages?

2. **How did corporate concentration become so extreme?** What happened to antitrust enforcement, and what are the consequences of monopoly power?

3. **Why does the tax system favor wealth over work?** How do tax preferences, loopholes, and enforcement gaps benefit the wealthy?

4. **What role has finance played in economic dysfunction?** How did Wall Street gain so much power, and what are the costs of financialization?

5. **How can we rebuild an economy that works for everyone?** What combination of policies would restore broadly shared prosperity?

6. **What stands in the way of reform?** Who benefits from the status quo, and how can their resistance be overcome?

## Why This Matters

Economic dysfunction affects virtually every aspect of American life:

### For Families

- **Stagnant living standards**: Despite working more hours, most families have not experienced real income gains in decades
- **Financial insecurity**: 40% of Americans cannot cover a $400 emergency expense
- **Crushing debt**: Student loans, medical bills, and credit card debt trap millions in financial distress
- **Retirement anxiety**: Most Americans are unprepared for retirement as pensions have disappeared

### For Communities

- **Hollowed-out towns**: Deindustrialization has devastated entire regions
- **Declining small business**: Main Street cannot compete with Amazon and Walmart
- **Brain drain**: Young people leave struggling areas for opportunity elsewhere
- **Social decay**: Economic stress contributes to addiction, family breakdown, and declining civic participation

### For Democracy

- **Political capture**: The wealthy use economic power to buy political influence
- **Declining trust**: Economic anxiety fuels distrust in institutions
- **Polarization**: Economic grievances are weaponized for political purposes
- **Oligarchy risk**: Extreme inequality threatens democratic governance

### For the Economy Itself

- **Slower growth**: Inequality dampens consumer demand and economic dynamism
- **Reduced innovation**: Monopolies stifle competition and entrepreneurship
- **Financial instability**: Under-regulated finance creates crisis risk
- **Wasted potential**: Millions cannot contribute their full productive capacity

## The Opportunity

Despite entrenched interests, there are reasons for hope:

- **Bipartisan concern**: Majorities across party lines support taxing the wealthy, breaking up monopolies, and raising wages
- **Growing awareness**: The 2008 financial crisis, Occupy Wall Street, and pandemic exposed economic fragility
- **Policy innovation**: New ideas from across the ideological spectrum (industrial policy, antitrust revival, wealth taxes)
- **State and local action**: Cities and states raising minimum wages, implementing paid leave, pursuing local antitrust
- **Business voices**: Some business leaders recognizing that extreme inequality threatens long-term prosperity
- **International examples**: Other countries demonstrating alternatives to American-style capitalism
