# Economic Reform: Current State

## The Problem Today

### Income Inequality

**The Great Divergence**

Since the late 1970s, income growth has concentrated overwhelmingly at the top of the distribution:

- The top 1% captured 54% of all income growth from 1979-2019
- The top 0.1% saw incomes grow 345% while the bottom 50% saw 20% growth
- Real median household income has barely budged in decades, adjusting for inflation and household size changes
- The income share going to the top 10% reached 50%, levels not seen since the 1920s

**Geographic Inequality**

Income disparities have widened between regions:

- Coastal metropolitan areas have pulled away from the rest of the country
- Counties containing the top 50 metros now generate 75% of GDP
- Rural areas and small cities have experienced decades of decline
- The gap between richest and poorest states continues to widen

### Wealth Concentration

**Extreme Concentration at the Top**

Wealth inequality is even more severe than income inequality:

- The top 1% owns $44 trillion, more than the entire bottom 90%
- The 3 wealthiest Americans own as much as the bottom 50%
- The top 0.1% owns nearly as much as the bottom 90%
- Billionaire wealth doubled during the pandemic while median families struggled

**Racial Wealth Gap**

Historic discrimination has created persistent disparities:

| Metric | White Families | Black Families | Hispanic Families |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Median wealth | $189,100 | $24,100 | $36,200 |
| Homeownership rate | 73% | 44% | 48% |
| Stock ownership | 61% | 33% | 24% |
| Business ownership rate | 15% | 5% | 7% |

**Inheritance and Dynastic Wealth**

Wealth increasingly passes across generations:

- 35-40% of wealth in America is inherited
- The estate tax applies to fewer than 2,000 estates annually
- Trust structures allow wealth to avoid taxation indefinitely
- Stepped-up basis eliminates capital gains taxes at death

### Wage Stagnation

**Productivity-Pay Gap**

Workers have not shared in the gains from economic growth:

| Period | Productivity Growth | Hourly Compensation Growth |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 1948-1979 | 108% | 93% |
| 1979-2024 | 65% | 17% |

The gap represents trillions of dollars shifted from workers to owners.

**Erosion of Worker Power**

Multiple factors have undermined wages:

- Private sector union membership: 6% (down from 35% in 1950s)
- Real minimum wage: $7.25 (worth $4.00 in 1968 dollars)
- Non-compete agreements affect 18% of workers
- Wage theft exceeds $15 billion annually
- Misclassification denies benefits to millions

**The Working Poor**

Many full-time workers cannot escape poverty:

- 44 million workers earn less than $18/hour
- 25% of jobs pay below poverty line for a family of four
- 7 million workers hold multiple jobs
- 28% of workers lack access to paid sick leave
- Many working families rely on public assistance to survive

### Corporate Concentration

**Monopoly Power Across Industries**

Consolidation has dramatically increased in most sectors:

| Industry | Market Concentration (Top 4 firms) |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Airlines | 80% of domestic passengers |
| Wireless telecom | 98% of subscribers |
| Social media | 80%+ (Meta, TikTok, X) |
| Search engines | 90%+ (Google) |
| Beer | 65% (AB InBev, Molson Coors) |
| Meatpacking | 85% (4 companies) |
| Prescription drug distribution | 90% (3 companies) |
| Defense contractors | 90% (5 companies) |

**Decline of Competition**

Market dynamism has weakened:

- Startup rate has fallen 50% since 1970s
- Number of public companies cut nearly in half since 1990s
- Business entry rate now lower than exit rate
- Large firms hold $4+ trillion in cash rather than investing
- Markups (prices over costs) have increased 50% since 1980

**Platform Monopolies**

Technology giants dominate key markets:

- Google controls 92% of search and 70%+ of digital ad market
- Amazon represents 50%+ of e-commerce and dominates cloud services
- Apple and Google control 99% of mobile operating systems
- Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp
- Microsoft dominates productivity software and cloud services

### The Tax System

**Race to the Bottom**

Tax policy has shifted burden from capital to labor:

| Tax Rate | 1950s | 1970s | Today |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Top marginal income rate | 91% | 70% | 37% |
| Top capital gains rate | 25% | 35% | 20% |
| Corporate rate | 52% | 48% | 21% |
| Estate tax exemption | $60,000 | $175,000 | $13+ million |

**Loopholes and Avoidance**

The wealthy legally minimize their taxes:

- Carried interest loophole saves hedge fund managers billions
- Step-up in basis eliminates $40+ billion in capital gains annually
- Real estate "like-kind exchanges" defer taxes indefinitely
- Offshore tax havens shelter $2+ trillion in corporate profits
- Pass-through deduction benefits wealthy business owners

**Enforcement Collapse**

The IRS cannot enforce existing law:

- IRS budget cut 20% in real terms since 2010
- Audit rate for millionaires dropped from 8% to 1%
- Estimated tax gap exceeds $600 billion annually
- Wealthy taxpayers can afford lawyers to fight IRS
- Collections from top earners have plummeted

### Trade and Globalization

**Manufacturing Decline**

Trade policy accelerated deindustrialization:

- Manufacturing employment: 12 million (down from 19 million in 1980)
- Estimated job losses from China trade: 2-3 million
- Trade deficit in goods: ~$1 trillion annually
- Manufacturing share of GDP: 11% (down from 25% in 1970)

**Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**

Offshoring created strategic weaknesses:

- Semiconductor production shifted almost entirely to Asia
- Critical minerals and pharmaceuticals largely imported
- Pandemic exposed fragility of global supply chains
- National security concerns about foreign dependence

**Benefits to Capital, Costs to Labor**

Trade gains were not shared:

- Corporate profits from globalization concentrated at top
- Workers in affected industries saw wages decline
- Communities devastated by plant closures
- Promised retraining and transition support largely failed

### Financial Sector Dominance

**Financialization of the Economy**

Finance has grown relative to the productive economy:

| Metric | 1980 | Today |
|--------|------|-------|
| Finance share of GDP | 4.9% | 8.3% |
| Finance share of corporate profits | 10% | 25-30% |
| Financial assets to GDP ratio | 4:1 | 10:1 |
| Household debt to income | 60% | 100% |

**Short-Termism**

Financial pressure distorts corporate behavior:

- Average stock holding period: 5 months (was 8 years in 1960)
- Stock buybacks now exceed R&D spending
- Quarterly earnings pressure undermines long-term investment
- Private equity strips assets and loads debt
- Hostile takeovers punish patient capital

**Predatory Finance**

The financial sector extracts wealth from ordinary Americans:

- Overdraft fees: $10+ billion annually
- Payday loan interest: 400% APR average
- Credit card interest: $130+ billion annually
- Student loan debt: $1.7 trillion
- Mortgage servicing abuses persist

### Debt Levels

**Household Debt**

Americans are increasingly indebted:

| Debt Category | Total Outstanding |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Mortgages | $12.5 trillion |
| Student loans | $1.7 trillion |
| Auto loans | $1.6 trillion |
| Credit cards | $1.1 trillion |
| **Total** | **$17+ trillion** |

**Corporate Debt**

Companies have leveraged up:

- Non-financial corporate debt: $13+ trillion
- Debt-to-GDP ratio at historic highs
- "Zombie companies" (unable to cover interest) proliferating
- Leveraged buyouts leave companies debt-laden
- Credit quality deteriorating

**Government Debt**

Federal debt has ballooned:

- Federal debt held by public: $28+ trillion (100%+ of GDP)
- Annual interest payments: $600+ billion
- Tax cuts primary driver of deficits since 2000
- Debt ceiling crises manufactured periodically
- Social Security and Medicare face long-term shortfalls

### Economic Mobility Decline

**The American Dream Fading**

Upward mobility has declined substantially:

| Birth Year | Probability of Earning More Than Parents |
|------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1940 | 92% |
| 1950 | 79% |
| 1960 | 62% |
| 1970 | 61% |
| 1980 | 50% |
| 1990+ | Estimated below 50% |

**International Comparison**

The U.S. now ranks poorly on mobility:

| Country | Intergenerational Earnings Elasticity (higher = less mobile) |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Denmark | 0.15 |
| Canada | 0.19 |
| Germany | 0.32 |
| France | 0.41 |
| United Kingdom | 0.50 |
| **United States** | **0.47** |

**Geographic Mobility**

Opportunity varies dramatically by location:

- Children in some cities have 4x better chance of mobility
- Southeast and industrial Midwest have lowest mobility
- Salt Lake City, San Francisco Bay Area have highest
- Moving to high-opportunity areas improves outcomes
