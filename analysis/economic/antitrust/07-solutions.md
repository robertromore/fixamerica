# Antitrust: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles for Reform

1. **Restore original purpose**: Competition policy should address economic power, not just consumer prices
2. **Update for digital economy**: Rules must address platforms, data, and network effects
3. **Strengthen enforcement**: More resources, clearer authority, structural remedies
4. **Address labor markets**: Recognize worker harm from employer concentration
5. **Prevent concentration**: Easier to prevent monopolies than break them up

### Categories of Reform

| Category | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Legal standards | Abandon consumer welfare standard; adopt competition standard |
| Agency authority | Expand FTC power; increase resources |
| Merger review | Tougher standards; structural presumptions |
| Structural remedies | Break up existing monopolies |
| Sector-specific rules | Platform regulation; healthcare; agriculture |
| Labor markets | Address monopsony; ban anti-competitive practices |

## Legal Standard Reform

### Beyond Consumer Welfare

**The Problem**

The consumer welfare standard:

- Ignores worker harm
- Ignores innovation effects
- Ignores quality, choice, privacy
- Ignores political economy
- Allows "free" services to escape scrutiny

**The Solution: Competition Standard**

Replace consumer welfare with competition-focused analysis:

| Consumer Welfare | Competition Standard |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Focus on prices | Focus on competitive process |
| Short-term effects | Long-term market structure |
| Economic efficiency only | Multiple values |
| Defendants claim efficiency | Competition presumptively good |

**Implementation**

- Legislation clarifying purpose of antitrust laws
- Agency guidelines adopting competition standard
- Judicial appointments changing interpretation
- Academic research supporting shift

### Structural Presumptions

**Merger Presumptions**

Shift burden of proof:

| Current Approach | Reform Approach |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Government must prove harm | Merging parties must prove benefit |
| Efficiency claims accepted | Efficiency claims scrutinized |
| Remedies negotiated | Structural remedies preferred |

**Market Share Thresholds**

| Market Share | Presumption |
|--------------|-------------|
| 30%+ | Presumptively anticompetitive merger |
| 50%+ | Monopoly power presumed |
| 70%+ | Structural remedy considered |

### Predatory Conduct Standards

**Reform Proposals**

| Practice | Current Standard | Reformed Standard |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Predatory pricing | Must prove recoupment | Below-cost pricing sufficient |
| Exclusive dealing | Rule of reason | Presumptively harmful above thresholds |
| Tying | Must prove separate products | Platform bundling scrutinized |
| Self-preferencing | Not addressed | Prohibited for dominant platforms |

## Enforcement Enhancement

### Agency Resources

**Current Resources**

| Agency | Budget | Staff |
|--------|--------|-------|
| FTC | ~$400M | ~1,100 |
| DOJ Antitrust | ~$200M | ~700 attorneys |
| Combined | ~$600M | ~1,800 |

**Reform Proposal**

| Agency | Proposed Budget | Proposed Staff |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| FTC | $1 billion+ | 3,000+ |
| DOJ Antitrust | $500 million+ | 1,500+ |
| Combined | $1.5 billion+ | 4,500+ |

**Funding Mechanisms**

- Merger filing fee increases
- Monopoly disgorgement funds
- Direct appropriations
- Self-funding from penalties

### FTC Authority

**Strengthen Rulemaking**

| Current | Reform |
|---------|--------|
| Rulemaking authority contested | Clear statutory authority |
| Adjudication process slow | Expedited procedures |
| Limited civil penalties | Significant fines available |
| Remedies limited | Disgorgement, structural remedies |

**Structural Changes**

- Independent litigation authority
- Longer commissioner terms
- More staff independence
- Enhanced economic analysis

### DOJ Antitrust Division

**Reforms**

| Area | Reform |
|------|--------|
| Criminal enforcement | Increase individual prosecutions |
| Merger review | More challenges, fewer settlements |
| Civil monopolization | More breakup cases |
| State coordination | Enhance joint enforcement |

### State Enforcement

**Empower State AGs**

- Concurrent jurisdiction with federal agencies
- Resource sharing with states
- State AG merger review authority
- Coordination mechanisms

## Merger Reform

### Tougher Review Standards

**Proposed Merger Guidelines**

| Factor | Current Approach | Reformed Approach |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Market definition | Narrow, favors defendants | Broader, functional markets |
| Competitive effects | Must prove substantial harm | Presumption against concentration |
| Entry analysis | Assume entry will occur | Skeptical of entry claims |
| Efficiencies | Accept merger party claims | Require proof, discount claims |

### Structural Presumptions

**Concentration Thresholds**

| HHI Change | Current Treatment | Proposed Treatment |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| <100 points | Approved | Review required |
| 100-200 points | Minimal scrutiny | Rebuttable presumption |
| >200 points | Enhanced scrutiny | Presumptively blocked |

**Market Share Presumptions**

| Combined Share | Presumption |
|----------------|-------------|
| >30% | Presumptively anticompetitive |
| >50% | Strong presumption against |
| >70% | Virtually per se illegal |

### Prior Approval Requirements

**Reform Proposals**

- Dominant firms require pre-approval for any acquisition
- Serial acquisitions trigger enhanced review
- Private equity roll-ups aggregate review
- Notification thresholds lowered

### Retrospective Review

**Post-Merger Analysis**

- Regular review of approved mergers
- Unwind mergers that harmed competition
- Learn from enforcement mistakes
- Build case database

## Structural Remedies

### Breaking Up Monopolies

**Candidates for Breakup**

| Company | Potential Structure |
|---------|---------------------|
| Google | Separate Search, YouTube, Cloud, Android |
| Meta | Separate Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp |
| Amazon | Separate AWS, Retail, Logistics |
| Apple | Separate iOS from App Store; interoperability |

**Implementation Approach**

1. Identify separable business lines
2. Determine standalone viability
3. Address technical dependencies
4. Ensure competition post-breakup
5. Ongoing monitoring

### Line of Business Restrictions

**Structural Separation**

Prohibit dominant firms from competing in markets where they have platform power:

| Platform | Restriction |
|----------|-------------|
