# Antitrust: Stakeholders

## Who Benefits from Concentration

### Dominant Corporations

**Technology Giants**

| Company | Market Position | Annual Revenue | Profits from Dominance |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Apple | iOS monopoly, App Store control | $380+ billion | 30% App Store tax |
| Google | Search, advertising monopoly | $280+ billion | Ad pricing power |
| Meta | Social network dominance | $120+ billion | Attention monopoly |
| Amazon | E-commerce, cloud leadership | $570+ billion | Platform control |
| Microsoft | Office, cloud, gaming | $230+ billion | Enterprise lock-in |

**Their Stakes**

- Market power enables premium pricing
- Platform control over competitors
- Acquire potential threats
- Data advantages compound over time
- Regulatory capture protects position

### Private Equity

**The Roll-Up Model**

Private equity firms profit from consolidation:

| Strategy | Description | Industries |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Roll-ups | Buy competitors, combine, extract value | Healthcare, veterinary, HVAC |
| Platform plays | Anchor acquisition plus bolt-ons | Restaurants, dental |
| Operational leverage | Cut costs through scale | Retail, media |

**Major Players**

| Firm | Assets Under Management | Consolidation Focus |
|------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Blackstone | $1+ trillion | Real estate, healthcare |
| KKR | $500+ billion | Industrial, healthcare |
| Apollo | $600+ billion | Financial services |
| Carlyle | $400+ billion | Defense, healthcare |

**Their Stakes**

- Roll-ups increase pricing power
- Debt financing magnifies returns
- Exit through sale to larger firms or IPO
- Antitrust enforcement threatens model

### Investment Banks

**Merger Advisory Fees**

| Year | M&A Value | Advisory Fees |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 2020 | $3.6 trillion | $35+ billion |
| 2021 | $5.9 trillion | $50+ billion |
| 2022 | $3.6 trillion | $35+ billion |

**Major Players**

- Goldman Sachs
- Morgan Stanley
- JPMorgan Chase
- Bank of America
- Lazard

**Their Stakes**

- Fees proportional to deal size
- More mergers = more revenue
- Antitrust blocks reduce dealflow

### Corporate Executives

**Compensation Incentives**

- CEO pay tied to stock price
- Mergers often boost short-term stock
- Empire building increases compensation
- Scale protects job security

**The Agency Problem**

Executives may pursue mergers that benefit them personally:

- Larger company = higher pay
- Acquisitions are exciting; internal growth boring
- Success measured by deal volume
- Failure blamed on "integration challenges"

### Corporate Law Firms

**Antitrust Bar**

| Activity | Fee Structure |
|----------|---------------|
| Merger clearance | $10-50+ million per deal |
| Antitrust defense | $1,000+ per hour |
| Regulatory advice | Retainer + hourly |

**Their Stakes**

- Concentrated industries generate more legal work
- Defending monopolies lucrative
- Revolving door with agencies

### Shareholders of Dominant Firms

**Monopoly Rents**

- Above-normal profits distributed to shareholders
- Stock prices reflect market power
- Institutional investors hold across industries
- Common ownership may reduce competition

## Who Is Harmed by Concentration

### Consumers

**Higher Prices**

| Industry | Estimated Price Impact |
|----------|----------------------|
| Airlines (concentrated routes) | +30% |
| Hospitals (post-merger) | +20-40% |
| Pharmaceuticals | +1000%+ for some generics |
| Cable/internet | Among highest in world |

**Reduced Choice**

- Fewer options in concentrated markets
- Quality degradation without alternatives
- Innovation stifled as incumbents acquire
- Services bundled without consent

**Privacy Erosion**

- No alternatives to data-extracting platforms
- Take-it-or-leave-it terms of service
- Surveillance as business model
- Competition would create privacy options

### Workers

**Wage Suppression**

| Factor | Estimated Impact |
|--------|-----------------|
| Employer concentration | -15-25% wages |
| Non-compete enforcement | -4-10% wages |
| No-poach agreements | -3-5% wages |

**Reduced Mobility**

- Fewer employers to move between
- Non-competes trap workers
- Retaliation for job searching
- Rural areas especially affected

**Working Conditions**

- Less bargaining power
- Fewer union options
- Gig work precarity
- Algorithmic management

**Specific Examples**

| Industry | Worker Impact |
|----------|---------------|
| Meatpacking | Dangerous conditions, low pay |
| Hospitals | Nurse wages suppressed |
| Tech | NDAs, non-competes |
| Retail | Scheduling algorithms |

### Small Businesses

**Competing with Giants**

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Platform fees | 15-30% to sell on Amazon |
| Advertising costs | Google/Meta duopoly sets prices |
| Supplier power | Concentrated suppliers set terms |
| Access to capital | Banks favor large customers |

**Specific Impacts**

- Independent retailers destroyed by Walmart, Amazon
- Local pharmacies eliminated by chains
- Independent grocers disappeared
- Professional practices rolled up

**Platform Dependence**

- Businesses need Google to be found
- Need Amazon to reach customers
- Need Meta for advertising
- Platforms can copy and compete

### Entrepreneurs and Startups

**Barriers to Entry**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Network effects | Can't compete with established platforms |
| Data advantages | Incumbents have better information |
| Talent competition | Big Tech attracts best employees |
| Regulatory capture | Compliance favors incumbents |

**Exit Options Limited**

- IPO market concentrated
- Acquisition by Big Tech common
- Independence rarely sustainable
- Innovation acquired, not competing

**Statistics**

- Startup formation down 50% since 1980
- New business share of employment declining
- Venture capital increasingly concentrated
- Exit primarily through acquisition

### Farmers and Agricultural Producers

**Input Market Concentration**

| Input | Top Firms Share |
|-------|-----------------|
| Seeds | 60% (4 firms) |
| Tractors | 70% (3 firms) |
| Fertilizer | 75% (4 firms) |
| Pesticides | 70% (4 firms) |

**Output Market Concentration**

| Product | Buyer Concentration |
|---------|---------------------|
| Beef | 85% (4 packers) |
| Pork | 70% (4 packers) |
| Poultry | 54% (4 firms) |
| Grain | Highly concentrated |

**Squeezed from Both Sides**

- Pay more for inputs
- Receive less for outputs
- Contract farming creates dependency
- Land prices inflated by corporate buyers

### Communities

**Geographic Concentration**

- Corporate headquarters in few metros
- Tax base concentrated

**Healthcare Deserts**

- Pharmacy concentration reduces access
- Healthcare oligopolies raise prices

**Retail Deserts**

- Independent stores close
- Dollar stores and chains remain
- Quality and selection decline

### Taxpayers

**Bailouts and Subsidies**

- "Too big to fail" creates moral hazard
- Corporate welfare for dominant firms
- Tax avoidance by multinationals
- Enforcement costs externalized

**Lost Tax Revenue**
