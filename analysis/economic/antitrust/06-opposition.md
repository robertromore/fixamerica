**Economic Consulting**

- Litigation support is lucrative
- Same experts appear repeatedly
- Industry funds academic research

### Some Republicans

**Free Market Wing**

- Opposes government intervention generally
- Skeptical of regulatory expansion
- Views antitrust as industrial policy
- Supports property rights over competition

**But Bipartisan Concern About Big Tech**

- Some Republicans support Big Tech action
- Content moderation concerns motivate
- Different framing than progressives
- Coalition unstable but exists

### Some Democrats

**Corporate Democrats**

- Receive Big Tech contributions
- Represent tech-heavy districts
- Worry about innovation narrative
- Prefer privacy/content rules to antitrust

**California Delegation**

- Tech companies major employers
- Campaign contributors
- Economic interests of constituents
- Some support reform, others cautious

## Arguments Against Reform

### Economic Arguments

#### Markets Are Competitive

**The Claim**

Markets remain competitive; concentration statistics misleading:

- National concentration doesn't capture local competition
- New entry continues in most industries
- International competition constrains dominance
- Digital markets especially contestable

**Problems with This Argument**

- Local market concentration often higher than national
- Entry has declined, not increased
- International competition limited in many sectors
- Platform markets show extreme winner-take-all dynamics

#### Efficiency Benefits

**The Claim**

Concentration reflects efficiency, not market power:

- Large firms have lower costs
- Consumers benefit from scale economies
- Mergers create synergies
- Vertical integration reduces transaction costs

**Problems with This Argument**

- Efficiency gains often not passed to consumers
- Many mergers destroy value
- Diseconomies of scale exist
- Claimed efficiencies rarely verified post-merger

#### Consumer Welfare Standard Works

**The Claim**

Current approach protects consumers appropriately:

- Prices are key metric, easy to measure
- Courts can apply standard consistently
- Administrable standard limits discretion
- Decades of precedent provide guidance

**Problems with This Argument**

- Consumer welfare unmeasurable in practice
- Ignores worker, small business, innovation effects
- Courts inconsistently apply
- "Free" services escape scrutiny

#### Antitrust Would Harm Innovation

**The Claim**

Breaking up dominant firms or blocking mergers would:

- Reduce R&D investment
- Eliminate economies of scope
- Disrupt successful business models
- Harm American global competitiveness

**Problems with This Argument**

- Innovation often comes from startups, not giants
- Dominant firms acquire rather than compete
- Historical breakups (AT&T, Standard Oil) led to innovation
- Monopoly profits fund acquisitions, not R&D

### Legal Arguments

#### Constitutional Concerns

**The Claim**

Reform proposals raise constitutional issues:

- Due process requires clear standards
- Retroactive breakups may constitute takings
- Agency authority limited by separation of powers
- First Amendment protects commercial speech

**Problems with This Argument**

- Sherman Act has 130+ years of precedent
- Structural remedies constitutional
- FTC authority well-established
- Antitrust not speech regulation

#### Courts Won't Allow

**The Claim**

Federal courts will strike down aggressive enforcement:

- Supreme Court hostile to antitrust
- Circuit courts follow Chicago School
- Agency losses will continue
- Reform requires legislative change

**This Argument Has Merit**

- Courts are significant constraint
- But judges can be persuaded over time
- Legislative change possible
- Agency persistence can shift doctrine

#### Vague Standards

**The Claim**

Reform proposals create unenforceable vagueness:

- "Competition" without "consumer welfare" is undefined
- Political factors would enter analysis
- Business can't plan with uncertainty
- Rule of law requires clear rules

**Problems with This Argument**

- Consumer welfare equally vague
- Pre-Chicago antitrust was administrable
- Other countries apply different standards
- Business always operates with uncertainty

### Political Arguments

#### China Competition

**The Claim**

Breaking up American companies helps China:

- US tech dominance strategic
- Chinese firms benefit from American antitrust
- National security requires national champions
- Industrial policy, not antitrust

**Problems with This Argument**

- Competition makes American firms stronger
- Chinese firms benefit from copying, not antitrust
- Monopoly complacency is strategic weakness
- National security addressed through other means

#### Populist Overreach

**The Claim**

Current antitrust movement is:

- Driven by political animus, not economics
- Punishing success
- Progressive industrial policy
- Backwards-looking Luddism

**Problems with This Argument**

- Bipartisan concern about Big Tech
- Economic harms well-documented
- Historical antitrust was bipartisan
- Diverse motivations ≠ illegitimate

#### Regulatory Capture Risk

**The Claim**

Empowering agencies risks capture:

- Agencies will be captured by industry
- Political appointments undermine consistency
- Enforcement will be arbitrary
- Better to rely on markets than bureaucrats

**Problems with This Argument**

- Current under-enforcement is also capture
- Structural rules reduce discretion
- Other countries manage enforcement
- Markets aren't alternatives to rules

### Practical Arguments

#### Remedies Don't Work

**The Claim**

Breaking up companies is impractical:

- Network effects will reconcentrate market
- Technology can't be divided
- Consumers would lose integrated services
- Behavioral remedies sufficient

**Problems with This Argument**

- Historical breakups worked (AT&T, Standard Oil)
- Technology can be separated (witness spinoffs)
- Integration can be preserved with interoperability
- Behavioral remedies have poor track record

#### Enforcement Resources

**The Claim**

Agencies lack resources for ambitious enforcement:

- Corporations will outspend government
- Litigation takes years
- Appeals further delay
- Settlement is inevitable

**This Argument Has Merit**

- Resource asymmetry is real
- But resources can be increased
- Cases can be chosen strategically
- Success breeds success

#### Unintended Consequences

**The Claim**

Reform could backfire:

- Break up tech, empower media monopolies
- Attack platforms, hurt small sellers on them
- Aggressive enforcement deters investment
- Cure worse than disease

**Problems with This Argument**

- All policy has unintended consequences
- Current concentration has consequences too
- Careful implementation can minimize harms
- Not acting is also a choice

## Lobbying and Influence

### Industry Lobbying

**Big Tech Lobbying Infrastructure**

| Company | Lobbyists | Think Tank Funding |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Google | 100+ registered | Significant |
| Amazon | 100+ registered | Significant |
| Meta | 50+ registered | Significant |

| Microsoft | 50+ registered | Moderate |

**Lobbying Strategies**

### Revolving Door

**Agency to Industry**

| Pattern | Effect |
|---------|--------|

| DOJ lawyers → law firms | Knowledge of enforcement |
| Economists → consulting | Defense-friendly analysis |

**Industry to Agency**

| Pattern | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Corporate lawyers → agencies | Industry perspective |
| Lobbyists → government | Relationships maintained |

### Academic Funding

**Corporate Support for Research**

- Google funds academic research
- Tech companies fund law schools
- Industry-sponsored conferences
- Undisclosed conflicts common

**The Disclosure Problem**

- Research funding often not disclosed
- Expert witnesses paid by defendants
- Same scholars appear repeatedly
- Independence questions
