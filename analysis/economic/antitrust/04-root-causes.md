# Antitrust: Root Causes

## Why Concentration Increased

### Intellectual and Legal Causes

#### The Chicago School Revolution

**How Ideas Changed Law**

The most important cause of concentration was an intellectual revolution that transformed how courts and agencies think about competition:

| Before Chicago School | After Chicago School |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Concentration is dangerous | Concentration often efficient |
| Big is suspect | Big is often better |
| Protect small business | Only consumer welfare matters |
| Structure determines behavior | Focus on prices and output |
| Prevent problems | Wait for clear consumer harm |

**Why Chicago School Won**

1. **Simplicity**: Consumer welfare standard easier to apply than balancing multiple goals
2. **Scientific veneer**: Economic models seemed more rigorous than case-by-case analysis
3. **Funding**: Corporate interests funded Chicago School research and advocacy
4. **Judicial appointments**: Conservative judges trained in Chicago approach
5. **Timing**: Fit 1980s deregulatory zeitgeist

**The Bork Myth**

Robert Bork claimed antitrust's original purpose was consumer welfare. Historical scholarship shows this is wrong:

- Sherman Act debated around political economy, not efficiency
- Congress explicitly concerned about small business survival
- "Competition" meant rivalry, not efficiency
- Consumer welfare term invented in 1960s

But Bork's rewrite became conventional wisdom.

#### The Consumer Welfare Standard

**Problems with the Standard**

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Unmeasurable | Consumer welfare impossible to measure precisely |
| Short-term focus | Ignores long-term competitive effects |
| Price myopia | Ignores quality, innovation, choice, privacy |
| Producer interests | Corporations claim efficiency gains |
| Asymmetric information | Defendants know more than enforcers |

**How It Enables Concentration**

- Merging parties claim efficiency gains
- Courts defer to business judgment
- Predatory behavior tolerated if prices not raised immediately
- Vertical integration presumed efficient
- Platform monopolies escape because services are "free"

### Political Economy

#### Corporate Political Power

**The Cycle**

1. Corporate concentration increases profits
2. Profits fund lobbying and political donations
3. Political influence weakens antitrust
4. Weaker antitrust enables more concentration
5. Repeat

**Lobbying Expenditures**

| Industry | Annual Lobbying (recent) |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Pharmaceuticals | $350+ million |
| Technology | $100+ million |
| Finance | $550+ million |
| Healthcare | $700+ million |

**Campaign Contributions**

- Big Tech employees among top political donors
- Corporate PACs fund both parties
- Concentrated industries have concentrated political spending

#### Regulatory Capture

**The Revolving Door**

| Flow | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Agency to firm | Knowledge of enforcement priorities |
| Firm to agency | Sympathy for industry positions |
| Law firm to agency | Same |
| Academic to agency | Ideology shapes policy |

**Capture Mechanisms**

- Agencies staffed by those who will return to private sector
- Industry provides "expertise" and data
- Concentrated industries organized; consumers diffuse
- Budgets controlled by Congress subject to lobbying

#### Judicial Philosophy

**Federal Judiciary**

- Dominated by judges with Chicago School training
- Federalist Society influence on appointments
- Business-friendly interpretation of statutes
- Skepticism of government intervention

**Supreme Court**

- Consistently narrowed antitrust since 1970s
- *Ohio v. American Express* (2018) made platform cases harder
- *Comcast v. Behrend* (2013) restricted class actions
- *Credit Suisse* (2007) limited antitrust in regulated industries

### Economic and Business Factors

#### Network Effects and Winner-Take-All

**Digital Markets**

Platform businesses exhibit extreme returns to scale:

| Effect | Description | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Network effects | Value increases with users | Winner takes all |
| Data advantages | More users = better data = better product | Entrenches leaders |
| Switching costs | Users invested in ecosystem | Lock-in |
| Multi-homing costs | Hard to use multiple platforms | Single winner |

**Traditional Economics Didn't Anticipate**

- Zero marginal cost products
- Attention as the product
- Data as competitive advantage
- Platform as regulator of ecosystem

#### Financialization

**Shareholder Value Maximization**

Since 1980s, corporate governance focused on:

- Stock price above all
- Short-term earnings
- Financial engineering over operations
- Mergers as strategy

**Debt-Financed Acquisitions**

- Low interest rates enabled leveraged buyouts
- Tax code favors debt over equity
- Private equity model based on consolidation
- Financial markets reward size

#### Globalization

**Global Competition Argument**

- Firms argued they needed domestic scale to compete globally
- Regulators accepted "national champion" logic
- But domestic concentration often not necessary for global competition

**International Regulatory Arbitrage**

- Firms can choose favorable jurisdictions
- Race to bottom in some standards
- But EU shows alternative approach possible

### Enforcement Failures

#### Resource Constraints

**Agency Budgets**

| Agency | Budget | Compared to... |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| FTC | ~$400M | Apple's legal budget |
| DOJ Antitrust | ~$200M | One Big Tech acquisition |
| Combined | ~$600M | Google's 2023 EU fines |

**Asymmetric Warfare**

- Companies can outspend agencies 100:1
- Litigation takes years, favoring deep pockets
- Agencies can't match corporate expert witnesses
- Best lawyers go to private sector

#### Structural Problems

**FTC**

- Partisan balance enables deadlock
- Commissioners serve past terms
- Limited remedial authority
- Can't impose fines for initial violations

**DOJ Antitrust**

- Subject to political pressure
- Resources stretched thin
- Must convince Article III judges
- Settlement culture avoids precedent

#### Ideological Capture

**Agency Culture**

- Decades of Chicago School training
- Staff socialized into consumer welfare framework
- Enforcement skepticism internalized
- Revolutionary change requires cultural shift

### Legal Framework Limitations

#### Outdated Statutes

**Sherman Act (1890)**

- Designed for industrial trusts
- Doesn't address digital platforms
- "Restraint of trade" interpretation narrowed
- Criminal provisions rarely used

**Clayton Act (1914)**

- Merger review reactive, not proactive
- Exemptions for labor, agriculture
- Standard ("substantially lessen competition") vague
- Remedies limited

**FTC Act (1914)**

- "Unfair methods" interpreted narrowly
- Rulemaking authority contested
- Enforcement through adjudication slow
- State AG preemption issues

#### Evidentiary Burdens

| What Plaintiffs Must Prove | Challenge |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Market definition | Courts reject novel definitions |
| Market power | High share thresholds |
| Anticompetitive effect | Requires economic proof |
| No efficiency justification | Defendants always claim efficiency |
| Consumer harm | Hard to quantify |

#### Remedies Problem

| Remedy | Use | Effectiveness |
|--------|-----|---------------|
| Breakup | Extremely rare | Effective but hard to obtain |
| Behavioral | Common | Often ineffective, requires monitoring |
| Fines | Common | Cost of doing business |
| Consent decrees | Very common | Rarely enforce, expire |

### Market Structure Factors

#### Economies of Scale

**Real Efficiency Gains**

Some concentration reflects genuine efficiency:

- Manufacturing scale economies
- R&D requiring massive investment
- Infrastructure networks
- Brand building

**But Often Overstated**

- Efficient scale often below monopoly scale
- Diseconomies of scale exist
- Bureaucracy and coordination costs
- Innovation often from smaller firms

#### Barriers to Entry

**Sources of Barriers**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Capital requirements | Excludes new entrants |
| Network effects | Late entrants can't compete |
| Regulatory capture | Incumbents write rules |
| Patents | Legal monopolies |
| Switching costs | Customers locked in |
| Data advantages | Incumbents have better information |

#### Killer Acquisitions

**The Strategy**

Dominant firms acquire potential competitors before they become threats:

| Company | Notable Acquisitions |
|---------|---------------------|
| Google | YouTube, DoubleClick, Waze, 200+ others |
| Meta | Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus |
| Amazon | Whole Foods, MGM, Zappos |
| Microsoft | LinkedIn, GitHub, Activision |
| Apple | Beats, Intel modem business |

**Enforcement Gap**

- Many acquisitions below reporting thresholds
- Nascent competition hard to prove
- "Potential competitor" doctrine weakened
- Acquisitions completed before review

### Why Change Is Hard

| Factor | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| Legal precedent | Courts bound by Chicago School cases |
| Institutional culture | Agencies socialized into status quo |
| Resource asymmetry | Corporations outspend reformers |
| Political economy | Beneficiaries powerful, losers diffuse |
| Intellectual framework | New theories still developing |
| Judicial appointments | Lifetime tenure locks in ideology |
