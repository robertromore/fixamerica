# Antitrust: Overview

## Executive Summary

Market concentration in America has reached levels not seen since the Gilded Age. Four companies control over 85% of the meat processing industry. Two companies dominate 70% of the beer market. One company controls 90% of online search. This concentration raises prices for consumers, depresses wages for workers, stifles innovation, and consolidates political power in the hands of corporate giants.

For over a century, antitrust law has been America's primary tool for maintaining competitive markets and dispersing economic power. The Sherman Act (1890), Clayton Act (1914), and FTC Act (1914) established the legal framework to break up monopolies, prevent anticompetitive mergers, and prohibit unfair business practices.

But beginning in the 1970s, a revolution in antitrust thinking—the Chicago School—narrowed enforcement to focus almost exclusively on short-term consumer prices. Under this "consumer welfare standard," regulators approved thousands of mergers, ignored vertical integration, and allowed dominant firms to crush competitors. The result is today's concentrated economy.

## Scope

This subtopic examines:

- **The antitrust legal framework** and its evolution over 130 years
- **Corporate concentration** across industries—tech, healthcare, agriculture, retail, finance
- **Big Tech monopolies** and their unique challenges to competition
- **Mergers and acquisitions** wave since the 1980s
- **Monopsony power**—when employers dominate labor markets
- **Private equity roll-ups** that consolidate fragmented industries
- **Enforcement agencies**—FTC and DOJ Antitrust Division
- **Reform proposals** from across the political spectrum
- **International comparisons**—particularly EU enforcement

## The Problem

### Market Concentration

**Across Major Industries**

| Industry | Top Firms' Market Share | Change Since 1980 |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Online search | 90%+ (Google) | N/A (industry created) |
| Smartphone OS | 99% (Apple + Google) | N/A (industry created) |
| Social media | 80%+ (Meta) | N/A (industry created) |
| Airlines (domestic) | 80% (4 carriers) | Up from 50% |
| Health insurance | 50% (4 insurers) | Up from 25% |
| Banking | 60% of deposits (4 banks) | Up from 20% |
| Beer | 70% (2 brewers) | Up from 28% |
| Beef packing | 85% (4 firms) | Up from 36% |
| Wireless carriers | 98% (3 carriers) | Consolidated from many |

### Consumer Harm

- Higher prices in concentrated industries
- Reduced choice and quality
- Less innovation as dominant firms acquire competitors
- Privacy erosion when no alternatives exist

### Worker Harm

- Wage suppression in concentrated labor markets
- Fewer job options and reduced mobility
- Non-compete agreements limiting movement
- Franchise no-poach agreements

### Democratic Harm

- Corporate concentration creates political power
- Dominant firms can shape regulations
- Media concentration reduces diverse viewpoints
- Economic power translates to political influence

## Why This Matters

### Historical Context

The original antitrust laws were passed amid concern about both economic power and political power. Senator John Sherman argued his act was needed because "if we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessities of life."

This understanding—that concentrated economic power threatens democracy—guided antitrust enforcement for decades. The government broke up Standard Oil, AT&T, and Hollywood studios. It blocked mergers that would create dominant firms. It maintained competitive markets across the economy.

### The Chicago School Turn

Beginning in the 1970s, conservative scholars at the University of Chicago argued that antitrust should focus solely on "consumer welfare"—essentially, consumer prices. If a merger lowered prices, it should be approved. If a dominant firm had lower prices than competitors would, it was efficient, not monopolistic.

This framework systematically favored concentration:

- Mergers approved if any efficiency claimed
- Vertical integration presumed beneficial
- Dominant firms protected if prices weren't raised immediately
- Predatory pricing nearly impossible to prove

The result: a wave of mergers and acquisitions that transformed the American economy.

### Today's Challenge

Modern monopolies—particularly in technology—present challenges the original antitrust laws didn't anticipate:

- **Zero-price services** that harm through data extraction, not high prices
- **Network effects** that create winner-take-all markets
- **Platform power** where firms control the marketplace competitors must use
- **Surveillance capitalism** that profits from data collection
- **Vertical integration** across supply chains and information flows

## Key Stakeholders

### Benefiting from Concentration

- Dominant corporations and their shareholders
- Private equity firms executing roll-up strategies
- Investment banks earning merger fees
- Corporate executives with monopoly rents
- Law firms defending concentrated industries

### Harmed by Concentration

- Consumers paying higher prices
- Workers facing monopsony employers
- Small businesses competing with giants
- Entrepreneurs blocked from markets
- Communities losing local businesses

### Enforcement Community

- FTC and DOJ Antitrust Division
- State attorneys general
- Academic economists and legal scholars
- International competition authorities

## The Path Forward

Reforming antitrust requires action on multiple fronts:

1. **New legal standards** that look beyond consumer prices
2. **Stronger enforcement** of existing laws
3. **Structural remedies** including breaking up dominant firms
4. **Merger reform** with tougher review standards
5. **Labor market focus** addressing monopsony power
6. **Tech-specific rules** for platform competition

Growing bipartisan concern about Big Tech has created an opening for reform. But comprehensive change requires understanding both the history of antitrust and the modern challenges facing competition policy.
