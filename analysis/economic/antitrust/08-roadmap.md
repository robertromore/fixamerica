## Sequencing Strategy

### Why This Order

1. **Executive first**: Can act immediately without Congress
2. **Litigation early**: Cases take years; start now
3. **Build coalitions**: Demonstrate success before asking for legislation
4. **Incremental victories**: Each win makes next easier
5. **Structural last**: Requires legal victories and political support
