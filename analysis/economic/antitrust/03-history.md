# Antitrust: History

## Origins

### The Trust Problem (1870s-1890s)

The post-Civil War era saw unprecedented industrial consolidation. New corporate forms—particularly the "trust"—allowed competitors to combine into monopolies that controlled entire industries.

**The Rise of Trusts**

| Trust | Control | Methods |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Standard Oil | 90% of US refining | Predatory pricing, railroad rebates |
| American Sugar | 98% of sugar refining | Horizontal combination |
| US Steel | 65% of steel production | Vertical integration |
| American Tobacco | 90% of cigarettes | Acquisitions |

**Economic Effects**

- Prices manipulated by monopolies
- Small competitors driven out
- Workers exploited without alternatives
- Farmers squeezed by railroad monopolies

**Political Response**

The populist and progressive movements made antitrust central to their agenda:

> "If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessities of life." — Senator John Sherman (1890)

### The Sherman Act (1890)

**The Law**

Section 1: "Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."

Section 2: "Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony."

**Initial Weakness**

- Courts interpreted narrowly
- Used against labor unions more than corporations
- Few successful prosecutions
- Business combinations continued

### The Progressive Era (1901-1914)

**Theodore Roosevelt: Trust-Buster**

Roosevelt launched aggressive antitrust enforcement:

| Case | Year | Result |
|------|------|--------|
| Northern Securities | 1904 | Railroad monopoly broken up |
| Standard Oil | 1911 | Split into 34 companies |
| American Tobacco | 1911 | Broken up |
| US Steel | 1920 | Survived (after TR's presidency) |

**The Clayton Act (1914)**

Strengthened Sherman Act by prohibiting specific practices:

- Price discrimination
- Exclusive dealing agreements
- Mergers that substantially lessen competition
- Interlocking directorates

**The FTC Act (1914)**

- Created Federal Trade Commission
- Prohibited "unfair methods of competition"
- Administrative enforcement alongside courts
- Expertise-based approach

## Evolution of Doctrine

### The Rule of Reason (1911-1937)

**Standard Oil v. United States (1911)**

The Supreme Court established the "rule of reason":

- Not all restraints of trade illegal
- Courts must weigh competitive effects
- Only "unreasonable" restraints prohibited

**Per Se Rules Emerge**

Some practices deemed automatically illegal:

- Price fixing
- Market allocation
- Bid rigging
- Certain boycotts

### The Structuralist Era (1937-1970s)

**Heightened Enforcement**

The Supreme Court and enforcement agencies took aggressive stances:

| Case | Year | Holding |
|------|------|---------|
| ALCOA | 1945 | Monopoly from achieving 90% share unlawful |
| American Tobacco | 1946 | Consciously parallel pricing can violate antitrust |
| Brown Shoe | 1962 | Blocked merger creating 5% market share |
| Von's Grocery | 1966 | Blocked merger creating 7.5% share |

**Principles**

- Market structure determines competitive behavior
- Concentrated markets lead to anticompetitive outcomes
- Preventing concentration better than remedying monopoly
- Small business protection valued alongside efficiency

### The Chicago School Revolution (1970s-Present)

**The Intellectual Movement**

Economists at the University of Chicago argued:

- Markets are generally self-correcting
- Monopoly power is transitory
- Most business practices are efficient
- Only consumer welfare (prices) matters

**Key Figures**

| Scholar | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| Aaron Director | Founded Chicago antitrust program |
| Robert Bork | *The Antitrust Paradox* (1978) |
| Richard Posner | Economic Analysis of Law |
| George Stigler | Industrial organization economics |

**Robert Bork's Framework**

Bork argued antitrust should focus solely on "consumer welfare":

- Only horizontal price-fixing clearly harmful
- Vertical restraints generally efficient
- Mergers should be approved if any efficiency claimed
- Monopoly is often the result of superior efficiency

### The Consumer Welfare Standard

**Implementation**

Courts and agencies adopted Chicago School approach:

| Before Chicago School | After Chicago School |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Mergers creating 5% share blocked | Mergers creating 30%+ approved |
| Vertical integration suspect | Vertical integration presumed efficient |
| Predatory pricing actionable | Predatory pricing nearly impossible to prove |
| Market structure matters | Only prices matter |

**Merger Enforcement Collapse**

| Decade | Merger Challenges |
|--------|-------------------|
| 1960s | Aggressive blocking |
| 1970s | Beginning decline |
| 1980s | Minimal enforcement |
| 1990s-2010s | Rare blocking |

## Key Cases

### Foundational Cases

**Standard Oil v. United States (1911)**

- Broke up Standard Oil into 34 companies
- Established rule of reason
- Created precedent for structural remedies

**United States v. ALCOA (1945)**

- Judge Learned Hand's opinion
- Monopoly power itself can be unlawful
- Even if achieved through "superior skill, foresight, and industry"
- High point of structural antitrust

**Brown Shoe v. United States (1962)**

- Blocked merger creating 5% market share
- Emphasized protecting competitors as well as competition
- Congress intended to arrest concentration "in its incipiency"

### The Chicago School Turn

**Continental TV v. GTE Sylvania (1977)**

- Upheld territorial restrictions on dealers
- Adopted efficiency justifications
- Began overturning Warren Court precedents

**Matsushita v. Zenith (1986)**

- Made predatory pricing claims nearly impossible
- Required proof predator could recoup losses
- Assumed markets self-correct

**Eastman Kodak v. Image Technical Services (1992)**

- Brief departure from Chicago orthodoxy
- Recognized aftermarket power
- Largely ignored in subsequent cases

### Modern Cases

**United States v. Microsoft (2001)**

- Found Microsoft monopolized operating systems
- Tying browser to OS violated Sherman Act
- Settlement avoided breakup

**Ohio v. American Express (2018)**

- Supreme Court adopted two-sided market analysis
- Required plaintiffs prove harm on both sides of platform
- Made platform monopolies harder to challenge

## Lessons from History

### Lesson 1: Enforcement Matters

When agencies actively enforce, markets stay competitive. The structuralist era maintained competition; the Chicago School era allowed concentration.

### Lesson 2: Ideas Shape Policy

The Chicago School revolution shows how academic ideas can transform law and policy over decades.

### Lesson 3: Breakups Work

Standard Oil's breakup created competitors that thrived. AT&T's breakup enabled telecommunications innovation. Structural remedies have historically succeeded.

### Lesson 4: Capture is Real

Industries consistently seek to weaken enforcement. The revolving door between agencies and corporate law firms shapes policy.

### Lesson 5: Political Economy Matters

Antitrust has always been about more than economics. The original laws addressed political as well as economic power.

### Lesson 6: Technology Changes Competition

New technologies create new competitive dynamics. Law must adapt—as it did with trusts, should with platforms.

## Pendulum Swings

### Cycles of Enforcement

American antitrust has oscillated between:

**Active Enforcement**

- Progressive Era (1901-1920)
- New Deal/Post-War (1937-1970s)
- Biden Administration (2021-present)

**Passive Enforcement**

- Pre-Sherman Act
- 1920s
- Reagan through Obama (with exceptions)

### Current Moment

The 2020s represent a potential turning point:

- Biden administration most aggressive since 1970s
- Bipartisan concern about Big Tech
- New academic critiques of Chicago School
- But courts still apply consumer welfare standard
