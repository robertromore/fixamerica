Federal bills, state model legislation, regulatory frameworks, and detailed analysis of loopholes and shortcomings are included.

## Federal Legislation

### Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen antitrust enforcement by clarifying legal standards, increasing agency resources, and establishing structural presumptions against concentration.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Competition and Antitrust Law 
Enforcement Reform Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Market concentration has increased across the American economy
    over the past four decades.
(2) The "consumer welfare" standard as currently applied by courts
    has proven inadequate to maintain competitive markets.
(3) Concentrated markets harm workers through wage suppression,
    consumers through higher prices and reduced choice, and
    democracy through accumulation of political power.
(4) The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice
    Antitrust Division lack resources to adequately enforce
    antitrust laws.
(5) Merger review standards have permitted excessive consolidation.

SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS.

(a) PURPOSE.—The purposes of the antitrust laws include—
    (1) the protection of competition and the competitive process;
    (2) the preservation of open and fair markets;
    (3) the prevention of excessive market concentration;
    (4) the protection of the interests of workers and suppliers
        as well as consumers;
    (5) the dispersal of economic and political power; and
    (6) the promotion of innovation and entrepreneurship.

(b) COMPETITIVE EFFECTS.—In determining whether an agreement,
    merger, or conduct violates the antitrust laws, the trier of
    fact shall consider effects on—
    (1) market structure and concentration;
    (2) barriers to entry and expansion;
    (3) potential competition and innovation;
    (4) wages, working conditions, and labor market competition;
    (5) quality, choice, and privacy; and
    (6) the competitive process generally.

(c) EFFICIENCY DEFENSE.—Claims of efficiency gains from mergers
    or conduct shall—
    (1) be supported by clear and convincing evidence;
    (2) demonstrate that claimed efficiencies are merger-specific
        and could not be achieved through less anticompetitive means;
    (3) be passed through to consumers, workers, and other affected
        parties; and
    (4) not be sufficient alone to justify significant increases
        in market concentration.

SEC. 4. MERGER REVIEW REFORM.

(a) STRUCTURAL PRESUMPTIONS.—
    (1) A merger shall be presumed to substantially lessen
        competition or tend to create a monopoly if—
        (A) the combined firm would have a market share exceeding
            30 percent in any relevant market; or
        (B) the merger would result in an increase in the
            Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of more than 100 points
            in a market with an HHI of 1,800 or more.
    (2) The presumption may be rebutted only by clear and
        convincing evidence that the merger will not harm
        competition.

(b) DOMINANT FIRM ACQUISITIONS.—
    (1) A firm with a market share exceeding 50 percent in any
        relevant market shall be prohibited from acquiring any
        firm that—
        (A) operates in the same market;
        (B) operates in an adjacent market;
        (C) is a potential competitor; or
        (D) provides products or services that could enhance
            the dominant firm's market power.
    (2) Exceptions may be granted only upon demonstration by
        clear and convincing evidence that the acquisition will
        not harm competition.

(c) SERIAL ACQUISITIONS.—
    (1) In reviewing a merger, the reviewing agency shall consider
        the cumulative effect of prior acquisitions by the
        acquiring party over the preceding 10 years.
    (2) Firms that have made 3 or more acquisitions in a single
        market within 5 years shall be subject to enhanced scrutiny.

(d) NOTIFICATION THRESHOLD.—Section 7A of the Clayton Act (15
    U.S.C. 18a) is amended to reduce the transaction value

## Regulatory Framework

### FTC Unfair Methods of Competition Rule

**Authority**: Section 5 of the FTC Act.

**Draft Rule**:

```text
PART 460—UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION

§ 460.1 Scope.

This Part establishes rules identifying unfair methods of
competition under Section 5 of the FTC Act.

§ 460.2 Definitions.

(a) "Dominant firm" means a firm with—
    (1) a market share exceeding 40 percent in any relevant
        market; or
    (2) the power to profitably raise prices, reduce output,
        or exclude competitors.

(b) "Exclusionary conduct" means conduct that excludes or
    disadvantages competitors or potential competitors.

(c) "Exploitative conduct" means conduct that harms consumers,
    workers, or suppliers beyond the harms of market power.

§ 460.3 Unfair Methods of Competition.

The following practices constitute unfair methods of competition:

(a) EXCLUSIVE DEALING.—A dominant firm's conditioning the
    sale of products or services on the buyer's agreement not
    to deal with the firm's competitors.

(b) TYING.—A dominant firm's conditioning the sale of one
    product or service on the purchase of another product
    or service.

(c) SELF-PREFERENCING.—A platform's favoring its own products
    or services over those of competitors that rely on the
    platform.

(d) PREDATORY PRICING.—Pricing below cost where the firm has
    a reasonable prospect of recouping losses through market
    power.

(e) REFUSAL TO DEAL.—A dominant firm's refusal to deal with
    competitors on reasonable terms where such dealing has
    been the prior course.

(f) MOST-FAVORED-NATION CLAUSES.—Clauses requiring that a
    seller offer terms no worse than those offered to the
    seller's other customers, where such clauses facilitate
    price uniformity or exclude competitors.

(g) WAGE-FIXING.—Agreements among employers to fix, depress,
    or stabilize wages.

(h) NO-POACH AGREEMENTS.—Agreements among employers not to
    solicit or hire each other's employees.

(i) NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS.—Requirements that workers not
    compete with their employer after termination of employment.

(j) LOYALTY REBATES.—Rebates conditioned on purchasing all or
    a substantial share of requirements from a dominant firm.

(k) KILLER ACQUISITIONS.—Acquisitions of nascent competitors
    or potential competitors by dominant firms.

§ 460.4 Defenses.

(a) The practices identified in § 460.3 may be defended upon
    showing that—
    (1) the conduct is reasonably necessary to achieve a
        legitimate business justification;
    (2) the challenged conduct is no broader than necessary; and
    (3) the procompetitive benefits outweigh the anticompetitive
        harms.

(b) Efficiency claims shall be supported by credible evidence.

§ 460.5 Penalties.

Violations of this Part shall be subject to—
(a) civil penalties under Section 5(m) of the FTC Act;
(b) cease and desist orders;
(c) disgorgement of profits; and
(d) structural relief where appropriate.

§ 460.6 Effective Date.

This Part shall take effect 180 days after publication in
the Federal Register.

### DOJ/FTC Merger Guidelines

**Summary of Key Reforms**:

| Current Approach | Reformed Approach |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Market definition first | Effects-based analysis |
| HHI screens only | Structural presumptions |
| Efficiency defense generous | Efficiency claims scrutinized |
| Vertical mergers permissive | Vertical integration concerns |
| Behavioral remedies common | Structural remedies preferred |

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Structural Presumptions**: Mergers creating 30%+ share presumptively anticompetitive
2. **Serial Acquisitions**: Cumulative effect analysis required
3. **Dominant Firm Acquisitions**: Enhanced scrutiny for firms with 50%+ share
4. **Labor Market Effects**: Include labor market analysis in all merger review
5. **Potential Competition**: Protect nascent and potential competitors
6. **Remedies**: Prefer structural remedies; behavioral remedies disfavored

| Self-preferencing ambiguity | Per se rule for own-product promotion in search/marketplace |
| Business user scope | Broad definition including advertisers, developers, sellers |
