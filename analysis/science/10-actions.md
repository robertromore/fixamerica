# Science Policy: Actions

## Overview

This document outlines concrete actions that individuals, communities, organizations, and advocates can take to strengthen American science policy. Science advocacy is not just for scientists -- citizens, business leaders, educators, and elected officials all have roles to play in building a stronger, more equitable, and more trustworthy scientific enterprise.

## For Individual Citizens

### Stay Informed

- Follow science policy news through AAAS, *Science*, *Nature*, and specialized outlets
- Read your congressional representatives' positions on science funding and integrity
- Understand the basic structure of federal research funding (who funds what, and how much)
- Learn to distinguish scientific consensus from individual studies or opinion

### Contact Elected Officials

- Call or write your senators and representative during appropriations season (typically February-September) to support science funding
- Respond to specific threats to research agencies, scientific integrity policies, or science education
- Attend town halls and ask questions about science policy
- Share personal stories about how research has affected your life (medical treatments, technology, agriculture)

### Support Science in Your Community

- Attend public lectures, science cafes, and community science events
- Volunteer for citizen science projects (bird counts, water quality monitoring, weather observations)
- Support local science museums, libraries, and educational institutions
- Advocate for evidence-based policies at the local and state level

### Vote for Science

- Consider candidates' positions on science funding, scientific integrity, and evidence-based policy
- Support candidates with scientific or technical backgrounds
- Use resources from organizations like 314 Action and Science Debate to evaluate candidates

## For Scientists and Researchers

### Engage in Advocacy

- Join scientific society advocacy days (AAAS, ACS, APS, and others organize annual Hill visits)
- Participate in the AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowship or congressional fellowship programs
- Write op-eds and letters to the editor about science policy issues
- Testify before congressional committees when opportunities arise
- Share your research with non-specialist audiences through public talks, social media, and media interviews

### Improve the System from Within

- Serve on peer review panels and advocate for reform (shorter proposals, clearer criteria, reduced bias)
- Mentor early-career researchers and advocate for their interests in faculty governance
- Support open science by posting preprints, sharing data and code, and publishing in open access venues
- Report scientific misconduct through institutional and federal channels
- Push for reformed promotion and tenure criteria that value reproducibility, mentorship, and public engagement

### Protect Scientific Integrity

- Document any instances of political interference with research or communication
- Know your rights as a government scientist or federally funded researcher
- Contact the Union of Concerned Scientists or Government Accountability Project if you experience retaliation
- Support colleagues who face political pressure for their findings

---

## For Communities and Local Organizations

### Build Local Science Infrastructure

- Advocate for science-related economic development (research parks, innovation hubs, STEM education centers)
- Support local universities' research missions through community engagement and advocacy
- Create community science advisory boards to bring scientific expertise into local governance
- Partner with libraries to expand public access to scientific information

### Address Science in Local Schools

- Advocate for strong science curricula based on current scientific standards
- Support science teacher professional development
- Create mentorship programs connecting local scientists with students
- Sponsor science fairs, robotics teams, and other extracurricular STEM activities

---

## For Organizations and Institutions

### Universities

- Advocate collectively through AAU, APLU, and other associations for increased research funding
- Reform internal practices: improve postdoc compensation, reduce administrative burden, support diverse researchers
- Increase transparency in indirect cost spending
- Invest in public engagement and science communication
- Support open access and data sharing as institutional priorities

### Professional Societies

- Organize advocacy days and provide members with tools to contact legislators
- Publish policy statements on key science policy issues
- Track legislation and alert members to opportunities for input
- Provide expert testimony and analysis to Congress and agencies

### Industry

- Advocate for increased federal basic research funding (which feeds the innovation pipeline)
- Support STEM visa reform and international researcher mobility
- Partner with universities on workforce development programs
- Invest in pre-competitive research through public-private partnerships

---

## For Advocates and Organizers

### Build Coalitions

- Connect science advocacy with economic development, national security, and public health constituencies
- Engage business leaders as allies for research funding (emphasize workforce and innovation pipeline)
- Build bipartisan relationships -- science funding has historically enjoyed bipartisan support
- Partner with patient advocacy groups, who are among the most effective advocates for biomedical research

### Effective Messaging

| Message Frame | Target Audience | Key Points |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Economic competitiveness | Business community, fiscal moderates | R&D investment drives innovation, jobs, and GDP growth |
| National security | Defense hawks, national security community | China competition, technological superiority depends on research |
| Health and medicine | General public, patient advocates | NIH funding leads to cures and treatments |
| Local impact | All elected officials | Research dollars in their districts, local jobs and economic activity |
| American leadership | Patriotic audiences | U.S. scientific preeminence is earned through investment |
| Fiscal responsibility | Budget hawks | Research investment has highest ROI of any federal spending |

### Organize Campaigns

- Use appropriations deadlines and congressional recesses as focal points for advocacy
- Coordinate sign-on letters from researchers, institutions, and business leaders
- Organize constituent meetings with members of Congress and their staffers
- Leverage social media and earned media to amplify science advocacy messages
- Support the March for Science and similar public demonstrations
