# Science Policy: Stakeholders

## Overview

American science policy involves a complex ecosystem of stakeholders with overlapping and sometimes conflicting interests. Understanding who holds power, who benefits, and who is harmed by the current system is essential for designing reforms that can attract sufficient support while addressing genuine problems.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Research Universities

**Role**: Perform the majority of federally funded basic research; train the next generation of scientists

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Universities receiving federal R&D | ~2,500 |
| Top 100 research universities' share | ~80% of academic R&D |
| Total academic R&D expenditures | ~$95 billion (2022) |
| Federal share of academic R&D | ~52% |
| Indirect cost recovery revenue | ~$11 billion/year |

**Interests**:

- Maximizing federal research funding
- Maintaining high indirect cost rates (typically 50-65%)
- Expanding research capacity and prestige rankings
- Protecting institutional autonomy from federal regulation
- Attracting top faculty and international students

**Power**: Significant lobbying presence through the Association of American Universities (AAU), Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU), and individual institutional government relations offices. University-based research generates economic activity in congressional districts, providing political leverage.

### Federal Research Agencies

**Key agencies and their R&D budgets**:

| Agency | R&D Budget | Primary Mission |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| NIH | ~$48B | Biomedical research |
| DOD | ~$76B | National defense |
| DOE | ~$22B | Energy, nuclear security, basic science |
| NASA | ~$15B | Space exploration and Earth science |
| NSF | ~$11B | All fields of basic research |
| USDA | ~$4B | Agricultural research |
| NIST | ~$1.5B | Standards, measurement, manufacturing |
| ARPA-H | ~$2.5B | Health breakthroughs |

**Interests**:

- Budget growth and program stability
- Mission accomplishment and relevance
- Maintaining programmatic authority and flexibility
- Protecting agency culture and norms
- Demonstrating impact to Congress and the public

**Power**: Agencies control the distribution of hundreds of billions in research funding, giving them enormous influence over research priorities, institutional winners and losers, and career trajectories.

### Individual Researchers

**Categories**:

| Category | Estimated Number | Key Concerns |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Tenured/tenure-track faculty | ~180,000 | Funding stability, administrative burden |
| Research faculty (non-tenure) | ~120,000 | Job security, benefits |
| Postdoctoral researchers | ~70,000 | Compensation, career prospects |
| Graduate research assistants | ~300,000 | Stipends, mentorship quality, job market |
| Federal intramural scientists | ~30,000 | Scientific freedom, political interference |
| National lab researchers | ~40,000 | Lab management, mission alignment |

**Interests**:

- Stable, adequate research funding
- Reasonable administrative burden
- Scientific freedom and autonomy
- Fair compensation and career paths
- Protection from political interference
- Recognition and professional advancement

**Power**: Individual researchers have limited political power, but collectively they form the backbone of the system. Through professional societies, advocacy organizations, and constituent relationships with Congress, they can influence policy.

### Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Researchers

**The junior workforce** forms the operational core of the research enterprise but has the least power:

- Graduate students are funded through research assistantships (~$35,000-$40,000/year), teaching assistantships, and fellowships
- Postdocs earn $56,484-$72,000 (NRSA scale) for positions that increasingly last 4-6 years
- Both groups face uncertain career prospects: only ~15-20% of postdocs obtain tenure-track positions
- Unionization efforts at graduate and postdoc levels are growing but remain limited

**Interests**: Higher compensation, better mentorship, viable career paths, health insurance, family support, and an end to the exploitation model that treats them as cheap labor rather than professionals in training.

### Industry R&D Sector

**Scale**: The private sector spends ~$660 billion annually on R&D, dwarfing federal investment.

| Sector | Approximate R&D | Focus |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Technology (Alphabet, Meta, etc.) | ~$250B | AI, cloud, platforms |
| Pharmaceutical/biotech | ~$120B | Drug development |
| Automotive/aerospace | ~$80B | Electric vehicles, defense |
| Semiconductor | ~$60B | Chip design, manufacturing |
| Other manufacturing | ~$100B | Various |
| Other services | ~$50B | Various |

**Interests**:

- R&D tax credits and favorable tax treatment
- Intellectual property protection
- Trained STEM workforce availability
- Technology transfer from universities and labs
- Regulatory environments that support innovation
- Immigration policies that allow hiring of international talent

**Power**: Enormous, through direct lobbying, campaign contributions, and economic influence. Technology and pharmaceutical companies are among the largest corporate lobbying spenders.

## Government Stakeholders

### Congress

**Key committees**:

| Committee | Jurisdiction |
|-----------|-------------|
| Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation | NSF, NIST, NASA |
| Senate HELP (Health, Education, Labor, Pensions) | NIH, education |
| Senate Appropriations (CJS, Labor-HHS) | Agency budgets |
| House Science, Space, and Technology | NSF, DOE, NASA, NIST |
| House Energy and Commerce | NIH, EPA, telecom |
| House Appropriations (CJS, Labor-HHS) | Agency budgets |

**Interests**: Demonstrating constituent benefit, directing funding to home states/districts, responding to public concerns about science issues, maintaining oversight authority.

### Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)

- Advises the President on science and technology issues
- Director serves as the President's Science Advisor
- Coordinates interagency science policy
- Issues government-wide policies (e.g., Nelson Memo on open access, scientific integrity framework)
- Limited staff (~50-80 people) relative to scope of responsibility

### Office of Management and Budget (OMB)

- Controls the annual budget request to Congress
- Reviews all significant agency regulations
- Can effectively veto agency spending priorities
- Often prioritizes deficit reduction over research investment
- Budget examiners for science agencies have enormous informal power

## Who Is Harmed by the Current System

### Early-Career Researchers

- Spend prime productive years in low-paid, insecure postdoctoral positions
- Face declining grant success rates and shrinking tenure-track opportunities
- Bear disproportionate cost of system dysfunction (job insecurity, overwork, mental health)
- Women and underrepresented minorities face additional barriers

### The Public

- Taxpayers fund ~$200 billion in research annually but often cannot access the results
- Scientific misinformation fills the vacuum left by poor science communication
- Communities outside research hubs do not benefit from the economic activity research generates
- Patients wait longer for treatments when research funding is unstable or misallocated

### Underrepresented Groups

- Black, Hispanic, and Native American researchers remain severely underrepresented at every career stage
- Women face persistent barriers in many STEM fields, particularly in leadership
- First-generation college students lack the networks and mentorship that facilitate research careers
- Researchers at non-R1 institutions (including minority-serving institutions) face structural disadvantages in grant competition

### International Researchers

- Visa processing delays and uncertainty deter talent from coming to or staying in the U.S.
- The China Initiative's chilling effect has been particularly harmful to Asian and Asian American scientists
- H-1B and J-1 visa limitations create precarious employment situations
- Researchers caught between security concerns and their legitimate scientific work

## Key Relationships and Power Dynamics

### The Iron Triangle of Science Funding

A classic "iron triangle" connects three groups that mutually benefit from increased research spending:

1. **Congressional committees** with jurisdiction over science agencies gain influence through larger budgets
2. **Federal agencies** expand their programs and prestige
3. **Research universities** receive more grants and overhead revenue

This triangle generally works to increase funding but resists reforms that might redistribute funding or change how the system operates.

### The Publisher-University-Funder Triangle

- **Funders** (NIH, NSF) require publication of results
- **Universities** reward researchers for publishing in high-impact journals
- **Publishers** charge universities subscription fees to access the research those universities produced
- Researchers provide free labor as authors, reviewers, and editors
- The public pays twice: once for the research (through taxes) and again for access (through library subscriptions)

### Generational Tensions

Senior scientists who built careers under more favorable conditions (higher success rates, earlier first grants, lower costs of entry) often set policies that disadvantage early-career researchers. This creates a governance problem: the people with the power to reform the system are those who succeeded under the current system.
