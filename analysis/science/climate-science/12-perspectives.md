# Climate Science: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the protection of climate science through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of February 2026)

| Bill/Amendment | Type | Current Status | Last Action |
|----------------|------|----------------|-------------|
| Climate Research Protection Act | Federal Legislation | Proposed (this analysis) | Draft text in 11-legislation.md |
| Climate Science Integrity Act | Federal Legislation | Proposed (this analysis) | Draft text in 11-legislation.md |

*Note: Status reflects 119th Congress (2025-2026). See [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md) for full bill text.*

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is government overreach and scientific uncertainty; actual concern is that climate science supports unwanted regulation |
| Principle consistency | "Pro-science" and "fiscal responsibility" principles are selectively applied -- climate science is scrutinized far more aggressively than defense or energy research |
| Goalpost stability | Goalposts have shifted repeatedly: from "warming isn't happening" to "it's natural" to "it's not that bad" to "solutions are too costly" |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate to high; climate science has become a tribal identity marker, leading to reflexive opposition |

**Justification:** Conservative engagement on climate science shows significant inconsistency. The shift from George H.W. Bush signing the UNFCCC in 1992 to near-universal Republican opposition to climate science by 2010 was driven more by fossil fuel donor pressure and political identity dynamics than by changes in the underlying evidence. Genuine fiscal concerns about research spending exist, but they are applied selectively -- military research and fossil fuel subsidies face far less scrutiny.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Shifting goalposts*: Republican Party platforms moved from acknowledging climate change (2008: "climate change is occurring") to dismissing it (2016: no mention of human causation), despite strengthening scientific evidence. See: Republican National Committee Platform documents, 2008 and 2016.
- *Selective scrutiny*: Rep. Lamar Smith subpoenaed NOAA scientists' emails in 2015 after a study contradicted the "warming pause" narrative, while showing no similar interest in scrutinizing industry-funded research. See: House Science Committee activities, 114th Congress.
- *Donor alignment*: The Koch network's pivot against climate science in the late 2000s coincided closely with the Republican shift from acknowledgment to denial. See: Mayer, Jane. *Dark Money* (2016).

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Acknowledges some climate research occurs but disputes claims of political interference; frames budget cuts as fiscal discipline rather than political targeting |
| Root Cause Agreement | 2/10 | Rejects the framing of fossil fuel disinformation and political polarization as root causes; attributes politicization to climate advocates' policy agenda |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation. "Climate Change" issue briefs (2023-2024): Frame climate research spending as wasteful; emphasize uncertainties
- *2024 Republican Party Platform*: No specific provisions on climate research protection
- National Review editorial positions: Consistently oppose mandated climate research funding

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Protected research funding | 2/10 | "Congress should not bind future appropriations" | Loss of ability to defund programs they oppose |
| Scientific integrity policies | 3/10 | "Creates unfireable bureaucrats" | Limits political appointees' control over agency messaging |
| Improved climate communication | 2/10 | "Government propaganda" | Effective communication strengthens support for climate policy |
| Depoliticization strategies | 4/10 | "Independent agencies lack accountability" | An independent climate body would be harder to control |
| Research infrastructure investment | 3/10 | "Fiscal responsibility requires prioritization" | Selective application -- no similar concerns about defense R&D |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Climate Research Protection Act | 2/10 | "Unconstitutional appropriations mandate; interferes with executive branch management" | Prevents defunding climate programs; restricts political editing of reports |
| Climate Science Integrity Act | 3/10 | "Creates an unaccountable scientific bureaucracy" | Whistleblower protections and anti-censorship provisions limit political control |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Consolidate climate research under a single agency for efficiency
- Subject all federal research to cost-benefit analysis before funding
- Reduce federal climate research and shift to private sector and university research
- Oppose mandated funding floors and let the appropriations process determine priorities annually

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian, Religious Right
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on narrow efficiency and accountability measures), Populist (on economic anxiety framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Liberal

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine belief in science-based governance and concern about interference; motivations align with stated positions |
| Principle consistency | Consistent support for scientific integrity and research funding across topics |
| Goalpost stability | Stable positions; consistently supported climate research across administrations |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; willing to engage on bipartisan framing and compromise structures |

**Justification:** Liberal support for climate science protection is principled and consistent. Democrats have supported climate research funding and scientific integrity across multiple administrations, including when it produced inconvenient findings. Some minor inconsistency arises from occasionally conflating science protection with climate policy advocacy, blurring a line that could help build broader coalitions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Consistent support*: Democratic members of Congress have consistently supported climate research appropriations and opposed proposed cuts, including during budget negotiations where other priorities competed. See: Appropriations committee voting records.
- *Scientific integrity advocacy*: Democratic administrations (Obama, Biden) issued and strengthened scientific integrity policies. See: Obama 2009 Scientific Integrity Memorandum; Biden 2021 Executive Order on Scientific Integrity.
- *Minor conflation*: Some Democratic messaging equates supporting climate science with supporting specific policies (Green New Deal, carbon tax), which may alienate potential allies who accept the science but prefer different policies.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with the analysis of political interference, budget threats, and research suppression |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees with fossil fuel disinformation and political polarization analysis; may overemphasize Republican culpability and underemphasize structural factors |

**Source references:**

- *2024 Democratic Party Platform*: Strong support for climate science and research funding
- Center for American Progress. Climate and science policy briefs (2023-2024): Advocate for protected funding and integrity policies
- Congressional Democratic caucus letters supporting climate research appropriations

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Protected research funding | 9/10 | "Essential to maintain scientific capacity" | Would prefer even higher funding levels |
| Scientific integrity policies | 9/10 | "Overdue legal protections for scientists" | Supports codification into statute |
| Improved climate communication | 8/10 | "Public deserves accurate climate information" | May conflate communication with advocacy |
| Depoliticization strategies | 7/10 | "Independence is important but so is accountability" | Wary of structures that could be captured by industry |
| Research infrastructure investment | 9/10 | "Invest in scientific leadership" | Strongly supports satellite and computing investments |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Climate Research Protection Act | 9/10 | "Strong foundation but could go further" | Would prefer higher funding floors and broader scope |
| Climate Science Integrity Act | 9/10 | "Essential protections for scientific freedom" | Would prefer stronger enforcement mechanisms |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Expand legislation to protect all federal scientists, not just climate scientists
- Create a private right of action for scientists to sue in federal court
- Require Senate confirmation for any political appointees overseeing climate research
- Link climate research funding to a percentage of GDP

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Centrist
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-corporate framing), Constitutionalist (on transparency)
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right (on this specific issue)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to scientific integrity as part of broader systemic reform; no hidden agenda |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies anti-corporate, pro-public-interest principles to science policy |
| Goalpost stability | Stable, principled positions; demands may be ambitious but are consistent |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; willing to support incremental reforms while advocating for more transformative change |

**Justification:** Progressive engagement on climate science is highly principled and consistent. The progressive analysis that fossil fuel industry power drives science politicization aligns directly with their broader critique of corporate influence on democratic governance. Progressives have consistently supported stronger protections than other perspectives are willing to enact, but have also supported incremental measures.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Systemic analysis*: Progressive organizations (Sunrise Movement, Justice Democrats) consistently connect climate science protection to broader anti-corporate reform. See: Sunrise Movement policy platform.
- *Coalition support*: Progressives have supported centrist climate science bills even when they fell short of progressive ambitions.
- *Environmental justice*: Progressives uniquely emphasize how climate science gaps disproportionately affect marginalized communities. See: Congressional Progressive Caucus policy briefs.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | Full agreement with the analysis; would add emphasis on environmental justice dimensions |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Strongly agrees with the fossil fuel disinformation analysis; views it as part of a broader pattern of corporate capture |

**Source references:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus policy positions on climate and science
- Sunrise Movement. "Green New Deal" framework documents
- Union of Concerned Scientists reports (aligned with progressive analysis)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Protected research funding | 8/10 | "Necessary but insufficient" | Would prefer dramatically higher funding levels |
| Scientific integrity policies | 9/10 | "Essential protections" | Would add criminal penalties for interference |
| Improved climate communication | 8/10 | "Must center environmental justice" | Wants communication to address equity dimensions |
| Depoliticization strategies | 6/10 | "Independence is good but must not insulate from democratic accountability" | Concerned that independent structures could be captured by industry |
| Research infrastructure investment | 9/10 | "Major public investment needed" | Would tie to Green New Deal-scale programs |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Climate Research Protection Act | 8/10 | "Good start; needs stronger provisions and higher funding" | Would add environmental justice research mandates |
| Climate Science Integrity Act | 8/10 | "Important but enforcement mechanisms are insufficient" | Would add private right of action and criminal penalties |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Create a public science trust funded by fossil fuel extraction fees
- Mandate environmental justice research components in all climate research programs
- Establish community advisory boards for research priorities
- Bar former fossil fuel industry employees from overseeing climate research

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-corporate themes), Centrist (on practical protections)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Libertarian, Religious Right

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine philosophical opposition to government-run science programs, but selective application of skepticism |
| Principle consistency | Consistent in opposing government spending; less consistent in applying skepticism to industry-funded research |
| Goalpost stability | Relatively stable; "government shouldn't do it" is a consistent position |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; principled opposition to federal programs rather than purely partisan |

**Justification:** Libertarian opposition to government climate research programs is philosophically grounded in genuine skepticism about government competence and concern about mission creep. However, the selective focus on government science while largely ignoring industry-funded disinformation undermines claims of principled neutrality. Libertarians who consistently applied their anti-cronyism principles would oppose industry-funded disinformation as vigorously as government research programs.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Consistent anti-spending*: Cato Institute has consistently opposed expansions of federal research programs. See: Cato Institute budget analyses.
- *Selective skepticism*: Libertarian organizations have been far more critical of government climate research than of industry-funded contrarian research. See: Cato climate publications, which frequently cite industry-funded work without noting conflicts of interest.
- *Philosophical basis*: Genuine philosophical arguments about private vs. public provision of research exist. See: Terence Kealey, *The Economic Laws of Scientific Research* (1996).

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Agrees that political interference with science is problematic in principle, but views federal climate research as itself an example of government overreach |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Skeptical of the "industry disinformation" framing; attributes politicization to government involvement in science rather than industry opposition to it |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute. "Climate Change" and "Government Spending" policy briefs
- Reason Foundation. Science policy commentary
- Libertarian Party platform statements on government research

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Protected research funding | 2/10 | "Government should not mandate spending" | Opposes government science programs in principle |
| Scientific integrity policies | 4/10 | "If government does research, it should be honest" | Grudging acceptance that integrity matters if programs exist |
| Improved climate communication | 3/10 | "Government should not be in the communication business" | Fears government propaganda |
| Depoliticization strategies | 5/10 | "Depoliticization through privatization" | Would prefer to move research out of government entirely |
| Research infrastructure investment | 2/10 | "Private sector can provide these services" | Opposes government capital spending on principle |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Climate Research Protection Act | 2/10 | "Mandated spending is anti-liberty" | Opposes binding appropriations and expanded government programs |
| Climate Science Integrity Act | 3/10 | "Good intentions but creates more bureaucracy" | Supports whistleblower protections in principle; opposes new government offices |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Privatize climate monitoring; sell satellite data commercially
- Replace federal research grants with tax credits for private climate research
- Eliminate political appointee oversight of research (agrees on this point, different reasoning)
- Fund university research through endowments rather than annual appropriations

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on spending opposition)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on anti-corporate cronyism, if consistently applied), Centrist (on transparency)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist (on government program expansion)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine constitutional concerns about federal science authority mixed with selective application of constitutional principles |
| Principle consistency | Federalism and enumerated powers principles applied more rigorously to climate than to defense or space programs |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate; constitutional objections are somewhat flexible depending on the political valence of the program |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; constitutional arguments can be used constructively or obstructively |

**Justification:** Constitutionalist engagement raises legitimate questions about federal authority, separation of powers, and the appropriate role of Congress versus the executive branch in directing research. However, constitutional objections to climate research funding are applied far more aggressively than to other federal science programs (defense research, space exploration, nuclear weapons research) that rest on similar constitutional foundations, suggesting some motivated reasoning.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Selective application*: Constitutional objections are rarely raised against DOD research programs or NASA space exploration, which rest on similarly broad readings of federal power.
- *Legitimate concerns*: Questions about whether Congress can bind future appropriations and whether independent scientific bodies comply with the Appointments Clause are substantive.
- *Flexibility*: Constitutionalist positions on federal science authority have shifted over time, suggesting they are not purely principled.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that political interference with research is problematic; has concerns about federal overreach in climate monitoring |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Partially agrees that politicization is a problem but attributes it to federal involvement rather than industry interference |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society. Policy briefs on administrative law and agency independence
- Constitutional scholars' analyses of federal research authority under Article I

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Protected research funding | 3/10 | "Congress cannot bind future appropriations" | Constitutional objection to mandatory spending |
| Scientific integrity policies | 5/10 | "Separation of powers must be respected" | Supports integrity in principle; wary of limiting executive authority |
| Improved climate communication | 4/10 | "Government speech raises First Amendment questions" | Legitimate constitutional concern, selectively applied |
| Depoliticization strategies | 4/10 | "Independent agencies raise Appointments Clause issues" | Valid structural concern |
| Research infrastructure investment | 4/10 | "Federal authority must be constitutionally grounded" | Would require clear constitutional basis for each program |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Climate Research Protection Act | 3/10 | "Mandatory appropriations violate congressional prerogatives; anti-interference provisions may violate executive authority" | Constitutional objections, some legitimate |
| Climate Science Integrity Act | 4/10 | "Whistleblower protections are constitutional; independent officers may raise Appointments Clause issues" | Mixed assessment based on structural constitutional analysis |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Authorize but do not mandate climate research programs, preserving congressional discretion
- Structure scientific integrity oversight through existing Inspector General authorities rather than new independent offices
- Ensure any independent science body is constitutionally structured under the Appointments Clause
- Leave state-level climate research to states under the Tenth Amendment

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Libertarian
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on structural governance design), Liberal (on transparency and accountability)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on scope of federal authority)

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is "elite scientists telling regular people what to do"; underlying concern is economic threat to fossil fuel workers |
| Principle consistency | Anti-elite rhetoric conflicts with populist support when the elites in question are fossil fuel billionaires funding climate skepticism |
| Goalpost stability | Low; positions shift based on partisan cues rather than principled analysis |
| Zero-sum behavior | High on climate specifically; climate science viewed as a weapon used by coastal elites against heartland workers |

**Justification:** Populist engagement on climate science is heavily driven by cultural identity dynamics rather than consistent principles. The populist instinct to oppose elite institutions would logically extend to opposing fossil fuel industry manipulation of public discourse, but in practice, populist energy is directed almost entirely against climate scientists and environmental advocates. This inconsistency reflects the degree to which climate has become a culture-war issue rather than a policy debate.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Anti-elite selectivity*: Populist ire targets "academic elites" and "government bureaucrats" but rarely fossil fuel executives whose wealth far exceeds that of any climate scientist.
- *Economic anxiety*: Genuine concern about energy costs and fossil fuel job losses provides a legitimate basis for skepticism about climate *policy*, but is channeled into opposition to climate *science*.
- *Media influence*: Populist positions on climate closely track conservative media messaging. See: Pew Research Center surveys on media trust and climate views.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 3/10 | Skeptical of claims of research suppression; views government climate programs as elitist waste |
| Root Cause Agreement | 2/10 | Rejects the fossil fuel disinformation analysis; sees politicization as driven by climate advocates pushing unwanted policy |

**Source references:**

- Polling data on populist-leaning voters' climate views (Pew, PRRI)
- Media coverage from populist-oriented outlets (Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon programs)
- Economic analyses of fossil-fuel-dependent communities

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Protected research funding | 2/10 | "Wastes taxpayer money on elite science" | Genuine economic anxiety about government spending priorities |
| Scientific integrity policies | 3/10 | "Bureaucrats protecting bureaucrats" | Distrust of government institutions generally |
| Improved climate communication | 2/10 | "Propaganda from out-of-touch elites" | Deep distrust of expert communication |
| Depoliticization strategies | 3/10 | "Can't depoliticize something that is inherently political" | Views climate science as inseparable from policy |
| Research infrastructure investment | 3/10 | "Invest in real jobs, not satellites for scientists" | Legitimate concern about spending priorities |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Climate Research Protection Act | 2/10 | "Mandated spending on elite priorities" | Opposes protected funding for programs that threaten fossil fuel jobs |
| Climate Science Integrity Act | 3/10 | "Scientists should be accountable to the public, not protected from oversight" | Distrust of institutional protections for government employees |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Redirect climate research funding to energy worker retraining
- Require climate scientists to disclose grant funding and travel
- Create public review boards for climate research priorities
- Fund local weather services over "global climate" research

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Religious Right
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on anti-corporate framing, if extended to fossil fuel industry), Liberal (on worker protection aspects)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (different base), Democratic Socialist (different economic analysis)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to evidence-based policy and bipartisan solutions |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies evidence-based standards; sometimes risks false equivalence between scientific consensus and political opposition |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; pragmatic approach adapts to political realities without abandoning core commitments |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; actively seeks compromise and bipartisan solutions |

**Justification:** Centrist engagement on climate science is principled and constructive. Centrists consistently support evidence-based governance and oppose political interference with research. The main limitation is an occasional tendency toward false balance -- treating the scientific evidence and political objections as equally valid "sides" in a spirit of compromise. This can inadvertently legitimize positions that are not supported by evidence.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan efforts*: Centrist organizations like the Bipartisan Policy Center and Niskanen Center have consistently supported climate research funding while seeking bipartisan approaches to climate policy.
- *Evidence-based framing*: Centrists emphasize the practical value of climate data for economic planning, disaster preparedness, and national security.
- *Risk of false balance*: Centrist media sometimes presents the scientific consensus and political opposition as equally valid perspectives. See: Bipartisan Policy Center climate reports.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement with the factual analysis; may understate the degree of organized opposition |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agrees on politicization dynamics but may attribute too much to "both sides" and too little to organized industry campaigns |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center. Climate science and energy policy reports (2023-2024)
- Niskanen Center. "Climate and Clean Energy" policy briefs
- No Labels. Science policy positions

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Protected research funding | 7/10 | "Stability is important; must balance with fiscal responsibility" | Would prefer softer funding protections with flexibility |
| Scientific integrity policies | 8/10 | "Bipartisan issue that should be easy to pass" | Strongly supports; wants bipartisan cosponsor lists |
| Improved climate communication | 7/10 | "Better communication reduces polarization" | Concerned about government communication being perceived as advocacy |
| Depoliticization strategies | 8/10 | "Independent structures are the best path forward" | Strongly supports CBO-like model for climate assessment |
| Research infrastructure investment | 7/10 | "Smart investment in national capability" | Supports but wants cost-effectiveness analysis |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Climate Research Protection Act | 7/10 | "Good framework; funding floor may be too rigid" | Would prefer authorization with strong appropriations language rather than mandatory spending |
| Climate Science Integrity Act | 8/10 | "Should be a bipartisan priority" | Strongly supports; would emphasize bipartisan governance structures |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Structure legislation as bipartisan compromise from the outset, with Republican and Democratic lead sponsors
- Create a bipartisan Climate Science Advisory Board with equal representation
- Focus on "weather and climate services" framing rather than "climate change" to reduce partisan friction
- Phase in protections gradually to build support and demonstrate effectiveness

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, some Conservatives (on practical governance)
- **Potential bridges:** Constitutionalist (on structural design), Libertarian (on transparency and accountability)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (different base), Religious Right (different priorities)

---

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is theological (God's sovereignty over nature); actual alignment is with conservative political coalition on fossil fuels |
| Principle consistency | "Creation care" theology would support climate science, but is overridden by coalition loyalty |
| Goalpost stability | Low; theological arguments shift to match political positions |
| Zero-sum behavior | High on climate specifically; viewed as part of a secular liberal agenda |

**Justification:** Religious Right engagement on climate science is notably inconsistent. Christian stewardship theology provides strong arguments for understanding and protecting the natural world, and a significant minority of evangelical leaders (the "creation care" movement) have embraced climate science. However, the dominant faction aligns with conservative political opposition, using theological arguments ("God controls the climate") that conflict with the same tradition's support for human agency in other domains. The Cornwall Alliance's framing of climate concern as an obstacle to poverty reduction is particularly inconsistent with mainline Christian teaching on environmental stewardship.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Theological inconsistency*: The argument that "God controls the climate" is not applied to other natural phenomena that the Religious Right accepts human responsibility for managing.
- *Internal division*: The Evangelical Climate Initiative (2006), signed by 86 evangelical leaders, accepted climate science and called for action. The Cornwall Alliance organized a counter-declaration. See: "Climate Change: An Evangelical Call to Action" (2006).
- *Coalition alignment*: Religious Right climate positions closely mirror those of conservative political organizations that fund their activities. See: DeSmog Blog funding analyses.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 3/10 | Skeptical of claims of political interference; views climate programs with suspicion |
| Root Cause Agreement | 2/10 | Rejects the fossil fuel disinformation analysis; may frame climate concern as secular overreach |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Protected research funding | 2/10 | "Government spending should reflect voters' priorities" | Opposes mandated spending on programs they distrust |
| Scientific integrity policies | 3/10 | "Scientists should be accountable, not autonomous" | Distrust of scientific establishment |
| Improved climate communication | 2/10 | "Secular science propaganda" | Views government climate communication as hostile to religious worldview |
| Depoliticization strategies | 3/10 | "Science has already been politicized by climate activists" | Conflates science and policy |
| Research infrastructure investment | 3/10 | "Other priorities are more important" | Genuine disagreement on spending priorities |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Climate Research Protection Act | 2/10 | "Locks in spending on a contested agenda" | Views climate research as supporting unwanted regulation |
| Climate Science Integrity Act | 3/10 | "Protects an ideological establishment" | Distrust of the scientific community on this topic |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Fund "creation care" research through faith-based organizations
- Ensure religious perspectives are represented on scientific advisory committees
- Focus research on adaptation and resilience rather than causation
- Support disaster preparedness research without the "climate change" framing

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Populist
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on creation care theology, with "stewardship" framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Libertarian

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to public science and opposition to corporate influence; motivations fully align with stated positions |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies democratic accountability and anti-corporate principles to science policy |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; ambitious positions are consistently held |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; supports incremental reforms while advocating for structural change |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialist engagement on climate science is highly principled and internally consistent. The analysis that fossil fuel industry power corrupts both political and scientific institutions is a direct application of core democratic socialist principles about corporate influence on democratic governance. Democratic socialists consistently support the strongest possible protections for public science and the most aggressive accountability measures for industry interference.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Consistent principles*: Democratic socialist positions on climate science directly follow from principles applied to healthcare, finance, and other sectors. See: Democratic Socialists of America platform.
- *Structural analysis*: The connection between corporate power, political influence, and science politicization is a core tenet. See: Klein, Naomi. *This Changes Everything* (2014).
- *Coalition support*: Despite preferring more ambitious measures, democratic socialists have consistently supported incremental climate science protections.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | Full agreement; would add emphasis on the systemic nature of corporate capture |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Strongly agrees; views fossil fuel disinformation as paradigmatic example of corporate power distorting public knowledge |

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Scientific integrity policies | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Libertarian, Constitutionalist | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right |
| Depoliticization strategies | Liberal, Centrist, Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Libertarian | Conservative, Constitutionalist | Populist, Religious Right |
| Protected research funding | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Constitutionalist | Conservative, Libertarian, Populist, Religious Right |
| Research infrastructure | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Constitutionalist | Conservative, Libertarian, Populist, Religious Right |
| Improved communication | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | -- | Conservative, Libertarian, Populist, Religious Right |

**Key insight:** Scientific integrity policies and depoliticization strategies have the broadest potential support base, including some centrist and libertarian interest. Funding mandates and infrastructure investment face a sharper partisan divide. The most viable legislative path focuses on integrity protections paired with depoliticization framing.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Scientific Integrity for All Federal Research*

**Bridges:** Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian + Constitutionalist

**Core Agreement:** All four perspectives agree in principle that government-funded research should be honest, transparent, and free from political manipulation. Broadening protections beyond climate to all federal science defuses the partisan framing.

**Policy Description:**

Enact scientific integrity legislation that applies to *all* federal research, not just climate science. Include whistleblower protections, anti-censorship provisions, and transparent reporting requirements. Structure oversight through existing Inspector General offices to address constitutional concerns about new independent offices.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Achieves core scientific integrity protections through broader framing |
| Centrist | Bipartisan framing makes passage more feasible; applies to all science |
| Libertarian | Uses existing oversight structures rather than creating new bureaucracy; transparency provisions align with anti-cronyism principles |
| Constitutionalist | IG-based enforcement respects existing constitutional structure; no new independent offices raising Appointments Clause concerns |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Climate-specific provisions and dedicated enforcement office |
| Centrist | Some enforcement strength in exchange for broader coalition |
| Libertarian | Acceptance of statutory protections for government scientists |
| Constitutionalist | Acceptance of federal standards that apply to all agencies |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/4 coalition members rated 3+ consistency (Liberal 4, Centrist 4, Libertarian 3, Constitutionalist 3)
- **Durability:** Moderately durable; broad scope makes it harder to frame as partisan; existing IG infrastructure provides institutional continuity
- **Implementation Path:** Attach to COMPETES Act reauthorization or standalone bipartisan bill; leverage existing IG authorities

---

### Compromise 2: *Weather and Climate Monitoring Infrastructure Protection*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist

**Core Agreement:** All four perspectives value accurate weather forecasting, agricultural planning data, and disaster preparedness infrastructure. Framing climate monitoring as essential government infrastructure (like highways or weather services) rather than as "climate change research" creates a viable coalition.

**Policy Description:**

Protect core weather and climate monitoring infrastructure (satellites, observation networks, ocean buoys) through multi-year authorizations with strong bipartisan support. Frame as "weather and climate services" rather than "climate change research." Include provisions ensuring data continuity and no gaps in satellite coverage. Exclude policy-oriented research from the protected funding to narrow the scope.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Framed as infrastructure, not climate policy; supports weather services that constituents use |
| Liberal | Protects the monitoring infrastructure that underpins climate science |
| Centrist | Bipartisan framing; practical governance priority |
| Populist | Weather services benefit rural communities, farmers, and disaster-prone areas |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Acceptance of protected funding for monitoring programs (if not labeled "climate change") |
| Liberal | Narrower scope that does not include policy-oriented research or communication programs |
| Centrist | Less comprehensive protection in exchange for broader political support |
| Populist | Acceptance of federal spending on scientific infrastructure |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 2/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal 4, Centrist 4; Conservative 2, Populist 2)
- **Durability:** Moderately durable for monitoring infrastructure; weather framing has proven resilient to partisan pressure. Low-consistency coalition partners (Conservative, Populist) may withdraw support if framing shifts back to "climate change."
- **Implementation Path:** Authorization bill or appropriations language; leverage bipartisan support for weather services; partner with NOAA and agricultural stakeholders

---

### Compromise 3: *Climate Data Preservation and Transparency*

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Libertarian + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Five perspectives agree that government-funded research data should be preserved, publicly accessible, and protected from destruction. Transparency and data preservation principles have broad philosophical support across the ideological spectrum.

**Policy Description:**

Establish mandatory data preservation requirements for all federally funded climate data. Create a public data archive with redundant storage, including at least one copy maintained by an independent academic institution. Require open-format, machine-readable data publication. Prohibit the destruction or alteration of long-term data records without documented scientific justification.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Protects irreplaceable data records from political destruction |
| Progressive | Ensures public ownership and accessibility of publicly funded data |
| Centrist | Good governance and transparency; evidence-based policy depends on data integrity |
| Libertarian | Transparency and public access to government data align with accountability principles |
| Democratic Socialist | Public data as a public good; prevents corporate capture of publicly funded knowledge |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Standalone data bill without broader research protection |
| Progressive | Narrower scope than full research protection |
| Centrist | May face opposition from perspectives that see data preservation as enabling climate policy |
| Libertarian | Acceptance of mandatory government data standards |
| Democratic Socialist | Acceptance of narrower scope without funding mandates |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/5 coalition members rated 3+ consistency (Liberal 4, Progressive 5, Centrist 4, Libertarian 3, Democratic Socialist 5)
- **Durability:** Highly durable; data preservation and transparency are principles that are difficult to oppose publicly. Even perspectives outside the coalition would face political costs from advocating data destruction.
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone bill or amendment to data governance legislation; leverage broad transparency coalition; partner with academic institutions and data science community

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most immediately viable coalition for climate science protection combines **Liberal + Centrist + Progressive + Democratic Socialist** perspectives on scientific integrity provisions, supplemented by **Libertarian** and **Constitutionalist** support for narrower transparency and data preservation measures. This coalition can achieve approximately 55-60% of the proposed reforms.

### Key Obstacles

- **Fossil fuel industry funding**: The financial resources available to the opposition vastly exceed those of the supporting coalition
- **Partisan identity**: Climate science has become so embedded in partisan identity that many potential allies (moderate Conservatives, pragmatic Populists) face severe political costs for supporting any reform labeled "climate"
- **Framing challenges**: The most effective reforms (protected funding, anti-interference provisions) are also the most politically contested; the most broadly supported reforms (data transparency) are the least impactful

### Low Consistency Partners

The three perspectives rated 2/5 on consistency (Conservative, Populist, Religious Right) present the greatest coalition-building challenges:

- **Conservatives**: Engaging the subset of conservatives who accept climate science but prefer market-based policy solutions (Niskanen Center, RepublicEN) is more promising than engaging the broader movement
- **Populists**: Connecting climate research to practical benefits for working-class communities (weather services, disaster preparedness, agricultural data) is the most effective bridge
- **Religious Right**: The "creation care" minority within evangelical Christianity provides a potential bridge, but it represents a minority position within the Religious Right coalition

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with integrity, not climate**: Frame initial legislation as scientific integrity reform broadly, not climate-specific protection
2. **Build the infrastructure coalition**: Use the "weather and climate services" framing to secure bipartisan support for monitoring infrastructure
3. **Advance data preservation**: Pursue the data transparency compromise as a standalone measure with the broadest possible coalition
4. **Layer protections**: After establishing baseline integrity and transparency protections, add stronger climate-specific provisions through subsequent legislation
5. **Invest in communication**: Sustained public education about the value of climate data -- framed as infrastructure, not ideology -- builds the political foundation for stronger protections
