# Climate Science: Roadmap

## Implementation Strategy

Protecting climate science requires a phased approach that builds political support, enacts legal protections, and creates durable institutional structures. Each phase builds on the previous one, creating a progressively stronger defense against political interference with climate research.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)

### Objective

Build the political, legal, and organizational foundation for climate research protection.

### Key Actions

**Coalition Development**

- Assemble a broad coalition spanning scientific societies, environmental organizations, the insurance and financial sector, agricultural interests, military and national security voices, and local government leaders who depend on climate data
- Frame climate research protection as infrastructure, not ideology -- emphasize the practical economic value of climate data for weather forecasting, disaster preparedness, agriculture, insurance, and military planning
- Recruit Republican and conservative voices willing to support research protection while maintaining their preferred policy positions on emissions
- Engage professional scientific societies (AGU, AMS, AAAS) as institutional advocates

**Documentation and Evidence**

- Compile a comprehensive record of political interference with federal climate science across administrations
- Document the economic costs of research disruption: satellite delays, workforce attrition, data gaps, and damaged international collaborations
- Commission independent assessments of the gap between U.S. climate research capacity and the capacity of peer nations (EU, China, Japan)
- Publish case studies of how climate data disruptions affected specific economic sectors (agriculture, insurance, disaster response)

**Legal Groundwork**

- Draft model scientific integrity legislation with input from legal scholars, former agency officials, and scientific societies
- Identify constitutional authorities and legal precedents supporting research protection
- Analyze existing legislative vehicles (appropriations, authorization bills, COMPETES Act reauthorization) that could carry climate research provisions
- Prepare litigation strategies for challenging political interference with mandated research programs

**Public Engagement**

- Launch public education campaigns about the value of climate monitoring infrastructure
- Use local impacts (extreme weather, sea level rise, agricultural disruption) to connect climate research to constituent concerns
- Partner with broadcast meteorologists and local media to communicate the connection between climate research and daily weather services
- Develop educational materials for K-12 that explain how climate science works and why it matters

---

## Phase 2: Legislative Action (Years 2-4)

### Objective

Enact statutory protections for climate research funding, scientific integrity, and data preservation.

### Key Actions

**Climate Research Protection Act**

- Introduce and build support for legislation establishing protected funding floors for core climate monitoring programs
- Target attachment to must-pass legislation (appropriations, defense authorization, COMPETES reauthorization) if standalone bills face obstruction
- Build bipartisan cosponsor lists by emphasizing practical benefits: weather forecasting, agricultural planning, disaster preparedness
- Prepare fallback provisions (multi-year authorizations, automatic continuing resolutions) if full funding floors prove unachievable

**Climate Science Integrity Act**

- Introduce legislation codifying scientific integrity requirements across federal agencies
- Include whistleblower protections, anti-censorship provisions, and data preservation mandates
- Establish an independent Scientific Integrity Officer with fixed-term appointment and for-cause removal protection
- Link to existing oversight mechanisms (Inspector General, Government Accountability Office)

**Appropriations Strategy**

- Work with appropriations subcommittee staff to protect climate research line items in annual spending bills
- Develop bipartisan "Dear Colleague" letters highlighting the economic value of climate monitoring
- Prepare amendments blocking riders that would restrict climate research
- Ensure that appropriations reflect true costs of satellite programs, including lifecycle maintenance

**State-Level Action**

- Promote state legislation protecting state-level climate research programs (state climatologists, university climate centers)
- Support state data preservation laws requiring archiving of climate-relevant state records
- Build state-level coalitions to create a constituency for federal action
- Identify state attorneys general willing to defend climate research through litigation

---

## Phase 3: Institutional Reform (Years 4-8)

### Objective

Create durable institutional structures that insulate climate research from political cycles.

### Key Actions

**Independent Climate Research Governance**

- Establish an independent climate assessment body, structured like the Congressional Budget Office, with:
    - Bipartisan board of governors with staggered terms
    - Professional staff selected through merit-based processes
    - Statutory mandate to produce periodic climate assessments
    - Protection from political interference in findings and recommendations
- Transition the National Climate Assessment from an executive branch product to an independent assessment with statutory authority

**Research Infrastructure Investment**

- Secure multi-year appropriations for next-generation satellite programs (GeoXO, Earth System Observatory)
- Invest in dedicated supercomputing facilities for climate modeling
- Expand and modernize surface observation networks and ocean monitoring systems
- Establish endowment-style funding mechanisms for critical long-term monitoring programs

**Workforce Development**

- Create a Climate Science Service Corps modeled on the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, providing career stability and professional development for federal climate scientists
- Establish climate science fellowship programs to attract graduate students to federal service
- Implement competitive salary structures that reduce attrition to the private sector
- Create interagency mobility programs allowing scientists to move between agencies without losing seniority

**International Leadership**

- Strengthen U.S. commitments to international climate research programs (IPCC, WCRP, GCOS)
- Negotiate bilateral research agreements that create mutual dependencies, making withdrawal costly
- Position U.S. climate research leadership as a national security and diplomatic asset
- Ensure continuity of U.S. satellite data contributions to international programs

---

## Phase 4: Sustained Defense (Ongoing)

### Objective

Maintain protections against future attempts at interference and keep research capacity at the leading edge.

### Key Actions

- **Monitoring**: Establish permanent watchdog mechanisms to detect and report political interference with climate research
- **Legal defense**: Maintain litigation readiness to challenge violations of statutory research protections
- **Public accountability**: Publish annual scorecards on scientific integrity compliance across federal agencies
- **Technology upgrades**: Continuously invest in next-generation satellites, computing, and observational technology
- **Workforce renewal**: Maintain pipeline programs to replace retiring scientists and keep skills current
- **International engagement**: Sustain U.S. leadership in international climate research collaborations

| Budget sequestration or government shutdown disrupting programs | Medium | High | Protected funding floors; automatic continuing resolution provisions |
| Hostile administration undermining enacted protections | Medium | High | Statutory requirements with independent oversight; litigation strategies |
| Loss of key political champions | Medium | Medium | Build broad coalition so no single champion is indispensable |
| International competitors overtaking U.S. capability | Medium | Medium | Sustained infrastructure investment; competitive workforce policies |
