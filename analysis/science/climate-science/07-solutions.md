# Climate Science: Solutions

## Overview

Protecting climate science requires a multi-layered approach: legal protections that insulate research from political interference, stable funding mechanisms that survive administration changes, improved communication strategies, institutional reforms that depoliticize climate research, and sustained investment in research infrastructure. No single reform is sufficient; the opposition ecosystem described in [Opposition](06-opposition.md) requires a correspondingly comprehensive response.

## Solution 1: Protected Research Funding

### The Problem

Climate research funding is subject to annual appropriations politics, making it vulnerable to politically motivated cuts. Every administration skeptical of climate action has proposed significant reductions to climate research budgets, and while Congress has partially restored these cuts, the uncertainty itself damages research programs by disrupting long-term planning, delaying satellite missions, and driving talent away from government service.

### The Reform

Establish mandatory, protected funding floors for core climate monitoring and research programs, analogous to how the Federal Reserve or FDIC have funding mechanisms that are partially insulated from annual appropriations.

**Key elements**:

- **Statutory funding floors**: Mandate minimum annual appropriations for critical climate monitoring programs (satellite operations, surface observation networks, ocean monitoring systems, the Keeling Curve and similar long-term records)
- **Multi-year authorizations**: Authorize climate research programs in 5-year cycles, with automatic continuing resolutions at prior-year levels if new appropriations are not enacted
- **Dedicated funding stream**: Explore dedicated revenue sources (e.g., a small fee on fossil fuel extraction or a portion of offshore drilling royalties) to fund climate monitoring infrastructure
- **Capital planning**: Require 10-year capital plans for satellite programs to prevent the gaps in coverage that result from erratic budgeting

### Evidence

- The National Weather Service's protected funding for core weather observations provides a model for insulating monitoring programs from political cycles
- NOAA's satellite program has experienced costly delays due to budget uncertainty; the GAO estimated that JPSS procurement inefficiencies added billions in costs (GAO-13-676)
- The European Union's Copernicus program demonstrates how stable, multi-year funding produces superior Earth observation capabilities

### Trade-offs

| Benefit | Cost/Risk |
|---------|-----------|
| Stable research programs | Reduced congressional flexibility |
| Workforce retention | Potential for bureaucratic inertia |
| Better satellite continuity | Dedicated funding may compete with other priorities |
| International credibility | Funding floors may be set too low and become ceilings |

## Solution 2: Scientific Integrity Policies

### The Problem

Existing scientific integrity policies are executive branch policies that can be weakened or ignored by unsympathetic administrations. They lack statutory authority, independent enforcement mechanisms, and meaningful penalties for violations.

### The Reform

Codify scientific integrity protections into federal law, with independent oversight and enforcement mechanisms.

**Key elements**:

- **Statutory scientific integrity requirements**: Enact legislation requiring all federal agencies that conduct or fund scientific research to maintain scientific integrity policies with minimum standards
- **Independent Scientific Integrity Officer**: Establish a government-wide Scientific Integrity Officer, appointed for a fixed term and removable only for cause, with authority to investigate complaints and issue binding recommendations
- **Whistleblower protections**: Strengthen protections for federal scientists who report political interference with research
- **Anti-censorship provisions**: Prohibit agency leadership from preventing scientists from publishing peer-reviewed findings, presenting at conferences, or responding to media inquiries about their research
- **Data preservation requirements**: Mandate long-term preservation of climate data in formats accessible to the public, with redundant storage to prevent deliberate or accidental loss

### Evidence

- The Obama administration's 2009 Scientific Integrity Memorandum led to agency-level policies, but these proved insufficient when the Trump administration chose not to enforce them
- The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (5 U.S.C. 2302) provides some protections but does not specifically address scientific suppression
- Inspector General investigations have confirmed instances of political editing of scientific reports (CEQ editing under Philip Cooney, EPA testimony alterations)
- Canada's experience with "muzzling" federal scientists under the Harper government (2006-2015) and subsequent reforms provides relevant lessons

### Trade-offs

| Benefit | Cost/Risk |
|---------|-----------|
| Legal protection for scientists | May be difficult to enforce against determined opposition |
| Independent oversight | Adds bureaucratic layer |
| Deterrent effect against interference | Fixed-term appointments may not survive hostile administrations |
| Clear standards for all agencies | Definitions of "interference" may be contested |

## Solution 3: Improved Climate Communication

### The Problem

The gap between scientific consensus (97%+) and public perception of consensus (~67%) is one of the most consequential communication failures in modern science. This gap enables political exploitation and undermines support for research protection.

### The Reform

Invest in science communication infrastructure, training, and media literacy.

**Key elements**:

- **Scientist communication training**: Fund programs that train climate scientists in effective public communication, media engagement, and social media use, through agencies and professional societies
- **National Climate Information Service**: Expand NOAA's climate services to provide authoritative, accessible climate information tailored to different audiences (farmers, municipal planners, business leaders, the general public)
- **Media literacy initiatives**: Support media literacy education that helps the public evaluate scientific claims, identify disinformation, and understand the difference between genuine scientific debate and manufactured doubt
- **Consensus communication**: Invest in public awareness campaigns about the level of scientific agreement on climate change, since research by van der Linden et al. (2017) shows that communicating the consensus is one of the most effective ways to shift public opinion
- **Inoculation strategies**: Apply psychological research on "inoculation" -- pre-emptively exposing people to weakened forms of disinformation arguments to build resistance -- as demonstrated by Cook, Lewandowsky, and Ecker (2017)

### Evidence

- The "consensus gap" is strongly correlated with support for climate policy, suggesting that closing the gap would strengthen support for research protection (Ding et al., 2011)
- Yale's Six Americas research demonstrates that communication strategies must be tailored to different audience segments rather than one-size-fits-all messaging
- The American Meteorological Society's broadcast meteorologist outreach has demonstrated that trusted local communicators can effectively convey climate science

### Trade-offs

| Benefit | Cost/Risk |
|---------|-----------|
| Better public understanding | May be perceived as government propaganda |
| Reduced vulnerability to disinformation | Communication programs are politically vulnerable |
| Stronger base of support for research | Scientists may face more scrutiny and attacks |
| More informed policy debate | May further politicize the issue in the short term |

## Solution 4: Depoliticization Strategies

### The Problem

Climate science has become so thoroughly embedded in partisan identity that addressing it requires structural changes, not just better arguments. As long as climate is a proxy for the left-right political divide, research protections will be contested along partisan lines.

### The Reform

Adopt institutional designs and framing strategies that remove climate science from the partisan battlefield.

**Key elements**:

- **Independent climate research agency**: Consider establishing an independent federal climate research body -- analogous to the Federal Reserve for monetary policy or the Congressional Budget Office for fiscal analysis -- with statutory independence from political appointees. Such a body could produce climate assessments, manage long-term monitoring, and issue reports without requiring political approval.
- **Bipartisan governance**: Structure any independent body with bipartisan appointments, staggered terms, and protection against removal without cause
- **National security framing**: Continue and expand DOD's climate security assessments, since framing climate change as a threat to military readiness and national security has proven effective at creating bipartisan support
- **Economic framing**: Emphasize the economic value of climate data -- for agriculture, disaster preparedness, insurance, energy planning, and supply chain management -- rather than focusing exclusively on environmental arguments
- **Separate science from policy**: Institutionally and rhetorically separate the question "what is the climate doing?" (science) from "what should we do about it?" (policy), so that supporting research does not require endorsing specific policy prescriptions

### Evidence

- The Congressional Budget Office model demonstrates that an independent analytical body can produce trusted information even on contentious topics
- DOD's climate security framing has generated more bipartisan acceptance than environmental framing (CNA Military Advisory Board reports, 2007-2020)
- The Federal Reserve's structural independence, while imperfect, has largely insulated monetary policy from short-term political pressures

### Trade-offs

| Benefit | Cost/Risk |
|---------|-----------|
| Structural insulation from politics | Risk of democratic accountability deficit |
| Bipartisan credibility | Independence can be eroded over time |
| Sustained research continuity | New agency may face startup challenges |
| Clear separation of science and policy | True separation is difficult in practice |

## Solution 5: Research Infrastructure Investment

### The Problem

U.S. climate research infrastructure -- satellites, computing, observational networks, and workforce -- requires sustained investment. Budget volatility leads to gaps in satellite coverage, outdated computing, and workforce attrition that undermine research quality and U.S. scientific leadership.

### The Reform

Make strategic, long-term investments in the physical and human infrastructure of climate research.

**Key elements**:

- **Satellite continuity**: Fund next-generation Earth observation satellites on schedules that ensure no gaps in critical data records (sea level, ice sheets, atmospheric composition, radiation budget)
- **Computing capacity**: Invest in dedicated supercomputing facilities for climate modeling to keep pace with European and Chinese competitors
- **Observational networks**: Maintain and expand surface observation stations, ocean buoys (Argo floats), and atmospheric monitoring sites, with particular attention to data-sparse regions
- **Workforce development**: Establish fellowship and loan-forgiveness programs to attract and retain climate scientists in federal service; ensure competitive salaries relative to the private sector
- **Data management**: Invest in modern data infrastructure for archiving, distributing, and making accessible the enormous volumes of climate data produced by federal programs

### Evidence

- The GAO has repeatedly identified satellite program delays as a major risk to weather and climate data continuity (GAO-16-773, GAO-19-515)
- European climate models have outperformed U.S. models in some recent comparisons, in part due to more consistent computing investments
- The Argo float network (3,800+ autonomous ocean profilers) has been called one of the most successful international scientific collaborations, but sustaining it requires ongoing investment

### Trade-offs

| Benefit | Cost/Risk |
|---------|-----------|
| Maintained scientific leadership | Significant upfront costs |
| No data gaps in critical records | Competes with other science priorities |
| Competitive workforce | Private sector may still outcompete on compensation |
| Better climate projections | Infrastructure investments have long lead times |
