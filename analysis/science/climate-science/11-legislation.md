# Climate Science: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Protecting climate science from political interference requires legislation at multiple levels. This document provides draft legal text for two federal bills: the **Climate Research Protection Act**, which establishes protected funding for climate monitoring and mandates the National Climate Assessment cycle; and the **Climate Science Integrity Act**, which codifies scientific integrity protections, whistleblower safeguards, and data preservation requirements. Together, these bills create a legal framework that insulates climate research from the episodic political interference documented in [History](03-history.md) and [Current State](02-current-state.md).

## Federal Legislation

### Climate Research Protection Act

**Purpose**: Establish protected, stable funding for core federal climate monitoring programs; prohibit political interference in the production and communication of climate research findings; and mandate a regular cycle for the National Climate Assessment.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Climate Research Protection Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Federal climate monitoring and research programs provide
    essential data for weather forecasting, agricultural planning,
    disaster preparedness, national security, and economic
    decision-making.
(2) The United States operates the world's most extensive
    network of climate monitoring satellites, surface observation
    stations, and ocean monitoring systems.
(3) Political interference with the communication of climate
    research findings, and episodic budget volatility, have
    damaged the continuity and credibility of federal climate
    programs.
(4) Long-term climate monitoring records, some spanning more
    than six decades, are irreplaceable national assets that
    require sustained and stable investment.
(5) Disruptions to satellite programs caused by inconsistent
    funding have resulted in billions of dollars in unnecessary
    costs and data gaps that compromise weather and climate
    services.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(a) COVERED AGENCY.--The term "covered agency" means the
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Energy,
    the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection
    Agency, the Department of Agriculture, and any other agency
    participating in the United States Global Change Research
    Program.
(b) CLIMATE MONITORING PROGRAM.--The term "climate monitoring
    program" means any program operated by a covered agency for
    the purpose of systematically collecting, archiving, or
    analyzing data related to the Earth's atmosphere, oceans,
    cryosphere, land surface, or biosphere for the purpose of
    understanding climate variability and change.
(c) CLIMATE RESEARCH.--The term "climate research" means
    scientific investigation conducted or funded by a covered
    agency relating to the causes, mechanisms, impacts, or
    projections of climate variability and change.
(d) NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT.--The term "National Climate
    Assessment" means the assessment required under section 106
    of the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (15 U.S.C. 2936).

SEC. 4. PROTECTED FUNDING FOR CLIMATE MONITORING.

(a) IN GENERAL.--For each fiscal year, total appropriations for
    climate monitoring programs across all covered agencies shall
    not be less than the amount appropriated for such programs in
    the fiscal year preceding the date of enactment of this Act,
    adjusted annually for inflation as measured by the Consumer
    Price Index for All Urban Consumers.
(b) SATELLITE CONTINUITY.--
    (1) The Administrator of the National Oceanic and
        Atmospheric Administration and the Administrator of the
        National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall each
        maintain a 10-year capital investment plan for Earth
        observation satellite programs, updated biennially.
    (2) Such plans shall ensure no planned gaps in coverage for
        essential climate variables as defined by the Global
        Climate Observing System.
    (3) Satellite program budgets shall include full lifecycle
        costs, including development, launch, operations, and
        data management.
(c) LONG-TERM MONITORING CONTINUITY.--No covered agency shall
    discontinue a climate monitoring record that has been
    maintained for 20 or more consecutive years without--
    (1) conducting an impact assessment identifying the
        scientific and operational consequences of discontinuation;
    (2) providing public notice and a 180-day comment period;
        and
    (3) certifying to the appropriate congressional committees
        that equivalent or superior monitoring capability will be
        maintained through alternative means.

SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON POLITICAL INTERFERENCE.

(a) IN GENERAL.--No officer or employee of the United States
    shall--
    (1) direct, instruct, or coerce a Federal scientist to
        alter, suppress, or delay the publication of scientific
        findings produced through climate research;
    (2) alter the substance or conclusions of a scientific
        report, assessment, or publication produced through
        climate research without the written consent of the
        lead author or principal investigator;

    (5) retaliate against a Federal scientist for communicating
        climate research findings through authorized channels.
(b) SCIENTIFIC REVIEW.--Nothing in this section shall be
    construed to prohibit--
    (1) peer review of scientific work by qualified scientists;
    (2) editorial review for factual accuracy by scientific
        supervisors;
    (3) coordination of agency communications for logistical
        purposes, provided such coordination does not alter
        scientific content or unreasonably delay communication; or
    (4) classification of information that is properly
        classified under Executive Order or statute.
(c) ENFORCEMENT.--
    (1) Any Federal scientist who believes that a violation
        of subsection (a) has occurred may file a complaint with
        the Inspector General of the relevant covered agency.
    (2) The Inspector General shall investigate all complaints
        filed under this subsection within 90 days and issue
        findings.
    (3) Any officer or employee found to have violated
        subsection (a) shall be subject to disciplinary action
        up to and including removal from Federal service.
    (4) Remedies for affected scientists shall include
        restoration of suppressed publications, correction of
        altered reports, and appropriate compensatory relief.

SEC. 6. NATIONAL CLIMATE ASSESSMENT CYCLE.

(a) MANDATORY CYCLE.--The National Climate Assessment required
    under section 106 of the Global Change Research Act of 1990
    shall be produced and publicly released not less frequently
    than once every 4 years.
(b) INDEPENDENCE OF FINDINGS.--
    (1) The content and conclusions of the National Climate
        Assessment shall be determined solely by the scientific
        authors and reviewers.
    (2) No officer or employee of the Executive Office of the
        President shall direct or require changes to the
        scientific content of the Assessment prior to release.
    (3) The Assessment shall undergo external peer review by
        the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
        Medicine.
(c) PUBLIC RELEASE.--
    (1) The National Climate Assessment shall be released
        publicly within 60 days of completion of peer review.
    (2) No covered agency or Executive Office of the President
        shall delay the release of the Assessment for political
        or communications purposes.
(d) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.--There is authorized to be
    appropriated $30,000,000 for each fiscal year for the
    production of the National Climate Assessment.

SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this
    Act, and annually thereafter, each covered agency shall
    submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report
    describing--
    (1) total expenditures on climate monitoring programs;
    (2) the status of satellite programs and any anticipated
        gaps in coverage;
    (3) compliance with the anti-interference provisions of
        section 5; and
    (4) any complaints filed under section 5(c) and their
        disposition.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** creates a funding floor tied to inflation, preventing the real-value erosion that occurs when programs are held at nominal levels. The satellite continuity provisions address the pattern of costly delays caused by budget volatility.
- **Section 5** prohibits the specific forms of political interference documented in the historical record: editing reports, restricting media communication, requiring political pre-approval, and retaliating against scientists. The carve-outs in subsection (b) preserve legitimate scientific review while prohibiting political interference.
- **Section 6** strengthens the existing NCA mandate by specifying a 4-year cycle, prohibiting political editing, requiring NAS peer review, and setting a deadline for public release. This addresses the pattern of delayed releases timed to minimize media coverage.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Constitutional: Congress cannot bind future Congresses on appropriations | Funding floor is a statutory baseline, not an absolute mandate; Congress can amend or repeal |
| Political: "government science spending mandates" framing | Frame as infrastructure protection, like weather service funding |
| Administrative: defining "political interference" vs. legitimate oversight | Section 5(b) carve-outs address this; IG investigation provides case-by-case adjudication |
| Practical: enforcement during hostile administrations | IG independence and congressional reporting provide oversight mechanisms |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Create an independent Climate Monitoring Board with direct hiring authority and budget autonomy
- **Fallback version**: Apply anti-interference provisions to the National Climate Assessment only, as the most politically visible product
- **Bipartisan addition**: Include provisions supporting weather forecasting and agricultural research to broaden the coalition

---

### Climate Science Integrity Act

**Purpose**: Establish comprehensive protections for climate scientists, including whistleblower safeguards, anti-censorship provisions, and data preservation requirements.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Climate Science Integrity Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Federal scientists have reported instances of political
    interference with their research, including censorship of
    findings, restrictions on communication, and retaliation
    for publishing inconvenient results.
(2) Self-censorship among Federal climate scientists is
    widespread and undermines the quality and completeness of
    scientific advice available to policymakers and the public.
(3) Long-term climate data records are irreplaceable national
    assets that must be preserved regardless of changes in
    political priorities.
(4) Public trust in Federal science depends on the perceived
    and actual independence of scientific findings from
    political influence.
(5) Existing whistleblower protections do not adequately
    address the specific forms of interference experienced
    by Federal scientists conducting climate research.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(a) COVERED AGENCY.--The term "covered agency" has the meaning
    given such term in section 3(a) of the Climate Research
    Protection Act.

    policy" means a written policy adopted by a covered agency
    that establishes standards and procedures for protecting the
    integrity of scientific research conducted or funded by the
    agency.
(d) CLIMATE DATA RECORD.--The term "climate data record" means
    any systematically collected dataset maintained by a covered
    agency for the purpose of monitoring climate variables over
    time, including but not limited to temperature, precipitation,
    atmospheric composition, sea level, ice extent, and ocean
    conditions.

SEC. 4. SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY POLICIES.

(a) REQUIREMENT.--Not later than 1 year after the date of
    enactment of this Act, each covered agency shall adopt or
    update a scientific integrity policy that meets the minimum
    standards established in this section.
(b) MINIMUM STANDARDS.--Each scientific integrity policy shall
    include provisions that--
    (1) prohibit political interference with the design,
        conduct, or reporting of scientific research;
    (2) guarantee Federal scientists the right to publish
        research findings in peer-reviewed journals, present

        inquiries about their research;
    (3) establish clear procedures for resolving disputes
        between scientists and agency leadership about the
        communication of research findings;
    (4) prohibit retaliation against Federal scientists for
        exercising their rights under the policy;
    (5) require that any agency review of scientific
        publications or communications be conducted by
        qualified scientists, not political appointees; and
    (6) require that scientific advisory committees be composed
        of members selected on the basis of scientific
        expertise, with conflicts of interest publicly
        disclosed.
(c) SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY OFFICER.--
    (1) Each covered agency shall designate a Scientific
        Integrity Officer who--
        (A) shall be a career Federal employee or career
            appointee, not a political appointee;
        (B) shall have demonstrated scientific expertise
            relevant to the agency's mission;
        (C) shall be removable only for cause; and
        (D) shall report directly to the agency head.
    (2) The Scientific Integrity Officer shall--
        (A) receive and investigate complaints of violations
            of the scientific integrity policy;
        (B) issue findings and recommendations within 120
            days of receiving a complaint;
        (C) publish an annual report summarizing complaints,
            investigations, and outcomes; and
        (D) coordinate with the agency Inspector General on
            matters involving potential criminal conduct or
            gross mismanagement.

SEC. 5. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS FOR CLIMATE SCIENTISTS.

(a) PROTECTED DISCLOSURES.--In addition to protections provided
    under the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012,
    a Federal scientist shall not be subject to any personnel
    action for--
    (1) disclosing to the Scientific Integrity Officer,
        Inspector General, Congress, or the public information
        that the scientist reasonably believes demonstrates
        political interference with scientific research;
    (2) refusing to alter, suppress, or delay scientific
        findings at the direction of a political appointee;
    (3) communicating scientific findings through peer-reviewed
        publications, professional conferences, or authorized
        media channels; or
    (4) cooperating with congressional investigations or
        Inspector General inquiries regarding scientific
        integrity.
(b) BURDEN OF PROOF.--In any proceeding arising from an alleged
    violation of subsection (a), the burden of proof shall be on
    the agency to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence
    that the personnel action would have been taken in the
    absence of the protected disclosure.
(c) REMEDIES.--A Federal scientist who prevails in a proceeding
    under this section shall be entitled to--
    (1) reinstatement to the position held before the
        personnel action, or to an equivalent position;
    (2) back pay and benefits;
    (3) compensatory damages;
    (4) reasonable attorney's fees and costs; and
    (5) any other relief necessary to make the employee
        whole.
(d) ANTI-RETALIATION.--For purposes of this section, personnel
    actions include but are not limited to termination, demotion,
    suspension, reassignment to duties not commensurate with the
    scientist's qualifications, reduction in grade or pay,
    denial of promotion, and any other significant change in
    duties or working conditions.

SEC. 6. ANTI-CENSORSHIP PROVISIONS.

(a) RIGHT TO COMMUNICATE.--
    (1) A Federal scientist shall have the right to
        communicate scientific findings to the public, media,
        and Congress, provided that the scientist clearly
        distinguishes between findings based on research and
        personal opinions on policy matters.
    (2) No covered agency shall require a Federal scientist
        to obtain approval from a political appointee before--
        (A) publishing in a peer-reviewed journal;
        (B) presenting at a scientific conference;
        (C) responding to media inquiries about published
            research; or
        (D) providing information requested by a member of
            Congress.
(b) WEBSITE AND PUBLIC INFORMATION.--
    (1) No covered agency shall remove, alter, or archive
        scientific information from its public-facing websites
        or publications for political or ideological reasons.
    (2) Any removal or alteration of scientific content from
        agency websites must be--
        (A) based on scientific grounds documented in writing;
        (B) approved by the agency's Scientific Integrity
            Officer; and
        (C) reported to the appropriate congressional
            committees within 30 days.
(c) TERMINOLOGY.--No covered agency shall direct or instruct
    Federal scientists or other agency employees to avoid using
    scientifically accepted terminology in official
    communications, reports, or publications.

SEC. 7. DATA PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS.

(a) PRESERVATION MANDATE.--
    (1) Each covered agency shall preserve all climate data
        records in perpetuity, in formats that are publicly
        accessible and machine-readable.
    (2) Climate data records shall be stored in at least three
        geographically distributed locations, including at least
        one location maintained by an entity independent of the
        Executive Branch.
(b) NATIONAL CLIMATE DATA ARCHIVE.--
    (1) The Administrator of the National Oceanic and
        Atmospheric Administration, in coordination with the
        National Archives and Records Administration, shall
        establish and maintain a National Climate Data Archive.
    (2) The Archive shall include all climate data records
        produced by covered agencies, with metadata sufficient
        to allow independent verification and analysis.
    (3) The Archive shall be publicly accessible through a
        centralized online portal at no charge to users.
(c) PROHIBITION ON DESTRUCTION.--
    (1) No officer or employee of the United States shall
        destroy, alter, or render inaccessible any climate data
        record except as part of a documented, scientifically
        justified data management process approved by the
        agency's Scientific Integrity Officer.
    (2) Any intentional destruction or alteration of climate
        data records in violation of this subsection shall be
        subject to criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 2071
        (concealment, removal, or mutilation of public records).
(d) ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS.--Covered agencies are authorized to
    enter into cooperative agreements with academic institutions
    for the purpose of creating redundant copies of climate data
    records.

SEC. 8. REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.--Not later than March 1 of each year, the
    Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy
    shall submit to Congress a report including--
    (1) the status of scientific integrity policies at each
        covered agency;
    (2) a summary of complaints filed with Scientific
        Integrity Officers and their disposition;
    (3) the status of climate data preservation efforts; and
    (4) any recommendations for strengthening scientific
        integrity protections.
(b) GAO REVIEW.--The Comptroller General shall conduct a review
    of the implementation of this Act not later than 3 years
    after the date of enactment, and every 5 years thereafter.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated--
(a) $10,000,000 for each fiscal year for the establishment and
    operation of Scientific Integrity Officers across covered
    agencies;
(b) $25,000,000 for each fiscal year for the establishment and
    maintenance of the National Climate Data Archive; and
(c) such sums as may be necessary for the implementation of
    other provisions of this Act.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 1 year after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** codifies what are currently executive branch policies into statute, making them harder to weaken or ignore. The Scientific Integrity Officer provisions create independent enforcement mechanisms within each agency.
- **Section 5** extends whistleblower protections to address the specific forms of retaliation that climate scientists have experienced: reassignment, communication restrictions, and career damage. The burden-of-proof provision (clear and convincing evidence) provides strong protection.
- **Section 6** directly addresses the documented patterns of censorship: website scrubbing, terminology restrictions, and political pre-approval requirements for communications.
- **Section 7** addresses data preservation concerns that arose during the 2017-2020 period, when academic institutions scrambled to archive federal climate data. The triple-redundancy requirement and independent storage provision ensure no single administration can destroy long-term climate records.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| First Amendment concerns about government speech | Government speech doctrine gives agencies broad discretion, but statute can require agencies to maintain scientific content |
| Enforcement during hostile administrations | IG independence, congressional reporting, and private right of action provide multiple enforcement paths |
| Cost of data preservation | $25M/year is modest relative to the value of irreplaceable decades-long records |
| "Unfireable scientists" objection | Protections are against retaliation for protected disclosures, not against performance-based actions |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Create a private right of action allowing scientists to sue directly in federal court for violations
- **Fallback version**: Apply protections only to scientists working on mandated assessments (NCA) or operating monitoring systems
- **Bipartisan addition**: Include provisions protecting all federal scientists, not just climate scientists, to broaden the coalition

---

## State Model Legislation

### State Climate Data Preservation Act

**Purpose**: Ensure state-level climate data is preserved and accessible, providing redundancy for federal records and protecting state climate research programs.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Climate Data Preservation
Act".

SECTION 2. STATE CLIMATE DATA ARCHIVE.

(a) The [State Science Agency/University System] shall establish
    and maintain a State Climate Data Archive containing--
    (1) all climate monitoring data collected by state agencies;
    (2) copies of federal climate data records relevant to
        [State]; and
    (3) climate-relevant data from state-funded research.
(b) The Archive shall be publicly accessible through an online
    portal at no charge.

SECTION 3. STATE CLIMATOLOGIST.

(a) The [Governor/University System] shall maintain a State
    Climatologist position, filled by an individual with
    appropriate scientific credentials.
(b) The State Climatologist shall have the right to communicate
    scientific findings without political pre-approval.
(c) The State Climatologist may not be terminated or reassigned
    for communicating scientific findings.

SECTION 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect upon passage and signature.
```

**Adaptations**: States may adjust the institutional home (university system vs. state agency), funding mechanisms, and scope based on local conditions and existing infrastructure.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### OSTP Scientific Integrity Directive

**Existing Authority**: The Office of Science and Technology Policy has authority under 42 U.S.C. 6614 to coordinate federal science policy.

**Draft Regulation**: OSTP should issue a government-wide directive establishing minimum standards for scientific integrity policies that:

- Apply to all agencies that conduct or fund scientific research
- Require career (not political) appointees to serve as Scientific Integrity Officers
- Establish standardized complaint and investigation procedures
- Require public annual reporting on integrity complaints and outcomes
- Define prohibited forms of political interference with specificity

**Explanation**: While legislation provides the strongest protection, an OSTP directive can be implemented immediately and establish norms that legislation can later codify.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Appropriations Power**: Congress has broad authority to set conditions on the expenditure of funds, including requirements for how research findings are communicated
- **Government Speech**: Under *Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans* (2015), the government has discretion over its own speech, but Congress can direct how agencies communicate scientific findings
- **First Amendment**: Federal employees retain some First Amendment rights, particularly when speaking as citizens on matters of public concern (*Pickering v. Board of Education*, 391 U.S. 563 (1968)), though the scope of protection within employment duties is limited by *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, 547 U.S. 410 (2006)

### Preemption Questions

- Federal legislation would preempt state laws that conflict with federal scientific integrity requirements
- State data preservation laws would supplement, not conflict with, federal requirements
- No significant preemption issues are anticipated

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- Inspector General investigations under existing IG authority
- Scientific Integrity Officer investigations under new statutory authority
- Congressional oversight through reporting requirements
- Private litigation by affected scientists through whistleblower provisions
- GAO audits and reviews

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- GAO review at 3 years and every 5 years thereafter
- Annual reporting requirements provide continuous oversight
- No sunset provision recommended -- protections should be permanent, though Congress can amend as needed

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Climate Research Protection Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Budget reclassification | Agencies could reclassify programs to move them outside "climate monitoring" definitions | High |
| Inflation-only floor | Funding floor tied to inflation may not keep pace with actual research costs, especially for satellite programs | Medium |
| Legitimate review pretexts | Political appointees could use "editorial review" or "coordination" exceptions to delay publications indefinitely | High |
| Assessment delay tactics | Administration could starve NCA of resources or appoint obstructive personnel without technically violating the statute | Medium |
| Contractor exclusion | Protections for "Federal scientists" may not cover contractors who perform significant research | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No private right of action | Scientists must rely on IG and internal processes that may be slow or compromised | Political feasibility -- private lawsuits seen as too aggressive |
| Funding floor only protects against cuts | Does not address the need for increased investment to maintain competitiveness | Binding future appropriations is constitutionally constrained |
| Limited scope to climate science | Does not protect other areas of science from political interference | Narrower scope improves political viability but leaves gaps |
| IG independence varies | Inspector General effectiveness depends on individual appointees | IG independence is a broader governance challenge |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Budget reclassification**: Add a provision requiring OMB to report annually on all agency spending that was classified as climate monitoring in FY [base year], preventing quiet reclassification
2. **Inflation adjustment**: Tie the floor to a research-specific cost index (e.g., the BRDPI -- Biomedical Research and Development Price Index -- or a custom science cost index) rather than CPI
3. **Legitimate review abuse**: Add a 30-day time limit on agency review of scientific publications, with automatic approval if the deadline passes without action
4. **Contractor protections**: Extend key protections to contractors and grantees whose primary duties involve climate research
5. **Assessment resources**: Specify minimum staffing levels and dedicated funding for the NCA production team

### Climate Science Integrity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Hostile SIO appointment | Despite "career employee" requirement, an agency could appoint a career employee unsympathetic to the mission | Medium |
| Slow-walking investigations | SIO could technically comply while conducting ineffective investigations | Medium |
| Definition gaming | Agencies could argue that certain activities are not "scientific research" and thus not covered | Medium |
| Data format loophole | Technically preserving data in inaccessible formats satisfies the letter but not the spirit | Low |
| Chilling effects from FOIA exposure | Scientists may self-censor knowing their communications could be obtained through FOIA requests by hostile actors | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No criminal penalties for interference | Political interference carries only administrative consequences | Political feasibility constraints |
| Garcetti limitation | Supreme Court precedent limits First Amendment protection for government employees speaking in their official capacity | Constitutional doctrine |
| Cultural change required | Laws alone cannot create a culture of scientific integrity; institutional norms must also shift | Cultural factors beyond legislative reach |
| Resource constraints | Enforcement mechanisms require funding that may be cut by hostile appropriators | Same vulnerability as the programs being protected |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **SIO selection**: Require SIO selection from a shortlist provided by relevant professional scientific societies (AGU, AMS, AAAS)
2. **Investigation standards**: Establish specific investigation procedures and timelines, with escalation to IG if SIO fails to act
3. **Broad definitions**: Define "scientific research" expansively to include data collection, analysis, modeling, assessment, and communication
4. **Data accessibility**: Require machine-readable, open-format data with public APIs, not just "preservation"
5. **FOIA balance**: Establish deliberative process protections for pre-publication scientific communications, similar to attorney-client privilege, to prevent weaponized FOIA requests

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Hostile administration non-enforcement | Congressional standing to sue for enforcement; automatic triggers for GAO review when complaints are not investigated |
| Cross-agency coordination gaps | Designate OSTP as coordinating body with authority to establish common standards |
| Private sector scientific integrity | Extend disclosure requirements to industry-funded research that seeks to influence federal policy |
| International coordination disruption | Include treaty-like provisions making withdrawal from international research programs require congressional approval |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- GAO shall conduct comprehensive reviews of both Acts at 3-year and 5-year intervals
- Annual reporting requirements serve as continuous monitoring
- Scientific Integrity Officers shall submit annual public reports
- Congress should hold oversight hearings on implementation within 2 years of enactment
