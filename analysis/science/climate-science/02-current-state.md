# Climate Science: Current State

## Federal Climate Research Budgets

### Overview of Federal Spending

The U.S. government funds climate research through multiple agencies, each with distinct mandates. The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) coordinates climate science across 14 federal agencies, though significant research also occurs outside the USGCRP framework.

| Agency | Primary Climate Mission | FY 2025 Est. Climate Budget |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| NASA | Earth observation, satellite monitoring, climate modeling | ~$2.2 billion (Earth Science Division) |
| NOAA | Climate monitoring, weather/climate prediction, ocean science | ~$600 million (climate-specific) |
| DOE | Energy-climate interactions, carbon cycle, climate modeling | ~$800 million (Office of Science, climate-related) |
| NSF | Fundamental climate research, polar programs, geosciences | ~$1.1 billion (Geosciences Directorate) |
| EPA | Climate impacts on health and environment, emissions data | ~$100 million (climate research programs) |
| USDA | Agricultural climate impacts, carbon sequestration research | ~$150 million (climate-related research) |
| DOD | Climate security assessments, operational impacts | ~$200 million (climate-related research) |

**Total estimated federal climate research investment**: Approximately $5 billion annually across all agencies, though precise figures depend on how "climate research" is defined and categorized.

### Budget Trends

Federal climate research funding has experienced significant volatility:

- **2009-2016**: Steady growth under the Obama administration, with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act providing additional one-time research funds
- **2017-2020**: Repeated proposed cuts of 20-30% to climate programs, partially restored by Congress through the appropriations process
- **2021-2024**: Significant increases under the Biden administration, including Inflation Reduction Act investments in climate data and modeling
- **2025-present**: Renewed uncertainty as budget proposals target climate-specific programs

### NASA Earth Science

NASA operates the most comprehensive space-based Earth observation system in the world:

- **Budget**: The Earth Science Division received approximately $2.2 billion in FY 2025, representing about 30% of NASA's Science Mission Directorate
- **Missions**: Over 25 active Earth-observing missions, including key climate satellites
- **Data**: NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) distributes approximately 50 terabytes of Earth science data daily
- **Vulnerability**: Earth science has repeatedly been targeted for cuts under the rationale that it falls outside NASA's "core mission" of space exploration

### NOAA Climate Programs

NOAA serves as the primary federal agency for weather and climate services:

- **Climate Monitoring**: Operates surface observation networks, weather balloons, ocean buoys, and satellite systems
- **Climate Prediction Center**: Provides seasonal outlooks and El Nino/La Nina forecasts
- **National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)**: Maintains the world's largest archive of weather and climate data
- **Recurring tension**: NOAA's dual role as a scientific agency and a service provider creates competing budget priorities between research and operations

### DOE National Laboratories

The Department of Energy's national laboratory system contributes significantly to climate science:

- **Climate modeling**: Los Alamos, Argonne, Oak Ridge, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories run some of the world's most advanced climate models
- **Carbon science**: DOE funds extensive research on the carbon cycle, carbon capture, and energy-climate interactions
- **Computing**: DOE supercomputers provide critical computing capacity for high-resolution climate simulations
- **Energy Systems Integration**: Research on how climate change affects energy production and demand

### NSF Geosciences

The National Science Foundation funds fundamental research through competitive grants:

- **Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences**: Upper atmosphere, weather, and climate research
- **Earth Sciences**: Geological processes relevant to climate
- **Ocean Sciences**: Ocean circulation, marine ecosystems, ocean-atmosphere interactions
- **Polar Programs**: Arctic and Antarctic research, ice sheet monitoring
- **Strength**: NSF's peer-review process provides relatively strong insulation from political interference in research selection

## National Climate Assessment

### Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5)

The most recent National Climate Assessment was released in November 2023:

- **Mandate**: Required by the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (15 U.S.C. 2921-2961), produced approximately every four years
- **Scope**: Comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts across the United States, organized by region and sector
- **Key findings**:
    - Every region of the United States is experiencing climate change impacts
    - Climate-related extreme events (heat waves, hurricanes, flooding, wildfire) are increasing in frequency and intensity
    - Communities of color, low-income populations, and Indigenous peoples face disproportionate climate risks
    - Rapid emissions reductions can substantially limit future warming and impacts
- **Political sensitivity**: Previous NCAs have faced political pressure to downplay findings or delay release
- **Production process**: Authored by hundreds of scientists across federal agencies and academia, subject to extensive peer review and public comment

### Assessment History and Political Challenges

| Assessment | Release Year | Political Context |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| NCA1 | 2000 | Released during Clinton-Bush transition |
| NCA2 | 2009 | Released early in Obama administration |
| NCA3 | 2014 | Released with Obama administration support |
| NCA4 (Vol. II) | 2018 | Released day after Thanksgiving; administration distanced itself from findings |
| NCA5 | 2023 | Released with Biden administration support |

## Satellite Monitoring Programs

### Current Satellite Constellation

The United States maintains a critical constellation of Earth-observing satellites:

**NOAA Operational Satellites:**

- **GOES (Geostationary)**: GOES-16, GOES-17, GOES-18 provide continuous Western Hemisphere monitoring
- **JPSS (Polar-orbiting)**: JPSS-1 (NOAA-20) and JPSS-2 (NOAA-21) provide global coverage; JPSS-3 and JPSS-4 in development
- **DSCOVR**: Deep Space Climate Observatory at L1 Lagrange point, monitoring solar wind and Earth's radiance

**NASA Climate Missions:**

- **Aqua**: Ocean, atmosphere, and land surface observations (operating since 2002, nearing end of life)
- **Terra**: Land, atmosphere, and ocean interactions (operating since 1999, nearing end of life)
- **ICESat-2**: Ice sheet elevation measurements
- **GRACE-FO**: Gravity measurements tracking groundwater and ice mass changes
- **Landsat 9**: Land surface change detection (joint with USGS)
- **Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich**: Sea level measurement (joint with ESA)
- **PACE**: Phytoplankton, aerosol, cloud, ocean ecosystem observations (launched February 2024)
- **NISAR**: Radar mission for surface deformation and ecosystem change (joint with ISRO, launched 2024)

### Continuity Concerns

- **Aging fleet**: Several critical satellites are operating well beyond design life
- **Gaps in coverage**: Delays in successor missions risk data continuity gaps, particularly for long-term climate records
- **Budget pressure**: Earth science missions compete with planetary science and human spaceflight for NASA funding
- **International dependence**: Some measurements increasingly rely on European (Copernicus/Sentinel) and Japanese satellite programs

### Next-Generation Systems

| Program | Agency | Status | Purpose |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| GeoXO | NOAA | Development | Next-gen geostationary monitoring (2032+ launch) |
| JPSS-3/4 | NOAA | Development | Continuity polar-orbiting observations |
| Earth System Observatory | NASA | Development | Multi-mission Earth observation system |
| Libera | NASA | Development | Earth's radiation budget measurements |

## Climate Modeling

### State of the Art

Climate modeling has advanced substantially in recent decades:

- **Resolution**: Leading models now operate at 25-50 km grid spacing, compared to 500 km in early models
- **Complexity**: Modern Earth system models incorporate atmosphere, ocean, land surface, ice sheets, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem dynamics
- **Ensemble approaches**: Multiple model runs with varied initial conditions provide probability distributions rather than single forecasts
- **Computational demands**: A single century-long climate simulation can require millions of computing hours

### U.S. Modeling Centers

| Center | Institution | Primary Model |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| GFDL | NOAA/Princeton | CM4, ESM4 |
| NCAR | NSF/University consortium | CESM |
| GISS | NASA Goddard | ModelE |
| DOE Labs | Multiple national laboratories | E3SM |

### Challenges

- **Computing infrastructure**: U.S. climate modeling centers compete for supercomputing time with other scientific priorities
- **European competition**: The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and other international centers have invested more consistently in modeling infrastructure
- **Workforce**: Training and retaining climate modelers requires sustained investment in graduate programs and competitive salaries
- **Communication**: Translating model outputs into actionable information for policymakers and the public remains difficult

## Research Suppression Concerns

### Historical Episodes

Political interference with climate science has occurred across multiple administrations, but certain periods stand out:

**2001-2008 (Bush Administration):**

- White House Council on Environmental Quality edited climate reports to insert uncertainty language
- NASA scientist James Hansen reported restrictions on media communications about climate findings
- EPA's 2003 State of the Environment report dropped the climate change section under White House pressure
- Philip Cooney, a former American Petroleum Institute lobbyist serving as CEQ chief of staff, edited climate reports before publication

**2017-2020 (Trump Administration):**

- EPA removed climate change information from its website
- USDA instructed staff to avoid the term "climate change" in favor of "weather extremes"
- Multiple agencies restricted scientists' ability to attend conferences, publish findings, or communicate with media
- EPA disbanded its Office of the Science Advisor
- Political appointees sought to block or delay the Fourth National Climate Assessment
- Proposed budget cuts of 20-30% to climate research programs at NOAA, NASA, and EPA (partially restored by Congress)

**2025-Present:**

- Renewed concerns about potential interference with climate programs
- Federal scientific workforce facing uncertainty about research priorities and communication freedom
- Budget proposals targeting climate-specific programs and terminology

### Scientific Integrity Policy Status

As of early 2026, the state of scientific integrity protections varies across agencies:

| Agency | Scientific Integrity Policy | Independent Officer | Effectiveness |
|--------|---------------------------|--------------------|-|
| NASA | Adopted 2011, updated 2022 | Yes | Generally strong, but relies on administration support |
| NOAA | Adopted 2011, updated 2021 | Yes | Effective when enforced; vulnerable to political pressure |
| EPA | Adopted 2012, strengthened 2022 | Yes | Subject to significant weakening under skeptical administrations |
| DOE | Adopted 2013, updated 2022 | Yes | Moderate; national labs have some institutional independence |
| NSF | Peer review process provides structural protection | N/A | Strong structural protections; less dependent on policy |

### Current Concerns

- **Self-censorship**: Surveys of federal scientists report widespread self-censorship on politically sensitive topics, even absent explicit directives
- **Workforce morale**: Uncertainty about political support affects recruitment and retention of climate scientists
- **Data preservation**: Concerns about the security of long-term climate data records led to data archiving efforts by academic institutions during the 2017-2020 period
- **Communication restrictions**: Formal and informal limits on scientists' ability to discuss findings with media and public

## International Research Collaboration

### IPCC Process

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the world's largest scientific collaboration:

- **Structure**: Three working groups (Physical Science Basis, Impacts/Adaptation, Mitigation) plus a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
- **Assessment cycle**: Approximately every 6-7 years; AR6 (Sixth Assessment Report) completed 2021-2023
- **U.S. contribution**: American scientists have been among the largest national contributors to IPCC reports, serving as coordinating lead authors and review editors
- **Seventh Assessment cycle**: AR7 production underway, with a synthesis report expected around 2029

### Other International Programs

- **World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)**: Coordinates international climate research; U.S. agencies are major funders and participants
- **Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)**: Maintains essential climate variable monitoring; NOAA and NASA contribute significantly
- **Bilateral agreements**: U.S. climate research partnerships with EU (Copernicus), Japan (JAXA), and others
- **Paris Agreement reporting**: Climate research underpins national emissions reporting and Global Stocktake assessments

### Vulnerability of International Engagement

- **Withdrawal risks**: Periodic threats to withdraw from international climate agreements affect scientific collaboration
- **Funding uncertainty**: U.S. contributions to international climate research programs are subject to annual appropriations
- **Brain drain**: Policy instability may drive climate scientists to positions in other countries or the private sector
- **Reputation effects**: Political interference with U.S. climate science undermines American scientific leadership globally
