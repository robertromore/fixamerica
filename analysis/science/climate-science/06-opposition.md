# Climate Science: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to climate science in the United States is organized, well-funded, and deeply embedded in political and media structures. Understanding who opposes climate research protection, why they oppose it, and what arguments they deploy is essential for designing reforms that can withstand sustained resistance.

## Opposition Group 1: Fossil Fuel Industry

### Who

- **Major oil and gas companies**: ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Koch Industries, and others
- **Trade associations**: American Petroleum Institute (API), American Gas Association, National Mining Association
- **Industry-funded entities**: Donors Trust, Donors Capital Fund (conduits for anonymous industry donations to climate skepticism organizations)

### Why They Oppose

- Climate science findings directly threaten the long-term viability of fossil fuel business models
- Accepting the science creates legal liability for climate damages (ongoing lawsuits by states and municipalities)
- Climate research supports emissions regulations that increase operating costs
- "Stranded asset" risk: Trillions of dollars in proven reserves that may become unburnable

### How They Oppose

- **Direct lobbying**: Spending over $100 million annually to influence climate-related legislation and appropriations
- **Campaign contributions**: Major donations to politicians who question climate science or oppose climate policy
- **Funded research**: Sponsoring contrarian research and amplifying outlier findings
- **Public relations**: "Energy realism" campaigns framing fossil fuels as essential to prosperity and energy security
- **Legal action**: Challenging climate regulations through the courts; opposing disclosure requirements
- **Revolving door**: Placing former industry employees in government positions overseeing climate policy

### Their Arguments

| Argument | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| "The science is uncertain" | Core findings are extremely well-established; remaining uncertainties are about degree, not existence |
| "Natural variability explains warming" | Natural factors alone cannot explain observed warming; multiple attribution studies confirm human causation |
| "Models are unreliable" | Models have successfully projected warming trends for decades; disagreements are about regional details |
| "Climate policy will destroy the economy" | Conflates climate science with climate policy; the science says what is happening, not what to do about it |
| "We need more research before acting" | Decades of additional research have consistently confirmed and strengthened earlier findings |

### How to Counter

- Distinguish between climate *science* (what is happening) and climate *policy* (what to do about it) -- opposing regulation does not require opposing the science
- Highlight the fossil fuel industry's own internal research confirming human-caused climate change
- Point to the financial sector's independent validation of climate risks through insurance pricing and investment screening
- Support disclosure requirements for industry-funded research and advocacy

## Opposition Group 2: Free-Market Think Tanks

### Who

| Organization | Key Activities |
|-------------|---------------|
| Heartland Institute | Publishes the "Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change" (NIPCC); mails contrarian materials to teachers |
| Competitive Enterprise Institute | Legal challenges to climate regulations; "CO2 is life" campaign |
| Cato Institute | Publishes contrarian analyses; hosts climate skeptic scholars |
| Heritage Foundation | Opposes climate legislation; provides policy frameworks for Republican administrations |
| American Enterprise Institute | Offers "moderate" skepticism; has shifted toward acknowledgment but opposes regulation |
| Cornwall Alliance | Religious framing of climate skepticism; "stewardship" arguments against climate action |

### Why They Oppose

- **Ideological commitment**: Free-market organizations view government regulation as inherently harmful; climate science implies the need for regulation
- **Donor expectations**: Many receive significant funding from fossil fuel interests and conservative foundations
- **Institutional identity**: Having invested decades in climate skepticism, reversing course would undermine credibility and donor relationships
- **Solution aversion**: Opposition to the implied policy solutions drives rejection of the underlying science

### How They Oppose

- **Contrarian publications**: Producing reports, books, and op-eds that cherry-pick data or emphasize uncertainties
- **Counter-conferences**: Organizing events (e.g., Heartland's International Conference on Climate Change) that mimic scientific conferences but present contrarian views
- **Media placement**: Providing quotable skeptic voices for journalists seeking "balance"
- **Personnel pipelines**: Recommending skeptic appointees for government science positions
- **Legal strategies**: Filing lawsuits and FOIA requests targeting climate scientists to create harassment and intimidation effects
- **Educational materials**: Distributing contrarian materials to K-12 teachers

### Their Arguments

| Argument | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| "Government science is biased toward alarmism" | Peer review, replication, and independent confirmation provide strong checks; government scientists have often been conservative in projections |
| "Climate policies cost more than adaptation" | Economic analyses vary widely; this is a policy question, not a reason to question the science |
| "Free markets will solve climate problems" | A policy argument, not a scientific one; does not address whether the science is accurate |
| "Scientists are motivated by grant money" | Federal grants are competitive and peer-reviewed; industry funding for skepticism is far less transparent |
| "Climate science is a new religion" | Ad hominem framing that avoids engaging with evidence |

### How to Counter

- Separate the policy debate from the scientific evidence -- one can accept climate science while preferring market-based solutions
- Highlight that many conservative economists (e.g., Gregory Mankiw, George Shultz) have accepted climate science while advocating market-based responses like carbon pricing
- Expose funding sources to allow the public to evaluate potential conflicts of interest
- Engage constructively with genuine scientific questions while identifying bad-faith arguments

## Opposition Group 3: Politicians in Fossil-Fuel States

### Who

- Members of Congress representing coal-producing states (West Virginia, Wyoming, Kentucky) and major oil and gas states (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, North Dakota)
- State legislators and governors in fossil-fuel-dependent regions
- Political figures who have built brands on climate skepticism

### Why They Oppose

- **Constituent economic interests**: Fossil fuel extraction is a major employer and tax base in their districts and states
- **Campaign funding**: Fossil fuel industry is a primary donor to their campaigns
- **Primary election dynamics**: Acknowledging climate science risks a primary challenge from the right
- **Regional identity**: Fossil fuels are deeply embedded in the cultural identity of many energy-producing regions
- **Genuine economic anxiety**: Legitimate concerns about the economic effects of energy transition on their communities

### How They Oppose

- **Congressional oversight**: Using committee positions to harass climate scientists through hearings, document demands, and FOIA requests
- **Budget politics**: Proposing cuts to climate research programs; attaching riders prohibiting climate research to spending bills
- **Appointments**: Confirming or blocking agency nominees based on climate views
- **Rhetorical framing**: Casting climate science as an attack on working-class energy jobs
- **Legislative obstruction**: Blocking scientific integrity legislation and climate research mandates

### Notable Tactics

- Bringing snowballs to the Senate floor as "evidence" against global warming (Sen. James Inhofe, 2015)
- Subpoenaing NOAA scientists' emails after a study contradicted the "global warming pause" narrative (Rep. Lamar Smith, 2015)
- Characterizing climate change as "the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people" (Sen. James Inhofe, 2003)

### How to Counter

- Frame climate research protection as nonpartisan -- monitoring weather and climate is essential government infrastructure regardless of policy preferences
- Emphasize the economic benefits of climate data for agriculture, disaster preparedness, and military planning in their states
- Support just transition programs that address legitimate economic concerns
- Distinguish between opposing climate *policy* (legitimate political position) and suppressing climate *science* (attack on evidence-based governance)

## Opposition Group 4: Those Who Conflate Climate Science with Climate Policy

### Who

This category includes a broader group than the previous three -- people across the political spectrum who, intentionally or not, treat climate science findings as inseparable from specific policy prescriptions.

- **Intentional conflators**: Industry and political actors who deliberately blur the line to make opposing the science seem like opposing bad policy
- **Unintentional conflators**: Members of the public who have absorbed the framing that accepting climate science means accepting specific policies they oppose
- **Some climate advocates**: Activists who present their preferred policies as the only scientifically valid response, inadvertently reinforcing the conflation

### Why This Matters

The conflation of science and policy is perhaps the most important obstacle to depoliticizing climate research:

- A person can fully accept the scientific evidence for human-caused climate change while opposing carbon taxes, supporting nuclear energy, or preferring adaptation over mitigation
- When climate science is presented as requiring specific policy responses, people who oppose those policies are incentivized to reject the science
- This conflation makes it nearly impossible to build bipartisan support for protecting climate research

### How to Counter

- Consistently and explicitly separate statements about what the science shows from arguments about what should be done
- Acknowledge that climate policy involves trade-offs, values, and priorities that are legitimately contested -- the science constrains the option space but does not dictate specific policies
- Support climate science education that teaches the difference between empirical findings and policy preferences
- Encourage climate scientists to clearly distinguish between their expert knowledge and their personal policy views

## Cross-Cutting Opposition Dynamics

### The Obstruction Ecosystem

Opposition to climate science operates as a coordinated ecosystem:

1. **Fossil fuel industry** provides funding
2. **Think tanks** produce intellectual frameworks and contrarian research
3. **Politicians** provide political legitimacy and government access
4. **Media outlets** amplify messages to the public
5. **Grassroots organizations** create appearance of popular opposition

### Evolving Tactics

Opposition tactics have evolved over time:

| Era | Primary Tactic | Example |
|-----|---------------|---------|
| 1990s | Deny the science | "No consensus on warming" |
| 2000s | Emphasize uncertainty | "Science isn't settled" |
| 2010s | Delay and deflect | "We need more research"; "Other countries should act first" |
| 2020s | Accept science, oppose solutions | "Yes, climate is changing, but regulations won't help" |

This evolution represents a partial retreat -- outright denial has become increasingly untenable -- but the practical effect of opposing all climate action remains similar.

### Vulnerabilities of the Opposition

- **Internal contradictions**: The fossil fuel industry's own research contradicts its public positions, creating legal and reputational liability
- **Generational shift**: Younger conservatives are more likely to accept climate science, creating pressure for the Republican Party to evolve
- **Financial sector alignment**: Insurance companies, banks, and institutional investors increasingly treat climate change as a financial risk, undermining claims that the science is uncertain
- **Military acceptance**: DOD's treatment of climate change as a security threat provides bipartisan cover for accepting the science
- **Extreme weather**: Increasingly visible climate impacts make abstract denial harder to sustain
