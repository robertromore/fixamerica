# Climate Science: Stakeholders

## Overview

The climate science landscape involves a complex web of stakeholders with varying interests, resources, and influence. Some stakeholders generate climate knowledge, others fund or use it, and still others seek to suppress or distort it. Understanding these dynamics is essential to designing effective protections for climate research.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Climate Scientists

**Role**: Produce the foundational knowledge that informs climate policy decisions.

**Who they are**:

- Federal agency scientists at NOAA, NASA, DOE national laboratories, EPA, USGS, and other agencies (~2,000-3,000 researchers)
- University-based researchers funded by NSF, DOE, NASA, and NOAA grants
- National laboratory researchers at DOE facilities
- International researchers collaborating through IPCC and other programs

**Interests**:

- Scientific freedom to pursue research, publish findings, and communicate results
- Stable, adequate funding for long-term monitoring and research programs
- Protection from political interference and retaliation
- Career stability and professional development opportunities
- Access to computing resources, satellites, and observational networks

**Power and influence**:

- High epistemic authority within the scientific community
- Moderate public influence through media and public communication
- Low direct political power; dependent on agency leadership and political appointees for resources
- Significant vulnerability to budget cuts, communication restrictions, and reassignment

**Key vulnerability**: Federal climate scientists serve at the pleasure of political appointees who may be hostile to their findings. Self-censorship is widespread even without explicit directives.

### Federal Agencies

**Role**: Fund, conduct, and coordinate federal climate research; operate monitoring systems; produce assessments.

**Key agencies and their stakes**:

| Agency | Primary Climate Role | Key Vulnerability |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| NOAA | Weather/climate monitoring, prediction, data archives | Climate mission contested; budget under recurring threat |
| NASA | Earth observation satellites, climate modeling | Earth science framed as outside "core mission" |
| DOE | Energy-climate research, national lab computing | Climate research competes with nuclear weapons and physics |
| NSF | Fundamental research grants, polar programs | Peer review provides insulation; budget still politically set |
| EPA | Climate impacts, emissions monitoring | Most politically vulnerable agency; regulatory mission creates enemies |
| USDA | Agricultural climate impacts | Climate work small fraction of total mission |
| DOD | Climate security assessments | Military framing provides some bipartisan cover |
| USGS | Land and water climate impacts | Low political profile provides modest protection |

**Interests**:

- Mission fulfillment and institutional continuity
- Budget stability and growth
- Workforce morale and retention
- Institutional reputation and public trust

**Power and influence**:

- Substantial institutional resources and expertise
- Congressional allies on authorization and appropriations committees
- Constrained by political appointees at leadership level
- Career civil service protections provide partial insulation

### Fossil Fuel Industry

**Role**: Primary source of organized opposition to climate science; major funder of skepticism infrastructure.

**Who they are**:

- Major oil and gas companies (ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP, Shell)
- Coal companies (Peabody Energy, Arch Resources, CONSOL Energy)
- Industry trade associations (American Petroleum Institute, National Mining Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce)
- Dark money networks (Donors Trust, Donors Capital Fund)

**Interests**:

- Protect existing fossil fuel assets and revenue streams
- Delay or prevent emissions regulations
- Maintain social license to operate
- Avoid liability for climate damages
- Manage transition to low-carbon economy on industry's terms

**Power and influence**:

- Enormous financial resources for lobbying, campaign contributions, and public relations
- Deep ties to both political parties, but especially to Republican leadership
- Revolving door between industry and government regulatory positions
- Ability to fund sustained, multi-decade disinformation campaigns
- Structural economic importance in fossil-fuel-producing states

---

### Environmental Organizations

**Role**: Advocate for strong climate research, policy action, and scientific integrity.

**Key organizations**:

| Organization | Focus Area | Approach |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| Union of Concerned Scientists | Scientific integrity, research defense | Science-based advocacy, monitoring government interference |
| Climate Science Legal Defense Fund | Legal protection for scientists | Pro bono legal defense, FOIA defense |
| Environmental Defense Fund | Market-based climate solutions | Centrist advocacy, corporate partnerships |
| Natural Resources Defense Council | Environmental law and policy | Litigation, regulatory engagement |
| Sierra Club | Grassroots climate advocacy | Mobilization, political campaigns |
| 350.org | Climate action and fossil fuel divestment | Movement building, direct action |

**Interests**:

- Protection and expansion of climate research programs
- Enforcement of scientific integrity policies
- Public communication of climate science findings
- Policy action on emissions reduction

**Power and influence**:

- Moderate financial resources (far less than fossil fuel industry)
- Strong grassroots networks and volunteer base
- Legal expertise and litigation capacity
- Media access and public communication platforms
- Dependent on donor support; vulnerability to economic downturns

---

### Policymakers

**Role**: Authorize, fund, and oversee federal climate research; determine whether and how research findings inform policy.

**Key actors**:

- **Congressional committees**: House Science, Space, and Technology Committee; Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee; Appropriations subcommittees
- **White House**: Office of Science and Technology Policy; Council on Environmental Quality; Office of Management and Budget
- **State governors and legislatures**: Increasingly important as federal policy fluctuates

**Interests**:

- Re-election and constituent service
- Donor satisfaction
- Party loyalty and ideological consistency
- Occasionally, evidence-based policy outcomes

**Power and influence**:

- Direct control over research budgets through appropriations
- Oversight authority including subpoena power
- Appointment of agency leadership
- Legislative authority to mandate or prohibit research activities

**Key dynamic**: Policymakers who represent fossil-fuel-producing states face structural incentives to question climate science, regardless of personal beliefs, because their constituents' economic interests are at stake.

## Secondary Stakeholders

### Affected Communities

**Who they are**:

- **Coastal communities**: Facing sea level rise, increased storm surge, and flooding
- **Agricultural communities**: Experiencing changing precipitation patterns, extreme heat, and shifting growing seasons

## Stakeholder Dynamics

### Power Asymmetry

The fundamental challenge in climate science politics is a stark power asymmetry: the fossil fuel industry has vastly more financial and political resources than the scientific community or environmental organizations. This asymmetry enables sustained disinformation campaigns and political interference that the scientific community struggles to counter.

### Shifting Alliances

Several trends are reshaping stakeholder dynamics:

- **Financial sector engagement**: Insurance companies, asset managers, and banks increasingly validate climate science through their own risk analyses
- **Military acknowledgment**: DOD's characterization of climate change as a "threat multiplier" provides bipartisan credibility
- **Corporate shifting**: Some major corporations, including some fossil fuel companies, have publicly acknowledged climate science even while continuing to fund opposition groups
- **Youth mobilization**: Younger generations across the political spectrum show higher rates of climate science acceptance

### Missing Stakeholders

Certain groups are notably underrepresented in climate science governance:

- **Future generations**: Those who will bear the greatest consequences of current decisions have no political voice
- **Global South communities**: Those most vulnerable to climate impacts have minimal influence on U.S. research priorities
- **Independent media**: Local journalism's decline has reduced independent scrutiny of both climate science and its opponents
