# Climate Science: Overview

## Executive Summary

Climate science is among the most thoroughly validated fields of scientific inquiry, yet it has become one of the most politically contested. Federal agencies including NOAA, NASA, the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the EPA collectively invest billions of dollars annually in climate research, satellite monitoring, and modeling programs that inform policy decisions worldwide. The resulting body of knowledge -- supported by decades of observational data, thousands of peer-reviewed studies, and repeated confirmation by independent research teams -- has been subjected to sustained political interference, industry-funded disinformation campaigns, and episodic efforts to suppress or distort findings.

The politicization of climate science undermines the nation's capacity to prepare for climate impacts, erodes public trust in scientific institutions, and distorts the policy debate. Protecting the integrity of climate research is not a partisan issue -- it is a prerequisite for evidence-based governance on one of the defining challenges of the century.

## Key Facts

| Indicator | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total federal climate research spending (FY 2025 est.) | ~$3.3 billion across agencies |
| NASA Earth science budget (FY 2025 est.) | ~$2.2 billion |
| NOAA climate research budget (FY 2025 est.) | ~$600 million |
| NSF geosciences directorate (FY 2025 est.) | ~$1.1 billion |
| Number of NOAA weather/climate satellites | 16+ operational |
| Years of continuous CO2 monitoring (Mauna Loa) | 67+ years (since 1958) |
| IPCC assessment reports completed | 6 (latest AR6, 2021-2023) |
| U.S. National Climate Assessments completed | 5 (latest NCA5, 2023) |
| Scientific consensus on human-caused warming | 97%+ of climate scientists |

## Core Tensions

The climate science debate involves several persistent tensions:

- **Scientific consensus vs. political contestation**: The overwhelming scientific agreement on human-caused climate change contrasts sharply with ongoing political disputes over the validity of climate science.
- **Research independence vs. political oversight**: Federal scientists depend on politically controlled budgets and reporting structures, creating vulnerability to interference.
- **Public communication vs. scientific complexity**: Climate science involves probabilistic projections, uncertainty ranges, and complex models that are difficult to communicate clearly and easy to distort.
- **Short-term economic interests vs. long-term risk management**: Climate research findings often imply costly policy responses, creating incentives for those with short-term economic stakes to undermine the science.
- **National sovereignty vs. global scientific collaboration**: International climate research partnerships are sometimes framed as threats to U.S. policy autonomy.

## Key Questions

1. **Why has climate science become so politically polarized in the United States?** What role have industry campaigns, media dynamics, and political incentives played?

2. **How have different administrations affected the integrity of federal climate research?** What specific episodes of interference, censorship, or suppression have occurred?

3. **What is the current state of U.S. climate monitoring and modeling capacity?** Are observational networks and satellite programs adequately funded and protected?

4. **What legal and institutional protections exist for climate scientists?** How effective are scientific integrity policies, and where are the gaps?

5. **How can climate research be insulated from political interference while maintaining democratic accountability?** What governance structures best protect scientific independence?

## Vision

A system in which federal climate research operates under robust legal protections that insulate scientific findings from political interference; where funding for climate monitoring, modeling, and assessment is stable and adequate; where scientists can communicate their findings freely without fear of retaliation; and where the resulting knowledge informs policy debates grounded in evidence rather than ideology.
