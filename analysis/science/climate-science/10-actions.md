# Climate Science: Actions

## For Individuals

### Learn First

**Understand the Science**

- [ ] Read [Current State](02-current-state.md) to understand the federal climate research landscape
- [ ] Read [Root Causes](04-root-causes.md) to understand why climate science is politicized
- [ ] Visit NASA's Climate Change portal (<https://climate.nasa.gov/>) for accessible explanations of key findings
- [ ] Watch the Keeling Curve in real time at <https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/> to understand long-term CO2 trends

**Understand the Political Dynamics**

- [ ] Read [Opposition](06-opposition.md) to understand who opposes climate research protection and why
- [ ] Review the Yale Climate Opinion Maps to understand views in your area (<https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/>)
- [ ] Learn the difference between climate *science* (what is happening) and climate *policy* (what to do about it) -- this distinction is essential for productive conversations
- [ ] Read the Fifth National Climate Assessment's chapter on your region (<https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/>)

### Take Action

**Contact Representatives**

- [ ] Call or write your members of Congress to support protected funding for climate monitoring programs (NOAA satellites, NASA Earth science, National Climate Assessment)
- [ ] Ask your representatives to cosponsor scientific integrity legislation
- [ ] Attend town halls and ask about their position on protecting federal climate research from political interference
- [ ] Emphasize practical benefits: weather forecasting, agricultural planning, disaster preparedness, military readiness -- not just environmental arguments

**Defend Science When Attacked**

- [ ] Write letters to the editor when climate science is misrepresented in local media
- [ ] Share accurate information from trusted sources (NASA, NOAA, NAS) on social media
- [ ] Report suspected political interference with federal science to the Union of Concerned Scientists (<https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/report-political-interference-science>)
- [ ] Support the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, which provides pro bono legal representation to scientists facing harassment (<https://www.csldf.org/>)

**Spread Understanding**

- [ ] Have conversations with friends and family about climate science using non-partisan framing
- [ ] Focus on shared values: accurate weather forecasting, protecting farmers, disaster preparedness, national security
- [ ] Share local climate impact data relevant to your community
- [ ] Invite a climate scientist to speak at your community group, school, or faith organization

### Support Organizations

**Financial Support**

- [ ] Donate to the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund for legal protection of scientists
- [ ] Support the Union of Concerned Scientists' scientific integrity program
- [ ] Contribute to your state university's climate research programs
- [ ] Fund science communication organizations that translate research for public audiences

**Volunteer**

- [ ] Volunteer with citizen science programs (e.g., CoCoRaHS weather observation, Globe Observer, iNaturalist)
- [ ] Join local chapters of scientific advocacy organizations
- [ ] Help with data preservation efforts by supporting organizations archiving federal climate data
- [ ] Mentor students interested in climate science careers

## For Scientists and Researchers

### Protect Your Work

- [ ] Understand your rights under your agency's scientific integrity policy
- [ ] Document any instances of political interference with your research
- [ ] Know your whistleblower protections under the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act
- [ ] Register with the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund for legal support if needed
- [ ] Back up your data and publications in multiple locations

### Communicate Effectively

- [ ] Participate in media training programs offered by AGU, AMS, or AAAS
- [ ] Engage with local media and community groups to explain your research
- [ ] Use social media to share findings in accessible language
- [ ] When communicating, clearly distinguish between what your research shows (science) and what you personally think should be done (policy opinion)
- [ ] Collaborate with science communication professionals

### Advocate Within Institutions

- [ ] Join scientific integrity committees within your agency or professional society
- [ ] Testify before Congress when invited about the state of climate research
- [ ] Support professional society statements on scientific integrity and research protection
- [ ] Mentor early-career scientists in navigating political challenges

## For Educators

### In the Classroom

- [ ] Teach the scientific method and how to evaluate evidence -- skills that apply far beyond climate science
- [ ] Use NASA and NOAA educational resources for age-appropriate climate science lessons
- [ ] Teach students to distinguish between scientific consensus and political disagreement
- [ ] Discuss the history of scientific discovery, including cases where industry opposed scientific findings (lead, tobacco, ozone)
- [ ] Report any attempts to suppress climate science education to the National Center for Science Education

### Beyond the Classroom

- [ ] Organize science fairs and projects focused on local climate data
- [ ] Invite scientists to speak at school assemblies or career days
- [ ] Connect students with citizen science programs
- [ ] Support school board candidates who defend science education

## For Business Leaders

### Use Climate Data

- [ ] Incorporate climate projections into long-term business planning
- [ ] Use NOAA and NASA climate data for risk assessment and supply chain management
- [ ] Invest in climate resilience for facilities and operations

### Advocate for Research

- [ ] Join business coalitions supporting climate research funding (e.g., Ceres, We Mean Business Coalition)
- [ ] Publicly support the value of federal climate data for your industry
- [ ] Testify before Congress about the economic importance of climate monitoring
- [ ] Oppose budget cuts to climate research programs through industry associations

---

## For Local and State Officials

### Protect Local Research

- [ ] Support state-level scientific integrity policies
- [ ] Fund state climatologist positions and university climate research programs
- [ ] Ensure state agencies use the best available climate science in planning decisions

### Use Federal Data

- [ ] Incorporate National Climate Assessment findings into local planning
- [ ] Use NOAA climate projections for infrastructure investment decisions
- [ ] Participate in FEMA's climate adaptation planning processes
- [ ] Advocate to your congressional delegation for continued funding of climate data services that your jurisdiction depends on

## Talking Points for Conversations

When discussing climate science protection with people across the political spectrum:

**For conservative audiences**:

- "Climate monitoring is essential government infrastructure, like weather forecasting and military intelligence"
- "Farmers and ranchers depend on NOAA and USDA climate data to plan their seasons"
- "The military considers climate change a threat multiplier -- they need good data to plan"
- "You can support protecting the research without agreeing on what policies to adopt"

**For all audiences**:

- "97% of climate scientists agree that human activities are causing warming -- the science is as settled as it gets"
- "Political interference with science is dangerous regardless of which party does it"
- "Good data leads to good decisions, whether you're a farmer, an insurer, a military planner, or a city manager"
- "We can disagree about policy while still protecting the research that informs our choices"
