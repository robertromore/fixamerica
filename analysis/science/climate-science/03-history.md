# Climate Science: History

## Early Foundations (1824-1957)

### Discovery of the Greenhouse Effect

- **1824**: Joseph Fourier first described the atmospheric greenhouse effect, recognizing that the atmosphere traps heat radiating from the Earth's surface
- **1856**: Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated experimentally that CO2 absorbs heat, publishing findings in the *American Journal of Science and Arts*
- **1859**: John Tyndall conducted more detailed experiments measuring the infrared absorption of various gases, confirming that water vapor and CO2 are key greenhouse gases
- **1896**: Svante Arrhenius published the first quantitative estimate of warming from doubled CO2 concentrations, calculating a global temperature increase of approximately 5 degrees C (later refined to approximately 4 degrees C)
- **1938**: Guy Callendar compiled temperature records showing warming and linked it to rising CO2 from fossil fuel combustion, though his work was initially dismissed by most scientists

### Early Skepticism and Uncertainty

During this period, most scientists believed that the oceans would absorb excess CO2 and that natural variability explained observed temperature changes. The prevailing view was that human activities were too small to affect global climate -- a position that the accumulating evidence would eventually overturn.

## The Keeling Curve and Modern Climate Science (1958-1979)

### Charles David Keeling's Measurements

In 1958, Charles David Keeling began continuous measurements of atmospheric CO2 at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. His measurements revealed:

- **Rising trend**: Atmospheric CO2 was increasing steadily year over year
- **Seasonal cycle**: CO2 fluctuated seasonally due to Northern Hemisphere vegetation patterns
- **Fossil fuel signature**: The rate of increase corresponded to fossil fuel combustion rates

The "Keeling Curve" became one of the most important datasets in all of science, providing incontrovertible evidence that human activities were changing atmospheric composition. The unbroken record from 1958 to the present remains the gold standard for tracking CO2 accumulation.

### Early Climate Models

- **1967**: Syukuro Manabe and Richard Wetherald published the first credible one-dimensional climate model, estimating that doubling CO2 would raise global temperatures by approximately 2 degrees C
- **1969**: Manabe and Kirk Bryan developed the first coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model
- **1975**: Manabe and Wetherald published the first three-dimensional climate model showing geographic patterns of warming, including amplified Arctic warming -- a prediction later confirmed by observations

### Growing Scientific Concern

- **1965**: President's Science Advisory Committee warned President Johnson that rising CO2 could cause "marked changes in climate" by the end of the century
- **1977**: The National Academy of Sciences published *Energy and Climate*, warning that continued fossil fuel use could produce dangerous warming
- **1979**: The Charney Report (NAS) established the first authoritative estimate of "climate sensitivity" -- the warming expected from doubled CO2 -- at 1.5 to 4.5 degrees C, a range that has held remarkably stable through subsequent decades of research

## The Alarm Sounds (1979-1992)

### James Hansen's 1988 Testimony

On June 23, 1988 -- during a severe U.S. heat wave and drought -- NASA scientist James Hansen testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. His testimony marked a turning point:

- Hansen declared with "99% confidence" that global warming was underway and caused by the greenhouse effect
- He presented model projections showing continued warming under business-as-usual emissions
- The testimony received front-page coverage in the *New York Times* and major media outlets
- It catalyzed political attention to climate change in a way that scientific papers had not

### Creation of the IPCC (1988)

In response to growing scientific evidence, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988:

- **Purpose**: Assess the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts, and potential response strategies
- **Structure**: Government-nominated scientists conduct comprehensive literature reviews
- **First Assessment Report (1990)**: Concluded that human activities were substantially increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and that resulting warming was expected
- **Political significance**: The IPCC provided a mechanism for translating scientific findings into a form that could inform international policy negotiations

### Early International Response

- **1992**: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted at the Rio Earth Summit
- The United States signed under President George H.W. Bush, who stated that "the U.S. fully intends to be the world's preeminent leader in protecting the global environment"
- The convention established the principle that nations should act to prevent "dangerous anthropogenic interference" with the climate system

## The Doubt Industry Emerges (1988-2005)

### Organized Opposition to Climate Science

Beginning in the late 1980s, a coordinated effort to cast doubt on climate science emerged, drawing on tactics developed by the tobacco industry:

- **1989**: The Global Climate Coalition (GCC) was formed by fossil fuel companies and industry trade associations, including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, the American Petroleum Institute, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
- **Strategy**: Rather than arguing that climate change would be beneficial, the GCC focused on emphasizing scientific uncertainty and opposing emissions reduction commitments
- **1998**: A leaked American Petroleum Institute memo outlined a plan to recruit sympathetic scientists and train them to communicate doubt about climate science to media and policymakers
- **2002**: Republican strategist Frank Luntz advised GOP politicians in a confidential memo: "The scientific debate is closing [against us] but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science... Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly."

### Industry-Funded Research and Think Tanks

Several organizations played central roles in disseminating climate skepticism:

| Organization | Founded | Funding Sources | Primary Tactics |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| George C. Marshall Institute | 1984 | Industry, conservative foundations | Published contrarian reports; provided expert witnesses |
| Heartland Institute | 1984 | Koch network, fossil fuel companies | Organized counter-conferences (ICCC); mailed contrarian materials to teachers |
| Competitive Enterprise Institute | 1984 | Koch network, ExxonMobil | Legal challenges; "CO2 is life" advertising campaign |
| Global Climate Coalition | 1989 | Fossil fuel industry consortium | Lobbied against Kyoto Protocol; disbanded 2002 |

### Internal Industry Knowledge

Internal documents later revealed that major fossil fuel companies understood the reality of human-caused climate change even as they funded doubt campaigns:

- **ExxonMobil**: Internal research dating to the 1970s accurately projected CO2 increases and their warming effects. A 2017 peer-reviewed analysis by Supran and Oreskes found that 83% of Exxon's internal scientific documents acknowledged human-caused climate change, while 81% of its public "advertorial" communications expressed doubt.
- **Shell**: A 1988 confidential report titled "The Greenhouse Effect" accurately described warming projections and potential impacts
- **API**: A 1995 internal presentation acknowledged the scientific basis for human-caused warming while the organization publicly emphasized uncertainty

## Politicization Intensifies (2001-2016)

### Bush Administration (2001-2008)

The George W. Bush administration oversaw significant political interference with climate science:

- **2001**: The U.S. withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol
- **2001-2005**: Philip Cooney, a former American Petroleum Institute lobbyist serving as chief of staff to the White House Council on Environmental Quality, edited government climate reports to insert qualifying language emphasizing uncertainty. He resigned after the *New York Times* reported on the edits in June 2005 and was immediately hired by ExxonMobil.
- **2004-2006**: NASA public affairs officials restricted James Hansen and other scientists from speaking to media about climate findings. Hansen went public with the censorship allegations in 2006.
- **2003**: The EPA's draft "Report on the Environment" removed the climate change section after White House review. EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman later described the decision as driven by political considerations.
- **2007**: The White House significantly edited CDC Director Julie Gerberding's congressional testimony on climate change and health impacts, removing key findings

### Scientific Consensus Solidifies

Despite political headwinds, the scientific evidence continued to accumulate:

- **2001**: IPCC Third Assessment Report stated that "most of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations"
- **2004**: Naomi Oreskes published a survey of 928 abstracts in *Science*, finding zero papers rejecting the consensus position on human-caused climate change
- **2007**: IPCC Fourth Assessment Report strengthened the attribution language to "very likely" (greater than 90% probability) that human activities are the primary driver of warming since the mid-20th century
- **2007**: The IPCC and Al Gore were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize

### Obama Administration (2009-2016)

The Obama administration restored and expanded federal climate research:

- **2009**: Issued a scientific integrity memorandum directing agencies to develop policies protecting researchers
- **2013**: Released the President's Climate Action Plan, relying heavily on federal climate research
- **2014**: Released the Third National Climate Assessment with full administration support
- **2014**: IPCC Fifth Assessment Report stated that human influence on the climate system is "unequivocal"
- **2015**: United States played a leading role in negotiating the Paris Agreement, underpinned by U.S. climate research contributions
- **Budget increases**: Climate research funding increased across agencies, and new Earth observation missions were initiated

### Climategate (2009)

In November 2009, emails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia were stolen and selectively released:

- **Allegations**: Critics claimed the emails showed data manipulation and suppression of dissenting views
- **Investigations**: At least eight independent investigations (including by Penn State, the UK House of Commons, the National Science Foundation, and the EPA) cleared the scientists of scientific fraud or misconduct
- **Impact**: Despite exoneration, the incident temporarily reduced public confidence in climate science and provided ammunition for skeptics
- **Lesson**: Informal language in private communications can be misrepresented when taken out of context

## The Trump Era and Its Aftermath (2017-2024)

### First Trump Administration (2017-2020)

The Trump administration launched the most comprehensive challenge to federal climate science in modern history:

**Website and Communication Changes:**

- EPA removed or archived climate change web pages, including the Clean Power Plan page and climate indicators
- USDA instructed staff to use "weather extremes" instead of "climate change" and "increase weather resilience" instead of "reduce greenhouse gases"
- DOI removed references to climate change from press releases and public communications

**Personnel and Structural Changes:**

- EPA disbanded its Office of the Science Advisor
- Multiple scientific advisory committees were disbanded or not renewed
- Political appointees with industry ties were placed in positions overseeing climate research
- The CDC's "Climate and Health Program" was defunded

**Budget Proposals:**

- Proposed eliminating NASA's Carbon Monitoring System
- Proposed cutting NOAA's climate research budget by 20-30%
- Proposed eliminating DOE's ARPA-E program for advanced energy research
- Congress partially restored many proposed cuts through the appropriations process

**National Climate Assessment:**

- NCA4 Volume II was released the Friday after Thanksgiving 2018, widely interpreted as an attempt to minimize media coverage
- The president publicly dismissed the report's findings, stating "I don't believe it"
- Despite political opposition, the report was produced and released as required by law

**Scientific Response:**

- Academic institutions launched data preservation projects to archive federal climate data
- Professional scientific societies issued statements defending climate science
- Several former agency officials testified before Congress about interference
- The March for Science movement in April 2017 drew hundreds of thousands of participants

### Biden Administration (2021-2024)

The Biden administration prioritized climate science restoration:

- Rejoined the Paris Agreement on day one
- Issued executive orders restoring scientific integrity policies
- Appointed scientists and climate advocates to key positions
- Increased climate research budgets across agencies
- Released NCA5 in November 2023 with full administration support
- Invested in next-generation Earth observation systems
- Created the Office of the Chief Scientist at DOE

### Second Trump Administration (2025-Present)

The return of the Trump administration has renewed concerns about climate science programs:

- Proposed budget cuts to climate-specific research programs
- Uncertainty about the future of scientific integrity policies established under prior administrations
- Concerns about staffing and communication restrictions at climate-focused agencies
- Questions about continued U.S. participation in international climate research collaborations

## Key Lessons from the Historical Record

1. **The science was right early**: Core projections from the 1970s-1980s have been confirmed by subsequent observations. Climate sensitivity estimates from 1979 remain largely valid.

2. **Doubt was manufactured**: Industry-funded disinformation campaigns deliberately exploited the gap between scientific confidence and public understanding.

3. **Political interference is recurring**: Every administration skeptical of climate action has attempted to suppress, delay, or distort federal climate research. These efforts have been partially but not fully contained by scientific integrity policies and congressional resistance.

4. **Institutional resilience matters**: The National Climate Assessment has been produced on schedule despite political opposition, partly because it is mandated by law. Legal mandates provide stronger protection than executive policies.

5. **International collaboration amplifies national research**: The IPCC process multiplies the value of U.S. climate research by integrating it with global findings. Withdrawal from international engagement diminishes U.S. scientific influence.
