# Scientific Freedom: Actions

## Overview

Scientific freedom depends not only on laws and institutions but also on the active engagement of citizens, scientists, organizations, and communities. This document outlines concrete actions that individuals and groups at every level can take to defend scientific independence from political interference and strengthen the foundations of evidence-based governance.

---

## For Individual Citizens

### Stay Informed

- **Follow scientific integrity news**: Monitor reports from the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Columbia Law School Silencing Science Tracker, and the Government Accountability Project for documented instances of political interference with science
- **Understand the difference between policy and science**: Learn to distinguish between legitimate policy debates (where values and priorities differ) and political interference with scientific findings (where evidence is suppressed or distorted)
- **Evaluate sources critically**: When encountering claims that contradict scientific consensus, examine who is making the claim, who is funding them, and whether the claim has been peer-reviewed

### Contact Elected Officials

- **Support scientific integrity legislation**: Contact your U.S. senators and representative to express support for the Scientific Integrity Act, the Federal Scientist Protection Act, and the repeal of research restrictions like the Dickey Amendment
- **Oppose anti-science measures**: When legislation is proposed that would restrict research, defund scientific programs, or weaken scientist protections, make your opposition known through calls, emails, and public comments
- **Attend town halls**: Ask elected officials about their positions on scientific integrity and whistleblower protections at public forums
- **Engage in state-level advocacy**: Contact state legislators about academic freedom protections, university governance, and state-funded research policies

### Vote on Science Issues

- **Research candidates' science records**: Before elections, evaluate candidates' positions on scientific integrity, research funding, and evidence-based policymaking
- **Prioritize science in electoral choices**: Treat respect for scientific independence as a core governance qualification, not a single-issue concern
- **Support candidates across party lines**: Scientific integrity has historically been a bipartisan value; support candidates who demonstrate commitment to protecting science regardless of party

### Support Scientific Organizations

- **Donate to advocacy groups**: Organizations such as the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, and the Government Accountability Project rely on public support to monitor interference and defend scientists
- **Join or support scientific societies**: Organizations like the AAAS, which advocate for scientific freedom as part of their mission, are strengthened by broad membership
- **Subscribe to science journalism**: Support news outlets that investigate and report on political interference with science

## For Scientists and Researchers

### Federal Scientists

- **Know your rights**: Familiarize yourself with your agency's scientific integrity policy, whistleblower protections, and communication rights
- **Document interference**: If you experience or witness political interference with scientific work, create contemporaneous written records including dates, participants, directives, and the scientific content affected
- **Use protected channels**: Report interference through your agency's scientific integrity complaint process, to the Office of Special Counsel, or to your agency's Inspector General
- **Seek legal counsel early**: Contact organizations such as the Government Accountability Project, the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund, or a federal employment attorney before taking action on a complaint
- **Engage your union**: Federal employee unions (AFGE, NTEU) have negotiated provisions related to scientific integrity; use them
- **Communicate through professional channels**: Publish your findings in peer-reviewed journals and present at professional conferences, which provides an independent public record of your work

### Academic Researchers

- **Defend tenure protections**: Engage in faculty governance to resist efforts to weaken tenure at your institution
- **Challenge self-censorship**: If you are avoiding legitimate research topics due to political concerns, discuss this with colleagues and consider whether collective action could reduce individual risk
- **Review sponsored research agreements**: When accepting industry funding, ensure that contracts preserve your right to publish all findings, including negative results, without sponsor pre-approval
- **Mentor on scientific freedom**: Teach graduate students and postdocs about scientific freedom, the history of political interference, and their rights and responsibilities
- **Report donor interference**: If you become aware of donor or external pressure influencing research direction, hiring, or publication decisions, raise the issue through faculty governance and, if necessary, with AAUP
- **Support colleagues under pressure**: When fellow researchers face political or institutional retaliation for their findings, provide public support through co-signed letters, testimony, and professional solidarity

### All Scientists

- **Join professional societies**: Active membership in disciplinary societies strengthens collective advocacy for scientific freedom
- **Participate in policy engagement**: Provide expert testimony to legislators, serve on advisory committees, and contribute to public understanding of scientific issues
- **Communicate your work publicly**: Use accessible language to explain your research to non-specialist audiences, building public understanding of and support for scientific independence
- **Sign collective statements**: When scientific societies or advocacy organizations issue statements defending scientific freedom, add your name to demonstrate the breadth of scientific community support

---

## For Scientific Organizations and Professional Societies

### Monitoring and Advocacy

- **Maintain interference databases**: Continue and expand systematic tracking of political interference incidents across federal agencies
- **Issue rapid response statements**: When interference incidents occur, issue timely public statements that identify the specific interference, explain its implications, and call for remedial action
- **Lobby for legislation**: Dedicate organizational resources to lobbying for the Scientific Integrity Act, whistleblower protections, and repeal of research restrictions
- **Testify before Congress**: Provide expert testimony at congressional hearings on scientific integrity, agency operations, and research policy

### Support for Scientists

- **Establish legal defense funds**: Create or expand funds to provide legal representation to scientists facing retaliation for defending their findings
- **Offer career support**: Provide career counseling, networking, and placement assistance to scientists who leave federal service or academia due to political pressure
- **Create safe reporting channels**: Establish confidential mechanisms through which scientists can report interference to their professional society without immediate public exposure

### Standards and Best Practices

- **Develop model policies**: Create model scientific integrity policies that agencies and universities can adopt, with specific provisions for communication, complaint procedures, and enforcement
- **Recognize scientific courage**: Establish awards and recognition programs for scientists who demonstrate exceptional commitment to scientific integrity under pressure
- **Publish best practices**: Disseminate guidance on how scientists can protect themselves and their work from political interference while maintaining professional effectiveness

---

## For Universities and Research Institutions

- **Strengthen academic freedom policies**: Adopt robust academic freedom policies that explicitly protect faculty from political and institutional pressure on research topics and conclusions
- **Maintain tenure**: Resist legislative and administrative pressure to weaken tenure protections, which remain the strongest structural defense of academic freedom
- **Ensure transparency in sponsored research**: Require public disclosure of all restrictions on publication and data sharing in sponsored research agreements; reject agreements that give sponsors editorial control over findings
- **Vet donor agreements**: Establish institutional review processes for large donations to ensure they do not compromise research independence, faculty hiring, or curricular decisions
- **Support researchers under political pressure**: When faculty face political attacks for their research, provide institutional legal support, public statements of support, and protection from adverse personnel actions
- **Train on scientific integrity**: Include scientific integrity, research ethics, and academic freedom in graduate student and postdoctoral training programs

---

## For Journalists and Media

- **Investigate interference systematically**: Go beyond individual incidents to examine patterns of political interference across agencies and administrations
- **Protect sources**: Federal scientists who share information about interference may face retaliation; treat them as confidential sources when appropriate
- **Explain the distinction between policy and science**: Help audiences understand when political officials are making legitimate policy choices and when they are suppressing or distorting scientific findings
- **Follow up on commitments**: When administrations or agencies promise scientific integrity reforms, track implementation and report on compliance or failure
- **Cover the structural story**: Report on the institutional conditions that enable interference (e.g., lack of statutory protections, weak enforcement) in addition to individual incidents

---

## For Employers and Private Sector

- **Support evidence-based regulation**: Companies that operate in regulated industries benefit from predictable, science-based regulation; advocate for scientific integrity in regulatory processes
- **Fund independent research**: When funding academic research, use unrestricted grants that preserve researcher independence, and publicly commit to accepting and publishing all findings
- **Protect employee scientists**: Establish internal policies that protect company scientists from pressure to alter findings for commercial purposes
- **Engage in good-faith regulatory participation**: Contribute industry data and expertise to regulatory processes through transparent channels, rather than through political backdoors that undermine scientific assessment
