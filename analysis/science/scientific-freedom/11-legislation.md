# Scientific Freedom: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Protecting scientific freedom requires a durable statutory framework that does not depend on the goodwill of any particular administration. This document presents two federal bills -- the Scientific Integrity Act and the Federal Scientist Protection Act -- along with state model legislation, a regulatory framework, and analysis of legal considerations, loopholes, and shortcomings. Together, these provisions would codify protections for government scientists, strengthen whistleblower rights, and create independent enforcement mechanisms.

---

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Scientific Integrity Act

**Purpose**: To codify protections for federal scientific work against political interference, establish independent scientific integrity officials with statutory authority and enforcement power, and guarantee federal scientists the right to communicate their findings without political censorship.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Scientific Integrity Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
    (1) Federal agencies employ approximately 60,000 scientists
    and engineers whose work informs regulations, policies, and
    public health decisions affecting every American.
    (2) Political interference with federal science has been
    documented across multiple administrations and agencies, including
    suppression of findings, alteration of reports, restrictions on
    communication, and retaliation against scientists.
    (3) Existing scientific integrity protections rest on executive
    memoranda and agency policies that can be rescinded without
    congressional action, leaving them cyclically vulnerable.
    (4) The absence of statutory protections undermines public trust
    in government science and degrades the quality of evidence-based
    policymaking.

(b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--
    (1) to ensure that federal scientific findings, data, and
    analyses are produced and communicated free from political
    interference;
    (2) to establish independent scientific integrity officials
    with the authority and resources to investigate and remedy
    violations;
    (3) to protect the rights of federal scientists to communicate
    their findings to the public, the media, and Congress; and
    (4) to create accountability for political officials who
    interfere with scientific work.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
    (1) AGENCY.--The term "agency" means any Executive agency (as
    defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code) that
    conducts, funds, or uses scientific research or analysis as part
    of its mission.
    (2) COVERED SCIENTIST.--The term "covered scientist" means any
    employee, contractor, fellow, or grantee of an agency whose
    duties include conducting, supervising, or communicating
    scientific research, analysis, or technical assessments.
    (3) POLITICAL INTERFERENCE.--The term "political interference"
    means any action by a political appointee or other non-scientific
    official that--
        (A) directs, suppresses, or alters the findings,
        conclusions, or methodologies of scientific work for
        non-scientific reasons;
        (B) restricts or delays the communication of scientific
        findings for non-scientific reasons;
        (C) retaliates or threatens retaliation against a covered
        scientist for accurately reporting scientific findings; or
        (D) applies ideological, political, or religious criteria
        to scientific hiring, funding, or publication decisions.
    (4) SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY OFFICIAL.--The term "Scientific
    Integrity Official" means the official designated under
    section 4(a) of this Act.
    (5) SCIENTIFIC WORK.--The term "scientific work" means research,
    analysis, data collection, modeling, assessment, or technical
    evaluation conducted by or on behalf of an agency using
    scientific methods.

SEC. 4. SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY OFFICIALS.

(a) Designation.--Not later than 180 days after the date of

    (5) recommendations for legislative or administrative
    improvements.

(b) GAO Review.--Not later than 3 years after the date of
enactment, and every 5 years thereafter, the Comptroller General
shall submit to Congress a review of the implementation and
effectiveness of this Act.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act
$25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2032.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: The Scientific Integrity Act addresses the fundamental structural weakness in current protections: their dependence on executive action. By establishing scientific integrity officials with statutory authority, fixed terms, and removal protections, the Act creates a durable institutional framework that survives changes of administration. The private right of action gives individual scientists enforceable legal rights, rather than leaving them dependent on internal processes controlled by the agencies engaging in interference. The communication protections codify the principle that scientists should be free to share their findings, while preserving legitimate exceptions for classification and factual accuracy review.

**Potential Challenges**:

- **Unitary executive objections**: The administration may argue that statutory limits on political appointee authority over career scientists violate the president's constitutional authority to direct the executive branch. However, courts have upheld analogous independence provisions for inspectors general, the Federal Reserve, and other entities.
- **Defining "political interference"**: Drawing a clear line between legitimate policy direction (setting research priorities) and illegitimate interference (dictating research conclusions) will require careful application. The definition in Section 3(3) addresses this by focusing on alteration of findings, suppression, and retaliation rather than priority-setting.
- **Industry opposition**: Regulated industries benefit from the ability to influence agency science through political channels and will oppose statutory barriers to that influence.

**Refinements**:

- If a private right of action proves politically unachievable, an alternative would be to empower the Scientific Integrity Official to issue binding corrective orders subject to judicial review.
- If full independence provisions face constitutional challenge, a fallback structure would place the SIO within the Inspector General's office, leveraging existing independence protections.
- A sunset clause with mandatory reauthorization (e.g., 10 years) could address concerns about permanent bureaucratic expansion.

### Bill 2: Federal Scientist Protection Act

**Purpose**: To provide enhanced whistleblower protections specifically designed for federal scientists who report political interference with scientific work, including expedited procedures, preliminary injunctive relief, and expanded coverage for contractors and grantees.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Scientist Protection Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
    (1) Federal scientists who report political interference with
    their work face retaliation including reassignment, demotion,
    termination, and professional marginalization.
    (2) Existing whistleblower protections under the Whistleblower
    Protection Act of 1989 were not designed for scientific contexts
    and leave significant gaps in coverage.
    (3) The average resolution time for whistleblower complaints
    through the Office of Special Counsel exceeds 2 years, during
    which complainants often remain in adverse positions.
    (4) Fear of retaliation deters federal scientists from
    reporting interference, enabling ongoing suppression and
    distortion of scientific findings.
    (5) Contractors, grantees, and fellows who perform scientific
    work for federal agencies lack adequate whistleblower protections.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
    (1) COVERED INDIVIDUAL.--The term "covered individual" means--
        (A) any employee of a Federal agency whose duties include
        conducting, supervising, managing, or communicating
        scientific or technical work;
        (B) any contractor or subcontractor employee performing
        scientific or technical work under a Federal contract;
        (C) any grantee, fellow, or visiting researcher conducting
        scientific or technical work funded by or performed at a
        Federal agency; and
        (D) any former individual described in subparagraphs (A)
        through (C) with respect to disclosures relating to the
        period of Federal service or affiliation.
    (2) PROTECTED DISCLOSURE.--The term "protected disclosure"
    means any lawful disclosure of information that a covered
    individual reasonably believes evidences--
        (A) political interference with scientific findings,
        data, analyses, or communications;
        (B) suppression, alteration, or destruction of scientific
        work product for non-scientific reasons;
        (C) retaliation against any individual for scientific
        findings or integrity complaints;
        (D) application of ideological criteria to scientific
        hiring, funding, or publication decisions;
        (E) violation of an agency scientific integrity policy; or
        (F) any other violation of law, rule, or regulation
        relating to the conduct or communication of scientific
        work.
    (3) RETALIATORY ACTION.--The term "retaliatory action" means--
        (A) termination, suspension, demotion, or reassignment;
        (B) reduction in pay, benefits, or responsibilities;
        (C) denial of promotion, training, or professional
        development opportunities;
        (D) revocation or denial of security clearance;
        (E) initiation of investigation or disciplinary
        proceedings;
        (F) exclusion from committees, projects, or collaborative
        work;
        (G) reduction or termination of funding, grants, or
        contracts;
        (H) negative performance evaluations not based on merit;
        (I) transfer to a position inconsistent with the
        individual's expertise or qualifications; or
        (J) any other action that a reasonable person would find
        materially adverse.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION.

(a) In General.--No Federal agency, officer, employee, or agent
shall take or threaten any retaliatory action against a covered
individual because of--
    (1) a protected disclosure made to--
        (A) a supervisor or agency official;
        (B) the Scientific Integrity Official;
        (C) the Inspector General;
        (D) the Office of Special Counsel;
        (E) a Member of Congress or congressional staff;
        (F) a peer-reviewed journal or professional conference;
        or
        (G) the media or public, provided the disclosure does not
        contain properly classified information;
    (2) participation in an investigation or proceeding related
    to scientific integrity; or
    (3) refusal to comply with a directive that the covered
    individual reasonably believes constitutes political
    interference with scientific work.

SEC. 5. COMPLAINT PROCEDURES.

(a) Filing.--A covered individual who believes that a retaliatory
action has been taken or threatened may file a complaint with--
    (1) the Office of Special Counsel; or
    (2) the Scientific Integrity Official of the relevant agency.

(b) Initial Determination.--The receiving office shall make an
initial determination within 60 days of receiving a complaint as
to whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a
retaliatory action has occurred or is threatened.

(c) Expedited Investigation.--If the initial determination finds
reasonable grounds, the receiving office shall complete a full
investigation within 120 days.

(d) Burden of Proof.--
    (1) The covered individual must demonstrate by a preponderance
    of the evidence that a protected disclosure was a contributing
    factor in the retaliatory action.
    (2) The agency must then demonstrate by clear and convincing
    evidence that it would have taken the same action in the
    absence of the protected disclosure.

SEC. 6. PRELIMINARY RELIEF.

(a) Stay of Personnel Actions.--Upon a finding of reasonable
grounds under section 5(b), the agency shall immediately stay any
pending personnel action against the covered individual, including
reassignment, termination, demotion, or security clearance
revocation, pending final resolution of the complaint.

(b) Temporary Reinstatement.--If a covered individual has already
been subjected to a retaliatory personnel action, the receiving
office may order temporary reinstatement to the individual's prior
position pending final resolution.

(c) Judicial Review.--If the agency refuses to comply with an
order under this section, the covered individual may seek
preliminary injunctive relief in any United States district court
of competent jurisdiction.

SEC. 7. REMEDIES.

(a) Administrative Remedies.--Upon a final finding that a
retaliatory action has occurred, the appropriate authority shall
order--
    (1) reinstatement to the position held before the retaliation,
    or an equivalent position;
    (2) back pay with interest;
    (3) restoration of benefits, seniority, and leave balances;
    (4) expungement of any adverse personnel records resulting
    from the retaliation;
    (5) compensatory damages of not less than $10,000 and not
    more than $300,000; and
    (6) reasonable attorney's fees and costs.

(b) Disciplinary Action.--The agency shall take appropriate
disciplinary action against any individual found to have engaged
in retaliation, up to and including removal from Federal service.

(c) Civil Action.--If the Office of Special Counsel has not
issued a final determination within 180 days, or if the covered
individual is dissatisfied with the determination, the individual
may bring a civil action in any United States district court of
competent jurisdiction, where the court may award any of the
remedies specified in subsection (a), plus punitive damages in
cases of willful retaliation.

SEC. 8. ANTI-RETALIATION PROVISIONS FOR CONTRACTORS AND GRANTEES.

(a) Prohibition.--No Federal agency shall terminate, reduce, or
withhold funding from any contract, grant, or cooperative
agreement in retaliation for a protected disclosure by a covered
individual affiliated with the contractor or grantee.

(b) Contractor Obligations.--As a condition of any Federal
contract or grant involving scientific or technical work, the
contractor or grantee shall agree not to take retaliatory action
against any employee who makes a protected disclosure.

(c) Enforcement.--Violations of this section shall be grounds
for contract termination, debarment, or other remedies available
under Federal acquisition law.

SEC. 9. REPORTING.

Not later than March 1 of each year, the Office of Special Counsel
shall submit to the relevant congressional committees and make
publicly available a report on--
    (1) the number of complaints received under this Act;
    (2) the disposition of all complaints;
    (3) the average time to resolution;
    (4) summaries of remedies awarded; and
    (5) recommendations for legislative or administrative
    improvements.

SEC. 10. NON-PREEMPTION.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed to preempt or diminish any
rights or protections available to a covered individual under any
other Federal or State law.

SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Office of Special
Counsel $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2032
to carry out the additional responsibilities under this Act.

SEC. 12. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 90 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: The Federal Scientist Protection Act addresses the specific vulnerabilities of scientists who report political interference. Key design features include: (1) expanded coverage to contractors and grantees, who perform a large share of federally funded science but currently lack whistleblower protections; (2) preliminary relief provisions that prevent irreversible harm during the investigation process; (3) expedited timelines that reduce the multi-year resolution periods that currently deter reporting; (4) a comprehensive definition of retaliatory action that captures the full range of professional consequences scientists face; and (5) a clear burden-of-proof framework that balances protection of whistleblowers with management flexibility.

**Potential Challenges**:

- **OSC capacity**: The Office of Special Counsel may lack the scientific expertise and staffing to handle scientific whistleblower cases within the expedited timelines. The authorization of appropriations addresses funding, but building institutional capacity will take time.
- **Defining "contributing factor"**: The contributing factor standard, while protective of whistleblowers, may generate litigation over whether protected disclosures were actually relevant to personnel decisions.
- **Contractor coverage**: Extending whistleblower protections to contractor and grantee employees raises questions about the federal government's authority over private employment relationships. The contract-condition approach in Section 8 addresses this through the spending power.

**Refinements**:

- If expedited timelines prove unachievable, a fallback would be to provide for automatic preliminary relief when timelines are not met, creating an incentive for prompt resolution.
- If the private right of action proves politically difficult, an alternative would be to strengthen the Merit Systems Protection Board's authority to adjudicate scientific whistleblower cases.
- A qui tam provision allowing scientists to share in any civil penalties recovered from officials who engaged in interference could strengthen enforcement incentives.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Academic Freedom Protection Act

**Purpose**: To protect academic freedom at public colleges and universities against legislative interference with specific research topics, methodologies, or conclusions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Academic Freedom Protection
Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) The Legislature finds that:
    (1) Academic freedom is essential to the mission of public
    higher education and to the advancement of knowledge;
    (2) Faculty at public colleges and universities must be free
    to pursue research, publish findings, and teach within their
    areas of expertise without political interference; and
    (3) The integrity of publicly funded research depends on the
    independence of researchers from political and ideological
    pressure.

(b) The purpose of this Act is to protect academic freedom at
public institutions of higher education from legislative,
executive, and external political interference with research
and instruction.

SECTION 3. PROTECTIONS.

(a) No agency of state government, member of the Legislature,
or other state official shall:
    (1) Direct faculty at a public institution of higher education
    to alter, suppress, or refrain from pursuing specific research
    topics, methodologies, or conclusions;
    (2) Condition state appropriations to a public institution on
    the institution's adoption of specific research priorities,
    conclusions, or instructional content in individual courses;
    (3) Retaliate against a public institution or individual
    faculty member for research findings that conflict with the
    policy positions of state officials; or
    (4) Apply ideological criteria to faculty hiring, promotion,
    or tenure decisions at public institutions.

(b) This section does not:
    (1) Prohibit the Legislature from establishing general
    institutional missions, degree programs, or research
    priorities through appropriations;
    (2) Prevent governing boards from exercising their fiduciary
    and governance responsibilities; or
    (3) Restrict legitimate oversight of research ethics,
    financial management, or compliance with applicable law.

SECTION 4. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) Any faculty member or public institution aggrieved by a
violation of this Act may bring an action for declaratory and
injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) A prevailing plaintiff shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney's fees and costs.

SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

**Explanation**: This model legislation addresses the growing problem of state legislative interference with public university research. The Act distinguishes between legitimate state authority over institutional missions and budgets (which is preserved) and illegitimate interference with specific research topics and conclusions (which is prohibited). The enforcement mechanism provides a private right of action without damages, focusing on declaratory and injunctive relief to stop interference rather than punish it.

**Adaptations**: States may customize this model based on their constitutional structures, university governance models, and specific threats. States with elected university governing boards may need additional provisions addressing board-level interference. States with constitutional academic freedom protections may use this legislation to implement and enforce those protections.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### OSTP Scientific Integrity Standards

**Existing Authority**: The Office of Science and Technology Policy operates under the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6611 et seq.).

**Draft Regulation**:

Building on the 2023 OSTP Scientific Integrity Framework, agencies should promulgate binding regulations that:

- Require all scientific work products to include a certification by the principal investigator that findings have not been altered for non-scientific reasons
- Establish standardized complaint procedures across all agencies, with common timelines and evidentiary standards
- Require that all changes to scientific reports requested by political appointees be documented in a public log, including the requesting official's name, the nature of the requested change, and the scientific justification
- Mandate annual scientific integrity climate surveys of agency scientists, with results publicly reported
- Require that agency websites maintain permanent, timestamped archives of all published scientific data and reports

**Explanation**: These regulatory provisions complement the legislative framework by establishing administrative standards that can be implemented more quickly than legislation. While regulations are more durable than policy memoranda, they remain subject to revision through the notice-and-comment process and can be repealed by future administrations. Statutory codification (through the Scientific Integrity Act) provides the strongest protection.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **First Amendment**: Federal scientists' speech on matters of public concern receives First Amendment protection under *Pickering v. Board of Education*, 391 U.S. 563 (1968), but the *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, 547 U.S. 410 (2006) decision limited this protection for speech made pursuant to official duties. The Scientific Integrity Act effectively creates statutory protections that go beyond the constitutional floor established by *Garcetti*.
- **Unitary executive**: The president's constitutional authority to direct the executive branch creates tension with statutory limits on political appointees' authority over career scientists. However, courts have upheld analogous independence provisions for inspectors general, the Federal Reserve Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and other entities. The proposed legislation is designed within these established precedents.
- **Academic freedom**: The First Amendment protects academic freedom at public universities (*Sweezy v. New Hampshire*, 354 U.S. 234 (1957); *Keyishian v. Board of Regents*, 385 U.S. 589 (1967)), but the scope of this protection remains contested. The model state legislation supplements constitutional protections with specific statutory provisions.

### Preemption Questions

- The federal Scientific Integrity Act and Federal Scientist Protection Act would apply to federal agencies and federally funded scientists, without preempting state-level academic freedom protections.
- The model state legislation operates within state authority over public universities and does not conflict with federal law.
- States may enact scientific integrity protections for state-funded research that exceed federal standards.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Scientific Integrity Officials**: Agency-level investigation and corrective authority for scientific integrity complaints
- **Office of Special Counsel**: Expedited whistleblower complaint investigation and prosecution
- **Inspectors General**: Criminal and administrative investigation of serious interference
- **Federal courts**: Private right of action for injunctive relief, damages, and attorney's fees
- **Congressional oversight**: Annual reporting and periodic GAO review

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The Scientific Integrity Act includes a GAO review at 3 years and every 5 years thereafter
- Authorization of appropriations is for 6 years (FY2027-2032), requiring reauthorization
- No sunset clause on substantive protections, ensuring durable protection

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Scientific Integrity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Priority-setting disguise | Political appointees could frame interference as "priority-setting," which is permitted, rather than "directing conclusions," which is prohibited | High |
| Budget manipulation | Interference could take the form of defunding specific research programs rather than directly altering findings | High |
| Delayed review | Agencies could comply with the 5-day communication review deadline while finding other ways to discourage communication | Medium |
| Contractor exclusion gaps | The Act covers contractors but enforcement depends on contract conditions; agencies could structure work to avoid coverage | Medium |
| SIO capture | Despite independence provisions, SIOs operating within agencies may face subtle institutional pressure | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No coverage of Congress as source of interference | Appropriations riders restricting research are not addressed by agency-level integrity policies | Separation of powers; Congress's power of the purse |
| Executive-order vulnerability of regulations | Regulatory provisions can be rescinded more easily than statutes | Administrative law structure |
| Difficulty proving intent | Political interference often occurs through informal channels without documented directives | Nature of political communication |
| Limited reach to self-censorship | Statutory protections address overt interference but not the broader culture of self-censorship | Structural incentives beyond legal reach |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Address the priority-setting loophole by requiring documented scientific justification for any changes to research program scope, direction, or funding that affect ongoing scientific work
2. Strengthen budget manipulation protections by requiring that any reduction in funding for a specific research area exceeding 10% be accompanied by a public explanation that excludes scientific findings as a basis for the reduction
3. Complement the 5-day communication review deadline with a prohibition on informal discouragement of communication and a requirement to track media interview requests and responses
4. Extend contractor protections through government-wide acquisition regulation amendments rather than relying solely on individual contract conditions
5. Strengthen SIO independence by requiring that SIO performance evaluations be conducted by an external review panel rather than by agency leadership

| Pretextual justifications | Agencies could provide plausible non-retaliatory justifications for adverse actions, shifting the burden to the scientist to disprove them | High |
| Delay tactics | Despite expedited timelines, agencies could extend resolution through procedural challenges and appeals | Medium |
| Informal retaliation | Subtle retaliation (exclusion from meetings, social ostracism, unfavorable assignments) may not meet the "materially adverse" standard | Medium |
| Security clearance manipulation | Revoking or suspending security clearances can effectively end a scientist's career without triggering traditional personnel action protections | Medium |
| Grantee employer retaliation | The Act prohibits federal agencies from retaliating against grantees but may not prevent the grantee's own employer from doing so | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| OSC capacity limitations | Expedited timelines may not be achievable with current OSC staffing and expertise | Resource constraints |
| Cultural deterrence persists | Legal protections may not overcome the professional culture that discourages whistleblowing | Institutional culture beyond legal reach |
| Burden on individual scientists | Even successful whistleblowing exacts significant personal and professional costs | Nature of institutional conflict |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Address pretextual justifications by requiring agencies to provide documented, contemporaneous evidence that adverse actions were planned before the protected disclosure
2. Include mandatory mediation provisions to resolve disputes before they reach formal litigation
3. Expand the definition of retaliatory action to include patterns of minor adverse actions that collectively create a hostile work environment
4. Explicitly protect security clearance decisions from retaliatory manipulation by requiring independent review of any clearance action taken within 2 years of a protected disclosure
5. Require grantee institutions to adopt anti-retaliation policies as a condition of federal funding, extending protections to grantee employees

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Lack of scientific expertise at OSC and MSPB | Create specialized scientific integrity units within OSC and MSPB; hire staff with scientific credentials |
| Inconsistent agency implementation | Establish OSTP review and certification process for agency compliance with statutory requirements |
| Insufficient funding for enforcement | Tie enforcement funding to agency science budgets rather than relying on separate appropriations |
| Political vulnerability of SIO appointments | Require Senate confirmation for SIOs at major science agencies (NIH, EPA, NOAA, CDC, NASA) |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Both Acts should include mandatory GAO review at 3 years and every 5 years thereafter
- The Federal Scientist Protection Act should include a 5-year review of OSC capacity and case resolution timelines, with automatic appropriations increases if timelines are not met
- Agency scientific integrity regulations should include mandatory 5-year review and public comment periods
