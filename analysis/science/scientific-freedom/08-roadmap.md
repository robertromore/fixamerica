# Scientific Freedom: Roadmap

## Overview

Implementing scientific freedom protections requires a phased strategy that sequences reforms by political feasibility, institutional prerequisites, and urgency. This roadmap identifies three phases: immediate actions achievable through executive and administrative channels, medium-term legislative reforms that require congressional action, and long-term structural changes that involve institutional and cultural transformation.

---

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions (0-18 Months)

### Executive and Administrative Reforms

These actions can be taken without new legislation, using existing executive authority and agency discretion.

#### 1.1 Strengthen Agency Scientific Integrity Policies

- **Action**: Direct all science-producing agencies to update scientific integrity policies to align with the 2023 OSTP Scientific Integrity Framework
- **Authority**: Presidential memorandum; OSTP guidance
- **Key elements**:
    - Independent reporting structure for Scientific Integrity Officials (direct to agency head, not through political appointee chain)
    - Clear complaint procedures with defined timelines (90 days for initial determination)
    - Prohibition on political appointee involvement in scientific communication approval
    - Annual public reporting on complaints, investigations, and outcomes
- **Responsible parties**: OSTP, agency heads, designated SIOs
- **Metrics**: Completion of policy updates at all 24 agencies within 12 months; baseline complaint data established

#### 1.2 Reform Communication Policies

- **Action**: Issue government-wide guidance ensuring federal scientists can communicate findings without political pre-clearance
- **Authority**: Presidential memorandum; agency communications directives
- **Key elements**:
    - Scientists may respond to media inquiries in their areas of expertise with notification (not approval) to public affairs
    - Any review of scientific communications limited to factual accuracy, with 5-business-day response deadline and automatic approval if deadline passes
    - Scientists may present at professional conferences and publish in peer-reviewed journals without political review
    - Public affairs officers may not block, delay, or alter scientific communications
- **Responsible parties**: Agency communications directors, public affairs offices
- **Metrics**: Reduction in scientist-reported communication restrictions in annual surveys; number of media interviews and conference presentations by federal scientists

#### 1.3 Protect Civil Service Scientific Positions

- **Action**: Issue executive order affirming that scientific and technical positions in the competitive service will not be reclassified to exempt or at-will status
- **Authority**: Presidential executive order; Office of Personnel Management guidance
- **Key elements**:
    - Identify all scientific and technical positions across the federal government
    - Affirm competitive service protections for these positions
    - Require OPM review and public notice before any reclassification of scientific positions
- **Responsible parties**: OPM, agency human resources offices
- **Metrics**: Number of scientific positions with confirmed civil service protections; zero reclassifications without public review

#### 1.4 Rebuild Scientific Advisory Committees

- **Action**: Restore and strengthen scientific advisory committees that have been disbanded, weakened, or allowed to lapse
- **Authority**: Federal Advisory Committee Act; agency enabling statutes
- **Key elements**:
    - Reestablish all statutory and discretionary advisory committees with full membership
    - Require that advisory committee members meet relevant scientific expertise requirements
    - Prohibit advisory committee membership for individuals with disqualifying financial conflicts of interest
    - Ensure advisory committee reports are publicly available without political editing
- **Responsible parties**: Agency heads, General Services Administration (FACA oversight)
- **Metrics**: Number of advisory committees restored to full operation; proportion of members meeting expertise requirements

## Phase 2: Legislative Reforms (18 Months - 4 Years)

### Congressional Action

These reforms require new legislation and represent the core of a durable scientific freedom framework.

    - Independent SIOs with fixed terms, removal protections, and enforcement authority
    - Private right of action for scientists subjected to interference
    - Government-wide standards for scientific integrity complaint investigation and resolution
    - Annual reporting requirements and congressional oversight mechanisms
- **Responsible parties**: Senate Commerce Committee, House Science Committee
- **Coalition building**: Engage scientific societies, federal employee unions, good-government organizations, and bipartisan congressional caucuses
- **Metrics**: Bill introduction, committee passage, floor vote, enactment
- **Timeline**: Introduction within 18 months, committee action within 24 months, passage within 36 months

#### 2.2 Federal Scientist Protection Act

- **Action**: Enact enhanced whistleblower protections specifically for government scientists
- **Legislative vehicle**: Standalone bill or amendment to Whistleblower Protection Act reauthorization
- **Key provisions**:
    - Explicit coverage of scientific integrity disclosures
    - Preliminary injunctive relief for scientist whistleblowers
    - Expedited investigation procedures (120-day initial determination)
    - Extension to contractors, grantees, and fellows
    - Enhanced remedies including compensatory damages and attorney's fees
- **Responsible parties**: Senate Homeland Security Committee, House Oversight Committee
- **Coalition building**: Leverage existing whistleblower protection coalition; engage OSC and IG community
- **Metrics**: Bill introduction, committee action, enactment; reduction in average complaint resolution time
- **Timeline**: Introduction within 12 months, passage within 24-36 months

#### 2.3 Repeal of Research Restrictions

- **Action**: Remove existing appropriations riders restricting scientific research; enact statutory prohibition on future categorical research bans
- **Legislative vehicle**: Appropriations bills (removal of riders); standalone legislation (prohibition)
- **Key targets**:
    - Full repeal of remaining Dickey Amendment language
    - Removal of cannabis research classification barriers
    - Elimination of fetal tissue research restrictions
    - Statutory prohibition on future appropriations riders that categorically bar research
- **Responsible parties**: Appropriations committees, authorizing committees
- **Coalition building**: Issue-specific coalitions (gun violence researchers, medical marijuana advocates, biomedical research community)
- **Metrics**: Number of research restrictions repealed; new research funding in previously restricted areas
- **Timeline**: Individual repeals as opportunities arise; comprehensive prohibition within 3-5 years

#### 2.4 Restore Congressional Science Capacity

- **Action**: Reestablish the Office of Technology Assessment or equivalent congressional science advisory capacity
- **Legislative vehicle**: Legislative branch appropriations; standalone authorization
- **Key elements**:
    - Nonpartisan scientific advisory office serving all members of Congress
    - Professional staff with scientific expertise across relevant domains
    - Authority to conduct assessments at the request of committees or members
    - Public availability of all assessments and reports
- **Responsible parties**: Legislative branch appropriations subcommittees, congressional leadership

## Phase 3: Structural and Cultural Transformation (4-10 Years)

### Long-Term Institutional Change
