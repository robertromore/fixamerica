# Scientific Freedom: Stakeholders

## Overview

Scientific freedom implicates a wide range of stakeholders, from the federal scientists whose work is directly affected by political interference to the broader public whose health, safety, and environmental well-being depend on uncompromised scientific findings. This analysis maps the interests, power, and positions of key stakeholder groups to identify potential allies and adversaries in reform efforts.

- Advocating for legislative and regulatory protections
- Providing legal and professional support for scientists facing retaliation
- Building public awareness and political will for reform

**Power and influence**:

- Significant research and documentation capabilities
- Moderate media influence through reports and investigations
