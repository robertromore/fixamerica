# Scientific Freedom: Current State

## Overview

Scientific freedom in the United States faces an array of threats that have intensified over the past two decades. Political interference with federal science has become routine across multiple administrations, affecting agencies from the EPA to the CDC. Gag orders on federal scientists, suppression of research findings, retaliation against whistleblowers, and legislative restrictions on entire fields of inquiry represent persistent challenges that undermine evidence-based governance. While scientific integrity policies have expanded since 2009, enforcement remains weak and protections remain inadequate.

## Federal Scientists and Political Interference

### Scope and Prevalence

Surveys conducted by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) and government employee unions document widespread political interference with federal science:

- A 2018 UCS survey of scientists at 16 federal agencies found that approximately 50% reported instances of political interference with their work during the preceding five years
- Scientists at the EPA, NOAA, USDA, and DOI reported the highest rates of interference
- Common forms include suppression of reports, alteration of conclusions, removal of data from websites, restrictions on media communication, and reassignment away from sensitive topics
- The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has documented specific instances of scientific reports being delayed, altered, or suppressed for political reasons across multiple administrations

### Agency-Specific Conditions

| Agency | Key Issues | Recent Examples |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| EPA | Air quality, chemical safety, climate findings suppressed or delayed | Removal of climate data from websites; altered risk assessments for chemicals; restricted scientist communication |
| CDC | Public health guidance altered for political purposes | COVID-19 reporting interference; restrictions on terminology (e.g., "evidence-based," "fetus"); delayed guidance publication |
| NOAA | Climate and weather data politicized | "Sharpiegate" incident (2019); pressure on climate reports; altered hurricane forecasts |
| USDA | Agricultural science, nutrition guidance, climate impact on farming | Relocation of Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture; suppression of climate research |
| DOI | Endangered species, public lands management | Altered scientific findings on endangered species; reassignment of scientists critical of policy |
| FDA | Drug and device safety decisions influenced by political pressure | Emergency use authorization pressures; altered labeling guidance |
| NASA | Climate research communication restricted | Media access restrictions; altered climate messaging |

### Gag Orders and Communication Restrictions

Federal scientists face multiple layers of communication restriction:

- **Media policies**: Many agencies require pre-clearance before scientists can speak to journalists, with public affairs offices frequently blocking or delaying interview requests
- **Social media restrictions**: Agency social media policies have been used to prevent scientists from sharing findings on personal or professional accounts
- **Congressional testimony**: Political appointees have reviewed and altered prepared testimony by career scientists before congressional hearings
- **Conference participation**: Scientists have been prevented from presenting findings at professional conferences when research conflicts with administration priorities
- **Website content**: Scientific data and reports have been removed from agency websites during transitions between administrations

## Whistleblower Protection Gaps

### Current Legal Framework

Federal scientists who report political interference have limited legal recourse:

- **Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA)**: Provides some protection for federal employees who disclose waste, fraud, and abuse, but coverage is incomplete and enforcement is slow
- **Office of Special Counsel (OSC)**: Investigates whistleblower complaints, but has a substantial case backlog and limited enforcement authority
- **Inspector General Act**: Agency inspectors general can investigate interference, but their independence has been challenged by political removals
- **Scientific integrity policies**: Agency-level policies vary in scope and enforcement; most lack binding legal authority

### Documented Retaliation

Scientists who challenge political interference have faced serious professional consequences:

- **Reassignment**: Scientists transferred to positions unrelated to their expertise, often in remote locations, as punishment for inconvenient findings
- **Demotion**: Career scientists removed from leadership positions after producing research at odds with political agendas
- **Termination**: In extreme cases, scientists have been fired or forced to resign
- **Professional marginalization**: Exclusion from committees, conferences, and collaborative projects
- **Funding retaliation**: Grant funding reduced or eliminated for researchers whose work conflicts with political priorities

Average resolution time for whistleblower complaints through the OSC is two to three years, during which the complainant often remains in the adverse position. Success rates for whistleblower claims are low, and remedies, when granted, frequently fail to restore the scientist's prior standing.

## Academic Freedom

### University-Level Protections

Academic freedom enjoys stronger cultural norms and institutional protections than federal scientific freedom, but faces growing pressures:

- **Tenure protections**: Tenure provides meaningful insulation from political pressure, but the proportion of tenured and tenure-track faculty has declined from approximately 45% in 1975 to approximately 25% today, leaving most researchers without this protection
- **Institutional academic freedom**: Universities assert institutional autonomy from external political interference, but this has been tested by state legislative actions
- **AAUP standards**: The American Association of University Professors' 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure remains the foundational document, but enforcement depends on institutional commitment

### State Legislative Interference

State legislatures have increasingly sought to influence university research:

- **Topic restrictions**: Legislation in multiple states has targeted specific research areas including critical race theory, gender studies, and climate science
- **Funding conditionality**: State appropriations tied to ideological compliance or specific curricular mandates
- **Board appointments**: Politically motivated appointments to university governing boards that can influence research priorities
- **Anti-DEI legislation**: Laws restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs have impacted research on disparities in science

### Self-Censorship

Research by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and others documents significant self-censorship among both government and academic scientists:

- Approximately 25% of federal scientists report avoiding certain topics or modifying conclusions due to political concerns
- Researchers in climate science, environmental health, gun violence, reproductive health, and racial disparities report the highest levels of self-censorship
- Early-career researchers and those in non-tenure positions are most susceptible to self-censorship pressures
- Self-censorship is difficult to quantify but may represent a larger constraint on scientific freedom than overt interference

## Scientific Integrity Policies

### Federal Framework

Since the Obama administration's 2009 directive, federal agencies have developed scientific integrity policies:

| Policy Element | Status (2025) |
|---------------|---------------|
| Agencies with written policies | 24 of 24 science-producing agencies |
| Agencies with designated Scientific Integrity Officials (SIOs) | 24 |
| Agencies with complaint procedures | ~20 |
| Agencies with independent SIO reporting structures | ~8 |
| Agencies that have disciplined officials for interference | Fewer than 5 documented cases |
| OSTP government-wide framework | Issued January 2023; implementation ongoing |

### Weaknesses in Current Policies

- **Lack of statutory authority**: Most integrity policies are executive orders or agency memoranda that can be rescinded by incoming administrations
- **Weak enforcement**: Few agencies have meaningful penalties for officials who violate integrity policies
- **SIO independence**: Scientific integrity officials typically report through the agency chain of command, limiting their independence
- **Inconsistent coverage**: Policies vary significantly in scope, definitions, and procedures across agencies
- **No private right of action**: Scientists cannot sue for violations of integrity policies; enforcement depends on internal processes
- **Political vulnerability**: Policies established by executive action are vulnerable to reversal by subsequent administrations

## Congressional Research Restrictions

### Active Restrictions

Congress has used appropriations riders and statutory provisions to restrict research in specific areas:

- **Dickey Amendment (1996)**: Effectively banned CDC-funded gun violence research for nearly two decades; partially lifted in 2018 with appropriation of $25 million, but cultural inhibition persists
- **Cannabis research barriers**: Schedule I classification creates extensive regulatory hurdles for marijuana research; DEA licensing requirements limit the number of authorized growers
- **Fetal tissue research restrictions**: Executive orders and legislative proposals have periodically restricted or banned federal funding for research using fetal tissue
- **Gain-of-function research**: Funding pauses and enhanced oversight requirements have constrained dual-use research of concern, sometimes beyond evidence-based risk assessment

### Impact on Research Enterprise

Congressional restrictions create chilling effects beyond their direct scope:

- Researchers avoid adjacent topics to prevent funding jeopardy
- Institutional review boards adopt overly cautious interpretations
- Entire academic subfields suffer from talent flight and knowledge gaps
- Policy decisions proceed without relevant evidence, increasing public risk

## International Comparison

| Country | Key Protections | Assessment |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Germany | Constitutional right to academic freedom (Basic Law, Art. 5(3)); strong institutional autonomy | Strong statutory protection; robust enforcement |
| United Kingdom | Scientific Advisory Committee guidelines; Haldane Principle separating research direction from political control | Moderate; advisory system respected but not legally binding |
| Canada | Experienced severe muzzling of government scientists (2006-2015); implemented Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC) scientific integrity provisions | Improved after 2015; cautionary example of rapid deterioration |
| Australia | Science and Technology Council guidelines; academic freedom in university acts | Mixed; government scientists face restrictions; universities relatively autonomous |
| European Union | Horizon Europe framework protects researcher autonomy; European Research Council independence | Strong institutional protections at EU level |

## Current Reform Efforts

### Legislative Proposals

Several bills have been introduced in Congress to strengthen scientific freedom:

- **Scientific Integrity Act**: Would codify scientific integrity policies in statute, create independent integrity officials, and provide legal remedies for scientists
- **Federal Scientist Protection Act**: Would expand whistleblower protections specifically for government scientists and engineers
- **FACT Act (Free Access to Congressional Testimony)**: Would guarantee federal scientists the right to respond to congressional inquiries without political pre-clearance

### Executive Action

- The January 2023 OSTP Scientific Integrity Framework established government-wide standards, but implementation varies and the framework lacks statutory force
- Agency-level reforms continue incrementally, with some agencies strengthening complaint procedures and SIO independence

### Professional Society Initiatives

- AAAS, UCS, and other organizations maintain monitoring programs and publish annual reports on scientific freedom conditions
- Professional societies have adopted resolutions supporting scientific freedom and opposing political interference
- Some organizations provide legal defense funds for scientists facing retaliation
