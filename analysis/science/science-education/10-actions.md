# Science Education: Actions

## Overview

Citizens can take meaningful action to improve science education at every level -- from their own households to national policy. This document provides concrete steps organized by effort level and sphere of influence.

## Individual Actions

### For Parents and Families

**Low Effort**:

- Visit science museums, nature centers, and planetariums with children. Many offer free admission days or community access programs
- Watch quality science media together (NOVA, Nature, YouTube channels like SmarterEveryDay, Kurzgesagt, or Veritasium) and discuss what you learn
- Encourage curiosity by responding to children's "why" questions with investigation rather than dismissal
- Model scientific thinking at home: talk about evidence, distinguish opinion from fact, acknowledge uncertainty
- Check your state's science standards by visiting your state Department of Education website; know what your children should be learning

**Moderate Effort**:

- Review your child's science textbooks and curriculum materials for accuracy and rigor, particularly on evolution and climate change
- Enroll children in after-school STEM programs (Science Olympiad, FIRST Robotics, 4-H, coding clubs)
- Participate in citizen science projects as a family (iNaturalist, Globe Observer, Zooniverse)
- Attend school board meetings when science curriculum is discussed; provide informed public comment supporting evidence-based instruction
- Request science instructional time data from your school; ask how much time is allocated to science versus other subjects

**Higher Effort**:

- Run for school board on a platform that includes strong science education
- Organize parent groups to advocate for NGSS adoption or implementation in your district or state
- Volunteer as a science fair judge, guest speaker, or classroom assistant
- If you have STEM expertise, offer to mentor science teachers or co-teach lessons

### For Students

- Ask questions in science class; push for depth beyond textbook answers
- Join science clubs, teams, or competitions (Science Olympiad, robotics, science fair)
- Participate in citizen science projects independently
- Read science news from reliable sources (Science News for Students, Newsela Science)
- Speak up if science instruction seems inaccurate, incomplete, or politically influenced

### For STEM Professionals

- Volunteer in K-12 classrooms through programs like Scientists in Schools, Skype a Scientist, or Letters to a Pre-Scientist
- Mentor science teachers in your discipline
- Participate in science outreach events (Science Cafe, science festivals, public lectures)
- Support science education financially through donations to NSTA, NCSE, or local science education foundations
- Advocate within your professional societies for science education engagement

## Community Actions

### Engaging with Schools

- Attend school board meetings regularly, not just during controversies. Consistent presence from science-supportive community members counterbalances organized opposition
- Organize community forums on science education quality with participation from teachers, scientists, parents, and administrators
- Partner local businesses with schools for STEM career days, internships, and equipment donations
- Advocate for adequate science laboratory funding in school budgets
- Support bond measures and levies that include science facility improvements

### Supporting Science Teachers

- Establish community awards for outstanding science teaching
- Create local science teacher grant programs funded by community donations
- Organize community appreciation events for science educators
- Connect science teachers with local STEM professionals for content support and mentorship
- Advocate for competitive science teacher salaries with school boards and in state legislative testimony

### Building Informal Science Infrastructure

- Support local science museums, nature centers, and planetariums through membership, donations, and volunteerism
- Advocate for public library science programming (maker spaces, science reading clubs, family science nights)
- Start or support community science events (science cafes, science festivals, astronomy nights)
- Create community science gardens, weather stations, or biodiversity monitoring projects that serve as educational resources

## State-Level Advocacy

### Standards Adoption

- Contact state legislators to express support for NGSS adoption or equivalent rigorous standards
- Testify at state Board of Education hearings on science standards review
- Submit public comments during standards review processes
- Join or support state-level science education advocacy coalitions
- Write op-eds and letters to the editor supporting evidence-based science standards

### Opposing Anti-Science Legislation

- Monitor state legislature websites and NCSE alerts for "academic freedom" or "balanced treatment" bills targeting evolution or climate science
- Contact your state legislators immediately when anti-science bills are introduced
- Organize testimony from scientists, science teachers, and parents at legislative hearings
- Support legal organizations (ACLU, Americans United) that challenge anti-science education laws
- Build relationships with legislators year-round, not just during crises

### Teacher Investment

- Advocate for state-level science teacher salary supplements
- Support state funding for science teacher professional development
- Push for state loan forgiveness programs for science teachers
- Support legislation requiring adequate science instructional time in elementary schools

## National-Level Advocacy

### Federal Policy

- Contact your U.S. Representative and Senators to support:
    - Increased NSF Education and Human Resources budget
    - Expansion of the Noyce Scholarship program
    - Science accountability provisions in ESEA reauthorization
    - Federal science teacher loan forgiveness programs
    - Funding for science education research through the Institute of Education Sciences

### Supporting National Organizations

| Organization | How to Support | Impact |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| National Center for Science Education | Membership, donations, volunteer monitoring | Defends evolution and climate education |
| National Science Teaching Association | Membership, conference participation | Strengthens science teaching profession |
| AAAS | Membership, science education advocacy | Shapes national science education policy |
| Exploratorium and science museums | Membership, donations, volunteering | Expands informal science learning |

### Public Discourse

- Share accurate science information on social media; counter misinformation with evidence and sources
- Support quality science journalism by subscribing to outlets that cover science education (Education Week, Science, Scientific American)
- Participate in public comment periods on federal education regulations
- Organize or participate in science marches, rallies, and public demonstrations supporting evidence-based education

## What Not To Do

- Do not dismiss religious concerns about evolution without empathy. Focus on the distinction between scientific understanding and personal belief
- Do not frame science education as a partisan issue. Emphasize shared values: economic opportunity, student preparedness, national competitiveness
- Do not attack individual teachers publicly. Work through proper channels to address curriculum concerns
- Do not assume that good science education happens automatically. It requires active advocacy and sustained investment
