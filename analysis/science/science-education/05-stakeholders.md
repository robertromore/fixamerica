# Science Education: Stakeholders

## Overview

Science education reform involves a broad array of stakeholders with varying levels of power, interest, and capacity to influence outcomes. This document maps the key actors, their interests, their positions on reform, and their relative influence.

## Students and Families

### K-12 Students

**Interest**: Receiving a high-quality science education that prepares them for college, careers, and informed citizenship.

**Current Experience**:

- Approximately 50 million K-12 students in U.S. public schools encounter widely varying quality of science instruction depending on their state, district, school, and teacher
- Students in high-poverty and rural schools are most likely to experience underqualified teachers, inadequate laboratory facilities, and weakened standards
- Students from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds disproportionately attend schools with fewer science resources

**Influence**: Low direct influence. Students are the ultimate beneficiaries or victims of science education policy but have minimal voice in standards-setting, curriculum adoption, or funding decisions.

### Parents and Families

**Interest**: Varies significantly. Most parents want their children to receive a good education, including science. A subset prioritizes religious or ideological values over scientific consensus.

**Key Subgroups**:

| Subgroup | Position on Reform | Influence |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Science-supportive parents | Favor strong standards, NGSS adoption, evidence-based instruction | Moderate -- can mobilize through PTAs and school boards |
| Religious conservative parents | May oppose evolution instruction, climate science, or perceived secular worldview in science classes | High in some communities -- organized through churches, homeschool networks, and advocacy groups |
| Disengaged parents | Not actively involved in science education debates | Low -- absence from debates allows organized minorities to dominate |
| STEM professional parents | Strongly favor rigorous science education | Moderate -- influential in affluent suburban districts |

## Educators

### Science Teachers

**Interest**: Professional autonomy, adequate resources, competitive compensation, manageable workload, freedom from political interference in curriculum.

**Key Organizations**:

- **National Science Teaching Association (NSTA)**: ~40,000 members. Strongly supports NGSS and evidence-based instruction. Provides professional development and curriculum resources
- **State science teacher associations**: Vary in size and influence. Most support NGSS but face political constraints in non-adopting states
- **National Education Association (NEA) and American Federation of Teachers (AFT)**: The two major teacher unions. Generally support NGSS and oppose political interference in science curriculum but prioritize broader labor issues

**Influence**: Moderate. Teachers implement standards at the classroom level and can amplify or undermine reforms through their instructional choices. However, teachers have limited power over standards adoption, funding, or political decisions.

**Key Challenges**:

- Self-censorship on controversial topics (evolution, climate) is widespread, even where standards mandate coverage
- Many science teachers lack the content knowledge, pedagogical training, or administrative support to implement three-dimensional NGSS instruction
- Teacher voice is often marginalized in policy debates dominated by politicians, administrators, and advocacy organizations

### School Administrators

**Interest**: Meeting accountability requirements, managing budgets, avoiding community conflict, attracting and retaining qualified teachers.

**Influence**: High at the local level. Principals and superintendents control scheduling, professional development, resource allocation, and curriculum emphasis. They can prioritize or deprioritize science instruction through daily operational decisions.

**Typical Behavior**: Risk-averse. Administrators often minimize science when it is not part of accountability metrics and may discourage teachers from engaging with controversial topics to avoid parental complaints.

### Higher Education Faculty

**Interest**: Receiving well-prepared students; training future science teachers; conducting science education research.

**Key Organizations**:

- University science departments set prerequisites and expectations that shape high school curriculum
- Schools of education design teacher preparation programs
- Science education research faculty study effective instruction and produce evidence for reform

**Influence**: Moderate. Universities shape teacher preparation and conduct research that informs policy, but they have limited direct influence on K-12 curriculum decisions.

## Government Actors

### State Legislatures

**Interest**: Varies by member. Includes ideological goals (weakening evolution/climate instruction), constituent service (responding to parent concerns), and economic development (STEM workforce).

**Influence**: Very high. State legislatures determine science standards adoption, funding levels, teacher certification requirements, and whether to pass laws restricting curriculum content.

**Key Actions**:

- Passing or blocking NGSS adoption
- Introducing "academic freedom" or "balanced treatment" bills targeting evolution and climate science
- Setting teacher certification and compensation standards
- Allocating state funding for science education

### State Boards of Education

**Interest**: Setting and overseeing standards and curriculum. In some states, boards are elected and reflect community political dynamics; in others, they are appointed.

**Influence**: High. State boards make final decisions on standards adoption, textbook approval, and assessment frameworks.

**Political Vulnerability**: Elected boards are particularly susceptible to organized advocacy campaigns. State board elections typically have low voter turnout, allowing well-organized minorities to elect candidates with specific curriculum agendas.

### U.S. Department of Education

**Interest**: Improving educational quality and equity nationwide. The Department administers federal education funding and sets conditions for grants.

**Influence**: Moderate. The Department cannot mandate curriculum or standards (prohibited by federal law) but can incentivize reforms through competitive grants, technical assistance, and data collection.

**Key Programs**:

- Title I (compensatory education)
- Title II (teacher quality)
- Competitive grant programs (e.g., Education Innovation and Research)
- Institute of Education Sciences (research and data)

### National Science Foundation

**Interest**: Strengthening STEM education at all levels. NSF has a dedicated Education and Human Resources (EHR) Directorate with an annual budget of approximately $1.1 billion.

**Influence**: Moderate to high. NSF funds science education research, curriculum development, teacher preparation (Noyce Scholarships), and informal science education. Its funding decisions shape the research agenda and pilot programs that eventually influence policy.

### Congress

**Interest**: STEM workforce development, economic competitiveness, and constituent concerns.

**Influence**: High through appropriations (funding for NSF, Department of Education, NASA education programs) and legislation (ESEA reauthorizations, STEM education acts).

**Key Dynamics**: Bipartisan support for STEM education in the abstract, but partisan disagreement on specific content (evolution, climate), federal role in curriculum, and funding levels.

## Scientific and Professional Organizations

### American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)

**Interest**: Promoting science literacy and evidence-based education. AAAS launched *Project 2061* in 1985, which produced foundational science literacy benchmarks.

**Influence**: High in standards development. AAAS scientists and education researchers contributed significantly to the NRC Framework and NGSS. Lower influence on implementation and politics.

### National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine

**Interest**: Providing independent, evidence-based guidance on science education policy.

**Influence**: High in framing. The NRC's *Framework for K-12 Science Education* (2011) was the intellectual foundation for NGSS. National Academies reports carry significant authority with policymakers.

### Achieve, Inc

**Interest**: Standards development and implementation support. Achieve managed the NGSS development process and continues to support adoption states.

**Influence**: Moderate. Achieve provides technical assistance but has no authority to compel adoption or implementation.

### National Center for Science Education (NCSE)

**Interest**: Defending the teaching of evolution and climate science in public schools.

**Influence**: Moderate. NCSE monitors state-level threats to science education, provides rapid-response support to communities, and documents the scope of anti-science education legislation. It is the primary national organization tracking evolution and climate education controversies.

## Industry and Advocacy

### STEM Industry

**Interest**: A skilled STEM workforce pipeline. Technology companies, pharmaceutical firms, energy companies, and defense contractors depend on STEM-educated workers.

**Key Organizations**:

- **Business Roundtable**: Has repeatedly called for stronger STEM education
- **Change the Equation (now STEMconnector)**: Industry coalition supporting STEM education
- **Individual companies**: Google, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Boeing, and others fund STEM education programs

**Influence**: Moderate. Industry funds programs and lobbies for STEM education investment but rarely engages in the content controversies (evolution, climate) that shape standards debates.

### Fossil Fuel Industry

**Interest**: Opposing or weakening climate change education that could build public support for emissions reduction policies.

**Key Organizations**:

- **Heartland Institute**: Distributed climate-skeptic materials to tens of thousands of teachers
- **American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)**: Promoted model legislation for "balanced" treatment of climate science
- **State Policy Network**: Network of think tanks that have opposed NGSS adoption in multiple states

**Influence**: Significant in specific states. Fossil fuel industry-affiliated organizations have successfully blocked NGSS adoption, weakened climate content in state standards, and distributed alternative materials to teachers.

### Religious Organizations

**Interest**: Varies. Some denominations accept evolution and do not oppose science education reform. Others view evolution as incompatible with religious belief and seek to weaken its treatment in schools.

**Key Organizations**:

- **Discovery Institute**: The primary promoter of intelligent design and "academic freedom" legislation targeting evolution
- **Answers in Genesis**: Young-earth creationist organization that produces alternative curriculum materials
- **BioLogos**: Founded by Francis Collins, promotes compatibility of faith and evolution. Supports strong evolution education

**Influence**: High in specific states and communities. Religious organizations opposing evolution have been effective at influencing state board elections, textbook adoption, and legislative action.

### Science Education Advocacy Organizations

- **National Science Teaching Association (NSTA)**: Professional organization supporting science teachers and NGSS implementation
- **Smithsonian Science Education Center**: Develops curriculum materials and supports teacher professional development
- **WestEd**: Research and evaluation organization supporting NGSS implementation
- **Exploratorium, AAAS, and museum networks**: Develop informal education resources and advocate for science literacy

## Informal Science Education Institutions

### Science Museums and Centers

**Interest**: Engaging the public with science, reaching underserved communities, supporting formal education.

**Key Organizations**:

- **Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC)**: Network of 600+ science centers and museums worldwide
- **Smithsonian Institution**: Operates multiple science museums with free admission; national reach through traveling exhibits and digital resources
- **Major science museums**: California Science Center, Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago), Exploratorium (San Francisco), and others serve millions annually

**Influence**: Moderate. Museums shape public attitudes toward science and supplement classroom instruction but have limited influence on formal education policy.

### Public Media

- **PBS**: NOVA, Nature, and other science programming; educational resources for teachers
- **National Geographic**: Documentary programming, educational materials, and the National Geographic Bee
- **Digital platforms**: YouTube channels, podcasts, and social media accounts reach millions of young learners outside the classroom

**Influence**: Growing. Digital science content reaches audiences at scale, often more effectively than classroom instruction, but operates independently of formal education systems.

## Power Analysis

The stakeholders with the most influence over science education outcomes are not necessarily those with the greatest expertise or the most at stake:

- **State legislatures** have the most power but are the most susceptible to organized political pressure from ideological minorities
- **Science teachers** have the most direct impact on student learning but the least institutional power
- **Students** are the most affected by science education quality but have no institutional voice
- **Organized opposition** (anti-evolution, anti-climate groups) punches far above its numerical weight because of concentrated intensity, strategic targeting of low-turnout elections, and well-funded national coordination

This power asymmetry -- where those with the most expertise and the greatest stake have the least political power -- is a defining feature of American science education politics.
