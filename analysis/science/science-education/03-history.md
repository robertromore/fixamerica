# Science Education: History

## Early American Science Education (1776-1900)

### The Colonial and Early Republic Period

Science education in the United States was virtually nonexistent in its first century. Most formal education was classical, centered on Latin, Greek, rhetoric, and religious instruction. The few science courses available were called "natural philosophy" and appeared only in elite colleges.

- **1780s-1820s**: Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson advocated for practical scientific education, but implementation was limited
- **1821**: The first public high school (English Classical School, Boston) included rudimentary natural philosophy instruction
- **1848**: The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) founded, providing the first national organization for science promotion
- **1862**: The Morrill Land-Grant Act established colleges with mandates to teach "agriculture and the mechanic arts," creating the first systematic STEM education infrastructure
- **1870s-1890s**: The "object lesson" movement introduced hands-on science teaching in elementary schools, influenced by European pedagogical reformers

### The Darwin Controversy Begins

Charles Darwin's *On the Origin of Species* (1859) generated immediate controversy in American education:

- By the 1880s, evolution was included in most college biology courses
- High school biology textbooks increasingly incorporated evolution through the 1890s and early 1900s
- Religious opposition was present but not yet organized into a political movement

## The Progressive Era and Early Reform (1900-1950)

### The Rise of Science in High Schools

- **1893**: The Committee of Ten (NEA) recommended that science be a core high school subject, proposing courses in physics, chemistry, biology, and physical geography
- **1910s**: High school enrollment expanded dramatically; by 1920, more than 30 percent of American teenagers attended high school, many taking their first formal science courses
- **1914**: The first standardized science curriculum guides appeared at the state level

### The Scopes Trial and Its Aftermath

The legal and political battle over evolution in education crystallized in the 1920s:

- **1920s**: Several states passed anti-evolution laws. Oklahoma (1923), Florida (1923), and Tennessee (1925) enacted statutes prohibiting or restricting the teaching of evolution
- **1925**: *Tennessee v. Scopes* -- The "Monkey Trial." John Scopes was convicted of violating Tennessee's Butler Act by teaching evolution. Though the conviction was later overturned on a technicality, the trial had a chilling effect on science education
- **1925-1960s**: Following Scopes, publishers dramatically reduced evolution content in biology textbooks. By the 1940s, the word "evolution" had virtually disappeared from leading high school biology texts, replaced by euphemisms like "development over time"
- **1930s-1940s**: The anti-evolution movement quieted during the Depression and World War II but left lasting scars on curriculum

### Early Federal Involvement

- **1940s**: Wartime mobilization highlighted the need for scientific training; the Manhattan Project and radar development depended on university-trained scientists
- **1945**: Vannevar Bush's *Science, the Endless Frontier* argued for federal support of scientific education alongside basic research
- **1950**: The National Science Foundation (NSF) established with a mandate that included science education improvement

## The Sputnik Era and National Standards (1957-1980)

### The Sputnik Shock

The Soviet launch of Sputnik on October 4, 1957, triggered the most dramatic transformation of American science education in history:

- **1958**: The National Defense Education Act (NDEA) provided the first large-scale federal funding for science and mathematics education, allocating $1 billion over four years for science equipment, teacher training, and curriculum development
- **1959-1965**: NSF funded development of entirely new science curricula:
    - **PSSC Physics** (Physical Science Study Committee) -- inquiry-based physics for high school
    - **BSCS Biology** (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study) -- three versions of biology curriculum that reintroduced evolution as a central organizing principle
    - **CHEM Study** and **CBA Chemistry** -- reformed chemistry instruction
    - **ESS** (Elementary Science Study) -- hands-on elementary science
- These "alphabet curricula" reached approximately 50 percent of American students by the mid-1960s

### BSCS Biology and the Return of Evolution

The BSCS biology textbooks, first published in 1963, were groundbreaking:

- They placed evolution at the center of biology instruction for the first time in decades
- All three BSCS versions (Blue, Green, Yellow) treated evolution as foundational
- Adoption was controversial: Texas, Tennessee, and other states initially rejected or censored BSCS texts
- By 1970, BSCS materials were used by approximately 50 percent of high school biology students

### Growth and Critique

- **1965**: The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) provided additional federal funding for science education improvement
- **1970s**: The "process approach" to science education emphasized scientific methods and inquiry over content memorization
- **1970s critique**: Some educators and parents argued that inquiry-based curricula were too abstract and insufficiently practical. The "back to basics" movement pushed back against progressive science education

## The Standards Era (1983-2012)

### A Nation at Risk

- **1983**: *A Nation at Risk* warned that American education, including science education, was failing to maintain international competitiveness. The report catalyzed the modern standards movement
- **1985**: AAAS launched *Project 2061*, a comprehensive effort to define what all Americans should know about science. The resulting publication, *Science for All Americans* (1989), established science literacy benchmarks
- **1989**: The National Council on Education Standards and Testing recommended voluntary national standards

### First-Generation National Standards

- **1993**: AAAS published *Benchmarks for Science Literacy*, detailed learning goals organized by grade bands
- **1996**: The National Research Council (NRC) published *National Science Education Standards* (NSES), the first comprehensive national framework for K-12 science education
- NSES emphasized inquiry-based instruction and were widely adopted as the basis for state standards
- However, NSES were voluntary, and state adoption was uneven. Many states wrote standards that referenced NSES but weakened or omitted controversial topics

### No Child Left Behind and Science Testing

- **2002**: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) required science testing at three grade bands but did not make science a "core" subject for accountability purposes alongside reading and mathematics
- Science was tested but not used for school ratings, effectively deprioritizing it relative to reading and math
- Studies found that NCLB led to a measurable reduction in science instructional time, particularly in elementary schools, as teachers and administrators focused on tested accountability subjects

### Creationism and Intelligent Design

The evolution controversy entered a new phase in the 1990s and 2000s:

- **1987**: *Edwards v. Aguillard*, 482 U.S. 578 -- The Supreme Court struck down Louisiana's "Balanced Treatment Act," which required teaching creationism alongside evolution. The Court held this violated the Establishment Clause
- **1990s**: The "intelligent design" (ID) movement emerged as a rebranding of creationism, promoted primarily by the Discovery Institute. ID proponents argued that certain biological structures were "irreducibly complex" and implied a designer
- **2004**: The Dover, Pennsylvania school board voted to require teachers to read a statement promoting intelligent design. Eleven parents sued
- **2005**: *Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District*, 400 F. Supp. 2d 707 (M.D. Pa.) -- Judge John E. Jones III ruled that intelligent design is not science and that requiring its inclusion violated the Establishment Clause. The decision was thorough but applies only in the Middle District of Pennsylvania
- **2005-present**: Following *Kitzmiller*, anti-evolution efforts shifted from promoting specific alternatives to "academic freedom" bills that protect teachers who "question" evolution

### Climate Education Emerges as a Battleground

- **2007**: The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report strengthened scientific consensus on human-caused climate change
- **2008-present**: State legislatures began introducing bills requiring "balanced" presentation of climate science
- **2012**: The Heartland Institute mailed climate-skeptic materials to K-12 science teachers nationwide
- Climate education became entangled with energy industry lobbying, with fossil fuel interests funding organizations that produce alternative classroom materials

## The NGSS Era (2013-Present)

### Development of NGSS

- **2011**: The NRC published *A Framework for K-12 Science Education*, which identified three dimensions of science learning: disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts
- **2013**: The Next Generation Science Standards were released after a development process involving 26 lead states, with input from scientists, teachers, and the broader education community
- NGSS represented a fundamental shift from content-focused standards to performance expectations that integrate content, practices, and crosscutting concepts

### Adoption and Resistance

- **2013-2016**: Early adopters included Rhode Island, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Vermont, and Washington
- **2014**: Indiana became the first state to adopt and then repeal NGSS under political pressure
- **2015-2018**: Wyoming rejected NGSS over concerns about climate change content; Oklahoma's adoption was blocked by a legislative footnote prohibiting implementation
- **2019-2026**: Adoption has slowed. Most states that were likely to adopt have done so. The remaining non-adopting states face political barriers, particularly around evolution and climate content

### Implementation Challenges

Even in NGSS-adopting states, implementation has been difficult:

- Textbooks and curriculum materials aligned to NGSS were slow to develop; most publishers did not release fully aligned materials until 2018-2020
- Teacher professional development has been inadequate; surveys indicate that fewer than 40 percent of science teachers in NGSS states feel prepared to teach three-dimensionally
- Assessment systems have lagged behind standards adoption; most states still use assessments that primarily test factual recall rather than science practices

### COVID-19 Impact

The pandemic significantly disrupted science education:

- Laboratory and hands-on activities were largely eliminated during remote learning (2020-2021)
- Science instructional time was reduced as schools prioritized reading and mathematics recovery
- NAEP science assessment was delayed, making pandemic impact measurement difficult
- Teacher shortages worsened, with science positions among the hardest to fill in post-pandemic recovery
