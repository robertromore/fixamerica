# Science Education: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Science education reform requires action at multiple levels of government. The federal government cannot mandate curriculum or standards (a power reserved to states), but it can incentivize adoption of rigorous standards, protect the integrity of science instruction, invest in teacher quality, and ensure science education is prioritized in accountability systems. This document provides draft federal legislation addressing the two most critical levers: standards integrity and teacher workforce.

## Federal Legislation

### Science Education Standards and Integrity Act

**Purpose**: Establish federal incentives for states to adopt rigorous, evidence-based science standards and protect science curriculum from political interference, while respecting state authority over education.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Science Education Standards
and Integrity Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(a) Science literacy is essential for informed citizenship,
economic competitiveness, and national security.

(b) The United States ranks 16th among OECD nations in
science achievement, and fewer than one in four high school
seniors demonstrate science proficiency.

(c) Science standards vary widely in rigor across states,
with some states maintaining standards that omit or
undermine established scientific consensus on evolution
and climate change.

(d) Political interference in science curriculum undermines
students' ability to understand the natural world and
evaluate scientific evidence.

(e) The Next Generation Science Standards, developed by a
state-led consortium based on the National Research
Council's Framework for K-12 Science Education, represent
the current best evidence for K-12 science instruction.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(a) EVIDENCE-BASED SCIENCE STANDARDS.—The term "evidence-
based science standards" means K-12 science standards
that—
    (1) are based on the current scientific consensus as
    reflected in peer-reviewed literature and reports of
    the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
    Medicine;
    (2) integrate disciplinary core ideas, science and
    engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts;
    (3) include the theory of evolution by natural selection
    as a foundational concept in the life sciences;
    (4) include human-caused climate change as established
    science in the Earth and space sciences; and
    (5) have been reviewed and endorsed by a panel that
    includes active research scientists and science
    education researchers.

(b) SECRETARY.—The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of
Education.

(c) SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS.—The term "scientific consensus"
means the prevailing view among experts in the relevant
scientific field, as reflected in peer-reviewed publications,
reports of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine, and assessments of relevant international
scientific bodies.

SEC. 4. SCIENCE EDUCATION IMPROVEMENT GRANTS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary, in consultation with the
Director of the National Science Foundation, shall
establish a competitive grant program to support states
in adopting and implementing evidence-based science
standards.

(b) ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES.—Grant funds may be used for—
    (1) development or adoption of evidence-based science
    standards;
    (2) development of curriculum materials aligned to
    evidence-based science standards;
    (3) professional development for science teachers in
    three-dimensional instruction;
    (4) development and administration of assessments
    aligned to evidence-based science standards;
    (5) creation of open-source science education resources;
    and
    (6) partnerships between school districts and
    institutions of informal science education, including
    science museums and science centers.

(c) PRIORITY.—In awarding grants, the Secretary shall give
priority to states that—
    (1) have adopted or commit to adopting evidence-based
    science standards within 3 years of receiving the
    grant;
    (2) demonstrate a plan for sustained implementation
    support, including teacher professional development;
    and
    (3) include science as a meaningful component of
    statewide accountability systems.

(d) AMOUNT AND DURATION.—
    (1) Each grant shall be for a period of not more than
    5 years.
    (2) The Secretary shall allocate not less than 40
    percent of grant funds to states with the highest
    percentages of students from low-income families.

(e) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized
to be appropriated $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years
2027 through 2031 to carry out this section.

SEC. 5. SCIENCE EDUCATION INTEGRITY.

(a) PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS.—No funds made
available under this Act or any other federal education
program may be used to—
    (1) develop, adopt, or implement science curriculum or
    instructional materials that present as science any
    explanation that is not based on peer-reviewed
    scientific evidence;
    (2) require or encourage science teachers to present
    non-scientific alternatives to established scientific
    theories, including but not limited to creationism
    and intelligent design, as valid science; or
    (3) penalize science teachers for teaching scientific
    content consistent with the scientific consensus.

(b) TEACHER PROTECTION.—A state or local educational
agency that receives federal education funds shall not
take adverse employment action against a science teacher
for accurately teaching content consistent with scientific
consensus, including evolution by natural selection and
human-caused climate change.

(c) REPORTING.—Each state educational agency shall annually
report to the Secretary—
    (1) the science standards in effect in the state;
    (2) the most recent assessment of those standards by
    an independent expert review; and
    (3) any pending or enacted state legislation that
    restricts or modifies the teaching of specific
    scientific topics.

SEC. 6. SCIENCE ACCOUNTABILITY.

(a) ESSA SCIENCE PROVISIONS.—Section 1111(c) of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.
6311(c)) is amended to require that each state—
    (1) include science assessment results as a meaningful
    component of statewide accountability systems; and
    (2) establish minimum instructional time standards for
    science in elementary schools of not less than 150
    minutes per week.

SEC. 7. INDEPENDENT SCIENCE STANDARDS REVIEW.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary, in consultation with
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine, shall establish an independent Science Standards
Review Board.

(b) DUTIES.—The Board shall—
    (1) review and evaluate state science standards every
    5 years;
    (2) publish a public report assessing each state's
    standards against the criteria established in Section
    3(a); and
    (3) provide technical assistance to states seeking to
    improve their science standards.

(c) COMPOSITION.—The Board shall consist of 15 members,
including—
    (1) 5 active research scientists representing diverse
    scientific disciplines;
    (2) 5 science education researchers;
    (3) 3 experienced K-12 science teachers; and
    (4) 2 representatives of informal science education
    institutions.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3** defines evidence-based science standards using objective criteria tied to scientific consensus and expert review, avoiding the politically charged approach of naming specific standards (NGSS) while establishing functionally equivalent requirements
- **Section 4** creates financial incentives for states to adopt and implement rigorous standards without mandating adoption, respecting state authority under the Tenth Amendment
- **Section 5** uses the federal spending power to prohibit use of federal funds for anti-science instruction, a well-established constitutional mechanism (see *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987))
- **Section 6** addresses the structural deprioritization of science by requiring its inclusion in accountability systems, correcting the NCLB-era omission
- **Section 7** creates an independent review mechanism to publicly assess state science standards quality, providing transparency and accountability

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Tenth Amendment / states' rights | The Act uses incentives and spending conditions, not mandates. States remain free to reject federal funds |
| Establishment Clause concerns | The Act prohibits religious content in science instruction funded by federal dollars, consistent with *Edwards v. Aguillard* and *Kitzmiller* |
| "Federal overreach" framing | The Act was designed to operate through grants and conditions, the least intrusive federal mechanism |
| Political opposition in fossil fuel states | Climate science framing uses "scientific consensus" language, which is factual and defensible |
| First Amendment / teacher speech | The Act does not restrict teacher speech; it restricts the use of federal funds for non-scientific instruction and protects teachers who teach science accurately |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Condition all Title I funding on compliance with Section 5, creating stronger incentives
- **Fallback version**: Limit to the grant program (Section 4) and reporting requirements (Section 5(c)) without spending prohibitions
- **Technical addition**: Include provision for annual inflation adjustment of authorized appropriations

make recommendations for improvement.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** directly addresses the compensation gap that drives science teacher shortages. The $10,000-15,000 supplement is calibrated to significantly narrow (though not close) the gap between teaching and industry salaries
- **Section 5** establishes the residency model as the gold standard for science teacher preparation, replacing the traditional student-teaching semester with a full-year clinical experience
- **Section 6** creates a dedicated loan forgiveness pathway for science teachers that is more generous and faster than existing programs (5 years to full forgiveness vs. 10 years under PSLF)
- **Section 7** addresses the "flat career" problem in teaching by creating advancement pathways that keep expert teachers in classrooms rather than driving them into administration
- **Section 8** expands the proven Noyce program, which has demonstrated strong retention outcomes

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| High cost ($1.1 billion annually) | The cost of not addressing science teacher shortages -- in terms of student achievement, STEM workforce, and economic competitiveness -- is far higher |
| State matching requirement may exclude poorest states | The 25 percent match is designed to ensure state commitment; the Secretary may waive for states demonstrating fiscal hardship |
| Salary supplements may create tension with non-STEM teachers | Supplements are justified by documented shortages and labor market dynamics specific to STEM fields |
| Loan forgiveness creates moral hazard | The 3-5 year teaching commitment requirement ensures that forgiveness produces the desired behavior (teaching in high-need schools) |
| Rural recruitment challenges go beyond compensation | Section 5(d)(2) prioritizes rural districts, and residency programs can be designed for rural contexts |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Include a housing assistance program for science teachers relocating to rural areas ($5,000-10,000 annually)
- **Fallback version**: Limit to Noyce expansion (Section 8) and loan forgiveness (Section 6), which have the strongest evidence base
- **Technical addition**: Index salary supplements to regional cost of living and inflation

## State Model Legislation

### Model Science Education Integrity Act

**Purpose**: Protect science curriculum from political interference at the state level.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Science Education
Integrity Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Science instruction" means instruction in the natural
sciences, including biology, chemistry, physics, and Earth
and space sciences, provided in public elementary and
secondary schools.

(b) "Scientific consensus" means the prevailing view among
experts in the relevant scientific field, as reflected in
peer-reviewed publications and reports of the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

SECTION 3. SCIENCE CURRICULUM STANDARDS.

(a) All science instruction in public schools shall be
based on scientific consensus as defined in this Act.

(b) No public school shall require or encourage the
presentation of non-scientific explanations, including
creationism, creation science, or intelligent design,
as valid alternatives to established scientific theories
in science instruction.

(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit
the discussion of the history or philosophy of science,
provided such discussion does not misrepresent the current
state of scientific knowledge.

SECTION 4. TEACHER PROTECTION.

No teacher shall face adverse employment action for
accurately teaching content consistent with scientific
consensus.

SECTION 5. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act is held invalid, the
remaining provisions shall continue in effect.
```

**Explanation**: This model act provides a template for states seeking to proactively protect science instruction from political interference. It defines science instruction by reference to scientific consensus rather than naming specific standards, providing flexibility and durability.

**Adaptations**: States may add provisions specific to their context, such as references to state-adopted standards, mechanisms for expert review of curriculum challenges, or reporting requirements.

## Regulatory Framework

### Department of Education Science Education Regulations

**Existing Authority**: 20 U.S.C. 6311 (ESSA) authorizes the Secretary of Education to establish requirements for state accountability systems and assessment programs.

**Draft Regulation**:

The Secretary should promulgate regulations requiring:

1. States receiving Title I funds to include science assessment results in their annual reporting to the public
2. States to report the percentage of science classes taught by teachers with full certification in the relevant science discipline
3. States to report the amount of instructional time devoted to science at the elementary level

**Explanation**: These reporting requirements use existing regulatory authority to increase transparency about science education quality without mandating specific curricula or standards.

### NSF Science Education Grant Conditions

**Existing Authority**: 42 U.S.C. 1862 authorizes NSF to support science education programs.

**Draft Regulation**:

NSF should require that all science education programs funded through the Education and Human Resources Directorate:

1. Be consistent with the scientific consensus as reflected in National Academies reports
2. Incorporate three-dimensional learning approaches as described in the NRC Framework
3. Include evaluation components that measure student outcomes

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Tenth Amendment**: Education is reserved to the states. All federal provisions must operate through incentives, conditions on funding, or technical assistance -- not mandates
- **Establishment Clause**: The prohibition on teaching creationism and intelligent design as science is well-supported by *Edwards v. Aguillard* (1987) and *Kitzmiller v. Dover* (2005). Federal legislation reinforcing this principle operates within established constitutional boundaries
- **Free Speech**: Teachers retain the right to personal beliefs. The legislation restricts the content of publicly funded instruction, not teacher speech outside the classroom. This is consistent with *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), which held that public employee speech pursuant to official duties may be regulated
- **Spending Clause**: The grant conditions are constitutional under *South Dakota v. Dole* as they are related to a legitimate federal interest, not coercive, and clearly stated

### Preemption Questions

- Federal legislation does not preempt state authority over education. States remain free to set their own standards
- The spending conditions create incentives, not mandates. States that choose not to participate simply forgo federal funding under these specific programs
- State "academic freedom" laws (Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi) would remain in effect but would conflict with conditions for receiving federal funds under the proposed legislation

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- Grant conditions enforced through standard federal grant compliance procedures
- Teacher protection provisions enforced through complaints to the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights
- Science Standards Review Board reports provide public accountability even without enforcement mechanisms
- State reporting requirements create transparency and public pressure

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Grant programs authorized for 5-year periods, requiring reauthorization
- Independent evaluation required after 5 years (STEM Teacher Act, Section 9)
- Science Standards Review Board conducts reviews every 5 years

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Science Education Standards and Integrity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Standards relabeling | States could adopt standards that nominally meet criteria but weaken implementation through guidance or approved curriculum materials | High |
| Voluntary participation | States most in need of reform may simply decline to participate in the grant program | High |
| "History of science" exception | Section 3(c) of the model state act could be exploited to present creationism as a legitimate historical scientific perspective | Medium |
| Assessment gaming | States could develop assessments that technically meet requirements but fail to measure three-dimensional learning | Medium |
| Definition of scientific consensus | Opponents could challenge specific findings as not representing "consensus" | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Cannot compel non-participating states | Students in non-participating states receive no benefit | Tenth Amendment limitations on federal authority |
| Grant funding may be insufficient | $200M/year may not cover implementation costs in all participating states | Political constraints on appropriations |
| Teacher protection may be difficult to enforce | Individual teachers may not file complaints due to fear of retaliation | Power imbalance between individual teachers and school systems |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Include whistleblower protections for teachers who report violations, with anonymous complaint mechanisms
2. Condition a larger share of existing federal education funding (Title I, Title II) on compliance with science education integrity provisions
3. Require that standards review include examination of approved curriculum materials and assessments, not just the standards documents themselves
4. Establish a legal defense fund for teachers who face retaliation for teaching scientific consensus

### STEM Teacher Recruitment and Retention Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Certification gaming | States could lower certification standards to make more teachers eligible for supplements without improving quality | High |
| Residency quality variation | Residency programs could vary widely in quality if minimum standards are insufficiently specific | Medium |
| Supplement displacement | Districts could reduce base salaries for science teachers, offsetting the federal supplement | Medium |
| Loan forgiveness churning | Teachers could complete the 5-year commitment and then leave, creating recurring shortages | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Supplements do not fully close compensation gap | STEM industry salaries may still be significantly higher | Political constraints on appropriation levels |
| Rural recruitment challenges beyond compensation | Housing, isolation, and spouse employment are not addressed by salary supplements alone | Structural rural challenges |
| Career ladder positions require new school funding | Schools may not be able to sustain career ladder positions after federal funding ends | Sustainability of external funding |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require that states maintain or increase base teacher salary levels as a condition of receiving supplement funding (non-supplanting provision)
2. Establish minimum quality standards for residency programs, including required mentor teacher qualifications, minimum observation hours, and performance benchmarks
3. Extend the teaching commitment period for loan forgiveness to 7 years to improve long-term retention
4. Include a rural recruitment supplement that covers housing assistance and relocation costs

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Coordination across federal agencies | Establish interagency STEM education coordination office at OSTP |
| Program fragmentation | Consolidate overlapping STEM education programs as recommended by GAO |
| Data gaps | Require unified reporting on science teacher qualifications, instructional time, and student outcomes |
| Political sustainability | Authorize programs for 5-year periods with required evaluations |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- All grant programs authorized for 5-year periods, requiring congressional reauthorization based on evaluation results
- Independent evaluation at Year 5 assessing program effectiveness and cost-efficiency
- Science Standards Review Board provides ongoing monitoring of standards quality
- Annual reporting to Congress on program participation, teacher retention, and student achievement trends
