# Science Education: Overview

## Executive Summary

American science education is failing to produce a scientifically literate citizenry. Despite decades of reform efforts, U.S. students consistently perform at or below the international median on science assessments, millions of adults cannot distinguish evidence-based claims from pseudoscience, and politically driven controversies over teaching evolution and climate change continue to undermine classroom instruction in at least a dozen states. The result is a public ill-equipped to evaluate the scientific dimensions of issues from pandemic response to energy policy.

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), released in 2013, represented the most ambitious overhaul of K-12 science standards in a generation. Built on the National Research Council's *Framework for K-12 Science Education*, NGSS emphasize three-dimensional learning: disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts. Yet as of 2026, only 23 states and the District of Columbia have adopted NGSS or substantially NGSS-aligned standards. The remaining states maintain a patchwork of varying rigor, with some actively weakening treatment of evolution and climate science under political pressure.

The science teacher workforce is in crisis. Fewer than 40 percent of middle school science teachers hold a degree in a science discipline. Rural and high-poverty districts struggle to recruit and retain qualified science educators. Professional development remains fragmented and underfunded. Meanwhile, informal science education institutions -- museums, science centers, after-school programs, and public media -- reach millions of learners but operate largely disconnected from formal schooling.

Strengthening science education requires coordinated action: completing NGSS adoption and implementation, investing in science teacher preparation and retention, defending evidence-based curriculum from political interference, expanding informal science learning, and developing meaningful science literacy assessments that go beyond standardized test scores.

## Key Questions

1. **Why do U.S. students underperform on science assessments?** What structural factors explain the gap between American science education and top-performing nations?

2. **Why have fewer than half of states adopted NGSS?** What political, institutional, and pedagogical barriers block adoption of evidence-based standards?

3. **How do evolution and climate controversies affect classroom instruction?** What is the real-world impact of political interference on what students learn?

4. **Can science teacher quality be improved at scale?** What preparation, support, and compensation changes would attract and retain qualified science educators?

5. **How can informal science education complement formal schooling?** What role should museums, science centers, and community programs play in building science literacy?

6. **What does meaningful science literacy look like?** How should we measure whether students and adults can think scientifically, beyond test scores?

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| States adopting NGSS or aligned standards | 23 + D.C. (as of 2026) |
| NAEP science proficiency, grade 4 (2019) | 36% at or above proficient |
| NAEP science proficiency, grade 8 (2019) | 35% at or above proficient |
| NAEP science proficiency, grade 12 (2019) | 22% at or above proficient |

| Adults who can define a scientific hypothesis | ~28% |
| Federal spending on STEM education programs | ~$3.4 billion/year |

## Why This Matters

Science education is the foundation for both individual opportunity and collective decision-making:

| Dimension | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Economic competitiveness | Nations with stronger science education produce more innovation and higher GDP growth |
| Democratic governance | Citizens must evaluate scientific evidence on health, environment, and technology policy |
| Public health | Scientific literacy predicts vaccine acceptance, disease prevention, and health outcomes |
| National security | STEM workforce pipeline begins in K-12 classrooms |
| Equity | Science achievement gaps mirror and reinforce socioeconomic and racial disparities |
| Environmental stewardship | Understanding climate science is prerequisite for informed energy and environmental policy |

## The Opportunity

Despite significant challenges, the conditions for improvement exist:

- **NGSS provides a strong framework**: The standards are well-designed and evidence-based; the challenge is adoption and implementation
- **Bipartisan STEM support**: Broad political agreement on the importance of STEM education, even where specific content is contested
- **Informal learning is growing**: Science museums, maker spaces, and citizen science platforms are expanding reach
- **Technology enables access**: Digital simulations, virtual labs, and online courses can supplement classroom instruction
- **International models work**: Nations like Finland, Singapore, and Canada demonstrate that high science literacy is achievable through deliberate policy
