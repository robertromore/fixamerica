# Science Education: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to science education reform in the United States takes several distinct forms, each with different motivations, strategies, and levels of influence. Understanding this opposition is essential for designing reforms that can navigate political resistance and achieve durable improvements.

## Anti-Evolution Opposition

### Motivations

Opposition to evolution education is primarily religious and cultural:

- **Young-earth creationism**: Belief that the Earth is approximately 6,000-10,000 years old and that life was created in its present form by God, as described literally in the Book of Genesis. Adherents view evolution as incompatible with their faith and as a threat to religious authority
- **Old-earth creationism and intelligent design**: Acceptance of the age of the Earth but rejection of unguided natural selection as the mechanism for biological diversity. Proponents argue that a designer must be invoked to explain biological complexity
- **Cultural identity**: For many communities, opposition to evolution is not primarily about biology but about resisting perceived secular cultural dominance. Defending creationism signals group identity and solidarity

### Key Organizations

| Organization | Approach | Influence |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Discovery Institute | Promotes "intelligent design" and "academic freedom" bills; targets state legislatures and school boards | High -- most effective national organization in weakening evolution education |
| Answers in Genesis | Young-earth creationism; produces curriculum materials, operates Creation Museum and Ark Encounter | Moderate -- shapes beliefs among evangelical communities but less effective in policy |
| Institute for Creation Research | Produces creationist publications and curriculum materials | Low-moderate -- primarily influences already-sympathetic audiences |
| State-level groups | Local organizations that mobilize for school board elections and testify at legislative hearings | High in targeted states |

### Strategies

Anti-evolution organizations have refined their strategies over decades of legal defeats:

1. **"Academic freedom" bills**: The current primary strategy. These bills protect teachers who present "scientific strengths and weaknesses" of evolution, effectively providing legal cover for teaching creationism without explicitly mandating it. Tennessee (2012), Louisiana (2008), and Mississippi (2006) have enacted such laws

2. **"Teach the controversy"**: Framing the scientific consensus on evolution as a "debate" that students should evaluate critically. This misrepresents the state of scientific knowledge, where evolution is as well-supported as any theory in biology

3. **Textbook pressure**: Lobbying state textbook adoption committees to weaken evolution content, add disclaimers, or include alternative perspectives. Texas's State Board of Education has been the primary venue for this strategy

4. **School board capture**: Organized campaigns to elect anti-evolution candidates to state and local school boards, leveraging low turnout in school board elections

5. **Stealth standards**: In states that set their own standards, advocates have successfully weakened evolution language without eliminating it entirely -- for example, requiring that students "evaluate" or "analyze" evolution rather than "understand" or "explain" it

### Counterarguments

| Opposition Claim | Evidence-Based Response |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Evolution is "just a theory" | In science, "theory" means a well-supported explanatory framework, not a guess. Gravity, germ theory, and atomic theory are also "theories" |
| Teaching evolution infringes religious freedom | No student is required to believe evolution. Understanding scientific evidence is different from adopting a belief system. Courts have consistently held this distinction |
| There is genuine scientific controversy about evolution | There is no significant scientific disagreement about whether evolution occurs. Debates within evolutionary biology concern mechanisms and details, not the fundamental fact of evolution |
| Students should think critically about all claims | Critical thinking requires understanding the evidence. Presenting creationism as equivalent to evolution misrepresents the evidence and undermines genuine critical thinking |
| Parents should control what their children learn | Public schools have a legitimate interest in teaching established science. Parents retain the right to supplement with religious instruction outside school |

## Anti-Climate Education Opposition

### Motivations

Opposition to climate change education combines ideological, economic, and cultural factors:

- **Economic interest**: Communities dependent on fossil fuel extraction view climate education as a threat to their livelihoods and economic identity
- **Anti-regulation ideology**: Teaching climate science is perceived as building support for government regulation of energy, which some political philosophies oppose on principle
- **Partisan identity**: Climate skepticism has become a marker of conservative political identity, independent of the underlying science
- **Distrust of scientific institutions**: Broader skepticism about academic and government science is concentrated among politically conservative populations

### Key Organizations

| Organization | Approach | Influence |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Heartland Institute | Distributes climate-skeptic materials to teachers; produces "NIPCC" reports designed to mimic IPCC | High -- reached tens of thousands of teachers through direct mail campaigns |
| American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) | Promotes model legislation requiring "balanced" treatment of climate science | High -- legislative templates adopted in multiple states |
| State Policy Network affiliates | State-level think tanks that oppose NGSS adoption, particularly climate content | Moderate to high in targeted states |
| CO2 Coalition | Produces materials claiming CO2 is beneficial; provides speakers for schools | Low-moderate |
| PragerU | Produces videos targeting young audiences with climate-skeptic content; gained official approval for use in some states | Growing |

### Strategies

1. **"Balanced treatment" legislation**: Bills requiring teachers to present "all sides" of climate science, treating the manufactured "debate" as equivalent to scientific consensus. This echoes the evolution strategy

2. **Alternative materials distribution**: Mailing climate-skeptic materials directly to science teachers. The Heartland Institute's 2017 campaign reached teachers in all 50 states with materials asserting that global warming is natural and beneficial

3. **NGSS adoption blocking**: Organizing opposition to NGSS adoption specifically because the standards treat human-caused climate change as established science. This has been effective in Wyoming, Oklahoma, and other energy-producing states

4. **Teacher intimidation**: In some communities, teachers report receiving complaints, threats, or professional consequences for teaching climate science. This creates a chilling effect broader than any specific policy

5. **Textbook challenges**: Lobbying to weaken climate content in state-adopted textbooks or to require inclusion of skeptic viewpoints

### Counterarguments

| Opposition Claim | Evidence-Based Response |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| The science is not settled | The scientific consensus on human-caused climate change exceeds 99 percent among publishing climate scientists (Lynas et al., 2021) |
| Climate has always changed | True, but current warming is unprecedented in rate and is attributable to human greenhouse gas emissions, as documented by multiple independent lines of evidence |
| Teaching climate science is political indoctrination | Teaching established science is not indoctrination. Policy responses are debatable; the underlying science is not |
| Students should hear both sides | There is no scientifically credible "other side." Presenting manufactured doubt alongside scientific consensus is a form of misinformation |
| Climate education threatens energy jobs | Understanding climate science does not preclude support for fossil fuel workers. Education should include the economic dimensions of energy transitions |

## Opposition to NGSS Adoption

### Motivations

Opposition to NGSS adoption goes beyond evolution and climate content:

- **States' rights and local control**: Some oppose NGSS as a federal overreach, associating it with Common Core despite the different development processes
- **Content concerns**: Some educators and policymakers believe NGSS sacrifices content depth for breadth and practices integration
- **Implementation costs**: Adopting NGSS requires new curriculum materials, professional development, and assessments, which strain already tight budgets
- **Political bundling**: In some states, opposition to NGSS is bundled with opposition to Common Core, federal education policy generally, or specific political parties

### Key Arguments Against NGSS

| Argument | Validity | Context |
|----------|----------|---------|
| NGSS is a federal mandate | False. NGSS was developed by a state-led consortium. No federal law requires adoption | Used to mobilize anti-federal-government sentiment |
| NGSS reduces content rigor | Partially valid. NGSS covers fewer topics in greater depth. Some critics argue important content is omitted | Legitimate pedagogical debate distinct from political opposition |
| NGSS is too prescriptive | Mostly false. NGSS sets performance expectations, not curricula. States and districts retain flexibility in implementation | Misunderstands the standards-curriculum distinction |
| NGSS implementation is too expensive | Partially valid. Full implementation requires significant investment in materials, training, and assessment | Legitimate concern, but cost of inaction also significant |
| NGSS is linked to Common Core | False. Different development process, different organizations, different subjects | Guilt by association in states hostile to Common Core |

## Opposition to Federal STEM Investment

### Motivations

- **Fiscal conservatism**: Opposition to increased federal spending on STEM education programs, regardless of their effectiveness
- **Anti-government ideology**: Belief that education should be entirely state and local, with no federal role
- **Crowding-out concerns**: Worry that federal STEM programs displace state and private efforts

### Key Arguments

- Federal STEM education programs are fragmented and duplicative (partially valid -- GAO has documented this)
- Federal investment distorts state and local priorities (debatable -- depends on program design)
- Private industry should fund STEM education it benefits from (ignores public-good aspects of science literacy)

## Effectiveness of Opposition

The various opposition movements have achieved measurable results:

| Opposition Type | States Directly Affected | Indirect Effects |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Anti-evolution legislation | 3 with enacted laws; 20+ with introduced bills | Teacher self-censorship in at least 30 states |
| Anti-climate legislation | 5+ with enacted or pending measures | Chilling effect on climate instruction nationwide |
| NGSS adoption blocking | 19 states without NGSS-aligned standards | Perpetuates standards patchwork |
| Textbook weakening | Texas plus states that adopt Texas-influenced texts | National textbook content diluted |
| School board capture | Dozens of local boards; several state boards | Curriculum decisions driven by ideology |

The cumulative effect is that millions of American students receive science education that is weaker, less complete, and less evidence-based than what the scientific community recommends and what many other nations provide.

## Responding to Opposition

Effective responses to science education opposition must address the underlying motivations, not just the surface arguments:

- **For religious concerns**: Emphasize that science education teaches the evidence, not what students must believe. Highlight organizations like BioLogos that demonstrate compatibility of faith and science
- **For economic concerns**: Connect science education to economic opportunity and workforce development in language that resonates with community values
- **For local control concerns**: Emphasize that NGSS is voluntary and that states retain curriculum and implementation decisions
- **For cost concerns**: Provide evidence of the long-term economic returns to science education investment and document the costs of inadequate science literacy
- **For partisan concerns**: Build bipartisan coalitions by focusing on shared goals (economic competitiveness, national security, student opportunity) rather than partisan framing
