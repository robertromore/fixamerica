# Science Education: Current State

## Student Achievement

### National Assessment (NAEP)

The National Assessment of Educational Progress provides the most comprehensive picture of U.S. student science performance. Results are sobering:

| Grade | Below Basic | Basic | Proficient | Advanced |
|-------|-------------|-------|------------|----------|
| Grade 4 (2019) | 24% | 40% | 30% | 6% |
| Grade 8 (2019) | 32% | 33% | 28% | 7% |
| Grade 12 (2019) | 30% | 48% | 19% | 3% |

Key findings from the most recent NAEP science results:

- Proficiency rates have remained essentially flat since 2009 despite reform efforts
- Only 22 percent of 12th graders perform at or above proficient, meaning fewer than one in four graduating seniors demonstrate competency in science
- Achievement gaps by race and socioeconomic status remain wide: White students score an average of 33 points higher than Black students and 26 points higher than Hispanic students at grade 8
- Students eligible for free/reduced lunch score an average of 28 points lower than ineligible students
- Gender gaps in science have narrowed but persist in physical sciences and engineering

### International Comparisons

U.S. student performance on international assessments reveals a persistent gap with top-performing nations:

**PISA 2022 Science Results (Selected Countries)**:

| Country | Mean Score | U.S. Gap |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Japan | 547 | -47 |
| South Korea | 528 | -28 |
| Estonia | 526 | -26 |
| Canada | 515 | -15 |
| Finland | 511 | -11 |
| **United States** | **500** | **--** |
| OECD Average | 485 | +15 |
| Italy | 477 | +23 |

**TIMSS 2023 (Grade 8 Science)**:

- Singapore, Chinese Taipei, and Japan consistently rank in the top five
- The U.S. ranks in the upper-middle range, above the international median but below most East Asian and several European systems
- The U.S. score has not improved significantly since 2007

### Achievement Gaps

Science achievement gaps reflect and reinforce broader inequities:

- **Racial/ethnic gaps**: Black and Hispanic students are approximately three times less likely than White and Asian students to score proficient on NAEP science
- **Income gaps**: Students from low-income families score 1.5 to 2 grade levels behind peers from higher-income families
- **Geographic gaps**: Rural students in the South and Mountain West have the lowest science proficiency rates nationally
- **Disability gaps**: Students with disabilities score an average of 40 points below students without disabilities on NAEP
- **English learner gaps**: English learners score an average of 50 points below native English speakers

## Standards Landscape

### NGSS Adoption Status

The Next Generation Science Standards were released in April 2013 after a multi-year development process led by 26 states and managed by Achieve, Inc. As of 2026:

| Category | States | Count |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Adopted NGSS verbatim | CA, CT, DE, HI, IL, IA, KS, KY, MD, MI, NV, NH, NJ, NM, OR, RI, VT, WA, WV, D.C. | 19 + D.C. |
| Adopted substantially aligned standards | AR, GA, MA, NY | 4 |
| Partially aligned or in transition | CO, ID, ME, MT, NC, WI | 6 |
| Non-aligned or opposed | AL, AZ, FL, IN, LA, MS, MO, NE, ND, OH, OK, PA, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WY | 19 |
| Reviewing/undetermined | AK, MN | 2 |

### Non-NGSS State Standards

States that have not adopted NGSS vary widely in quality:

- **Texas** maintains standards that avoid the term "climate change" and use weakened language on evolution, describing it as a theory students should "evaluate"
- **Florida** adopted standards in 2008 that first used the word "evolution" but still include "academic freedom" provisions allowing teachers to present unspecified "alternatives"
- **Ohio** revised standards in 2018 that substantially weakened climate science coverage compared to earlier drafts
- **Virginia** maintains its own standards (SOLs) that are reasonably rigorous but lack the three-dimensional integration of NGSS
- **Indiana** adopted and then repealed NGSS in 2014 under political pressure, replacing them with weaker standards

### Standards Quality Variation

The Thomas B. Fordham Institute has rated state science standards on an A-F scale:

| Grade | States (Count) | Key Characteristics |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| A | 8 | NGSS or equivalent rigor; strong evolution and climate coverage |
| B | 7 | Generally strong; minor weaknesses in specific areas |
| C | 12 | Adequate in some areas; significant gaps in others |
| D | 13 | Weak in multiple domains; hedging on evolution or climate |
| F | 10 | Fundamentally inadequate; missing or undermined core content |

## Evolution and Climate Controversies

### Evolution Education

Despite unambiguous scientific consensus and clear legal precedent since *Edwards v. Aguillard*, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), evolution education remains politically contested:

- **"Academic freedom" bills**: Since 2004, over 80 bills in more than 20 states have proposed allowing teachers to "teach the controversy" about evolution, intelligent design, or the origin of life. As of 2026, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Mississippi have enacted such laws.
- **Teacher self-censorship**: Surveys by the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) find that approximately 13 percent of high school biology teachers present creationism as a valid scientific alternative, while another 60 percent minimize evolution instruction to avoid controversy
- **Textbook pressures**: Texas, as the second-largest textbook market, exerts outsized influence on national textbook content through its State Board of Education review process

### Climate Change Education

Climate education faces even more active opposition than evolution:

- **State restrictions**: At least 12 states have considered or enacted legislation requiring "balanced" presentation of climate science, presenting manufactured doubt alongside scientific consensus
- **Teacher preparedness**: A 2023 survey by the National Science Teaching Association found that only 54 percent of science teachers feel confident teaching climate change, and 30 percent report pressure from parents, administrators, or community members to downplay or omit the topic
- **Textbook gaps**: Analysis by researchers at North Carolina State University found that leading middle and high school science textbooks devote an average of fewer than 10 pages to climate change, with some omitting human causation or presenting false balance
- **Fossil fuel industry influence**: Organizations funded by fossil fuel companies, including the Heartland Institute, have distributed materials to K-12 teachers in all 50 states promoting climate skepticism

## Science Teacher Workforce

### Qualifications

The science teacher workforce faces significant quality and quantity challenges:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| High school science teachers with science degree and full certification | ~72% |
| Middle school science teachers with science degree | ~39% |
| Science classes taught by teachers without certification in the subject | ~22% nationally, ~34% in high-poverty schools |
| States with science teacher shortages | 48 |
| Average science teacher salary (national) | ~$65,000 |
| Average science teacher salary vs. STEM industry entry | 40-60% lower |

### Recruitment and Retention

- Annual attrition rate for science teachers is approximately 16 percent, higher than the 13 percent average for all teachers
- High-poverty and rural schools experience 20-25 percent annual turnover for science positions
- Alternative certification pathways (Teach for America, state-specific programs) fill approximately 20 percent of new science teaching positions but have lower retention rates
- The Noyce Scholarship program (NSF) supports approximately 3,600 new STEM teachers annually, meeting roughly 5 percent of the estimated need

### Professional Development

- Most science teachers receive fewer than 20 hours of science-specific professional development annually
- Only 35 percent of professional development for science teachers is aligned with NGSS or current science education research
- Teachers in NGSS-adopting states are more likely to receive three-dimensional learning training but report that available professional development is insufficient for full implementation

## Informal Science Education

### Science Museums and Centers

- The United States has over 700 science museums, science centers, natural history museums, and planetariums
- Annual attendance exceeds 95 million visits
- The Association of Science and Technology Centers (ASTC) reports that museums collectively serve approximately 12 million students through school field trips annually
- Museum audiences skew toward higher-income, more-educated, White populations; equity and access remain significant challenges

### After-School and Out-of-School Programs

- Approximately 10 million students participate in some form of after-school STEM programming
- Programs like FIRST Robotics, Science Olympiad, and 4-H reach approximately 4 million students annually
- Participation rates are significantly lower among students from low-income families, rural communities, and communities of color
- The 21st Century Community Learning Centers program, the largest federal after-school funding source, allocates approximately $1.3 billion annually, but only a fraction supports STEM-specific programming

### Public Media and Digital Learning

- PBS programming including *NOVA* and *SciShow* reaches millions of viewers annually
- YouTube science channels (Kurzgesagt, Veritasium, SmarterEveryDay) collectively reach hundreds of millions of monthly viewers
- Digital simulations and virtual labs (PhET, Labster) are used in approximately 30 percent of U.S. high school science classes
- Citizen science platforms (iNaturalist, Zooniverse, Globe Observer) engage approximately 2.5 million U.S. participants annually

## Federal STEM Education Programs

The federal government supports science education through multiple agencies:

| Agency | Program | Annual Funding |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| NSF | Education and Human Resources Directorate | ~$1.1 billion |
| Department of Education | STEM-focused grant programs | ~$800 million |
| NASA | Office of STEM Engagement | ~$143 million |
| NIH | Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) | ~$24 million |
| DOE | Office of Science Workforce Development | ~$30 million |
| NOAA | Education programs | ~$30 million |
| Smithsonian | Education programs | ~$50 million |

Total federal STEM education spending is approximately $3.4 billion annually, spread across more than 100 programs at 13 agencies. A 2018 GAO report found significant fragmentation, overlap, and lack of coordination among these programs.

## State-Level Variation

Science education quality varies enormously by state, creating a zip-code lottery for students:

- **Top-performing states** (Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire): High standards, well-prepared teachers, strong funding, consistent NAEP performance in top quartile
- **Middle-performing states**: Adequate standards but implementation gaps, teacher shortages in specific subjects or regions
- **Low-performing states** (Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama): Weak or compromised standards, severe teacher shortages, lowest NAEP scores, most likely to have anti-evolution or anti-climate legislation

The variation means that a student's science education depends heavily on where they live, not just on their own aptitude or effort.
