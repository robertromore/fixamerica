# Technology Transfer: Opposition

## Overview

Efforts to reform the technology transfer system face organized, well-funded, and politically connected opposition. The current framework distributes substantial benefits to powerful constituencies -- pharmaceutical companies, major research universities, and the venture capital industry -- who actively resist changes that might reduce their advantages. Understanding the structure, strategies, and arguments of opposition forces is essential for crafting reforms that can overcome resistance.

## Primary Opposition Forces

### Pharmaceutical Industry

**Organization**: Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), individual companies

**What they oppose**:

- Exercise of march-in rights to address drug pricing
- Any interpretation of "reasonable terms" that includes price
- Mandatory pricing provisions tied to federal research funding
- Government licenses being exercised to enable generic competition
- Transparency requirements linking public funding to drug prices

**Arguments**:

- March-in rights were never intended to control prices; the legislative history supports an availability-only interpretation
- Exercising march-in would destroy the incentive for companies to invest billions in developing publicly funded inventions into approved drugs
- University research is early-stage and represents a small fraction of total drug development costs; the private sector bears the significant financial risk
- Price controls would reduce industry investment in R&D, ultimately harming patients
- Other countries' lower prices are the result of free-riding on U.S. innovation

**Resources and tactics**:

- Over $350 million in annual lobbying expenditures; PhRMA alone spent $31 million in 2023
- Among the largest political campaign contributors across both parties
- Extensive revolving door between industry, FDA, NIH, and congressional staff
- Funded academic research and legal analysis supporting their positions
- Grassroots-style campaigns through patient advocacy groups that receive industry funding

**Effectiveness**: Very high. The pharmaceutical industry has successfully prevented march-in from ever being exercised and has shaped regulatory interpretations that effectively exclude price from the analysis.

### Major Research Universities

**Organization**: Association of American Universities (AAU), Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM), Council on Governmental Relations (COGR)

**What they oppose**:

- March-in rights exercised on university-licensed inventions
- New reporting burdens on technology transfer activities
- Restrictions on exclusive licensing
- Open-source or open-access requirements for publicly funded inventions
- Government recoupment of licensing revenue
- Limitations on university equity stakes in startups

**Arguments**:

- Bayh-Dole's success depends on the certainty of institutional patent rights; undermining this certainty would chill university innovation
- Universities invest significant resources in patenting and licensing; exclusive licenses are often necessary to attract the private investment needed for commercialization
- Revenue from technology transfer supports the academic mission, including further research and education
- University TTOs already operate under tight budgets; additional reporting requirements would divert scarce resources
- The current system has produced enormous benefits, including thousands of startups and billions in licensing revenue

**Resources and tactics**:

- AAU represents 71 major research universities with combined research expenditures exceeding $80 billion
- University presidents and government relations offices maintain strong relationships with congressional delegations
- Universities provide extensive comment letters in response to proposed rules
- AUTM conducts annual surveys and publishes data that frames the system positively
- Academic researchers at member institutions publish scholarship supporting the current framework

**Effectiveness**: High. Universities have successfully maintained the Bayh-Dole framework largely intact for over 40 years and have consistently opposed march-in petitions through lobbying and public comment.

### Venture Capital Industry

**Organization**: National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), individual firms

**What they oppose**:

- Compulsory licensing that would undermine exclusive licenses in their portfolio companies
- Requirements that reduce the patent protection available to university spinouts
- Regulations that increase the cost or uncertainty of licensing university IP
- Restrictions on foreign ownership or investment in companies licensing federally funded IP

**Arguments**:

- Venture investment requires strong IP protection; weakening university patents would make university spinouts uninvestable
- Exclusive licenses are essential for startups to compete against established companies
- The VC model depends on the ability to capture significant returns from successful investments; reducing IP protection reduces returns and therefore investment
- Any reform that increases regulatory uncertainty will cause VC firms to redirect investment away from deep-tech to lower-risk sectors

**Resources and tactics**:

- VC firms have significant political influence through personal networks and campaign contributions
- Industry events and media create narratives celebrating the university-VC-startup pipeline
- Individual VC partners serve on university boards and government advisory panels
- NVCA provides policy analysis and advocacy on IP and innovation issues

**Effectiveness**: Moderate to high. VC concerns about IP certainty are taken seriously by policymakers and university administrators.

## Secondary Opposition

### Federal Agencies (Institutional Resistance)

While agencies are not openly "opposed" to reform, institutional dynamics create de facto resistance:

- **NIH**: Has denied every march-in petition filed, establishing a strong internal precedent against exercise. The agency's close relationships with pharmaceutical industry partners create institutional reluctance to disrupt existing arrangements
- **NIST**: Proposed a 2023 framework that would codify the position that price is not a basis for march-in, suggesting institutional alignment with industry positions
- **DOD**: Prioritizes technology access for defense applications and may resist reforms perceived as slowing military technology development
- **SBA**: Defends the SBIR/STTR programs against criticism and resists reforms that might reduce the set-aside percentages

### Technology Transfer Professionals

Individual TTO staff and licensing managers may resist reforms that change their established workflows, evaluation criteria, or professional identity. AUTM provides a professional community that reinforces current practices and norms.

### Patent Bar and IP Attorneys

Patent attorneys who specialize in university licensing have financial interests in maintaining a system that generates patent prosecution, licensing negotiation, and litigation work. The IP legal community tends to favor strong patent rights and resist reforms that would weaken exclusive licensing.

## Opposition Arguments and Counterarguments

### "March-In Would Destroy Innovation"

**Argument**: If the government could march in based on price, companies would not invest in developing publicly funded inventions, and breakthrough drugs would never reach patients.

**Counterargument**: March-in is a targeted tool for specific cases of abuse, not a general price control. Companies would still have strong incentives to develop inventions even with a meaningful march-in backstop. Moreover, the threat of march-in could itself reduce pricing abuses, achieving the public benefit objective without actual exercise. Countries with compulsory licensing provisions (e.g., Canada, Germany) continue to attract pharmaceutical investment.

### "Universities Need Revenue from Licensing"

**Argument**: Technology transfer revenue supports the academic mission, funding further research and education. Reforms that reduce revenue would harm universities and the public interest.

**Counterargument**: Fewer than 20% of university TTOs generate positive net revenue. For the vast majority of universities, technology transfer is a cost center. The few institutions that generate significant revenue do so from a handful of blockbuster patents, and that revenue represents a tiny fraction of total university budgets. Maximizing licensing revenue should not take precedence over the public interest in affordable access to publicly funded inventions.

### "Bayh-Dole Is a Success Story"

**Argument**: Before Bayh-Dole, government-owned patents were rarely commercialized. The Act unleashed university innovation, creating new industries and economic growth. Reform risks breaking a system that works.

**Counterargument**: Bayh-Dole was a significant improvement over the prior system, but that does not mean it cannot be improved further. The Act was designed for a 1980 economy; the innovation landscape has changed dramatically. The Act's accountability mechanisms (march-in rights, reporting requirements) were included precisely because the framers anticipated that the system might need correction. Refusing to use those mechanisms is itself a departure from the Act's design.

### "Exclusive Licenses Are Necessary for Commercialization"

**Argument**: Companies will not invest the billions needed to develop a new drug unless they have exclusive patent rights that guarantee a period of monopoly pricing to recoup their investment.

**Counterargument**: Exclusive licenses may be appropriate for some technologies, but the default should not be exclusivity. Many technologies can be successfully commercialized through non-exclusive licenses, particularly platform technologies and research tools. When exclusive licenses are granted, they should include conditions protecting public access, including pricing provisions, and the government should retain meaningful rights to intervene when terms are unreasonable.

---

### "Price Controls Would Reduce R&D Investment"

**Argument**: If companies cannot freely set prices, they will invest less in R&D, and patients will ultimately suffer from fewer new drugs.

**Counterargument**: The United States already has the highest drug prices in the world, yet pharmaceutical R&D productivity (measured by approved drugs per dollar invested) has declined for decades. Much pharmaceutical R&D spending goes to marginal modifications of existing drugs rather than genuinely innovative treatments. International evidence suggests that countries with price negotiation or reference pricing continue to see robust pharmaceutical innovation. The critical question is whether the marginal return on extreme pricing actually flows to innovative R&D or to shareholder returns and marketing.

---

### "Additional Reporting Is Burdensome"

**Argument**: Universities and small businesses already face heavy compliance burdens; new reporting requirements would divert resources from research and innovation.

**Counterargument**: If public institutions receive public funds and public patent rights, accountability reporting is not an unreasonable burden. Modern data systems can reduce the cost of reporting significantly. Taxpayers have a right to know what their investment produces and on what terms it is made available. The current system's lack of transparency enables practices that may not serve the public interest.

## Political Dynamics

### Bipartisan Opposition to Reform

Technology transfer reform faces the unusual challenge of bipartisan opposition:

- **Republican opposition**: Ideological commitment to patent rights, free-market pricing, and minimal government intervention in commercial transactions. Opposition to march-in as government overreach
- **Democratic opposition**: Major research universities are often located in Democratic districts, and university lobbying influences Democratic members. Pharmaceutical campaign contributions flow to both parties

### Issue Salience

Technology transfer is a low-salience issue for most voters, which reduces political pressure for reform and gives organized opposition greater influence. Drug pricing is a higher-salience issue, but the connection to technology transfer and march-in rights is not widely understood.

### Congressional Champions

A small but growing number of members of Congress have pushed for technology transfer reform:

- Senators and Representatives who have introduced march-in legislation or requested agency action
- Members of oversight committees who have held hearings on drug pricing and public research investment
- The Congressional Budget Office and GAO have produced analyses that support the case for reform

## Vulnerabilities of the Opposition

Despite its strength, the opposition has several vulnerabilities:

- **Public opinion**: Polls consistently show strong public support for affordable drug pricing and accountability for public research investment. The industry's position is politically unpopular even if it is politically powerful
- **Specific cases**: Individual cases where publicly funded drugs are priced far above costs generate sympathetic media coverage that is difficult for the industry to counter
- **International comparisons**: The fact that the same drugs are sold at dramatically lower prices in other countries undermines industry arguments that high prices are necessary for innovation
- **Legal vulnerability**: The legal argument that "reasonable terms" excludes price has never been tested in court and may not survive judicial scrutiny
- **Internal dissent**: Some university researchers, technology transfer professionals, and even industry voices support reform, creating cracks in the opposition coalition
