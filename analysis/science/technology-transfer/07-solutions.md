# Technology Transfer: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming the technology transfer system requires a multi-pronged approach that addresses the structural root causes identified in this analysis: the asymmetric design of the Bayh-Dole framework, the failure to exercise march-in rights, revenue-maximizing TTO culture, the valley of death, federal laboratory bureaucracy, and the geographic concentration of innovation benefits. The solutions proposed here range from politically achievable incremental reforms to more ambitious structural changes.

## Solution 1: Activate March-In Rights

### Description

Issue clear regulatory guidance establishing that "reasonable terms" in 35 U.S.C. 203 encompasses price, and exercise march-in rights in cases where publicly funded inventions are sold at prices that effectively deny public access.

### Specific Actions

- **Reverse the NIST proposed rule**: Withdraw the 2023 proposed framework stating that price alone is insufficient for march-in, and replace it with guidance affirming that unreasonable pricing can trigger march-in
- **Establish pricing benchmarks**: Develop transparent criteria for evaluating whether terms are "reasonable," including international reference pricing, cost-plus analysis, and comparison with the public investment in underlying research
- **Exercise march-in in a test case**: Select a well-documented case (such as Xtandi) where public funding was substantial, the U.S. price is dramatically higher than international comparisons, and the legal record supports action. Use this case to establish precedent
- **Create a march-in petition process**: Formalize the process for filing and adjudicating march-in petitions, including timelines, evidentiary standards, and appeal rights

### Evidence Base

- Legal analysis by scholars including Peter Arno, Michael Davis, and Alfred Engelberg supports the interpretation that "reasonable terms" includes price
- The legislative history of Bayh-Dole, including statements by Senator Bayh, indicates that march-in was intended as a meaningful safeguard against abuse
- International experience with compulsory licensing (e.g., Canada, Thailand, Brazil) demonstrates that exercising government licensing rights does not destroy pharmaceutical innovation

### Challenges

- Legal challenges from patent holders are certain; the case would need to withstand judicial scrutiny
- Pharmaceutical industry and university lobbying would be intense
- Agency leadership would need strong political backing to proceed
- Industry may reduce collaboration with universities in retaliation, though the extent of this effect is debated

### Expected Impact

- Immediate effect on pricing of the targeted invention
- Deterrent effect on unreasonable pricing of other publicly funded inventions
- Establishment of legal precedent that clarifies the scope of march-in authority
- Potential cascading effect as other patent holders adjust pricing to avoid march-in

## Solution 2: Strengthen Bayh-Dole Accountability

### Description

Amend the Bayh-Dole Act to close loopholes, improve transparency, and ensure that the public interest provisions of the Act are enforceable.

### Specific Actions

- **Mandatory reporting**: Require institutions to report annually on all active licenses, including the identity of licensees, license terms, pricing of resulting products, and revenue generated
- **Public database**: Create a publicly accessible database linking federally funded research to resulting patents, licenses, products, and prices
- **Utilization reporting enforcement**: Require agencies to verify and enforce utilization reporting requirements, with consequences for non-compliance including loss of future patent rights
- **Public interest provisions**: Require that all exclusive licenses include provisions ensuring public access on reasonable terms, with specific pricing guardrails
- **Recoupment mechanism**: Establish a mechanism for the government to recoup a portion of licensing revenue when it exceeds a threshold, directing recovered funds back to research

### Evidence Base

- The Government Accountability Office has repeatedly found that Bayh-Dole reporting is incomplete and unenforced
- Studies have documented the inability of the public to trace the connection between federal funding and commercial products
- International models (e.g., the UK's Gateway to Research) demonstrate the feasibility of transparent research-to-product tracking

### Challenges

- Legislative action requires overcoming the lobbying power of universities and industry
- Reporting systems require investment in data infrastructure
- Defining "reasonable terms" for diverse technologies across different sectors is complex

### Expected Impact

- Transparency would enable public scrutiny of technology transfer practices
- Enforceable reporting would improve data for policy evaluation
- Public interest provisions would establish baseline expectations for licensees
- Recoupment would create a financial incentive for efficient, socially beneficial technology transfer

## Solution 3: Reform University TTO Incentives

### Description

Shift TTO evaluation from revenue metrics to impact metrics, and provide alternative models for technology transfer that prioritize broad dissemination over exclusive capture.

### Specific Actions

- **Impact-based metrics**: Federal agencies should develop and incentivize impact-based metrics for technology transfer, including:
    - Number of products reaching the market
    - Accessibility and affordability of resulting products
    - Regional economic impact (jobs created, companies formed)
    - Social benefit metrics (lives saved, environmental impact)
    - Diversity of licensees (small businesses, minority-owned firms, geographic spread)
- **Tiered licensing approaches**: Encourage TTOs to adopt tiered licensing strategies that match the licensing model to the technology and market:
    - Non-exclusive licenses for research tools and platform technologies
    - Exclusive licenses with public interest provisions for technologies requiring large development investments
    - Open-source release for software and data
    - Humanitarian licensing for technologies addressing global health challenges
- **TTO capacity building**: Federal investment in TTO training, staffing, and shared services, particularly for smaller institutions and HBCUs
- **Faculty entrepreneurship support**: Create protected pathways for faculty to engage in entrepreneurship, including leave policies, equity participation guidelines, and conflict-of-interest management frameworks

### Evidence Base

- Research by Maryann Feldman, Pierre Azoulay, and others documents the limitations of revenue-focused TTO management
- International models (e.g., Israel's Yissum, Germany's Fraunhofer) demonstrate alternative approaches that achieve high commercialization rates
- NSF's I-Corps program shows that training and mentorship can significantly improve commercialization outcomes

### Challenges

- Changing institutional culture is slow and requires sustained commitment
- Impact metrics are harder to measure than revenue
- Smaller institutions lack resources for sophisticated TTO operations even with additional federal support

### Expected Impact

- Shift TTO behavior from revenue extraction to public benefit maximization
- Increase the number and diversity of inventions that reach the market
- Improve relationships between researchers and TTOs
- Expand access to technology transfer benefits for smaller institutions

## Solution 4: Bridge the Valley of Death

### Description

Create and expand funding mechanisms and support structures specifically designed to bridge the gap between basic research and commercial viability.

### Specific Actions

- **Expand proof-of-concept programs**: Increase federal funding for proof-of-concept centers at universities and national labs, modeled on successful programs at the Deshpande Center (MIT), the Coulter Foundation, and DOE's Technology Commercialization Fund
- **Create a Translational Research Fund**: Establish a dedicated federal fund ($1-2 billion annually) that provides gap funding for promising technologies between the end of grant funding and the beginning of private investment
- **Scale I-Corps**: Expand NSF's I-Corps program to all federal R&D agencies, providing entrepreneurship training to all publicly funded researchers who wish to participate
- **Support patient capital**: Develop federal mechanisms (loan guarantees, tax incentives, co-investment programs) to attract "patient capital" willing to support technologies with long development timelines
- **Regional innovation hubs**: Fund the creation of innovation infrastructure (incubators, accelerators, wet labs, prototyping facilities) in underserved regions, building on the NSF Regional Innovation Engines and EDA Tech Hubs programs

### Evidence Base

- DOE's Technology Commercialization Fund has demonstrated effective models for proof-of-concept support
- I-Corps alumni start companies at rates far exceeding the general population of NSF-funded researchers
- International models (e.g., Germany's Fraunhofer Institutes, Israel's Yozma program) show that public investment in translational infrastructure accelerates commercialization

### Challenges

- Requires new appropriations in a constrained fiscal environment
- Risk of creating "bridges to nowhere" if market pull is insufficient
- Geographic equity is difficult to achieve without diluting funding effectiveness
- Measuring success requires long time horizons

### Expected Impact

- Increase the proportion of federally funded inventions that reach the market
- Reduce the time from discovery to commercial product
- Expand the geographic distribution of innovation benefits
- Create new companies and jobs in underserved regions

## Solution 5: Modernize Federal Laboratory Technology Transfer

### Description

Streamline and strengthen technology transfer from the national laboratory system, which represents $20 billion in annual federal investment but generates relatively modest commercial output.

### Specific Actions

- **Streamline partnership processes**: Set maximum timelines for CRADA and licensing agreement approval (e.g., 90 days), with default approval if deadlines are not met
- **Reduce IP complexity**: Develop standardized license templates and IP frameworks that reduce negotiation time and legal costs
- **Expand entrepreneurship programs**: Scale Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs (LEEP) -- Innovation Crossroads, Cyclotron Road, Chain Reaction -- to all national labs
- **Career incentives**: Create performance metrics and career advancement pathways that reward lab employees for technology transfer activities
- **User facility partnerships**: Expand industry access to national lab user facilities and develop mechanisms for shared IP development
- **Regional engagement**: Require each national lab to develop a regional economic engagement plan that connects lab capabilities to local industry needs

### Evidence Base

- GAO reports have repeatedly identified bureaucratic barriers as impediments to lab technology transfer
- Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs have demonstrated strong outcomes (Innovation Crossroads companies have raised over $100 million in follow-on funding)
- Sandia National Laboratories' streamlined licensing model shows that simplified processes can increase partnership volume without compromising lab interests

### Challenges

- Lab management contractors may resist changes that complicate their contractual obligations
- Classified and controlled information creates legitimate constraints on some technology transfers
- Lab researchers may view technology transfer activities as distractions from core science missions
- Workforce flexibility is limited by civil service or contractor employment frameworks

### Expected Impact

- Significant increase in the volume and speed of national lab technology transfer
- New startups and jobs in communities near national labs
- Better leverage of $20 billion annual investment in lab infrastructure and expertise
- Stronger connections between lab research and private-sector innovation

## Solution 6: Strengthen SBIR/STTR Programs

### Description

Reform the SBIR/STTR programs to improve commercialization rates, reduce fraud and concentration, and better serve underrepresented entrepreneurs and regions.

### Specific Actions

- **Combat SBIR mills**: Strengthen SBA's commercialization benchmarks, cap the number of Phase I awards a single company can receive, and require agencies to prioritize new applicants
- **Phase III support**: Create a dedicated Phase III bridge funding mechanism to help successful Phase II companies attract private investment or government contracts
- **Geographic diversification**: Set targets for geographic diversity in SBIR/STTR awards and fund regional SBIR mentorship programs
- **Fraud prevention**: Expand IG oversight, require certification of small business status, and increase penalties for fraud
- **Cross-agency coordination**: Establish a cross-agency SBIR/STTR coordination office to prevent duplicate funding, share best practices, and harmonize processes
- **Commercialization metrics**: Develop consistent, rigorous metrics for measuring commercialization outcomes across all agencies

### Evidence Base

- SBA and GAO reports document concerns about SBIR mills and fraud
- Data show significant geographic concentration of SBIR awards
- Agencies with stronger commercialization benchmarks (e.g., DOD) tend to have better Phase III transition rates
- International programs (e.g., UK's Innovate UK) demonstrate alternative models for small business innovation support

### Challenges

- SBIR mills have congressional champions and lobby against restrictions
- Increasing geographic diversity may conflict with merit-based selection
- Cross-agency coordination faces bureaucratic resistance
- Phase III support requires new appropriations or reallocation

### Expected Impact

- Higher commercialization rates from SBIR/STTR investments
- Broader geographic and demographic participation in small business innovation
- Reduced fraud and waste
- Better data for evaluating program effectiveness

## Solution 7: Ensure Public Return on Drug Development Investment

### Description

Implement specific mechanisms to ensure that the public receives adequate return on its investment in drug development through NIH and other agencies.

### Specific Actions

- **Public funding transparency**: Require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the total public funding (direct and indirect) behind each drug at the time of FDA approval
- **Reasonable pricing provisions**: Reinstate reasonable pricing clauses in CRADAs, licensing agreements, and other government-industry partnerships, updated to address the concerns that led to the 1995 repeal
- **Tiered pricing requirements**: Require that drugs developed with substantial public funding be sold at prices reflecting the public contribution, using international reference pricing or cost-plus methodology
- **Government-use license exercise**: When march-in is impractical, exercise the government's existing 28 U.S.C. 1498 authority to authorize generic production for government health programs (Medicare, VA, Medicaid, IHS)
- **Public option for drug manufacturing**: Invest in public manufacturing capacity for essential drugs developed from publicly funded research, providing a competitive alternative to private-sector pricing

### Evidence Base

- Studies documenting the public funding behind commercially successful drugs (Cleary et al. 2018, Nayak et al. 2019)
- International experience with reference pricing and compulsory licensing
- Historical precedent: the U.S. government manufactured drugs during World War II and has used 28 U.S.C. 1498 authority in other contexts
- Economic analysis suggesting that reasonable pricing provisions would not significantly reduce industry R&D investment

### Challenges

- Faces the strongest political opposition of any proposed reform
- Legal challenges regarding the scope of government license authority
- Defining "substantial public funding" is complex
- Public manufacturing capacity would require significant upfront investment

### Expected Impact

- Reduced prices for drugs developed with public funding
- Improved public awareness of the taxpayer contribution to drug development
- Pressure on the broader pharmaceutical pricing ecosystem
- Potential model for other countries addressing similar issues
