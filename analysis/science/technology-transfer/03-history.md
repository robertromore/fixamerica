# Technology Transfer: History

## Overview

The history of technology transfer from publicly funded research to the private sector reflects evolving American attitudes toward government's role in innovation, the proper balance between public investment and private enterprise, and the relationship between universities and industry. From the post-World War II era of government-owned research through the Bayh-Dole revolution of 1980 to the contemporary debates over drug pricing and march-in rights, the arc of technology transfer policy reveals a nation that has repeatedly struggled to ensure that public investment generates public benefit.

## Timeline

### Pre-1945: The Foundations

- **1787**: The U.S. Constitution grants Congress power to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts" through patents and copyrights (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8)
- **1862**: Morrill Land-Grant Act establishes land-grant universities with a mandate to serve practical needs, laying groundwork for university-industry connections
- **1887**: Hatch Act creates agricultural experiment stations at land-grant universities, an early model of applied research with public benefit
- **1890**: Second Morrill Act extends land-grant designation to historically Black institutions
- **1906**: Congress funds Bureau of Mines research, early federal laboratory system
- **1914**: Smith-Lever Act creates Cooperative Extension Service, one of the most successful technology transfer models in history, bringing agricultural research directly to farmers

### 1945-1980: The Government-Owns-All Era

**1945: Vannevar Bush and the Linear Model**

Vannevar Bush's report *Science -- The Endless Frontier* proposed a social contract: the federal government would fund basic research, and the results would flow to industry and society through a "linear model" of innovation (basic research leads to applied research leads to development leads to products). This framework shaped federal science policy for decades but left ambiguous who would own and commercialize the resulting inventions.

**1950: National Science Foundation Act**

The creation of NSF formalized the federal role in funding basic research. The question of patent policy was contentious: Senator Harley Kilgore advocated for government ownership of all federally funded inventions, while Bush and others favored institutional ownership. The debate was not resolved; agencies developed inconsistent patent policies over the next three decades.

**1950-1980: The Patchwork Era**

In the absence of uniform policy, 26 different federal agencies developed 26 different patent policies:

- **Government-title agencies** (most agencies): The government retained title to inventions, resulting in large patent portfolios with minimal commercialization
- **Contractor-title agencies** (DOD, DOE predecessors): Some agencies allowed contractors to retain title under Institutional Patent Agreements (IPAs), with better commercialization outcomes
- **The HEW problem**: The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (NIH's parent) generally retained title, creating particular bottlenecks for biomedical inventions

**By 1980, the record was clear**: the government owned approximately 28,000 patents, fewer than 5% of which had been commercially licensed. Inventions funded by taxpayers were languishing unused because no private entity had sufficient incentive to invest in their development.

**1966: Government Patent Policy**

President Johnson issued a memorandum attempting to standardize patent policies across agencies, generally favoring government ownership with exceptions. The policy satisfied neither advocates of government control nor supporters of institutional ownership.

**1971: Institutional Patent Agreements**

NIH began allowing universities to retain title to inventions through IPAs, but the process was cumbersome and inconsistent. Only about 80 universities had IPAs by 1980.

### 1980-1982: The Bayh-Dole Revolution

**The Problem That Sparked Reform**

By the late 1970s, a bipartisan consensus emerged that the government's patent policies were failing. Key catalysts included:

- Fewer than 5% of the 28,000 government-owned patents had been licensed
- Universities had difficulty commercializing inventions under inconsistent agency policies
- The United States faced growing economic competition from Japan and Germany
- Small businesses argued they were disadvantaged by government patent policies
- Academic researchers complained about bureaucratic obstacles to commercialization

**The Bayh-Dole Act (P.L. 96-517, December 12, 1980)**

Senators Birch Bayh (D-IN) and Bob Dole (R-KS) sponsored the Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, which:

- Allowed universities, nonprofits, and small businesses to retain title to inventions made with federal funding
- Required institutions to disclose inventions, file patents, and pursue commercialization
- Reserved a government-use license for all subject inventions
- Included preference for small business and U.S. manufacturing
- Established march-in rights (35 U.S.C. 203) allowing agencies to require licensing in specified circumstances
- Applied a uniform policy across all federal agencies

The Act passed with broad bipartisan support. Its sponsors argued it would unleash innovation by aligning incentives: institutions that made inventions would have the right and obligation to commercialize them.

**1980: Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act (P.L. 96-480)**

Enacted the same year as Bayh-Dole, the Stevenson-Wydler Act focused on federal laboratories rather than universities:

- Required federal labs to establish Offices of Research and Technology Applications (ORTAs)
- Created the Federal Laboratory Consortium (FLC) for Technology Transfer
- Directed labs to dedicate resources to technology transfer
- Established a framework for lab-industry cooperation

**1982: Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219)**

Created the SBIR program, requiring federal agencies with extramural R&D budgets exceeding $100 million to set aside a percentage for small business awards:

- Initial set-aside: 0.2% (later increased)
- Three-phase structure: feasibility, development, commercialization
- Goal: stimulate technological innovation, increase small business participation in federal R&D, and foster commercialization

### 1983-1995: Building the Infrastructure

**1984: National Cooperative Research Act**

Relaxed antitrust constraints on pre-competitive research collaborations, enabling industry consortia to work with universities and labs.

**1986: Federal Technology Transfer Act (P.L. 99-502)**

Strengthened lab-industry partnerships by:

- Authorizing Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs)
- Allowing lab employees to participate in commercialization
- Establishing royalty-sharing requirements for lab inventors
- Mandating that each lab have a technology transfer mission

**1989: National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act (P.L. 101-189)**

Extended CRADA authority to government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) labs, including DOE national laboratories.

**1989-1995: The Reasonable Pricing Experiment**

NIH Director Bernadine Healy implemented a "reasonable pricing" clause in CRADAs, requiring companies that commercialized NIH-funded inventions through CRADAs to sell the resulting products at "reasonable" prices. The clause proved controversial:

- Industry argued it deterred collaboration with NIH
- NIH reported a decline in CRADA proposals
- In 1995, NIH Director Harold Varmus eliminated the clause, concluding it was hindering rather than helping public access
- The decision remains contested, with critics arguing the evidence of deterrence was anecdotal and industry-promoted

**1992: Small Business Technology Transfer Act (P.L. 102-564)**

Created the STTR program, requiring a formal partnership between a small business and a research institution, with a 0.15% set-aside (later increased to 0.45%).

**1995: National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (P.L. 104-113)**

Further streamlined technology transfer by allowing federal labs to negotiate license agreements before inventions were fully developed and establishing performance-based incentives for lab employees engaged in tech transfer.

### 1996-2010: Expansion and Criticism

**The University Patenting Boom**

University patenting activity surged following Bayh-Dole:

| Metric | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 | 2010 |
|--------|------|------|------|------|
| University patents issued | ~250 | ~1,500 | ~3,800 | ~5,500 |
| Licensing revenue (millions) | ~$10 | ~$200 | ~$1,200 | ~$2,400 |
| Startups formed | ~50 | ~200 | ~450 | ~650 |
| TTOs established | ~25 | ~200 | ~300 | ~350 |

**Success Stories**

The Bayh-Dole framework enabled landmark innovations:

- **Recombinant DNA technology** (Stanford/UCSF): Licensed broadly, generating over $250 million for the universities and enabling the biotechnology industry
- **Cisplatin** (Michigan State): Cancer chemotherapy drug developed from federally funded research
- **Google PageRank** (Stanford): Search algorithm developed under NSF-funded research, licensed to Google
- **Citric acid production** (USDA): Enabled large-scale industrial production
- **Taxol (paclitaxel)** (NIH/Florida State): Cancer drug discovered in NIH-funded research, developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb; raised early questions about pricing of publicly funded inventions

**Growing Criticism**

By the 2000s, criticism of the technology transfer system intensified:

- **Access concerns**: Advocates petitioned NIH to exercise march-in rights over the AIDS drug Norvir (ritonavir) in 2004, arguing the price increase from $54 to $265 per month violated the "reasonable terms" requirement. NIH denied the petition, establishing a precedent against price-based march-in
- **Academic freedom concerns**: Increased patenting raised questions about whether IP considerations were distorting research priorities, delaying publication, and impeding the free exchange of ideas
- **Anticommons**: Legal scholars Michael Heller and Rebecca Eisenberg warned of a "tragedy of the anticommons" in which overlapping patents on research tools could impede downstream research
- **Patent thickets**: Cumulative patenting in some fields created dense thickets that increased transaction costs for follow-on innovators

**2000: Technology Transfer Commercialization Act (P.L. 106-404)**

Streamlined federal lab technology transfer, allowed labs to use fast-track licensing, and expanded partnership authorities.

### 2011-2020: Reform Pressure Builds

**2011: America Invents Act (P.L. 112-29)**

While primarily a patent reform bill, the America Invents Act affected technology transfer by:

- Transitioning the U.S. to a first-inventor-to-file system, simplifying international patenting
- Creating new post-grant review procedures
- Establishing micro-entity fee reductions benefiting university patentees

**SBIR/STTR Reauthorizations**

The programs were reauthorized multiple times, with incremental reforms:

- Set-aside percentages gradually increased (SBIR from 2.5% to 3.2%; STTR from 0.3% to 0.45%)
- Commercialization benchmarks were introduced
- Fraud prevention measures were strengthened
- Data rights protections were clarified

**2014: Lab-to-Market Initiative**

The Obama White House launched a cross-agency initiative to accelerate federal technology transfer, resulting in:

- Increased CRADA and licensing activity at some agencies
- New entrepreneurship programs at national labs (Innovation Crossroads, Cyclotron Road)
- I-Corps expansion to DOE and DOD
- Streamlined IP processes at several agencies

**Drug Pricing Intensifies**

High-profile drug pricing controversies brought renewed attention to the public investment behind commercial drugs:

- **Sovaldi (sofosbuvir)**: Hepatitis C cure priced at $84,000 per course, developed with substantial NIH-funded basic research. Gilead Sciences acquired the drug through its purchase of Pharmasset
- **Xtandi (enzalutamide)**: Prostate cancer drug developed at UCLA with DOD and NIH funding, priced at over $150,000 per year (now ~$189,000). Multiple march-in petitions filed and denied
- **2016 Xtandi petition**: NIH denied march-in, stating that the drug was being made available and that price alone did not constitute failure to make the invention available on reasonable terms

### 2021-Present: Inflection Point

**2021: Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy**

President Biden's executive order directed agencies to consider using Bayh-Dole march-in rights and other tools to address non-competitive markets, specifically mentioning drug pricing.

**2022: CHIPS and Science Act (P.L. 117-167)**

Included significant technology transfer provisions:

- Authorized NSF Regional Innovation Engines to build innovation ecosystems outside traditional hubs
- Authorized new DOE technology transfer authorities
- Directed NIST to update Bayh-Dole regulations
- Authorized funding for proof-of-concept programs

**2023: NIST Proposed March-In Framework**

NIST proposed a draft framework for evaluating march-in requests, which included a controversial provision stating that price alone is not a sufficient basis for exercising march-in rights. The proposal:

- Drew over 80,000 public comments
- Was supported by pharmaceutical companies and many universities
- Was opposed by patient advocates, consumer groups, and some members of Congress
- Remains pending as of early 2025

**2023-2024: Xtandi Petition Revisited**

A new march-in petition on Xtandi was filed with both NIH and NIST, arguing that the drug's price -- approximately $189,000 per year in the U.S. versus roughly $20,000-40,000 in other countries -- violates the "reasonable terms" requirement. The petition represents the most significant test of march-in authority in the Act's history.

## Lessons of History

### What Has Worked

- **Bayh-Dole's core bargain**: University patenting has dramatically increased the rate at which publicly funded inventions are commercially developed
- **SBIR/STTR**: The programs have funded early-stage technologies that private markets would not support, producing notable successes including Qualcomm, Symantec, and iRobot
- **I-Corps**: NSF's Innovation Corps program has been effective at training researchers in customer discovery and lean startup methodology
- **CRADAs**: When well-structured, lab-industry partnerships have produced valuable technology transfers

### What Has Not Worked

- **March-in rights**: The failure to ever exercise march-in rights has rendered them essentially a dead letter, removing the primary public accountability mechanism from the Bayh-Dole framework
- **Reasonable pricing**: The 1995 elimination of the NIH reasonable pricing clause removed the only direct price constraint on publicly funded inventions
- **Equitable distribution**: Technology transfer benefits remain heavily concentrated in a few institutions and regions
- **Federal lab commercialization**: Despite decades of reform, federal labs transfer technology at rates that are modest relative to their scale
- **Revenue as metric**: Overemphasis on licensing revenue has distorted TTO priorities away from public benefit
