# Technology Transfer: Actions

## Overview

Citizens, researchers, advocates, and community leaders can all take meaningful action to reform the technology transfer system. The following actions are organized by audience and difficulty level, ranging from immediate individual steps to sustained collective efforts.

## For Individual Citizens

### Learn and Share

- **Understand the basics**: Learn how federally funded research becomes commercial products, particularly drugs. The connection between taxpayer-funded NIH research and drug pricing is one of the most important and least understood policy issues
- **Follow the money**: Use NIH RePORTER (<https://reporter.nih.gov>) to search for federal research grants by topic, institution, and investigator. When a new drug is approved, search for the public funding behind it
- **Share information**: When pharmaceutical pricing controversies arise, share the evidence of public funding behind those products. Public awareness is the foundation of political action
- **Write to representatives**: Contact your members of Congress to express support for march-in rights enforcement, Bayh-Dole transparency, and affordable access to publicly funded inventions

### Engage with the Political Process

- **Support pro-reform candidates**: When candidates address drug pricing, ask specifically about their position on march-in rights and public return on research investment
- **Attend town halls**: Raise technology transfer and drug pricing at town hall meetings and public forums. Connecting the abstract concept of "technology transfer" to the concrete issue of drug affordability makes it politically salient
- **Submit public comments**: When agencies propose rules affecting technology transfer (such as the 2023 NIST march-in framework), submit public comments. Individual comments matter; the Xtandi march-in petition generated over 80,000 public comments
- **Join advocacy organizations**: Support organizations working on these issues, including Knowledge Ecology International, Patients for Affordable Drugs, Public Citizen, and AARP

### Consumer Actions

- **Ask about public funding**: When prescribed an expensive medication, ask your physician and pharmacist whether the drug was developed with federal research funding. The answer is almost always yes for innovative drugs
- **Support generic alternatives**: When available, choose generic medications to demonstrate market support for affordable access
- **Engage with patient advocacy**: If you or a family member is affected by high drug prices, share your story with advocacy organizations and congressional offices. Personal narratives drive policy change

## For Researchers and Scientists

### Within Your Institution

- **Disclose inventions**: When your research produces potentially useful inventions, file timely invention disclosures with your TTO. Engagement is the first step toward ensuring your work reaches the public
- **Advocate for impact-based TTO metrics**: Push your university administration to evaluate the TTO on impact (products reaching the market, accessibility, regional economic contribution) rather than revenue alone
- **Negotiate licensing terms**: When you have leverage in licensing negotiations (e.g., when your invention is highly valuable), advocate for terms that include public access provisions, including reasonable pricing requirements for pharmaceutical inventions
- **Participate in I-Corps**: If you have inventions with commercial potential, apply for NSF I-Corps or equivalent agency programs. The training in customer discovery and lean startup methodology is invaluable
- **Mentor student entrepreneurs**: Support students and postdocs who want to commercialize research through startups. Entrepreneurship training and mentorship are critical for building the next generation of researcher-entrepreneurs

### In Professional Communities

- **Publish on technology transfer reform**: Use your expertise to contribute to the academic literature on technology transfer policy. Peer-reviewed analysis from practicing scientists carries significant weight in policy debates
- **Speak publicly**: Present at conferences, write op-eds, and participate in policy forums on technology transfer issues. Scientist voices are underrepresented in these debates relative to industry and university administration voices
- **Join professional societies engaged in policy**: Many scientific societies (AAAS, ACS, IEEE, etc.) have policy committees that address technology transfer. Join and contribute
- **Support open science**: Where consistent with IP protection needs, share data, code, and materials openly. Open science norms complement technology transfer by expanding the accessible knowledge base
- **Document public funding**: When publishing research, clearly acknowledge all federal funding sources. This documentation is essential for tracing the public investment behind eventual commercial products

### Entrepreneurship

- **Consider startup formation**: If your research has commercial potential and your TTO supports it, consider founding a startup. Researcher-founded companies tend to have stronger technical foundations than those that license technology at arm's length
- **Engage with SBIR/STTR**: Small business set-aside programs provide non-dilutive funding for early-stage commercialization. If you are considering a startup, SBIR/STTR Phase I is often the best first step
- **Connect with national labs**: If your research complements national lab capabilities, explore CRADAs, user facility access, or Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs
- **Build diverse teams**: Innovation benefits from diverse perspectives. Recruit co-founders, advisors, and early employees from varied backgrounds and disciplines

## For University Administrators

### TTO Reform

- **Adopt impact-based metrics**: Evaluate your TTO on the number and quality of products reaching the market, not just licensing revenue. Include accessibility, affordability, and regional impact measures
- **Implement tiered licensing**: Develop licensing policies that match the approach to the technology:
    - Non-exclusive licenses for research tools and broadly applicable technologies
    - Exclusive licenses with public interest provisions for technologies requiring major development investment
    - Open-source release for software and code
    - Humanitarian licenses for global health applications
- **Invest in TTO capacity**: Provide adequate staffing, training, and resources for your TTO. Understaffed TTOs are slow, risk-averse, and unable to effectively serve faculty or the public interest
- **Reduce barriers to disclosure**: Simplify the invention disclosure process and actively encourage faculty to disclose. Many valuable inventions are never disclosed because the process is too burdensome
- **Support faculty entrepreneurship**: Create clear policies for faculty leave, equity participation, conflict management, and startup engagement that enable entrepreneurship without undermining research

### Institutional Policy

- **Transparency**: Publish annual reports on technology transfer activities, including licensing terms, revenue, and product outcomes. Voluntary transparency builds public trust and provides data for policy improvement
- **Public interest commitments**: Adopt institutional policies that prioritize public benefit in licensing, including reasonable pricing provisions for pharmaceutical inventions developed with public funding
- **Regional engagement**: Develop partnerships with local and regional economic development organizations, incubators, and industry to ensure that technology transfer benefits extend beyond the campus
- **Equity and inclusion**: Ensure that technology transfer resources and entrepreneurship support are accessible to researchers from underrepresented groups and at institutions with fewer resources

## For Policymakers

### Federal Level

- **Exercise march-in authority**: The single most important action federal agencies can take is to exercise march-in rights in a well-documented case, establishing precedent and demonstrating political will
- **Strengthen reporting requirements**: Require comprehensive, enforceable reporting on Bayh-Dole utilization, linking public funding to patents, licenses, products, and prices
- **Fund translational programs**: Appropriate funding for proof-of-concept programs, I-Corps expansion, and Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs
- **Reform SBIR/STTR**: Address SBIR mills, improve commercialization metrics, and create Phase III bridge funding
- **Streamline lab partnerships**: Direct federal labs to reduce CRADA and licensing approval timelines and adopt standardized processes

### State Level

- **Invest in innovation infrastructure**: Fund incubators, accelerators, wet labs, and prototyping facilities, particularly in regions underserved by private-sector innovation infrastructure
- **State matching programs**: Create programs that match federal SBIR/STTR awards with state co-investment, as several states (e.g., Virginia, Maryland, Ohio) already do
- **University accountability**: For public universities, use governance authority to encourage impact-based TTO metrics and public interest licensing practices
- **Regional cluster development**: Identify state research strengths and invest in building regional innovation clusters around those strengths

### Local Level

- **Connect to innovation ecosystems**: Partner with local universities, community colleges, and national labs to bring technology transfer benefits to your community
- **Support entrepreneurship**: Provide zoning, permitting, and tax support for incubators, makerspaces, and startup-friendly environments
- **Workforce development**: Invest in workforce training that prepares local workers for jobs created by technology transfer and startup activity

## For Advocacy Organizations

- **Build the evidence base**: Commission and publicize research documenting the public funding behind commercially successful products, the pricing disparities between the U.S. and other countries, and the failure of existing accountability mechanisms
- **File march-in petitions**: Continue filing well-documented petitions that build the public record and generate political pressure, even if individual petitions are denied
- **Submit regulatory comments**: Engage substantively in regulatory proceedings, including NIST rulemaking, agency policy development, and legislative hearings
- **Build coalitions**: Connect technology transfer reform with drug pricing advocacy, taxpayer protection movements, and innovation policy communities. The issue cuts across traditional political lines
- **Tell human stories**: Connect abstract policy issues to real people affected by high drug prices, regional innovation disparities, and barriers to commercialization. Personal narratives drive policy change more effectively than data alone
