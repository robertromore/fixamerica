# Technology Transfer: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

The technology transfer system is governed primarily by the Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. 200-212), the Stevenson-Wydler Act (15 U.S.C. 3701-3714), and the SBIR/STTR enabling statutes (15 U.S.C. 638). While these laws created a framework that significantly improved the commercialization of federally funded research compared to the pre-1980 era, they contain structural weaknesses -- particularly regarding public accountability, march-in rights enforcement, and transparency -- that have become increasingly apparent over four decades of implementation.

This document proposes two federal bills addressing the most critical gaps: (1) the Publicly Funded Research Accountability Act, which modernizes the Bayh-Dole framework with enforceable transparency and public interest provisions, and (2) the Innovation Commercialization and Regional Equity Act, which strengthens SBIR/STTR programs and creates new mechanisms to bridge the valley of death and reduce geographic concentration of innovation benefits.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Publicly Funded Research Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To modernize the Bayh-Dole Act framework by clarifying march-in rights authority, establishing mandatory transparency requirements, and ensuring that the public receives adequate return on its investment in research.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Publicly Funded Research Accountability Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds the following:
    (1) The Federal Government invests over $200,000,000,000
        annually in research and development, generating inventions
        that benefit the public through commercial products and
        services.
    (2) The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 (35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.)
        established a framework for universities, nonprofits, and
        small businesses to retain title to inventions made with
        Federal funding, with the expectation that such inventions
        would be made available to the public on reasonable terms.
    (3) The march-in rights provision of the Bayh-Dole Act (35
        U.S.C. 203) has never been exercised in over four decades,
        despite repeated petitions documenting cases where publicly
        funded inventions are sold at prices that effectively deny
        public access.
    (4) Current reporting requirements under the Bayh-Dole Act
        are inadequate, and existing reports are largely unenforced,
        preventing the public from understanding the return on its
        research investment.
    (5) Products developed from publicly funded research,
        particularly pharmaceuticals, are routinely sold in the
        United States at prices far exceeding those in other
        developed nations.

(b) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this Act is to--
    (1) clarify that march-in rights under 35 U.S.C. 203 may
        be exercised when a subject invention is not available to
        the public on reasonable terms, including at a reasonable
        price;
    (2) establish enforceable transparency requirements for
        the utilization of subject inventions;
    (3) ensure that exclusive licenses for subject inventions
        include public interest provisions; and
    (4) create mechanisms for the public to understand and
        benefit from its investment in research.

SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF MARCH-IN RIGHTS.

            subject invention in the United States compared to prices
            in other countries with comparable per capita income;
        (2) the total Federal investment in the research and
            development of the subject invention, including both
            direct funding and funding of underlying basic research;
        (3) the total private-sector investment in the
            development and commercialization of the subject
            invention;
        (4) the availability and affordability of the product or
            service to the populations that could benefit from it;
        (5) any subsidies, tax credits, or other public support
            received by the contractor or licensee in developing or
            marketing the product or service; and
        (6) such other factors as the agency head determines
            relevant.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3** resolves the central ambiguity in Bayh-Dole by explicitly stating that "reasonable terms" includes price. The multi-factor test provides agencies with a structured framework for evaluating march-in petitions, reducing the risk of arbitrary decisions. Procedural requirements (timelines, public comment, judicial review) ensure fairness while preventing indefinite delay
- **Section 4** addresses the chronic failure of Bayh-Dole reporting by making it mandatory, enforceable, and public. The consequence for non-compliance (potential reversion of title) creates meaningful incentives without being disproportionate
- **Section 5** ensures that exclusive licenses include baseline public interest provisions, addressing the root cause of the pricing problem at the point of licensing rather than relying solely on after-the-fact march-in
- **Section 6** creates pharmaceutical-specific transparency by requiring disclosure of public funding at the point of FDA approval, enabling the public to understand the taxpayer contribution to each approved drug

**Potential Challenges**:

- Constitutional challenge under the Takings Clause (Fifth Amendment): patent holders may argue that march-in based on price constitutes a regulatory taking. However, Bayh-Dole patents are granted subject to statutory conditions, and the government's reserved rights are part of the original bargain
- Industry lobbying: pharmaceutical and university lobbying against the bill would be intense. Building a broad coalition and framing the issue as taxpayer accountability is essential
- Compliance burden: new reporting requirements impose costs on institutions, particularly smaller ones. Phased implementation and capacity-building support mitigate this concern
- International implications: the bill could be challenged under international trade agreements as inconsistent with TRIPS obligations, though the march-in provisions are consistent with TRIPS Article 31 on compulsory licensing

**Refinements**:

- Include a de minimis threshold for reporting (e.g., inventions generating less than $5,000 in annual revenue may be reported in summary form)
- Provide technical assistance to smaller institutions for compliance
- Create a safe harbor for pricing that falls within a defined range of international reference prices
- Include a sunset provision requiring congressional reauthorization after 10 years

### Bill 2: Innovation Commercialization and Regional Equity Act

**Purpose**: To strengthen the pathway from publicly funded research to commercial products by reforming SBIR/STTR programs, creating translational funding mechanisms, expanding national laboratory technology transfer, and reducing geographic concentration of innovation benefits.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Innovation Commercialization and
Regional Equity Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds the following:
    (1) A persistent "valley of death" between basic research
        and commercial application prevents many publicly funded
        inventions from reaching the market.
    (2) The Small Business Innovation Research and Small
        Business Technology Transfer programs have funded important
        innovations but face challenges including concentration
        among repeat winners, insufficient commercialization rates,
        and geographic inequity.
    (3) The 17 Department of Energy national laboratories
        represent a $20,000,000,000 annual Federal investment but
        transfer technology at rates that are modest relative to
        their capabilities and resources.
    (4) Innovation benefits are heavily concentrated in a small
        number of metropolitan areas, leaving much of the Nation
        without access to the economic opportunities created by
        Federal research investment.

(b) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this Act is to--
    (1) bridge the valley of death through dedicated
        translational funding;
    (2) reform SBIR/STTR programs to improve commercialization
        and equity;
    (3) accelerate technology transfer from national
        laboratories; and
    (4) ensure that innovation benefits reach all regions of
        the United States.

SEC. 3. TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH AND COMMERCIALIZATION FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established in the Treasury of the
United States a fund to be known as the "Translational Research and
Commercialization Fund" (in this section referred to as the "Fund").

(b) PURPOSES.--Amounts in the Fund shall be used to--
    (1) provide proof-of-concept grants to researchers at
        universities and Federal laboratories for advancing
        inventions from the laboratory stage toward commercial
        viability;
    (2) provide gap funding for technologies that have
        demonstrated feasibility but have not yet attracted private
        investment;
    (3) support regional innovation infrastructure, including
        incubators, accelerators, prototyping facilities, and
        shared laboratory space, with priority for underserved
        regions; and
    (4) expand entrepreneurship training programs, including
        the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps (I-Corps)

        (B) Awards shall be made through a competitive,
            merit-based process with expedited review (not more than
            90 days from submission to decision).
        (C) Not less than 30 percent of proof-of-concept grants
            shall be awarded to researchers at institutions located
            in States that are in the bottom half of per-capita
            Federal research funding.
    (2) GAP FUNDING.--
        (A) The Board shall award grants of up to $2,000,000
            each for technologies that have completed

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3** creates a dedicated Translational Research and Commercialization Fund that directly addresses the valley of death with proof-of-concept grants, gap funding, and regional infrastructure investment. The 30% set-aside for underserved regions addresses geographic equity. The interagency board structure prevents agency silos
- **Section 4** reforms SBIR/STTR by introducing commercialization benchmarks, limiting repeat winners while preserving access for proven commercializers, creating Phase III bridge support, and mandating geographic equity outreach
- **Section 5** tackles the bureaucratic barriers that impede national lab technology transfer through partnership streamlining, entrepreneurship program expansion, career incentives, and regional engagement mandates
- **Section 6** expands the proven I-Corps model across all major R&D agencies, ensuring that publicly funded researchers across disciplines have access to entrepreneurship training
- **Section 7** creates cross-agency coordination to prevent duplication and promote best practices

**Potential Challenges**:

- Appropriations: the authorized funding levels ($1.5 billion for the Translational Fund, $200 million for Phase III Bridge, $100 million for I-Corps expansion, $50 million for LEEP) total approximately $1.85 billion annually at full scale. This is modest relative to total federal R&D spending but still requires new appropriations
- SBIR mill opposition: companies that benefit from the current system will lobby against repeat winner limitations
- Lab management contractor resistance: streamlining requirements may conflict with existing contractor workflows and risk-management practices
- Geographic equity tensions: directing funding toward underserved regions may face criticism that it sacrifices merit-based selection

**Refinements**:

- Sunset the Translational Research Fund after 6 years with mandatory reauthorization based on independent evaluation
- Allow SBIR repeat winner exceptions for companies in designated technology priority areas (e.g., critical minerals, quantum computing)
- Include matching fund requirements for regional innovation infrastructure to leverage state and private investment
- Provide transition period for lab management contractors to adjust processes

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Innovation Ecosystem Act

**Purpose**: To enable states to create complementary innovation infrastructure that leverages federal technology transfer programs.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Innovation Ecosystem Act".

SECTION 2. STATE SBIR/STTR MATCHING PROGRAM.

(a) The [Department/Agency] shall establish a program to provide
matching funds to small business concerns located in this State
that receive Phase I or Phase II awards under the Federal SBIR or
STTR programs.

(b) Matching funds shall be provided at a ratio of not more than
1:1 and shall not exceed $100,000 for Phase I matches and $500,000
for Phase II matches.

(c) There is appropriated $[amount] annually for this program.

SECTION 3. UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER INCENTIVES.

(a) Public universities in this State shall adopt impact-based
metrics for evaluating technology transfer performance, including
measures of products reaching market, accessibility, job creation,
and regional economic impact.

(b) Public universities shall publish annual technology transfer
reports including licensing terms, revenue, and product outcomes.

SECTION 4. REGIONAL INNOVATION INFRASTRUCTURE.

(a) The [Department/Agency] shall award grants to localities,
universities, and nonprofit organizations for the establishment of
innovation infrastructure, including incubators, accelerators,
shared laboratory space, and prototyping facilities.

(b) Priority shall be given to applications serving rural areas,
communities with high unemployment, and populations
underrepresented in the innovation economy.
```

**Explanation**: This model legislation enables states to complement federal technology transfer programs through SBIR/STTR matching (proven effective in Virginia, Maryland, and Ohio), TTO accountability at public universities, and regional innovation infrastructure investment.

**Adaptations**: States should customize funding levels, eligible entities, and priority criteria based on their research base, economic conditions, and innovation ecosystem maturity.

## Regulatory Framework

### NIST Bayh-Dole Regulations

**Existing Authority**: 35 U.S.C. 206 authorizes NIST to issue regulations implementing the Bayh-Dole Act.

**Recommended Regulatory Actions**:

- Withdraw the 2023 proposed framework stating that price alone is insufficient for march-in
- Issue new regulations establishing the multi-factor test for "reasonable terms" described in the Publicly Funded Research Accountability Act
- Strengthen utilization reporting requirements in 37 C.F.R. Part 401
- Develop data standards and systems for the public database of subject inventions

### SBA SBIR/STTR Regulations

**Existing Authority**: 15 U.S.C. 638 and SBA's SBIR/STTR Policy Directives.

**Recommended Regulatory Actions**:

- Implement enhanced commercialization benchmarks across all participating agencies
- Strengthen small business size and status verification procedures
- Develop consistent cross-agency metrics for measuring commercialization outcomes
- Establish geographic equity outreach requirements

### DOE Technology Transfer Regulations

**Existing Authority**: DOE Order 483.1 (Technology Transfer) and related directives.

**Recommended Regulatory Actions**:

- Establish maximum approval timelines for CRADAs and licensing agreements
- Develop standardized license templates for common scenarios
- Require technology transfer performance metrics in lab management contractor evaluations
- Expand authority for lab employee participation in startup ventures

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Takings Clause**: March-in rights based on price may face Fifth Amendment challenges. However, Bayh-Dole patents are granted subject to statutory conditions (including march-in), making the government's reserved rights part of the original property right rather than a subsequent taking. The Supreme Court's treatment of regulatory conditions on government-granted benefits supports this analysis
- **Due Process**: The procedural requirements in the proposed legislation (timelines, public comment, judicial review) satisfy due process concerns
- **Commerce Clause**: Federal authority to regulate technology transfer from federally funded research is well-established under the Spending Clause and Commerce Clause

### Preemption Questions

- Federal technology transfer law generally preempts inconsistent state patent policies, but states retain authority to regulate their own public universities and to create complementary programs
- The model state legislation operates within areas of concurrent federal-state authority (university governance, economic development) and does not conflict with federal law

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Agency administrative enforcement**: March-in proceedings, reporting verification, compliance actions
- **Judicial review**: Final agency determinations subject to APA judicial review
- **Congressional oversight**: Annual reporting to Congress on technology transfer metrics
- **Public transparency**: Database enables public scrutiny and advocacy

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Translational Research Fund authorized for 6 years with mandatory evaluation and reauthorization
- SBIR/STTR reforms effective with next reauthorization cycle
- March-in criteria subject to periodic review by NIST every 5 years

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Publicly Funded Research Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Confidential business information exemption | The CBI redaction provision in the public database could be exploited to withhold material information about pricing and licensing terms | High |
| De minimis threshold gaming | Institutions could structure licenses to fall below reporting thresholds | Medium |
| Indirect funding avoidance | Companies could argue that their products were not derived from federally funded research if the connection is indirect | High |
| Exclusive license workarounds | Licensees could nominally comply with public interest provisions while effectively maintaining monopoly pricing through complex terms | Medium |
| International pricing manipulation | Companies could set artificially low international prices to satisfy reference pricing criteria while maintaining high U.S. prices through rebate structures | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Retrospective application | The bill does not apply to existing licenses, leaving current pricing problems unaddressed; reduced near-term impact | Legal constraints on retroactive application |
| Agency discretion | March-in remains discretionary, not mandatory; agencies may continue to decline petitions, perpetuating the status quo | Need for agency independence balanced against accountability |
| Enforcement resources | Verification and enforcement require sustained funding that may not be appropriated, reducing effectiveness | Dependence on annual appropriations |
| Pharmaceutical-specific focus | The transparency provisions focus on drugs; other sectors with pricing concerns (e.g., agricultural biotechnology) are not specifically addressed, resulting in incomplete coverage | Scope limitation for political feasibility |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Narrow the CBI exemption to require specific identification and justification of each redacted item, with agency review of claimed exemptions
2. Set de minimis thresholds at levels that capture all commercially significant inventions and index to inflation
3. Define "federally funded research" broadly to include research on the drug target, mechanism, disease pathway, or enabling technology, not just research on the specific compound
4. Require that public interest provisions in exclusive licenses include specific, measurable benchmarks for pricing and availability, not just general commitments
5. Use multiple reference pricing methods (median international price, cost-plus analysis, value-based assessment) to prevent manipulation through any single metric
6. Mandate GAO review of implementation at 3-year and 6-year marks to identify and address emerging loopholes

### Innovation Commercialization and Regional Equity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Geographic set-aside gaming | Institutions in wealthy areas could establish satellite offices in underserved regions to qualify for geographic equity provisions | Medium |
| SBIR repeat winner restructuring | Companies could create affiliated entities to circumvent the 15-award cap | High |
| Commercialization metric manipulation | Companies could report nominal revenue or investment to satisfy benchmarks without meaningful commercialization | Medium |
| Lab partnership window dressing | Labs could meet the 90-day timeline by issuing preliminary approvals without meaningful review | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Appropriations dependence | Authorized funding may not be appropriated, rendering the Translational Fund ineffective and creating program failure risk | Disconnect between authorization and appropriation |
| Interagency coordination challenges | The Interagency Board structure may create bureaucratic complexity and administrative burden rather than reducing it | Multi-agency governance inherently complex |
| Long-term sustainability | Programs may be defunded after initial authorization period, creating innovation ecosystem instability | Political cycle risk |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Define geographic eligibility based on the institution's primary research operations, not satellite offices, and require attestation
2. Apply repeat winner limitations to affiliated entities through common ownership, management, and control tests consistent with SBA size standards
3. Require independent verification of commercialization metrics, including revenue documentation and investor confirmation
4. Require substantive review within the 90-day CRADA approval window, with documentation of review activities
5. Include automatic continuing authorization provision to prevent funding gaps between reauthorization cycles
6. Authorize the GAO to conduct biennial performance audits of all programs established under the Act

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Political resistance to march-in | Build public awareness campaign connecting march-in to drug affordability before exercising authority |
| University resistance to reporting | Phase in requirements; provide technical assistance; demonstrate that transparency builds public trust |
| VC concern about IP certainty | Clearly define scope of march-in to provide predictability; demonstrate that the system protects legitimate investment |
| Cross-agency harmonization | Designate OSTP as coordinating authority with clear directive power |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- All programs established under both bills should be subject to independent evaluation at the 5-year mark
- GAO should conduct biennial audits of march-in petition processing, reporting compliance, and program outcomes
- NIST should review and update Bayh-Dole regulations every 5 years to address emerging issues
- Congress should hold oversight hearings on technology transfer reform implementation annually for the first 5 years
