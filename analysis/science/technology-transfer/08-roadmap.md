# Technology Transfer: Roadmap

## Overview

Implementing technology transfer reform requires a phased approach that builds political support, establishes precedents, and creates institutional capacity over time. The roadmap sequences reforms from those that are administratively achievable in the near term to those requiring legislative action and sustained political commitment. Each phase builds on the accomplishments and momentum of the previous one.

## Phase 1: Administrative Actions and Quick Wins (Year 1-2)

### Objective

Use existing executive authority to improve transparency, establish precedent, and demonstrate commitment to reform without requiring new legislation.

### Actions

#### 1.1 Withdraw NIST Proposed March-In Framework

- **Action**: Withdraw the 2023 proposed rule stating that price alone is insufficient for march-in; issue new guidance affirming that "reasonable terms" includes price
- **Authority**: NIST rulemaking authority under 35 U.S.C. 206
- **Timeline**: 3-6 months
- **Responsible**: NIST, White House OSTP

#### 1.2 Exercise March-In in a Test Case

- **Action**: Identify and pursue a march-in case with strong factual support (substantial public funding, dramatic price disparity, clear availability concerns)
- **Authority**: 35 U.S.C. 203
- **Timeline**: 6-18 months (including administrative process and anticipated litigation)
- **Responsible**: NIH, HHS, DOJ (for litigation defense)

#### 1.3 Improve Bayh-Dole Reporting

- **Action**: Issue updated agency guidance strengthening utilization reporting requirements; begin building a public database of federally funded inventions and their commercial status
- **Authority**: Existing regulatory authority under 37 C.F.R. Part 401
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months for guidance; 12-24 months for database development
- **Responsible**: NIST, individual funding agencies

#### 1.4 Expand I-Corps and Entrepreneurship Programs

- **Action**: Extend I-Corps training to DOE, DOD, and USDA (building on existing pilots); increase funding for Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs
- **Authority**: Existing programmatic authority; CHIPS and Science Act authorizations
- **Timeline**: Immediate expansion within existing budgets; full expansion with FY+2 appropriations
- **Responsible**: NSF, DOE, DOD, USDA

#### 1.5 Streamline National Lab Partnerships

- **Action**: Direct DOE to implement maximum 90-day approval timelines for CRADAs and licensing agreements; adopt standardized license templates
- **Authority**: DOE Secretarial direction to lab management contractors
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months
- **Responsible**: DOE Office of Technology Transitions

### Phase 1 Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Success Metric |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| New march-in guidance issued | Month 6 | Guidance published in Federal Register |
| March-in case initiated | Month 12 | Administrative action filed |

## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Legal challenge to march-in | Very High | High | Strong legal preparation; DOJ coordination; selection of strongest test case |
| Industry lobbying blocks legislation | High | High | Build broad coalition; frame as taxpayer protection; public engagement campaign |
| Underfunding of new programs | High | Medium | Phase in costs; demonstrate ROI; bipartisan appropriations strategy |
| TTO resistance to culture change | Medium | Medium | Provide resources alongside accountability; incentivize voluntary adoption |
| Political leadership change | Medium | High | Embed reforms in regulation and institutional practice; build bipartisan support |
| Geographic equity conflicts with merit | Medium | Medium | Design programs that build regional capacity rather than simply redirecting funds |
