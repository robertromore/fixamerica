# Technology Transfer: Current State

## Overview

The American technology transfer system operates through three primary channels: university technology transfer offices implementing the Bayh-Dole Act framework, federal laboratory partnerships governed by the Stevenson-Wydler Act and related statutes, and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs that direct federal R&D dollars to small firms. Together, these channels are intended to convert approximately $200 billion in annual federal research investment into products, services, and economic activity that benefit the public. The system has produced significant successes -- including foundational technologies in biotechnology, computing, and clean energy -- but faces persistent structural problems that limit its effectiveness and raise questions about whether the public receives adequate return on its investment.

## The Bayh-Dole Framework

### Legal Structure

The Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-517), commonly known as the Bayh-Dole Act, is codified at 35 U.S.C. 200-212. Its key provisions include:

- **Institutional ownership**: Universities, small businesses, and nonprofits may elect to retain title to inventions made under federal funding agreements
- **Disclosure requirements**: Institutions must disclose inventions to the funding agency in a timely manner
- **Government license**: The federal government retains a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice any subject invention
- **Preference for U.S. industry**: Exclusive licenses must generally require that products be manufactured substantially in the United States
- **March-in rights**: Under 35 U.S.C. 203, the funding agency may require the contractor to grant licenses if the invention is not being made available to the public on "reasonable terms"
- **Reporting**: Institutions must report on utilization of subject inventions

### Implementing Regulations

The Bayh-Dole Act is implemented through 37 C.F.R. Part 401, administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Key regulatory provisions address:

- Standard patent rights clauses in funding agreements
- Invention disclosure and election procedures
- Government rights notification
- Reporting requirements on utilization

## University Technology Transfer

### Scale and Performance

The Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) surveys approximately 200 U.S. universities annually. Key metrics from recent surveys:

| Metric | Value (FY 2023) | Trend |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Invention disclosures | ~23,000 | Stable |
| Patent applications filed | ~17,000 | Increasing |
| U.S. patents issued | ~8,000 | Increasing |
| Active licenses and options | ~47,000 | Increasing |
| Licensing revenue | ~$4.1 billion | Volatile (driven by blockbusters) |
| Startups formed | ~1,100 | Increasing |
| Startups still operating | ~14,000+ | Cumulative since tracking began |

### Revenue Concentration

Licensing revenue is highly concentrated among a small number of institutions and inventions:

- The top 10 universities account for approximately 50% of all licensing revenue
- A single blockbuster patent can dominate an institution's revenue for years (e.g., Northwestern's Lyrica patent, Columbia's Axel patents, University of Florida's Gatorade)
- The median university TTO operates at a net loss when fully accounting for patent prosecution costs, legal fees, and staff salaries
- Fewer than 20% of university TTOs generate positive net revenue in a given year

### TTO Operations and Staffing

University technology transfer offices vary enormously in size, capability, and approach:

- **Large research universities** (top 50 by R&D expenditure): Typically 15-40 FTE staff, including licensing managers, patent counsel, startup specialists, and marketing personnel
- **Mid-tier universities**: Typically 5-15 FTE, often without in-house patent counsel
- **Smaller institutions**: May have 1-3 FTE or share TTO services with other institutions
- **Turnaround time**: The average time from invention disclosure to executed license is 2-5 years; many disclosures are never licensed
- **Portfolio management**: TTOs manage growing portfolios of patents that require ongoing maintenance fees, creating financial pressure to license or abandon

### Key Challenges for University TTOs

- **Understaffing**: Most TTOs lack sufficient personnel to evaluate, protect, and market the volume of invention disclosures they receive
- **Misaligned incentives**: TTOs are often evaluated on revenue generation rather than impact metrics, encouraging pursuit of high-value exclusive licenses over broader dissemination
- **Faculty relations**: Researchers frequently express frustration with TTO processes, viewing them as slow, opaque, and overly focused on institutional revenue
- **Risk aversion**: TTOs may decline to patent promising inventions due to cost concerns or pursue only conservative licensing strategies
- **Conflict of interest**: Universities simultaneously pursue research funding, industrial partnerships, and patent revenue, creating complex competing interests

## Federal Laboratory Technology Transfer

### The National Laboratory System

The 17 DOE national laboratories represent a $20 billion annual federal investment, employing approximately 70,000 scientists, engineers, and support staff. Other agencies also operate significant laboratory systems:

| Agency | Number of Labs | Annual Budget | Key Facilities |
|--------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| DOE | 17 | ~$20 billion | Sandia, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, Argonne, NREL, etc. |
| NIH | 27 institutes | ~$4 billion intramural | NIH Clinical Center, Rocky Mountain Labs |
| NIST | 6 campuses | ~$1.6 billion | Boulder, Gaithersburg |
| DOD | Multiple | Classified/varies | NRL, ARL, AFRL |
| NASA | 10 centers | ~$8.5 billion | JPL, Goddard, Ames |
| USDA | 4 regional centers | ~$1.5 billion | ARS, Forest Products Lab |

### Technology Transfer Mechanisms

Federal laboratories transfer technology through multiple mechanisms:

- **Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs)**: Joint research projects between labs and private partners; approximately 800 active at DOE labs
- **Strategic Partnership Projects (SPPs)**: Work performed by lab for a private sponsor (formerly Work for Others)
- **Patent licensing**: Labs file approximately 1,500 patents annually; active licensing generates ~$50 million in revenue
- **Agreements for Commercializing Technology (ACT)**: Newer mechanism allowing more flexible terms
- **User facility access**: Over 30 DOE Office of Science user facilities serve ~36,000 researchers annually, including industry users
- **Entrepreneurship programs**: Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs (LEEP) embed entrepreneurs in national labs; Innovation Crossroads at Oak Ridge, Cyclotron Road at Lawrence Berkeley, Chain Reaction at Argonne

### Performance Gaps

Despite the enormous scale of the federal laboratory system, technology transfer metrics are modest relative to investment:

- DOE labs collectively generate only ~$50 million in licensing revenue annually against $20 billion in funding
- CRADAs have declined from their 1990s peak of over 3,000 active agreements to approximately 800
- The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has repeatedly identified barriers including bureaucratic approval processes, inconsistent IP policies across labs, and insufficient incentives for researchers
- Cultural barriers persist: many federal researchers prioritize publication over commercialization, and lab management may view tech transfer as secondary to core missions

## SBIR and STTR Programs

### Program Structure

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was established in 1982 (P.L. 97-219) and has been reauthorized multiple times, most recently through 2025. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program was established in 1992 (P.L. 102-564).

| Feature | SBIR | STTR |
|---------|------|------|
| Set-aside | 3.2% of extramural R&D budget | 0.45% of extramural R&D budget |
| Annual funding | ~$3.5 billion | ~$500 million |
| Participating agencies | 11 | 5 (DOD, DOE, NASA, NIH, NSF) |
| Research partner required | No | Yes (at least 30% subcontracted to research institution) |
| Phase I awards (typical) | $50,000-$275,000 | $50,000-$275,000 |
| Phase II awards (typical) | $500,000-$1.75 million | $500,000-$1.75 million |
| Phase III | Commercialization (no SBIR funds) | Commercialization (no SBIR funds) |

### Performance Data

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total SBIR/STTR awards (cumulative) | >200,000 |
| Total funding (cumulative since 1982) | >$60 billion |
| Companies receiving awards (cumulative) | >30,000 |
| Commercialization rate (Phase II to market) | ~25-45% (varies by agency and methodology) |
| Companies with >20 Phase I awards | ~200 ("SBIR mills") |
| Average Phase I to Phase II transition rate | ~40-50% |

### Program Concerns

- **Concentration and "SBIR mills"**: A relatively small number of companies win repeatedly, raising concerns about whether the program reaches genuinely innovative new firms. SBA has implemented controls including a "Phase II to Phase III" transition rate benchmark
- **Commercialization measurement**: Agencies use inconsistent metrics to measure commercialization success, making cross-agency comparisons difficult
- **Fraud and abuse**: DOJ and agency inspectors general have prosecuted cases of SBIR fraud, including companies that submit duplicate proposals to multiple agencies or misrepresent their size and status
- **Geographic concentration**: SBIR awards are concentrated in states with existing R&D infrastructure, particularly California, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Virginia
- **Phase III gap**: Many Phase II awardees fail to secure private-sector or follow-on government funding needed for Phase III commercialization

## March-In Rights

### The Unused Power

Section 203 of the Bayh-Dole Act grants federal funding agencies the right to require patent holders to license their inventions to third parties under four circumstances:

1. The contractor has not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention
2. Action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs
3. Action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by federal regulations
4. The contractor has failed to satisfy the U.S. manufacturing requirement

### Petition History

Despite the broad language of the statute, march-in rights have never been exercised. Notable petitions include:

| Year | Petitioner | Drug/Invention | Agency | Outcome |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------|---------|
| 1997 | CellPro | Stem cell technology | NIH | Denied |
| 2004 | Essential Inventions | Norvir (ritonavir) | NIH | Denied |
| 2004 | Essential Inventions | Xalatan (latanoprost) | NIH | Denied |
| 2012 | Knowledge Ecology International | Fabrazyme | NIH | Denied (supply resolved) |
| 2016 | Knowledge Ecology International | Xtandi (enzalutamide) | NIH | Denied |
| 2021 | Multiple organizations | Xtandi (enzalutamide) | NIH | Denied |
| 2023 | Multiple organizations | Xtandi (enzalutamide) | HHS/NIST | Under review |

### The "Reasonable Terms" Debate

The central legal question is whether "reasonable terms" in Section 203(a)(1) encompasses price. The pharmaceutical industry and some legal scholars argue that "reasonable terms" refers only to availability, not price -- that as long as a product is on the market, the terms are reasonable regardless of price. Patient advocates and other legal scholars argue that the plain language and legislative history support interpreting "reasonable terms" to include price, since a product priced beyond patients' reach is not effectively available.

In December 2023, NIST proposed a rule change to clarify that price alone is not a sufficient basis for exercising march-in rights, codifying the position taken by previous administrations. The proposal generated substantial public comment and controversy.

## Drug Pricing and Public Investment

### The Taxpayer Contribution

Research has documented significant public funding behind many commercially successful drugs:

- A 2018 study in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* found that all 210 drugs approved by the FDA from 2010-2016 had received NIH funding for research related to their mechanism or disease target, totaling over $100 billion in cumulative NIH investment
- A 2019 study found that NIH-funded research contributed to every one of the 356 drugs approved from 1991-2020 that had associated patents
- Individual cases illustrate the scale: the HIV/AIDS drug Truvada was developed substantially with federal funding, yet was initially priced at over $1,600 per month; the cancer drug enzalutamide (Xtandi) was developed at UCLA with DOD and NIH funding and is sold for approximately $189,000 per year in the United States

### International Price Disparities

Drugs developed with U.S. taxpayer funding are routinely sold at far lower prices in other countries:

| Drug | U.S. Price (annual) | International Price | Difference |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Xtandi (enzalutamide) | ~$189,000 | ~$20,000-40,000 | 5-9x |
| Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) | ~$84,000 | ~$900 (generic, India) | 93x |
| Humira (adalimumab) | ~$77,000 | ~$15,000-35,000 | 2-5x |

### Current Access Provisions

Existing mechanisms intended to ensure public access to publicly funded inventions have proven largely ineffective:

- **March-in rights**: Never exercised (see above)
- **Government license**: The government retains a license for its own use but has rarely exercised it to ensure broader public access
- **Bayh-Dole reporting**: Universities are required to report on the utilization of inventions but reporting is widely regarded as incomplete and unenforced
- **NIH reasonable pricing clause**: NIH included a reasonable pricing clause in CRADAs from 1989-1995 but eliminated it under industry pressure, citing concerns it deterred collaboration

## Innovation Ecosystem Dynamics

### The Valley of Death

The gap between basic research and commercial application -- commonly called the "valley of death" -- persists despite decades of policy attention:

- **Proof-of-concept funding**: Limited funding is available to advance technologies beyond the laboratory stage but before they are attractive to private investors. DOE's Technology Commercialization Fund, NSF's I-Corps program, and various state programs partially fill this gap
- **Risk profiles**: Early-stage technologies carry risks that most private investors will not accept, particularly in sectors with long development timelines (e.g., energy, advanced manufacturing, biotechnology)
- **Venture capital concentration**: VC funding is heavily concentrated in software, digital health, and fintech, leaving deep-tech and hardware startups underserved. Approximately 75% of VC funding flows to California, New York, and Massachusetts

### Regional Disparities

Technology transfer benefits are geographically concentrated:

- Major academic hubs (Boston/Cambridge, San Francisco Bay Area, Research Triangle, San Diego) dominate startup formation and licensing activity
- Land-grant universities and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) receive disproportionately less technology transfer support
- Rural and post-industrial regions lack the ecosystem components (VC, mentors, facilities) needed to commercialize research
- Federal initiatives such as the NSF Regional Innovation Engines program and the EDA Tech Hubs program are attempting to address this disparity, but at modest scale relative to the need

### International Comparisons

| Country | Approach | Key Features |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| United States | Bayh-Dole model | University ownership, TTO-mediated licensing |
| United Kingdom | Lambert Toolkit | Flexible frameworks for university-industry collaboration |
| Germany | Fraunhofer model | Applied research institutes bridging basic research and industry |
| Israel | Yissum, Yeda models | Aggressive university startup programs; high researcher equity |
| South Korea | KIST/KAIST model | Government labs with industry orientation; rapid scale-up |
| China | State-directed | Government-mandated commercialization targets; national priority technologies |

## Regulatory and Policy Landscape

### Recent Developments

- **CHIPS and Science Act (2022)**: Authorized major new programs for technology transfer and regional innovation, including NSF Regional Innovation Engines and DOE tech transfer authorities; many provisions remain unfunded or partially funded
- **NIST March-In Framework (2023-2024)**: Proposed rule clarifying that price is not a basis for march-in; generated controversy and extensive public comment
- **Nelson Memo (OSTP, 2022)**: Required public access to federally funded publications and data, with implications for how research is disseminated and commercialized
- **Executive Order on Competition (2021)**: Directed agencies to consider using march-in rights and other tools to promote competition
- **Inflation Reduction Act (2022)**: Included Medicare drug price negotiation provisions that indirectly address publicly funded drug pricing
