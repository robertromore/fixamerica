# Research Funding: History

## Pre-Federal Era (Before 1940)

### Early American Science

Before World War II, the federal government played a minimal role in funding scientific research. The major exceptions were agriculture (the Hatch Act of 1887 funded agricultural experiment stations) and public health (the Hygienic Laboratory, precursor to NIH, was established in 1887). University research was funded primarily through private philanthropy -- Rockefeller, Carnegie, and other foundations -- and institutional resources.

### Key Pre-War Developments

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1862 | Morrill Land-Grant Act | Created public universities with research missions |
| 1887 | Hatch Act | Federal funding for agricultural research stations |
| 1887 | Hygienic Laboratory established | Precursor to NIH |
| 1901 | National Bureau of Standards created | Federal physical science laboratory |
| 1916 | National Research Council established | Organized scientific expertise for WWI |
| 1930 | Ransdell Act | Renamed Hygienic Laboratory as NIH |
| 1937 | National Cancer Institute Act | First categorical NIH institute |

### The Limitations of Private Funding

Pre-war research funding was geographically concentrated (Northeast elite universities), episodic (dependent on philanthropist interests), and insufficient for large-scale projects. The Manhattan Project demonstrated both the transformative potential of organized government-funded research and the inability of private funding to support efforts at that scale.

## The Vannevar Bush Revolution (1945-1950)

### Science -- The Endless Frontier

In July 1945, Vannevar Bush, director of the wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), delivered his landmark report *Science -- The Endless Frontier* to President Truman. The report articulated a vision of federally funded basic research as the foundation of national prosperity, health, and security. Bush argued that:

- Basic research is the "pacemaker of technological progress"
- The federal government must fund basic research because private industry cannot capture its diffuse benefits
- Funding should flow to the best researchers wherever they are found
- Scientists, not politicians, should determine research priorities (the "peer review" principle)

### The NSF Debate (1945-1950)

Bush's proposal for a single national research foundation sparked a five-year political debate:

- **Bush's vision**: A foundation governed by scientists, insulated from political control
- **Senator Harley Kilgore's alternative**: A foundation with geographic distribution requirements, applied research emphasis, and political accountability
- **Truman's veto (1947)**: Vetoed the first NSF bill because it lacked presidential authority over the director
- **Final compromise (1950)**: National Science Foundation Act of 1950 created NSF with a presidentially appointed director but strong scientific governance

### Parallel Developments

While the NSF debate continued, other agencies began funding research:

- **Office of Naval Research (ONR, 1946)**: Became the largest federal research funder in the late 1940s, supporting university research across disciplines
- **Atomic Energy Commission (AEC, 1946)**: Took over nuclear research from the Manhattan Project, established national laboratories
- **NIH expansion (1946-1950)**: Congress began creating disease-specific institutes, driven by disease advocacy groups

## The Golden Age (1950-1968)

### Sputnik and the Great Expansion

The Soviet launch of Sputnik in October 1957 triggered a massive increase in federal research funding. The National Defense Education Act (1958) and the creation of NASA and DARPA transformed the federal research landscape:

| Year | Federal R&D (nominal) | Federal R&D (% of GDP) | Key Events |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|------------|
| 1953 | $3.1B | 0.8% | Korean War buildup |
| 1957 | $5.1B | 1.1% | Sputnik launch |
| 1960 | $8.0B | 1.5% | NASA creation, DARPA established |
| 1964 | $14.7B | 1.9% | Peak federal R&D as % of GDP |
| 1968 | $16.5B | 1.6% | Vietnam War, budget pressures |

### NIH Doubling (1957-1968)

NIH's budget grew from $81 million in 1955 to $1.4 billion by 1968, a 17-fold increase in 13 years. This expansion established the U.S. as the undisputed world leader in biomedical research, created the modern research university system, and built an infrastructure of peer-reviewed, investigator-initiated grants that became the global gold standard.

### The Grant System Takes Shape

During the 1950s and 1960s, the core features of the modern grant system were established:

- **Peer review**: Expert panels evaluating proposals on scientific merit
- **Investigator-initiated research**: Scientists propose topics, not agencies
- **Indirect cost reimbursement**: Universities negotiate F&A rates with the government
- **Study sections**: Standing panels of experts at NIH organized by discipline
- **Project grants**: Time-limited awards with defined aims and budgets
- **Graduate research assistantships**: Grants fund graduate student stipends and tuition

### DARPA's Creation and Early Successes

The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) was created in 1958 as a direct response to Sputnik. Under directors like J.C.R. Licklider, ARPA pioneered a fundamentally different model of research management:

- **ARPANET (1969)**: Precursor to the modern internet
- **Time-sharing computing**: Enabled interactive computing
- **Empowered program managers**: Technical experts with broad authority and limited tenure
- **High-risk, high-reward**: Expected and accepted failure as part of the process

## Retrenchment and Diversification (1968-1990)

### Post-Apollo Decline

Federal R&D spending as a share of GDP declined from its 1964 peak of 1.9% to approximately 1.1% by 1975. The decline reflected:

- **Vietnam War costs**: Diverted discretionary spending
- **Social programs**: Great Society programs competed for funds
- **Public skepticism**: Growing distrust of government and technology (environmental movement, nuclear concerns)
- **Apollo completion**: Space program budget declined after the moon landing

### The War on Cancer

President Nixon's National Cancer Act of 1971 launched the "War on Cancer," providing NCI with special budgetary authority and establishing the model of disease-specific research campaigns driven by patient advocacy. While the War on Cancer was criticized for overpromising, it established the pattern of politically driven research funding priorities that persists today.

### NSF Growth and Mission Expansion

NSF gradually expanded its portfolio during this period:

- **RANN Program (1971)**: Research Applied to National Needs -- NSF's first major applied research program
- **Engineering directorate (1981)**: Expanded NSF's scope beyond basic science
- **EPSCoR (1978)**: First program to address geographic distribution of research funding
- **Computer science emphasis (1980s)**: NSF funded early internet infrastructure and computer science research

### Reagan-Era Defense R&D

Under President Reagan, defense R&D surged while civilian research stagnated:

| Year | Defense R&D | Civilian R&D | Defense Share |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1980 | $15.1B | $14.2B | 52% |
| 1985 | $31.4B | $15.6B | 67% |
| 1990 | $37.5B | $20.8B | 64% |

The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, "Star Wars") alone consumed several billion dollars annually. This period demonstrated how defense priorities could crowd out civilian research investment.

## The Biomedical Century (1990-2010)

### NIH Doubling (1998-2003)

The most consequential research funding decision of the modern era was the bipartisan doubling of the NIH budget between FY 1998 and FY 2003. Driven by disease advocacy groups, bipartisan congressional champions (Senators Arlen Specter and Tom Harkin), and the promise of genomics-era breakthroughs, the NIH budget rose from $13.6 billion to $27.1 billion in five years.

**Intended effects:**

- Dramatically expanded biomedical research capacity
- Created thousands of new research positions
- Funded the Human Genome Project to completion
- Established new institutes and research centers

**Unintended consequences:**

- Universities expanded facilities and faculty positions expecting continued growth
- When funding flattened after 2003, a structural deficit emerged
- More researchers competed for the same (inflation-adjusted) pool
- Success rates plummeted from ~30% to ~20%
- The "postdoc holding pattern" expanded as new PhDs could not find funded positions

### Post-Doubling Stagnation (2003-2015)

| Year | NIH Budget (2003 dollars) | R01 Success Rate |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 2003 | $27.1B | ~30% |
| 2005 | $25.8B | ~25% |
| 2008 | $24.5B | ~21% |
| 2010 | $25.0B (incl. ARRA) | ~21% |
| 2013 | $23.1B (sequester) | ~17% |
| 2015 | $24.3B | ~18% |

The lost decade after the NIH doubling is one of the clearest illustrations of the authorization-appropriation gap problem. Congress doubled the budget but made no commitment to sustaining the new level, creating a boom-bust cycle that inflicted lasting damage on the research enterprise.

### American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009)

The ARRA provided $21.5 billion in one-time research funding:

- **NIH**: $10.4 billion (two-year awards)
- **NSF**: $3.0 billion
- **DOE Office of Science**: $1.6 billion
- **NIST**: $610 million
- **ARPA-E created**: $400 million initial funding

While the stimulus temporarily boosted research, the one-time nature of the funding created a "cliff" when it expired in FY 2011-2012, coinciding with sequestration and further compressing success rates.

## Modern Challenges (2010-Present)

### Sequestration and Budget Control Act (2011-2021)

The Budget Control Act of 2011, enacted during the debt ceiling crisis, imposed automatic spending cuts (sequestration) that reduced non-defense discretionary spending by approximately 5% in FY 2013. Research funding was hit particularly hard:

- NIH lost approximately $1.5 billion in a single year
- NSF cut approximately 1,000 grants
- DOE Office of Science reduced laboratory operating budgets

While subsequent bipartisan budget deals (Murray-Ryan 2013, Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2015, 2018, 2019) gradually restored funding above sequestration levels, the decade of uncertainty depressed research investment below what sustained growth would have produced.

### COVID-19 and the Vindication of Research

The rapid development of mRNA vaccines -- built on decades of NIH-funded basic research by scientists including Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman -- provided the most vivid modern demonstration of the returns to federal research investment. The vaccines were developed in under a year, prevented an estimated 3.2 million U.S. deaths in their first two years, and generated economic benefits estimated at $5.7 trillion.

### CHIPS and Science Act (2022)

The CHIPS and Science Act represented the most significant research authorization in a generation:

- **NSF**: Authorized to grow to $19 billion by FY 2027
- **DOE Office of Science**: Authorized at $11.1 billion for FY 2027
- **NIST**: Authorized at $2.4 billion for FY 2027
- **NSF TIP Directorate**: Created to focus on technology translation
- **Regional innovation hubs**: Authorized to distribute research capacity geographically

However, as of FY 2024, actual appropriations have fallen 25-50% below authorized levels, repeating the pattern established by the America COMPETES Acts.

### ARPA-H (2022)

The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health was established in 2022 with an initial budget of $2.5 billion, housed within HHS but designed to operate independently from NIH. Modeled on DARPA, ARPA-H aims to fund high-risk biomedical research that falls outside NIH's peer review culture. Early programs have focused on cancer detection, organ transplantation, and health data infrastructure.

## Timeline Summary

| Era | Period | Key Features |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Pre-Federal | Before 1940 | Philanthropic funding, agricultural stations |
| Bush Revolution | 1945-1950 | Federal research compact established |
| Golden Age | 1950-1968 | Sputnik expansion, peak federal R&D |
| Retrenchment | 1968-1990 | Post-Apollo decline, defense emphasis |
| Biomedical Century | 1990-2010 | NIH doubling, then stagnation |
| Modern Challenges | 2010-present | Sequestration, CHIPS Act, COVID vindication |

## Lessons from History

1. **Boom-bust cycles cause lasting damage**: The NIH doubling followed by a decade of flat funding created structural problems worse than steady moderate growth would have
2. **Authorizations without appropriations are hollow promises**: Every major authorization bill has failed to deliver on its full funding commitments
3. **Crisis drives investment**: Sputnik, the War on Cancer, and COVID-19 all triggered funding surges, but sustained investment requires political will beyond crisis response
4. **Alternative models can coexist**: DARPA's program-managed approach has operated alongside the peer-review grant system for 65 years, each serving different purposes
5. **Geographic concentration is self-reinforcing**: Early investments in certain universities and laboratories created advantages that compound over decades
