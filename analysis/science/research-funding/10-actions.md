# Research Funding: Actions

## Overview

Federal research funding reform requires action from citizens, researchers, institutions, and policymakers. This document provides concrete steps that individuals and organizations can take to advocate for a more effective, equitable, and stable research funding system. Actions are organized by audience and difficulty level, from immediate low-effort steps to sustained high-effort campaigns.

## For Citizens

### Learn and Engage

- **Understand the basics**: Federal research funding supports approximately 300,000 researchers at over 2,500 institutions. Learn how grants from NIH, NSF, DOE, and DARPA work and why they matter for health, economic competitiveness, and national security.
- **Follow the money**: Use <https://www.usaspending.gov> and NIH RePORTER (<https://reporter.nih.gov>) to see what research your tax dollars fund in your state and district.
- **Read AAAS R&D budget analysis**: The American Association for the Advancement of Science publishes accessible summaries of federal R&D budgets at <https://www.aaas.org/programs/r-d-budget-and-policy>.

### Contact Elected Officials

- **Call or write your members of Congress** to express support for research funding, particularly during appropriations season (typically February-September):
    - Ask them to fund NIH, NSF, and DOE Office of Science at CHIPS and Science Act authorized levels
    - Ask them to exempt research agencies from continuing resolutions
    - Ask them to support the EPSCoR program expansion
- **Attend town halls** and ask candidates about their positions on federal research investment
- **Share personal stories**: If you or a family member has benefited from medical research, federally funded technology, or a research university education, share that story with your representative

### Support Advocacy Organizations

| Organization | Focus | How to Help |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Research!America | Health research advocacy | Join, donate, participate in campaigns |
| AAAS | Broad science advocacy | Membership, Congressional Visit Days |
| Science Coalition | University research | Sign petitions, share stories |
| Federation of American Scientists | Science policy | Support policy analysis work |
| Task Force on American Innovation | Industry-led advocacy | Business community engagement |

### Vote Informed

- Research candidates' positions on science funding before elections
- Support candidates who commit to sustained research investment regardless of party
- Recognize that research funding has historically been bipartisan -- reward that approach

## For Researchers

### Advocate Within the System

- **Participate in professional society advocacy**: Organizations like FASEB, APS, ACS, and AAAS organize Congressional Visit Days where scientists meet with legislators. These are among the most effective advocacy tools available.
- **Respond to Requests for Information (RFIs)**: When NIH, NSF, or other agencies solicit public comment on policies, submit substantive responses. These comments shape policy.
- **Serve on advisory committees**: Volunteer for study sections, advisory councils, and review panels. Understanding the system from the inside informs better advocacy.

### Support Reform Efforts

- **Join Rescuing Biomedical Research** (<https://rescuingbiomedicalresearch.org>): A coalition of scientists advocating for structural reform of the biomedical research enterprise
- **Join Future of Research** (<https://www.futureofresearch.org>): An advocacy organization focused on early-career researcher issues
- **Advocate for specific reforms**:
    - Two-stage proposal review to reduce workload
    - Longer grant periods (7-10 years) to enable long-term research
    - Higher success rates through submission limits or lottery mechanisms
    - Reduced indirect cost rates to maximize research dollars

### Engage the Public

- **Communicate your research**: Explain to non-scientists what you do, why it matters, and how it is funded. Use social media, public talks, op-eds, and local media.
- **Connect research to everyday life**: Help citizens understand that GPS, weather forecasting, cancer treatments, smartphones, and countless other technologies trace back to federally funded research.
- **Host lab tours and open houses**: Invite the public into your laboratory to see how research works and how their tax dollars are spent.

### Support Early-Career Colleagues

- **Mentor junior researchers** on grant writing, career development, and navigating the funding system
- **Advocate for early-career set-asides** in study section discussions and institutional policy
- **Share grant-writing resources** and successful proposals (many agencies now allow this)
- **Limit the number of concurrent grants** in your own lab to leave room for new investigators

## For University Administrators

### Reform Institutional Practices

- **Voluntarily reduce F&A rates**: Institutions that reduce indirect cost rates demonstrate good faith and increase the research purchasing power of every grant dollar
- **Increase hard-money salary support**: Reduce researchers' dependence on soft money by committing institutional funds to faculty salaries
- **Provide realistic startup packages**: Ensure new faculty have sufficient institutional support to build competitive research programs before they must compete for external funding
- **Track and publish career outcomes**: Report employment outcomes for PhD graduates and postdocs to inform prospective students and guide workforce planning

### Support Equity and Access

- **Participate in EPSCoR and capacity-building programs**: Institutions in underserved states should actively pursue EPSCoR and similar programs
- **Build collaborative networks**: Elite institutions should partner with less-resourced institutions on grant applications, training programs, and facility access
- **Diversify the research workforce**: Implement evidence-based strategies to recruit, retain, and promote researchers from underrepresented groups

### Advocate for System Reforms

- **Support CHIPS and Science Act appropriations**: Universities should lobby not only for more funding but for full funding of existing authorizations
- **Support transparency**: Voluntarily publish how F&A recovery is spent; do not wait for a mandate
- **Support early-career researchers**: Advocate for policies that improve the pipeline from graduate school to independent research positions

## For Policymakers

### Immediate Actions (Executive Branch)

- **Direct agencies to implement two-stage review** for all programs with success rates below 25%
- **Issue OMB guidance on F&A transparency** requiring public reporting of how indirect cost recovery is spent
- **Expand DARPA-model program manager positions** at NIH and NSF using existing hiring authorities
- **Publish annual geographic distribution reports** for all federal research funding
- **Strengthen new investigator policies** by directing 25% of new awards to early-career researchers

### Legislative Priorities

1. **Appropriate at CHIPS and Science Act levels**: Close the authorization-appropriation gap for NSF, DOE Office of Science, and NIST
2. **Exempt research from continuing resolutions**: Protect the research enterprise from the most damaging effects of budget uncertainty
3. **Expand EPSCoR to $1.5B**: Invest in geographic equity through meaningful capacity building
4. **Create Postdoctoral Independence Awards**: Fund 2,000 portable awards per year to accelerate early-career researcher independence
5. **Establish a Research Stabilization Fund**: Create mandatory funding mechanisms to provide long-term stability

### Oversight and Accountability

- **Hold hearings on indirect cost rates**: Examine whether F&A rates are justified and whether F&A revenue is being used for its intended purposes
- **Require outcome reporting**: Direct agencies to report on the outputs and impacts of funded research, not just inputs
- **Evaluate ARPA-model agencies**: Assess whether ARPA-H and ARPA-E are delivering on their promise and whether additional ARPA agencies are warranted
- **Monitor geographic distribution**: Track whether reforms are reducing the concentration of research funding

## For Industry

### Support the Research Enterprise

- **Advocate for increased federal basic research funding**: Industry benefits enormously from publicly funded basic research. The pharmaceutical industry alone derives approximately one-third of its most transformative drugs from NIH-funded discoveries.
- **Support public-private partnerships**: Contribute matching funds, facilities, and expertise to federally funded research programs
- **Invest in regional research ecosystems**: Locate R&D facilities in underserved regions to complement federal capacity-building efforts

### Reform Industry Practices

- **Acknowledge the public investment**: When commercializing products based on federally funded research, credit the public contribution
- **Support reasonable pricing**: Products derived from publicly funded research should be accessible to the public that funded the underlying science
- **Fund pre-competitive research**: Industry consortia can fund basic research in areas where no single company can capture the returns
