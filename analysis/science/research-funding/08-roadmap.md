# Research Funding: Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap sequences research funding reforms into three phases based on political feasibility, implementation complexity, and dependency relationships. The strategy begins with agency-level actions that require no legislation, advances to legislative reforms with bipartisan potential, and culminates in structural changes that address the deepest root causes. Each phase builds the political capital and institutional capacity needed for the next.

## Phase 1: Administrative Reforms (Years 1-2)

### Objective

Implement improvements that agencies can enact under existing authority, demonstrating benefits that build support for legislative reform.

### Actions

#### 1.1 Implement Two-Stage Proposal Review

- **Actor**: NIH Director, NSF Director
- **Action**: Mandate that all programs with success rates below 25% adopt a two-stage review process (short concept paper followed by full proposal for top 40-50%)
- **Timeline**: Announce within 6 months; implement within 18 months
- **Cost**: Minimal (administrative reorganization)
- **Expected impact**: Reduce total proposal-writing burden by 30-40%; improve reviewer quality of engagement with full proposals

#### 1.2 Pilot Longer Grant Periods

- **Actor**: NIH, NSF, DOE
- **Action**: Launch pilot programs offering 7-year awards with Year 3 and Year 6 milestone reviews in selected programs
- **Timeline**: Announce within 3 months; first awards within 12 months
- **Cost**: Budget-neutral (same total dollars, fewer but longer grants)
- **Expected impact**: Reduce reapplication burden; enable longer-term research trajectories

#### 1.3 Strengthen Early-Career Investigator Policies

- **Actor**: NIH, NSF
- **Action**: Increase the proportion of R01-equivalent funding reserved for Early Stage Investigators from current levels to 25% of new awards
- **Timeline**: Implement for next funding cycle
- **Cost**: Budget-neutral (reallocation within existing budget)
- **Expected impact**: Increase new investigator success rates; reduce average age at first grant

#### 1.4 Require F&A Transparency Reporting

- **Actor**: OMB, OSTP
- **Action**: Issue guidance requiring universities receiving more than $10M in annual federal research funding to publish annual reports on how F&A recovery is spent
- **Timeline**: Issue guidance within 6 months; first reports within 18 months
- **Cost**: Minimal
- **Expected impact**: Public accountability; data to inform subsequent F&A reform

#### 1.5 Embed Program Managers at NIH and NSF

- **Actor**: NIH Director, NSF Director
- **Action**: Create 50-100 rotating program manager positions (3-5 year terms) with authority to fund high-risk research outside standard peer review, using 3-5% of extramural budgets
- **Timeline**: Begin hiring within 6 months; first awards within 12 months
- **Cost**: $1.5-2.5B redirected from existing budgets
- **Expected impact**: Test DARPA-model within traditional agencies; fund transformative research

#### 1.6 Track and Report Geographic Distribution

- **Actor**: All federal research agencies
- **Action**: Publish annual reports on the geographic distribution of research funding by state, institution type, and urban/rural classification
- **Timeline**: Within 6 months
- **Cost**: Minimal
- **Expected impact**: Public awareness of concentration; data foundation for redistribution reforms

## Political Strategy

### Coalition Building

| Reform | Natural Coalition | Swing Votes | Opposition |
|--------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| Increased funding | Universities, disease advocates, industry, scientific societies | Fiscal moderates | Fiscal hawks |
| Geographic equity | EPSCoR states (28), rural members, APLU | Moderate members from funded states | AAU, top-20 universities |
| Early-career support | Early-career advocates, scientific societies | University administrators | Established PIs (some) |
| F&A reform | Fiscal conservatives, early-career researchers | Congress generally | Universities (strong) |
| Funding stability | Scientific societies, agencies, industry | Appropriations chairs | Appropriators (power loss) |

### Key Messaging

- **For fiscal conservatives**: "Research generates 20-60% annual returns -- the best investment the government makes"
- **For geographic equity advocates**: "Every state deserves the economic benefits of a research university"
- **For competitiveness hawks**: "China's research spending is growing at 10-15% per year while ours is flat"
- **For disease advocates**: "More stable, efficient funding means more cures faster"
- **For early-career supporters**: "We are losing our best young scientists to the grant treadmill"

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Fiscal austerity cycle | High | High | Build mandatory funding mechanisms early |
| University lobby blocks F&A reform | Very High | Medium | Start with transparency; build evidence base |
| Political polarization of science | Medium | High | Maintain bipartisan framing; avoid culture war topics |
| Administration change reverses progress | Medium | High | Embed reforms in legislation rather than executive orders |
| International crisis redirects attention | Medium | Medium | Frame research as national security investment |
