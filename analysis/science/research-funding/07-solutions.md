# Research Funding: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming federal research funding requires addressing multiple interconnected problems simultaneously: insufficient overall investment, chronic budget instability, hypercompetitive grant processes, excessive indirect costs, geographic concentration, and early-career researcher disadvantage. The solutions presented here range from incremental improvements achievable through agency action to structural reforms requiring legislation. They are organized by the root cause they address, with an assessment of feasibility, impact, and political viability for each.

## Solution 1: Stabilize Research Funding Through Multi-Year Mechanisms

### Problem Addressed

Annual appropriations and continuing resolutions create damaging uncertainty for research planning and prevent agencies from making long-term commitments.

### Proposed Reforms

#### 1A: Federal Research Trust Fund

Establish a dedicated trust fund for federal research, funded through a combination of mandatory appropriations and designated revenue sources. The trust fund would:

- Provide a stable baseline of research funding immune to annual appropriations battles
- Grow automatically with GDP or inflation, maintaining real purchasing power
- Allow agencies to make multi-year commitments for grants and infrastructure
- Supplement rather than replace annual discretionary appropriations

**Revenue sources could include**:

- A small percentage (0.1-0.2%) of GDP automatically appropriated
- A fraction of patent royalties from federally funded research
- A technology licensing fee on products derived from publicly funded research
- A dedicated portion of corporate tax revenue from R&D-intensive industries

**Precedent**: The Highway Trust Fund, Airport and Airway Trust Fund, and Nuclear Waste Fund all use dedicated revenue to provide stable infrastructure investment.

**Feasibility**: Low-Medium. Requires legislation and faces strong opposition from appropriators. However, the model is well-established for other federal programs.

#### 1B: Biennial Research Appropriations

Move research funding from annual to biennial appropriations cycles, aligning funding decisions with two-year congressional terms:

- Reduces the frequency of funding uncertainty
- Provides 24-month planning horizons instead of 12 (or less under CRs)
- Could be enacted as part of broader budget process reform

**Feasibility**: Medium. Less ambitious than a trust fund and does not require new revenue sources.

#### 1C: Continuing Resolution Exemption

Exempt federal research funding from continuing resolutions, allowing agencies to maintain new-grant authority and program starts even during CR periods:

- Prevents the most damaging effects of CRs on research (delayed grants, hiring freezes)
- Preserves congressional appropriations authority
- Limited precedent in military personnel and veterans' health exemptions

**Feasibility**: Medium. Requires legislative action but does not fundamentally change the appropriations process.

### Impact Assessment

| Mechanism | Funding Stability | Political Feasibility | Implementation Complexity |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Trust fund | Very High | Low | High |
| Biennial appropriations | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| CR exemption | Medium | Medium-High | Low |

## Solution 2: Reform Indirect Cost Rates

### Problem Addressed

Indirect cost rates averaging 53% divert a significant fraction of every research dollar from the laboratory to institutional overhead, with limited transparency or accountability.

### Proposed Reforms

#### 2A: Graduated F&A Rate Cap

Implement a graduated cap on indirect cost rates that declines as an institution's total federal research volume increases:

- **First $50M in direct costs**: Full negotiated rate (up to 60%)
- **$50M-$200M**: Capped at 50%
- **$200M-$500M**: Capped at 45%
- **Above $500M**: Capped at 40%

This approach preserves indirect cost recovery for smaller institutions while reducing the windfall for high-volume research universities. Savings would be redirected to direct research funding.

**Estimated savings**: $3-5 billion annually, available for additional grants.

**Feasibility**: Low. Universities would mount fierce opposition. The 2017 Trump administration proposal to cap NIH indirect costs at 10% was abandoned within months.

#### 2B: Transparency and Accountability Requirements

Require universities receiving more than $10 million annually in federal research funding to:

- Publicly report how indirect cost recovery is spent, by category
- Demonstrate that F&A revenue supports research infrastructure rather than cross-subsidizing unrelated activities
- Submit to periodic independent audits of F&A spending
- Report F&A rates alongside research expenditure data

**Feasibility**: Medium-High. Less threatening than a cap and aligned with general transparency values.

#### 2C: Incentivize Voluntary Rate Reduction

Create incentives for institutions to voluntarily reduce their F&A rates:

- Universities that reduce their F&A rate below the national average receive bonus direct-cost funding equal to a percentage of the savings
- Recognition programs for institutions with efficient research administration
- Preferential treatment in multi-institutional collaboration funding

**Feasibility**: Medium. Creates positive incentives rather than mandates.

## Solution 3: Increase Grant Success Rates and Reduce Proposal Burden

### Problem Addressed

NIH R01 success rates of ~20% and NSF rates of ~26% waste researcher time, discourage risk-taking, and create a "grant writing treadmill" that diverts scientists from research.

### Proposed Reforms

#### 3A: Shorter Proposals with Two-Stage Review

Implement a two-stage proposal process:

- **Stage 1**: Short (3-5 page) concept paper reviewed for scientific merit and significance
- **Stage 2**: Full proposal invited only for the top 40-50% of Stage 1 submissions
- **Outcome**: Full proposals written only when there is a reasonable chance of funding

This approach, used successfully by the European Research Council and some NSF programs, dramatically reduces the total proposal-writing burden while maintaining rigorous review.

**Feasibility**: High. Can be implemented by agencies without legislation. NSF has already experimented with this approach.

#### 3B: Submission Limits

Limit the number of major grant proposals an individual researcher can submit per year:

- **Proposal**: Each PI may submit no more than two new R01-equivalent proposals per year
- **Effect**: Reduces total proposal volume, increases success rates, and forces researchers to submit their best ideas rather than flooding the system
- **Precedent**: NSF already limits submissions in some programs; Swiss National Science Foundation limits submissions

**Feasibility**: Medium. Requires agency policy changes and faces opposition from productive researchers.

#### 3C: Lottery Among Qualified Proposals

For proposals that pass a minimum quality threshold, allocate funding through a random lottery rather than attempting to rank-order proposals whose quality differences are within reviewer noise:

- **Evidence**: Studies have shown that reviewer scoring in the middle range of proposals (scores 20-50th percentile) is essentially random, with low inter-reviewer agreement
- **Implementation**: Set a quality threshold; proposals above the threshold enter a lottery; proposals below are rejected
- **Effect**: Eliminates the wasteful grantsmanship of competing within the margin of reviewer noise; reduces bias; increases diversity of funded research

**Feasibility**: Low-Medium. Pilot programs have been tried at SNSF and some private foundations but face cultural resistance.

#### 3D: Longer Grant Periods with Milestone Review

Replace the standard 3-5 year grant with 7-10 year awards subject to milestone review:

- **Year 3**: Progress review; continued funding contingent on reasonable progress
- **Year 6**: Second review; opportunity to redirect or terminate
- **Effect**: Reduces reapplication burden by 50-70%; allows researchers to pursue longer-term projects
- **Precedent**: HHMI Investigator Program provides 5-year renewable awards with strong results

**Feasibility**: Medium. Requires agency policy changes and may require budget flexibility.

## Solution 4: Support Early-Career Researchers

### Problem Addressed

Average age at first R01 exceeds 43; early-career researchers face a structural funding disadvantage; the postdoc holding pattern wastes years of productive scientific careers.

### Proposed Reforms

#### 4A: Dedicated Early-Career Funding Pool

Set aside 25% of extramural research funding for investigators within 10 years of their terminal degree:

- Creates a protected pool with higher success rates for new investigators
- Prevents established labs from monopolizing available funding
- Reduces the age penalty that currently suppresses scientific creativity

**Feasibility**: Medium. NIH already has New Investigator and Early Stage Investigator policies, but a formal set-aside would face opposition from established researchers.

#### 4B: Postdoctoral Independence Awards

Create a new funding mechanism specifically designed to accelerate postdoctoral independence:

- 3-year awards of $200,000-$300,000 per year
- Portable -- follow the researcher rather than the institution
- Include modest indirect cost rates (15-20%)
- Available to postdocs in years 2-5, providing resources to establish independent research programs before faculty appointment
- 1,000-2,000 awards per year across NIH, NSF, and DOE

**Feasibility**: Medium-High. Builds on existing K99/R00 mechanism but at larger scale.

#### 4C: Soft Money Reform

Require that federally funded research positions include at least 50% hard-money salary support from the institution:

- Reduces researchers' dependence on grants for basic financial security
- Allows researchers to focus on science rather than salary maintenance
- Shifts some cost burden from federal grants to institutions

**Feasibility**: Low-Medium. Universities would resist absorbing salary costs.

## Solution 5: Diversify Geographic Distribution

### Problem Addressed

Ten states receive more than 60% of federal research funding. Most Americans live in states with minimal research university presence and receive limited economic benefit from federal R&D investment.

### Proposed Reforms

#### 5A: Expand and Transform EPSCoR

Increase EPSCoR funding from ~$250M to $2-3 billion annually and restructure the program:

- Fund the creation of new research centers of excellence in underserved states
- Provide 10-year capacity-building grants to develop competitive research programs
- Include infrastructure funding for laboratories, equipment, and computing
- Require state matching at reduced rates for lower-income states

**Feasibility**: Medium. Broad geographic support but requires significant new funding.

#### 5B: Regional Research Hubs

Establish 20-30 federally funded Regional Research Hubs (modeled on CHIPS Act technology hubs) focused on research areas aligned with regional strengths:

- Great Plains: Agricultural biotechnology, soil science
- Appalachian: Energy transition research, materials science
- Deep South: Climate adaptation, public health disparities
- Mountain West: Water resources, wildfire science
- Pacific Islands: Marine biology, climate resilience

**Feasibility**: Medium-High. CHIPS and Science Act already authorized regional innovation hubs.

#### 5C: Geographic Diversity in Review Criteria

Add geographic distribution as a consideration (not the primary criterion) in portfolio-level funding decisions:

- Individual grants still reviewed on scientific merit alone
- Program officers consider geographic diversity when building portfolios
- Track and report geographic distribution of funding by program

**Feasibility**: High. Can be implemented through agency policy without legislation.

## Solution 6: Expand DARPA-Model Funding

### Problem Addressed

The peer-reviewed, investigator-initiated grant system is biased against transformative, high-risk research. The DARPA model has demonstrated an alternative approach with extraordinary returns.

### Proposed Reforms

#### 6A: ARPA Agencies Across the Government

Following the ARPA-H model, create ARPA agencies for additional domains:

- **ARPA-E** (Energy): Already exists but underfunded at ~$500M; increase to $2B
- **ARPA-H** (Health): Established 2022 at $2.5B; sustain and grow
- **ARPA-C** (Climate): High-risk climate mitigation technology
- **ARPA-I** (Infrastructure): Advanced materials, construction technology

**Feasibility**: Medium. ARPA-H demonstrates political viability. Each new ARPA requires legislation.

#### 6B: Program Manager Slots at Traditional Agencies

Embed DARPA-style program managers within NIH, NSF, and DOE:

- Rotate technical experts for 4-6 year terms
- Provide authority to fund high-risk programs outside normal peer review
- Allocate 5-10% of each agency's budget to program-managed research
- Evaluate on portfolio outcomes rather than individual grant success

**Feasibility**: Medium-High. Can be implemented partly through agency authority.

## Solution 7: Close the Authorization-Appropriation Gap

### Problem Addressed

Congress routinely authorizes research spending levels far above what it ultimately appropriates, creating a pattern of broken promises that undermines long-term planning.

### Proposed Reforms

#### 7A: Authorization-Linked Scoring

Require that major research authorizations include CBO-scoreable funding mechanisms:

- Authorizations without identified funding sources would be flagged
- Reduces the political credit for unfunded authorizations
- Creates accountability for authorization-appropriation gaps

**Feasibility**: Low-Medium. Authorizing committees would resist constraints on their prerogatives.

#### 7B: Automatic Escalators

Include automatic funding escalators in authorization legislation:

- Research funding increases automatically by CPI + 2% annually unless Congress acts to change it
- Shifts the political default from "flat funding" to "sustained growth"
- Precedent: Social Security COLAs operate on this principle

**Feasibility**: Low. Appropriators strongly oppose automatic spending mechanisms.
