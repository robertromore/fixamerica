# Research Funding: Stakeholders

## Overview

Federal research funding involves a complex ecosystem of stakeholders with varying levels of power, interest, and alignment. Understanding who benefits from the current system, who is harmed by it, and who has the power to change it is essential for designing effective reforms. The stakeholder landscape is characterized by a fundamental tension: those with the most power to change the system (elite universities, established researchers, appropriators) generally benefit from the status quo, while those most harmed by it (early-career researchers, scientists at less-resourced institutions, the public) have the least political influence.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Federal Research Agencies

| Agency | Role | Key Interests | Reform Position |
|--------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| NIH | Largest biomedical research funder | Stable budgets, scientific independence, peer review integrity | Generally supportive of increased funding; cautious on structural reform |
| NSF | Primary non-medical basic research funder | Broad disciplinary coverage, merit review, new programs | Supportive of growth; implementing TIP directorate |
| DOE Office of Science | Physical sciences, national labs | Laboratory operations, large facilities, energy research | Focused on facility modernization and fusion |
| DARPA | High-risk defense R&D | Program manager autonomy, risk tolerance | Model for reform but resistant to being "reformed" itself |
| OSTP | Presidential science policy | Coordinating policy, strategic priorities | Position varies with administration |
| OMB | Budget formulation | Fiscal discipline, ROI, program evaluation | Generally constrains research spending growth |

### Congress

#### Appropriations Committees

The House and Senate Appropriations Committees (and their Labor-HHS-Education and Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittees) hold ultimate power over research funding levels:

- **Power level**: Very high -- directly set funding levels
- **Key interests**: Fiscal constraints, constituent benefits, disease advocacy response
- **Reform position**: Resistant to mandatory funding or multi-year commitments that reduce their power
- **Notable champions**: Historically bipartisan support (Specter/Harkin for NIH; Alexander/Murray for education research)

#### Authorizing Committees

The House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee set policy and authorize funding levels:

- **Power level**: Moderate -- cannot compel appropriations
- **Key interests**: Competitiveness, innovation, technology development
- **Reform position**: Generally favor larger authorizations; less focused on structural reform
- **CHIPS and Science Act**: Demonstrated ability to set ambitious targets but not enforce them

### Research Universities

#### Association of American Universities (AAU)

The AAU represents 71 leading research universities in the U.S. and Canada and is the most powerful lobby in research funding politics:

- **Power level**: Very high -- concentrated political influence, significant campaign contributions
- **Key interests**: Maintaining indirect cost rates, increasing total funding, preserving institutional autonomy
- **Reform position**: Strongly support increased funding; strongly oppose indirect cost caps; cautious on geographic redistribution
- **Lobbying activity**: AAU member institutions collectively spend tens of millions annually on federal lobbying

#### Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU)

APLU represents 246 public research universities:

- **Power level**: High -- broad geographic presence, state-level influence
- **Key interests**: State funding, land-grant mission, geographic equity
- **Reform position**: Support increased funding and somewhat more open to geographic redistribution than AAU

#### Smaller and Minority-Serving Institutions

Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges:

- **Power level**: Low -- limited lobbying resources, small research portfolios
- **Key interests**: Capacity building, set-asides, reduced barriers to entry
- **Reform position**: Strongly support geographic and institutional diversification of funding

### Researchers

#### Established Investigators

Senior researchers with existing grant portfolios and tenure:

- **Population**: ~50,000 principal investigators with active NIH or NSF grants
- **Power level**: Moderate -- peer review participation, professional society influence, media visibility
- **Key interests**: Stable funding, reduced administrative burden, continued peer review system
- **Reform position**: Favor increased funding; ambivalent about structural reforms that might redistribute funds away from established labs

#### Early-Career Researchers

Postdoctoral fellows, new assistant professors, and researchers seeking their first independent grants:

- **Population**: ~60,000 postdocs; ~5,000 new tenure-track hires per year in STEM
- **Power level**: Very low -- no institutional leverage, career vulnerability discourages advocacy
- **Key interests**: Improved success rates, shorter time to independence, reduced soft-money dependency
- **Reform position**: Strongly support reforms but lack organized political voice
- **Organizations**: Rescuing Biomedical Research, Future of Research, National Postdoctoral Association

#### Graduate Students

PhD students funded through research assistantships and training grants:

- **Population**: ~130,000 STEM doctoral students
- **Power level**: Very low -- dependent on advisors, limited collective action
- **Key interests**: Stipend levels, training quality, career prospects
- **Reform position**: Support expanded funding and training reform

### Disease Advocacy Organizations

Patient and family advocacy groups that lobby for disease-specific research funding:

| Organization | Focus | Influence | Approach |
|-------------|-------|-----------|----------|
| American Cancer Society | Cancer research | Very high | Congressional lobbying, public campaigns |
| Alzheimer's Association | Alzheimer's research | Very high | Successfully increased NIA budget |
| JDRF | Type 1 diabetes | High | NIH and FDA advocacy |
| Cystic Fibrosis Foundation | CF research | High | Venture philanthropy model |
| Michael J. Fox Foundation | Parkinson's research | High | Funding advocacy and direct research support |
| HIV/AIDS advocacy groups | HIV research | High (historically transformative) | Established model for patient activism |

- **Power level**: High -- sympathetic public, personal stories, bipartisan appeal
- **Key interests**: Increased funding for their specific disease area
- **Reform position**: Support increased NIH funding; may resist redistribution away from their disease
- **Impact**: Have successfully earmarked billions in disease-specific funding, sometimes at the expense of basic research

### Industry

#### Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Companies

- **Power level**: Very high -- massive lobbying capacity, campaign contributions
- **Key interests**: Federally funded basic research that industry can commercialize, IP rights, regulatory environment
- **Reform position**: Support increased basic research funding (reduces their own R&D costs); oppose restrictions on commercializing publicly funded discoveries
- **Key tension**: Industry benefits enormously from public research investment but contributes nothing to its cost

#### Technology Companies

- **Power level**: High -- growing political influence, talent pipeline dependency
- **Key interests**: AI research, quantum computing, workforce pipeline
- **Reform position**: Support NSF and DARPA funding increases; interested in public-private partnerships

#### Defense Contractors

## Key Dynamics

### The Insider-Outsider Problem

The stakeholders with the most power to change the system are also those who benefit most from the status quo. Elite universities, established researchers, and appropriations committees have strong incentives to preserve the current structure -- which favors institutional concentration, conservative peer review, and annual discretionary funding -- even as they publicly support "more funding for science."

### The Missing Constituency

Unlike defense (military families, veterans, contractors), healthcare (patients, providers, insurers), or education (students, teachers, parents), basic research lacks a natural political constituency that connects personal experience to funding decisions. The benefits of research are diffuse, long-term, and often invisible to the public, making it difficult to sustain political pressure for increased investment.

### The University Lobby's Dual Role

Research universities simultaneously serve as:

- **Performers of research**: Genuinely advancing knowledge and training scientists
- **Revenue-seeking institutions**: Maximizing grant volume and indirect cost recovery

This dual role creates conflicts of interest that complicate reform. Universities advocate for more funding (benefiting research) while also advocating against indirect cost reform (benefiting institutional revenue at the expense of research dollars).
