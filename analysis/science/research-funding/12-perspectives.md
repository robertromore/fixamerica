# Research Funding: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes federal research funding reform through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Research funding is unusual among policy domains in that it enjoys broad bipartisan support in principle -- polls consistently show 70-80% of Americans across party lines support federal investment in scientific research. However, significant disagreements emerge over funding levels, allocation mechanisms, indirect cost reform, geographic distribution, and the role of government in directing research priorities. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Publicly supports research investment while often prioritizing tax cuts that constrain discretionary budgets* |
| Principle consistency | *Fiscal discipline principle applied selectively -- defense R&D increases supported without offsets while civilian research held to stricter standards* |
| Goalpost stability | *Generally stable on principle of competitive merit-based funding; shifts on specific funding levels based on political climate* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Sometimes frames research spending as competing with tax relief rather than as investment* |

**Justification:** Conservatives genuinely value American scientific leadership and economic competitiveness, but fiscal restraint principles are applied inconsistently -- defense R&D growth is supported while civilian research is held flat. The gap between stated support for research and actual voting behavior on appropriations creates mixed consistency.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Republican presidents have signed major research authorization bills (CHIPS Act, America COMPETES) while submitting budgets that cut civilian research*
- *Heritage Foundation and AEI have published both pro-research and spending-restraint positions on the same topics*
- *Bipartisan NIH doubling (1998-2003) demonstrates conservative capacity for research investment when politically motivated*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Agree that research investment has declined and competitiveness is threatened; disagree that the problem requires major new government spending* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | *Agree that bureaucratic inefficiency and university overhead are problems; less inclined to see insufficient spending as the primary issue* |

**Source references:**

- *Heritage Foundation, "Blueprint for Reform: Federal Research and Development," 2023*
- *American Enterprise Institute, "Competing with China: A Strategy for Technology," 2022*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Mandatory funding floor* | 3/10 | *Oppose automatic spending mechanisms* | *Loss of congressional spending control; precedent for other mandatory programs* |
| *F&A rate caps* | 7/10 | *Support reducing university overhead waste* | *Aligns with government efficiency narrative; opportunity to cut spending* |
| *Two-stage review* | 6/10 | *Support efficiency improvements* | *Genuinely favor reducing bureaucratic burden* |
| *Geographic equity* | 5/10 | *Mixed -- support for red-state research investment but oppose formula-based distribution* | *Geographic equity benefits conservative districts but conflicts with pure merit ideology* |
| *Early-career support* | 5/10 | *Support in principle but resist new spending programs* | *Prefer market-based solutions to career pipeline problems* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stabilization Act* | 3/10 | *Oppose mandatory spending and GDP-linked funding floor* | *Sets precedent for automatic spending growth; reduces appropriator control* |
| *Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act* | 5/10 | *Support F&A reform and efficiency provisions; skeptical of EPSCoR expansion cost* | *F&A caps align with waste-reduction messaging; EPSCoR expansion is new spending* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Increase private-sector R&D through expanded R&D tax credits rather than direct government funding
- Reduce regulatory burden on universities and research institutions
- Cap F&A rates more aggressively (at 25-30%) and reduce total government research spending
- Focus research funding on areas with clear national security or economic applications
- Eliminate funding for social science and humanities research at NSF

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (efficiency), Centrist (evidence-based reform), Populist (anti-elite university waste)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (bipartisan research support tradition), Democratic Socialist (F&A reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (on funding levels), Democratic Socialist (on mandatory spending)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Consistently advocates for increased research funding; positions align with stated values of public investment and equity* |
| Principle consistency | *Generally applies pro-investment principles consistently across agencies and research types* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable support for increased funding; may shift priorities based on disease advocacy pressures* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Minimal -- generally views research funding as positive-sum* |

**Justification:** Liberals have been the most reliable supporters of sustained research funding increases. Positions are consistent with stated principles of public investment, equity, and evidence-based policy. Minor inconsistencies arise from disease-specific advocacy pressures and occasional tension between equity and merit-based allocation.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Democratic caucus has consistently supported higher NIH and NSF appropriations*
- *Democratic presidents' budget proposals have generally included research increases*
- *Liberal advocacy organizations (Research!America, AAAS) consistently support broad research funding*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement that research investment has declined, that the system is inequitable, and that reform is needed* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | *Agree with most causal analysis; may place less emphasis on university business model as root cause* |

**Source references:**

- *Center for American Progress, "Investing in America's Research Future," 2023*
- *Democratic Party Platform 2024, Science and Technology section*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Mandatory funding floor* | 8/10 | *Strongly support stable, growing research investment* | *Genuinely value public investment in science* |
| *F&A rate caps* | 5/10 | *Cautious -- support transparency but concerned about impact on universities* | *Universities are key constituency; F&A caps could harm institution-building* |
| *Two-stage review* | 7/10 | *Support reducing burden on researchers* | *Genuinely favor efficiency and equity in review* |
| *Geographic equity* | 8/10 | *Strongly support EPSCoR expansion and regional hubs* | *Aligns with equity values and benefits diverse constituencies* |
| *Early-career support* | 9/10 | *Strongly support postdoctoral independence awards and early-career set-asides* | *Aligns with equity and access values* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stabilization Act* | 8/10 | *Support mandatory funding floor and CR exemption* | *Would lock in research investment gains; some concern about allocation discretion* |
| *Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act* | 7/10 | *Support most provisions; cautious on aggressive F&A caps* | *University lobby influence; concern about unintended consequences for research institutions* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Full funding of CHIPS and Science Act authorizations as a minimum
- Expand ARPA-H with focus on health equity research
- Increase diversity requirements in grant review and award processes
- Mandate open access to all federally funded research
- Create a National Climate Research Initiative with dedicated funding

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (funding levels), Centrist (evidence-based approach), Democratic Socialist (public investment)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (bipartisan research tradition), Populist (geographic equity)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on government role), Constitutionalist (on federal authority)

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Consistently advocates for major public investment and structural reform; positions match principles* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies equity and public goods principles uniformly to research funding* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable on need for dramatic funding increases and structural reform; specific proposals may evolve* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *May frame research funding as competition between public and corporate interests* |

**Justification:** Progressives are the most vocal advocates for structural reform of the research funding system. Their positions on public investment, equity, and accountability are internally consistent. Occasional framing of research as a corporate subsidy creates tension with the scientific community, but overall positions are principled and predictable.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Congressional Progressive Caucus has consistently advocated for research funding above CHIPS Act levels*
- *Progressive think tanks (Roosevelt Institute, Economic Policy Institute) have published detailed research investment proposals*
- *Senator Sanders and others have highlighted the pharma industry's reliance on publicly funded research*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement on declining investment, inequity, and structural failures* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | *Strong agreement on university business model, corporate capture, and political economy analysis* |

**Source references:**

- *Roosevelt Institute, "Public Investment for the 21st Century," 2023*
- *Economic Policy Institute, "The Case for Doubling Federal Research Investment," 2022*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Mandatory funding floor* | 9/10 | *Strongly support -- should be higher (1.0% GDP)* | *View as minimum; want transformative investment levels* |
| *F&A rate caps* | 8/10 | *Support aggressive caps; universities should not profit from public funds* | *Framed as accountability for public investment* |
| *Two-stage review* | 7/10 | *Support as efficiency improvement* | *Want structural changes beyond process reform* |
| *Geographic equity* | 9/10 | *Strongly support as economic justice measure* | *Aligns with regional equity and anti-concentration values* |
| *Early-career support* | 9/10 | *Strongly support -- view early-career crisis as labor exploitation* | *Frame as worker rights issue in addition to science policy* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stabilization Act* | 8/10 | *Support but would prefer higher GDP floor (1.0%) and stronger equity provisions* | *Concerned that 0.6% GDP is insufficient for transformative change* |
| *Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act* | 8/10 | *Strongly support F&A caps, geographic equity, and early-career provisions* | *Would add provisions requiring public benefit from publicly funded discoveries* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Set funding floor at 1.0% of GDP (1960s levels)
- Require reasonable pricing for drugs and technologies developed with federal research funding
- Eliminate F&A rates entirely for public universities; fund infrastructure through direct capital grants
- Mandate diversity requirements in all research teams receiving federal funds
- Create a public pharmaceutical research institution to develop drugs without private-sector markup

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist (public investment, worker rights), Liberal (funding increases)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (anti-elite university critique), Centrist (evidence-based reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on funding levels), Libertarian (on government role)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuinely believes private sector can fund research more efficiently; consistent application of limited government principles* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies free-market and limited-government principles consistently to research funding* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable opposition to government funding of research; specific proposals consistent over time* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Views government funding as crowding out private investment* |

**Justification:** Libertarians are the most philosophically consistent opponents of federal research funding, applying limited-government principles uniformly. Their position that the private sector can and should fund research is principled, even though it is contradicted by the historical evidence that basic research is a public good the market systematically underfunds.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Cato Institute consistently argues for reduced federal role in research*
- *Reason Foundation has published analyses criticizing government research programs*
- *Libertarian Party platform calls for elimination of federal research agencies*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 3/10 | *Disagree that declining federal share is a problem; view private R&D growth as positive* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | *Agree that government bureaucracy is inefficient but disagree that the solution is more government funding* |

**Source references:**

- *Cato Institute, "Should the Federal Government Fund Science?" 2021*
- *Reason Foundation, "Rethinking Federal Research and Development," 2020*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Mandatory funding floor* | 1/10 | *Strongly oppose -- government should not guarantee any spending level* | *Fundamental opposition to mandatory government programs* |
| *F&A rate caps* | 6/10 | *Support reducing government waste; prefer eliminating grants entirely* | *Efficiency argument aligns with principles; half-measure compared to full privatization* |
| *Two-stage review* | 4/10 | *If government must fund research, efficiency improvements are acceptable* | *Process reform does not address fundamental objection* |
| *Geographic equity* | 2/10 | *Oppose formula-based distribution; market should determine research location* | *Geographic formulas are central planning* |
| *Early-career support* | 2/10 | *Oppose new government programs; market should set research career incentives* | *Additional government intervention in labor markets* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stabilization Act* | 1/10 | *Oppose mandatory spending, GDP linkage, and expanded government role* | *Represents permanent expansion of government* |
| *Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act* | 3/10 | *Support F&A caps as spending reduction; oppose new programs and set-asides* | *Mixed -- efficiency gains offset by new government mandates* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Phase out federal research funding over 10-20 years, replacing with expanded R&D tax credits
- Privatize national laboratories
- Convert NSF and NIH to prize-based funding models rather than grant-based
- Allow full tax deduction for private research donations
- Eliminate all earmarks and formula-based research programs

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (fiscal restraint), Constitutionalist (limited federal role)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on F&A reform), Populist (anti-establishment critique)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal (on government role), Progressive (on public investment), Democratic Socialist (on all dimensions)

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuinely concerned about constitutional authority for federal research programs; consistent in applying enumerated powers framework* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies strict construction consistently; supports states' role in research funding* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable principles; specific applications may vary based on how programs are framed* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Minimal -- focused on process and authority rather than outcomes* |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists apply a consistent framework of enumerated powers and federalism to research funding questions. While the constitutional basis for federal research funding is well-established (Spending Clause, Commerce Clause, and historical practice dating to the founding era), constitutionalists raise legitimate questions about the scope and structure of federal research programs.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Consistent emphasis on constitutional authority across policy domains*
- *Support for state-level research initiatives over federal programs*
- *Willingness to support federal research when constitutional basis is clear (defense, public health)*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | *Accept factual data on funding levels but question whether federal role should be as large as analysis assumes* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Agree that appropriations process is dysfunctional but see federalism questions as more fundamental* |

**Source references:**

- *Federalist Society, "The Constitutional Basis for Federal Science Policy," policy paper*
- *Tenth Amendment Center, analysis of federal research programs and states' rights*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Mandatory funding floor* | 2/10 | *Oppose automatic spending that bypasses congressional authority* | *Undermines Article I appropriations power* |
| *F&A rate caps* | 5/10 | *Acceptable exercise of Spending Clause conditions* | *Federal conditions on voluntary funding are constitutional per Dole* |
| *Two-stage review* | 5/10 | *Administrative procedure; no constitutional issue* | *Neutral -- internal agency management* |
| *Geographic equity* | 6/10 | *Support federalism-based distribution; prefer block grants to states* | *Aligns with states' rights principles if states control allocation* |
| *Early-career support* | 3/10 | *Prefer state-level workforce development* | *Federal role in labor markets is constitutionally questionable* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stabilization Act* | 2/10 | *Oppose mandatory appropriations as unconstitutional constraint on future Congresses* | *Separation of powers concern; appropriations power belongs to Congress annually* |
| *Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act* | 4/10 | *Support Spending Clause conditions (F&A caps, transparency); oppose new federal programs* | *Conditions on voluntary funding are within constitutional bounds; new programs expand federal reach* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Convert federal research grants to block grants administered by states
- Limit federal research to areas with clear constitutional basis (defense, interstate commerce, public health)
- Strengthen state university research programs through revenue sharing rather than federal grants
- Require sunset provisions for all federal research programs (10-year reauthorization)
- Return primary research funding responsibility to states and private sector

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (limited government), Conservative (fiscal restraint)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (skepticism of federal institutions), Centrist (process reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal (on federal role), Progressive (on structural reform), Democratic Socialist (on public investment)

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Anti-elite rhetoric about universities and researchers coexists with support for research that benefits "real Americans"* |
| Principle consistency | *Inconsistent application -- supports government spending when it benefits favored constituencies, opposes it when it benefits "elites"* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions shift based on who is perceived to benefit; COVID-19 politicized research funding further* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Frequently frames research funding as benefiting coastal elites at the expense of working Americans* |

**Justification:** Populist positions on research funding are the least consistent and most difficult to predict. Anti-elite sentiment drives opposition to university research spending, while pro-worker and economic nationalism concerns create support for applied research, manufacturing R&D, and geographic equity. COVID-19 politicization has further destabilized positions by associating government science with unpopular public health mandates.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Senator Coburn's "Wastebook" tradition of mocking research grants coexists with support for defense R&D*
- *"Drain the swamp" rhetoric targets research bureaucracy while supporting manufacturing research*
- *COVID-19 created lasting populist skepticism of NIH and government-funded science*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Agree that system benefits elites and is geographically concentrated; skeptical of premise that more government spending is needed* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | *Agree that universities take excessive overhead and system is rigged for insiders; disagree on solution being more federal investment* |

**Source references:**

- *American Compass, "Industrial Policy and Research Investment," 2023*
- *Congressional "waste, fraud, and abuse" reports targeting research grants*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Mandatory funding floor* | 3/10 | *Oppose automatic spending increases for government bureaucracies* | *Distrust of government institutions, including research agencies* |
| *F&A rate caps* | 8/10 | *Strongly support -- universities should not profit from taxpayer money* | *Anti-elite university sentiment is genuine and deep* |
| *Two-stage review* | 4/10 | *Bureaucratic process reform is window dressing* | *Want more fundamental change than process improvements* |
| *Geographic equity* | 8/10 | *Strongly support -- research money should go to all Americans, not just coastal elites* | *Geographic equity is a core populist value* |
| *Early-career support* | 4/10 | *Mixed -- sympathy for struggling young workers but suspicion of academic career subsidies* | *More supportive if framed as jobs and economic development than academic career support* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stabilization Act* | 3/10 | *Oppose automatic spending; support CR exemption if framed as worker protection* | *Distrust of mandatory spending; mixed on specific provisions* |
| *Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act* | 6/10 | *Support F&A caps and geographic equity; skeptical of new programs* | *Anti-university provisions appeal; new government programs do not* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Redirect research funding from basic research to applied research with clear economic benefits
- Require that federally funded research create American jobs and manufacturing capacity
- Eliminate funding for research topics perceived as politically motivated (climate, social science)
- Cap university administrator salaries as a condition of receiving federal research funds
- Establish "heartland research centers" in rural and industrial communities

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (anti-elite, fiscal restraint on some issues)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (geographic equity, anti-corporate), Liberal (geographic equity)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on government role in research), Constitutionalist (on expanded programs)

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuinely seeks pragmatic, evidence-based reform; positions reflect stated values of bipartisan problem-solving* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies evidence-based and compromise principles consistently* |
| Goalpost stability | *Highly stable; willing to adjust specific proposals based on evidence while maintaining core commitments* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Minimal -- actively seeks positive-sum solutions* |

**Justification:** Centrists are the most reliable coalition partners on research funding reform because their stated commitment to evidence-based, bipartisan solutions matches their actual behavior. Research funding is one of the few policy areas where genuine bipartisan cooperation has a historical track record, and centrists seek to build on that tradition.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center has published detailed research funding reform proposals*
- *CHIPS and Science Act was a bipartisan centrist achievement*
- *Moderate senators from both parties have consistently supported research funding increases*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | *Strong agreement with factual analysis of declining investment and structural problems* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | *Agree with most causal analysis; may weight political dysfunction higher than structural economic factors* |

**Source references:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center, "Restoring the Foundation: The Vital Role of Research in Preserving the American Dream," 2021*
- *National Academy of Sciences reports on research funding (bipartisan expert consensus)*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Mandatory funding floor* | 6/10 | *Support in principle; prefer bipartisan agreement on sustained increases over mandatory mechanisms* | *Pragmatic concern about political feasibility* |
| *F&A rate caps* | 7/10 | *Support graduated approach as reasonable compromise* | *Want reform without devastating research universities* |
| *Two-stage review* | 8/10 | *Strongly support as proven, evidence-based reform* | *Aligns with efficiency and evidence-based values* |
| *Geographic equity* | 7/10 | *Support expanded EPSCoR and regional hubs* | *Balance equity with merit-based excellence* |
| *Early-career support* | 8/10 | *Strongly support as investment in scientific workforce* | *Align with human capital investment values* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stabilization Act* | 6/10 | *Support CR exemption and advisory board; cautious on mandatory funding mechanisms* | *Prefer bipartisan appropriations agreements to mandatory spending* |
| *Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act* | 8/10 | *Strongly support most provisions as balanced, evidence-based reform* | *Would moderate F&A caps to build broader coalition* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Pursue sustained bipartisan appropriations agreements (modeled on NIH doubling coalition)
- Establish a bipartisan Research Competitiveness Commission
- Phase in reforms gradually with evaluation at each stage
- Combine efficiency gains (F&A reform, proposal streamlining) with modest funding increases
- Expand public-private research partnerships through matching programs

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (bipartisan tradition), Conservative (efficiency reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (funding increases), Populist (geographic equity), Constitutionalist (process reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (fundamental disagreement on government role)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Generally supportive of research but motivated by specific moral concerns (stem cells, fetal tissue) that override general support* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistent on moral red lines; less consistent on general research funding levels* |
| Goalpost stability | *Moral positions are firm; general funding positions shift with political climate* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *May oppose entire funding bills over specific moral provisions* |

**Justification:** The Religious Right's engagement with research funding is primarily driven by specific moral concerns rather than a comprehensive research policy vision. Support for medical research (particularly disease-specific research) coexists with firm opposition to research involving embryonic stem cells, fetal tissue, and other morally controversial materials. This creates predictability on moral questions but inconsistency on broader funding and structural issues.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Religious advocacy groups supported NIH doubling while opposing specific research lines*
- *Consistent opposition to embryonic stem cell research across administrations*
- *Support for faith-based institutions' participation in federal research programs*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Generally accept factual data; less engaged with structural funding issues than moral concerns* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Limited engagement with causal analysis; focused on moral dimensions rather than structural factors* |

**Source references:**

- *Family Research Council position papers on NIH funding and research ethics*
- *Ethics and Public Policy Center, analysis of federal research programs*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Mandatory funding floor* | 4/10 | *Mixed -- support medical research but wary of automatic spending* | *Concern that mandatory funding reduces ability to attach moral conditions* |
| *F&A rate caps* | 5/10 | *Generally support efficiency; not a priority issue* | *Limited engagement with structural reform* |
| *Two-stage review* | 5/10 | *Neutral -- administrative procedure is not a moral issue* | *No strong opinion on grant process design* |
| *Geographic equity* | 6/10 | *Support research investment in faith-friendly communities* | *Geographic equity may benefit religious institutions* |
| *Early-career support* | 5/10 | *Support young researchers in principle* | *Want moral guidelines applied to early-career programs* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stabilization Act* | 4/10 | *Conditional support -- would require moral guardrails on funded research* | *Mandatory funding without moral conditions is unacceptable* |
| *Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act* | 5/10 | *Support efficiency provisions; want faith-based institution eligibility* | *Would add conscience protections for researchers and religious exemptions* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Prohibit federal funding for embryonic stem cell research and fetal tissue research
- Include conscience protections allowing researchers to decline morally objectionable projects
- Ensure faith-based universities are eligible for all federal research programs
- Increase funding for disease-specific research (cancer, Alzheimer's) with moral guardrails
- Add ethics review requirements for research involving human subjects and emerging technologies

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (some overlap on moral and fiscal concerns)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (disease-specific research), Liberal (medical research funding)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (on moral restrictions), Democratic Socialist (on research scope), Libertarian (on government role)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Consistently advocates for public investment, worker rights, and democratic control of research; positions match principles* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies public goods and worker rights principles uniformly to research funding* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable commitment to dramatically increased public research investment* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Frames research funding as public vs. corporate interest, which can alienate potential allies* |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists are among the most consistent advocates for increased public research funding and structural reform. Their positions on public investment, researcher working conditions, and accountability for publicly funded discoveries are internally coherent and principled. The framing of research as a public good that should not be captured by corporate interests is consistent but can create tension with industry partners who support research funding increases.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Senator Sanders has repeatedly highlighted the public investment in research that underlies pharmaceutical profits*
- *DSA platform includes expansion of public research funding and elimination of private capture*
- *Consistent support for researcher labor rights (postdoc unionization, fair compensation)*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement on declining investment, inequity, and corporate capture of public research* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | *Strong agreement on structural causes, particularly university business model and corporate interest analysis* |

| *Early-career support* | 10/10 | *Strongest supporters -- view as labor rights and economic justice issue* | *Frame postdoc crisis as worker exploitation; demand structural change* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stabilization Act* | 8/10 | *Support but would increase GDP floor to 1.0% and add public benefit requirements* | *Concerned that 0.6% is insufficient; want provisions ensuring public benefits from public investment* |
| *Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act* | 8/10 | *Strongly support F&A caps, geographic equity, and early-career provisions; would strengthen all* | *Would add reasonable pricing requirements for products from publicly funded research* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Set funding floor at 1.0-1.5% of GDP
- Require reasonable pricing for all products derived from federally funded research (Bayh-Dole reform)
- Establish public research institutions for drug development, clean energy, and other public goods
- Guarantee living-wage stipends and benefits for all graduate students and postdocs on federal grants
- Eliminate F&A rates entirely; fund university research infrastructure through direct public capital investment
- Require worker representation on university research governance bodies

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (public investment, structural reform), Liberal (funding increases)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (anti-elite critique, geographic equity), Centrist (early-career support)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on funding levels), Libertarian (on government role), Constitutionalist (on federal authority)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| *F&A rate reform* | *Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Populist, Democratic Socialist* | *Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Religious Right* | *None (though university lobby is powerful)* |
| *Geographic equity* | *Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Centrist, Constitutionalist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist* | *Conservative* | *Libertarian* |
| *Two-stage review* | *Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist* | *Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right* | *None* |
| *Mandatory funding floor* | *Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist* | *Conservative, Populist, Religious Right* | *Libertarian, Constitutionalist* |
| *Early-career support* | *Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist* | *Conservative, Populist, Religious Right* | *Libertarian, Constitutionalist* |

**Key insight:** F&A reform and geographic equity have the broadest cross-ideological support, making them the most politically viable reforms. Mandatory funding mechanisms face the strongest structural opposition from Libertarian and Constitutionalist perspectives but have support from the largest ideological blocs. Two-stage review is a low-controversy, high-consensus reform that can serve as an early win.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Research Efficiency and Accountability Package*

**Bridges:** *Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist + Progressive*

**Core Agreement:** *All five perspectives agree that federal research dollars should be spent efficiently, that university overhead should be transparent, and that the grant process can be streamlined without reducing scientific quality.*

**Policy Description:**

Combine F&A transparency requirements, graduated indirect cost caps, and two-stage proposal review into a single legislative package. The package would require public reporting of how universities spend indirect cost recovery, phase in graduated F&A caps over 4 years, redirect savings to direct research costs, and mandate two-stage review for programs with success rates below 25%.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | *Reduces government waste; improves accountability for taxpayer dollars* |
| Liberal | *More research per dollar; savings fund additional grants* |
| Progressive | *University accountability; redirected savings fund early-career researchers* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based reform; bipartisan appeal; incremental approach* |
| Populist | *Cuts elite university windfall; forces transparency on how taxpayer money is spent* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | *Accepts continued federal research funding rather than privatization* |
| Liberal | *Accepts F&A caps that their university allies oppose* |
| Progressive | *Accepts graduated rather than flat caps; does not eliminate F&A entirely* |
| Centrist | *Accepts mandated reform rather than voluntary improvement* |
| Populist | *Accepts that basic research remains federally funded* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 3+ consistency
- **Durability:** *Strong -- efficiency and accountability appeal across ideological lines; university lobby is the primary opposition but lacks public sympathy on overhead costs*
- **Implementation Path:** *Introduce as standalone bill or attach to annual appropriations; agency-level implementation of two-stage review can proceed in parallel*

---

### Compromise 2: *Geographic Research Equity Act*

**Bridges:** *Liberal + Progressive + Populist + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Democratic Socialist*

**Core Agreement:** *Six perspectives agree that federal research funding is too geographically concentrated and that expanding research capacity to underserved states and regions would produce both economic and scientific benefits.*

**Policy Description:**

Expand EPSCoR funding from $250M to $1.5B over 5 years, establish 20-30 Regional Research Hubs aligned with local economic strengths, reduce matching requirements for lower-income states, and require agencies to report and set targets for geographic distribution of research funding. Fund through combination of F&A cap savings and new appropriations.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | *Promotes equity and expands research benefits to underserved communities* |
| Progressive | *Addresses structural inequality in research ecosystem; regional economic development* |
| Populist | *Research money goes to "real America," not just coastal elites* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based capacity building; bipartisan geographic coalition* |
| Constitutionalist | *Strengthens state-level research capacity; federalism-compatible if structured as block grants* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Public investment in regional economies; reduces geographic monopoly* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | *Accepts that geographic distribution may slightly reduce funding to top-tier institutions* |
| Progressive | *Accepts capacity building over immediate redistribution* |
| Populist | *Accepts that research remains primarily at universities rather than industrial facilities* |
| Centrist | *Accepts that some geographic targeting may reduce pure merit-based allocation* |
| Constitutionalist | *Accepts federal funding for research (in exchange for state-level implementation)* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Accepts incremental expansion rather than dramatic restructuring* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Populist is the exception at 2)
- **Durability:** *Moderate-High -- geographic equity benefits a large majority of states and congressional districts. Populist inconsistency is a risk, but the geographic benefits create durable support. Elite university opposition is concentrated in a small number of districts.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Build on CHIPS and Science Act regional hub authorization; attach EPSCoR expansion to annual appropriations; frame as economic development and national competitiveness*

---

### Compromise 3: *Next Generation Researcher Investment Act*

**Bridges:** *Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Democratic Socialist*

**Core Agreement:** *Four perspectives agree that the early-career researcher crisis -- average age 43 at first R01, expanding postdoc holding pattern, soft-money dependency -- undermines scientific innovation and represents a waste of human capital.*

**Policy Description:**

Create 2,000 portable Postdoctoral Independence Awards per year ($250K/year for 3 years with 15% indirect costs), establish a 25% early-career investigator set-aside for new research grants, and require institutions to track and publish career outcomes for all doctoral graduates and postdocs. Total new cost approximately $1.5B per year.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | *Invests in scientific workforce; promotes equity and access* |
| Progressive | *Addresses labor exploitation of early-career researchers; structural reform* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based investment in human capital; proven ROI on researcher independence* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Worker rights for researchers; reduces exploitation; public investment in careers* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | *Accepts that set-asides may reduce some established researchers' funding* |
| Progressive | *Accepts incremental reform rather than eliminating the postdoc system entirely* |
| Centrist | *Accepts new spending rather than budget-neutral reallocation* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Accepts that awards are competitive rather than guaranteed* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *High -- all coalition members are highly consistent, and the policy addresses a genuine crisis with clear beneficiaries. Opposition is weak because established researchers benefit from a stronger pipeline. Conservative and Populist support is possible if framed as workforce investment and economic development.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Can be partially implemented through agency action (NIH/NSF new investigator policies) while legislation is pursued for the full program. Career outcome reporting can be implemented via OMB guidance.*

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most achievable coalition brings together Liberal, Centrist, and Conservative perspectives on the **Research Efficiency and Accountability Package** (Compromise 1). This coalition has historical precedent (bipartisan research funding agreements, CHIPS Act), addresses concerns that resonate across ideological lines (efficiency, accountability, transparency), and faces opposition primarily from the university lobby rather than from elected officials. Adding Populist support through geographic equity provisions (Compromise 2) creates a supermajority coalition.

### Key Obstacles

1. **University lobby**: The most organized and effective opposition to F&A reform and geographic redistribution. Can be partially neutralized by framing reforms as benefiting research rather than penalizing institutions.
2. **Appropriations committee resistance**: Mandatory funding mechanisms face fierce resistance from appropriators who view them as erosions of congressional power. CR exemption is a more achievable intermediate step.
3. **Libertarian/Constitutionalist opposition**: Principled opposition to expanded government role in research is unlikely to be overcome but represents a small minority of the political spectrum.
4. **Populist unpredictability**: With a consistency rating of 2/5, populist support is the least reliable element of any coalition. Reforms should not depend on populist votes.

### Low Consistency Partners

The Populist perspective (2/5) and Religious Right (3/5) are the least predictable coalition partners. For Populists, geographic equity and anti-university provisions provide the most reliable entry points. For the Religious Right, disease-specific research advocacy (particularly cancer and Alzheimer's) provides common ground, but moral red lines on specific research types can derail broader support.

**Strategy for low-consistency partners:** Include provisions that address their stated concerns but do not make them essential to the coalition. Geographic equity provisions attract populist support; moral guardrail language satisfies the Religious Right without constraining overall research. Build the core coalition from Liberal, Centrist, Progressive, and moderate Conservative perspectives.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with Compromise 1** (Efficiency and Accountability): Build a bipartisan coalition around F&A transparency, graduated caps, and two-stage review. These reforms generate savings, reduce waste, and improve researcher experience -- all politically appealing outcomes.
2. **Add Compromise 2** (Geographic Equity): Expand the coalition by adding EPSCoR expansion and regional research hubs, which attract support from EPSCoR state delegations (28 states) and populist members.
3. **Pursue Compromise 3** (Early-Career Support): Build on efficiency savings and increased funding to support early-career researchers, with bipartisan framing around workforce investment and international competitiveness.
4. **Work toward mandatory funding** (Bill 1): Use the demonstrated benefits of Compromises 1-3 to build the case for structural funding stability. CR exemption first, then biennial budgeting, then mandatory floor -- in sequence from most to least politically feasible.
