# Research Funding: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to research funding reform comes from three distinct sources: those who oppose increased federal research spending in principle, those who support research but oppose structural changes to how funds are allocated, and those who support specific reforms but oppose others that would harm their interests. The most politically significant opposition often comes not from ideological opponents of science but from entrenched beneficiaries of the current system who resist redistribution and accountability.

## Opposition to Increased Federal Research Spending

### Fiscal Conservatives

**Core argument**: Federal spending must be reduced to control the deficit and national debt. Research funding, while potentially valuable, is discretionary spending that must compete with other priorities.

**Key positions**:

- Research funding should not be exempt from government-wide spending discipline
- The private sector can and should fund more research, particularly applied research
- Federal research has become bloated and inefficient, with too much money going to overhead rather than actual science
- Tax cuts that stimulate private-sector R&D investment are more efficient than government grants

**Strength of opposition**: Moderate. Fiscal conservatives do not typically target research funding specifically, but they resist increases in overall discretionary spending that would include research. Research funding has historically been among the last discretionary items to be cut, but it is not exempt from austerity politics.

**Key actors**:

- Heritage Foundation: Advocates for reduced federal role in research, emphasizing private-sector alternatives
- Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: Frames all spending increases as fiscal risks
- Congressional fiscal hawks: Apply across-the-board restraint rather than targeted cuts

### Anti-Government Populists

**Core argument**: Federal agencies, including research agencies, are part of a wasteful and unaccountable bureaucracy. Research grants fund academic elites disconnected from ordinary Americans' concerns.

**Key positions**:

- Research funding benefits coastal elites and prestigious universities while ignoring middle America
- Government-funded research has been politicized (climate science, COVID-19 public health)
- Taxpayer money is wasted on frivolous-sounding research topics
- The "deep state" includes government scientists who advance political agendas

**Strength of opposition**: Growing. Populist skepticism of expertise and institutions has intensified since 2016. Specific research projects have been targeted for ridicule (e.g., Senator Coburn's "Wastebook" and its successors, which highlighted seemingly absurd grant titles without explaining their scientific significance).

**Key actors**:

- Congressional members who publicize "wasteful" grants
- Media figures who mock research topics (shrimp on treadmills, duck genitalia studies)
- Anti-regulatory activists who view government scientists as obstacles to industry

### Ideological Opposition to Specific Research Areas

Some opposition targets specific types of research rather than research funding overall:

| Research Area | Opposition Source | Argument |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Climate science | Fossil fuel industry, climate skeptics | Results are biased; research is advocacy |
| Gun violence research | NRA, Second Amendment groups | CDC/NIH should not study firearms (Dickey Amendment legacy) |
| Embryonic stem cell research | Religious conservatives | Moral objections to embryo destruction |
| Social/behavioral science | Fiscal conservatives | Not "real" science; ideologically driven |
| Gain-of-function research | Biosecurity advocates (across spectrum) | Safety risks outweigh benefits |
| Race/gender studies in STEM | Conservative critics | "DEI" influence on scientific priorities |

## Opposition to Structural Reforms

### University Lobby Against Indirect Cost Reform

**The opposition**: The AAU and APLU represent the most organized and effective opposition to any reduction or cap on indirect cost rates.

**Their argument**: Indirect costs represent the real expenses of maintaining research infrastructure. Capping F&A rates would:

- Force universities to cross-subsidize research from tuition and other revenue
- Reduce the quality of research facilities
- Punish institutions that have invested most heavily in research infrastructure
- Potentially violate OMB Circular A-21 cost accounting principles

**Their influence**: The university lobby is exceptionally well-connected in Washington. University presidents, alumni networks, and congressional delegations from states with major research institutions create formidable political protection for the indirect cost system.

**Counter-evidence**: Critics note that:

- F&A rates have risen steadily even as construction costs have moderated
- Universities use F&A revenue for non-research purposes (athletics, administrative expansion)
- The 26% administrative component has grown faster than the facilities component
- No other country allows overhead rates as high as the U.S.
- The Trump administration proposed capping NIH indirect costs at 10% in 2017, generating immediate and overwhelming opposition from the university community

### Elite University Opposition to Geographic Redistribution

**The opposition**: Top-tier research universities oppose any formula-based redistribution of research funding away from peer-reviewed competition.

**Their argument**:

- The peer review system ensures that the best science is funded regardless of location
- Geographic formulas would dilute research quality by directing funds to less capable institutions
- EPSCoR already provides capacity-building support for underrepresented states
- The concentration of funding reflects the concentration of talent, not bias

**Their influence**: The top 20 research universities are located in districts and states of powerful legislators. Their alumni networks include many members of Congress, agency leaders, and senior executive branch officials.

**Counter-evidence**: Critics argue that:

- Peer review contains network biases that favor established institutions
- Geographic concentration deprives most Americans of the economic benefits of research
- Talent is widely distributed but opportunity is not
- International examples (Germany's Max Planck Institutes, distributed across the country) show that geographic distribution and quality are not mutually exclusive

### Established Researcher Opposition to Funding Model Changes

**The opposition**: Senior researchers with established grant portfolios resist changes that might redistribute funding toward:

- Early-career researchers (through set-asides or larger new investigator pools)
- Alternative funding mechanisms (DARPA-style programs, lotteries, block grants)
- Different review criteria (broader impacts, interdisciplinary work, diversity)

**Their argument**:

- The peer review system, while imperfect, is the best method for identifying quality
- Experience and track record are legitimate criteria for funding decisions
- Lottery-based funding would waste money on mediocre proposals
- Block grants would reduce scientific competition and quality

**Their influence**: Senior researchers serve on study sections, editorial boards, and advisory committees. They train the next generation of researchers and socialize them into the existing system's norms and expectations.

### Appropriations Committee Defense of Power

**The opposition**: Congressional appropriators resist any structural change that would reduce their annual control over research funding levels, including:

- Mandatory appropriations for research (like NIH trust fund proposals)
- Multi-year funding commitments
- Automatic inflation adjustments
- Research funding tied to GDP or other formulas

**Their argument**:

- Congressional power of the purse is constitutionally mandated
- Annual appropriations provide accountability and responsiveness
- Mandatory spending programs are nearly impossible to reform once established
- Congress must retain flexibility to respond to changing priorities

**Their influence**: Appropriators have direct veto power over any funding change and can block authorization bills from having practical effect.

## Opposition to Specific Reform Proposals

### Opposition to Grant Lotteries

**Proposal**: Fund grants through a lottery among proposals that pass a quality threshold, rather than attempting to rank all proposals.

**Opposition from**:

- Established researchers: "My excellent proposal should not be treated the same as a merely good one"
- Peer reviewers: "Our expertise in identifying the best science would be devalued"
- Agency leadership: "We need to justify funding decisions to Congress on merit"
- Disease advocates: "We cannot leave disease-specific funding priorities to chance"

### Opposition to Reduced Proposal Frequency

**Proposal**: Limit researchers to one major grant application per year to reduce system burden.

**Opposition from**:

- Productive researchers: "Why should I be limited in my ability to propose research?"
- Universities: "This would reduce our grant volume and indirect cost revenue"
- Junior researchers: "Fewer chances to apply means fewer chances to succeed"

### Opposition to Transparency in F&A Spending

**Proposal**: Require universities to publicly report how indirect cost recovery is spent.

**Opposition from**:

- University administrators: "Our financial operations are already audited; additional reporting is burdensome"
- AAU: "This represents government overreach into institutional autonomy"
- Research administration: "F&A accounting is already subject to federal cost principles"

## Effectiveness of Opposition

| Reform | Primary Opposition | Effectiveness | Result |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| Indirect cost caps | AAU, universities | Very High | 2017 Trump proposal defeated within months |
| Geographic redistribution | Elite universities, top states | High | EPSCoR remains underfunded; no structural change |
| Multi-year funding | Appropriations committees | Very High | Proposals have never advanced significantly |
| Grant lotteries | Established researchers, agencies | Moderate | Limited pilots but no systemic adoption |
| Early-career set-asides | Senior researchers | Moderate | NIH new investigator policies adopted but modest |
| Increased overall funding | Fiscal conservatives | Moderate | Funding grows but below authorized/promised levels |

## Opposition Strategies

### "More Funding Solves Everything"

The most effective opposition strategy is to redirect reform energy toward simply increasing the overall funding pool. By framing every structural problem as a budget problem, opponents avoid addressing the systemic issues that would persist even with more money. This strategy is effective because:

- Everyone agrees more funding would help
- It avoids conflict among stakeholders
- It requires no internal redistribution or accountability
- It shifts blame to appropriators rather than addressing system design

### "Protect Peer Review"

Any reform that modifies the peer review system is countered with the argument that peer review is the foundation of scientific quality and must not be compromised. This argument is effective because:

- Peer review genuinely is the best available system for most contexts
- Alternatives (lotteries, programmatic funding) are unfamiliar and uncertain
- Scientists are deeply socialized into peer review norms
- The argument conflates defending peer review with defending the specific implementation

### "Academic Freedom"

Reforms that require accountability, transparency, or changes in institutional behavior are opposed as threats to academic freedom and institutional autonomy. This argument is effective because:

- Academic freedom is a genuine and important value
- Federal interference in university governance has historical precedents (loyalty oaths, political targeting)
- The argument appeals to both liberal and conservative defenders of institutional independence
