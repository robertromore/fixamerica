# Research Funding: Current State

## Federal R&D Budget Landscape

### Overall Federal Investment

The federal government invested approximately $204 billion in research and development in FY 2024, spanning basic research, applied research, and experimental development. While this represents a nominal increase over previous years, federal R&D as a share of GDP has declined from its 1964 peak of 1.9% to approximately 0.73% -- a level that places the United States behind South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Japan in government R&D intensity.

Total U.S. R&D spending (public and private combined) reached approximately $886 billion in 2024, roughly 3.4% of GDP. The private sector now accounts for approximately 78% of total R&D, up from 33% in the 1960s. This shift reflects both the growth of corporate research (particularly in technology and pharmaceuticals) and the relative decline of federal investment.

### Agency-by-Agency Breakdown

| Agency | FY 2024 Budget | Primary Mission | Key Programs |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| NIH | ~$48.3B | Biomedical research | R01, R21, P01, U01, intramural |

| Applied research | ~$62B | ~30% |
| Development | ~$95B | ~47% |

## NIH Funding in Detail

### Budget Trajectory

NIH is the world's largest public funder of biomedical research. Its budget grew dramatically during the 1998-2003 doubling, rising from $13.6 billion to $27.1 billion. However, in inflation-adjusted terms, the NIH budget did not return to its 2003 peak until approximately 2020, representing a "lost decade" of flat funding that coincided with a surge in applications.

| Fiscal Year | NIH Budget (nominal) | Applications Received | R01 Success Rate |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| FY 1998 | $13.6B | ~24,000 | ~31% |
| FY 2003 | $27.1B | ~35,000 | ~30% |
| FY 2010 | $31.2B | ~49,000 | ~21% |
| FY 2015 | $30.3B | ~52,000 | ~18% |
| FY 2020 | $41.7B | ~55,000 | ~21% |
| FY 2024 | ~$48.3B | ~58,000 | ~20% |

### Grant Mechanisms

NIH uses a complex array of funding mechanisms:

- **R01**: The "bread and butter" investigator-initiated research grant, averaging ~$300,000 per year for 4-5 years. Approximately 28,000 R01-equivalent grants are active at any time.
- **R21**: Exploratory/developmental grants, smaller ($275,000 total over 2 years) with slightly higher risk tolerance
- **R00/K99**: Pathway to Independence awards bridging postdoctoral training and first faculty positions
- **K awards**: Career development awards for early-career researchers ($75,000-$100,000/year)
- **P01**: Program project grants supporting multi-component research programs
- **U01/U54**: Cooperative agreements with substantial NIH involvement
- **T32/F31/F32**: Training grants and individual fellowships
- **SBIR/STTR**: Small business innovation and technology transfer grants

### Institute-Level Distribution

NIH's 27 institutes and centers have widely varying budgets, reflecting both disease burden and political advocacy:

| Institute | FY 2024 Budget | Primary Focus |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| NCI (Cancer) | ~$7.3B | Cancer research |
| NIAID (Allergy/Infectious Disease) | ~$6.3B | Infectious disease, immunology |
| NHLBI (Heart, Lung, Blood) | ~$3.9B | Cardiovascular, pulmonary |
| NIGMS (General Medical Sciences) | ~$3.2B | Basic biomedical research |
| NIMH (Mental Health) | ~$2.3B | Mental health research |
| NINDS (Neurological Disorders) | ~$2.7B | Neuroscience |
| NIDDK (Diabetes/Digestive/Kidney) | ~$2.4B | Metabolic diseases |
| NIA (Aging) | ~$4.4B | Aging, Alzheimer's |

## NSF Funding in Detail

### Budget and Scope

NSF is the primary federal funder of non-medical basic research, supporting approximately 25% of all federally funded basic research at colleges and universities. Its FY 2024 budget of approximately $11.3 billion supports research across all scientific and engineering disciplines, as well as STEM education and major research facilities.

### Directorate-Level Breakdown

| Directorate | FY 2024 Budget | Disciplines |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Engineering (ENG) | ~$800M | All engineering fields |
| Computer & Information Science (CISE) | ~$1.1B | Computing, information systems |
| Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) | ~$1.7B | Math, physics, chemistry, materials |
| Geosciences (GEO) | ~$1.5B | Earth, ocean, atmospheric science |
| Biological Sciences (BIO) | ~$850M | Non-medical biology |
| Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE) | ~$350M | Social science, economics, psychology |
| Education & Human Resources (EHR) | ~$1.1B | STEM education |
| Technology, Innovation & Partnerships (TIP) | ~$880M | Regional innovation, translation |

### NSF Funding Rates

NSF's overall funding rate has fluctuated between 22-28% over the past decade, varying significantly by directorate:

| Directorate | Proposals/Year | Funding Rate |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Engineering | ~8,500 | ~24% |
| CISE | ~6,500 | ~25% |
| MPS | ~7,000 | ~28% |
| Geosciences | ~4,500 | ~30% |
| Biological Sciences | ~5,000 | ~23% |
| SBE | ~3,500 | ~22% |

## DOE Office of Science

### Structure and Budget

The DOE Office of Science is the nation's largest federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences, operating 17 national laboratories. Its FY 2024 budget of approximately $8.8 billion supports six major research programs:

| Program | FY 2024 Budget | Focus |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Basic Energy Sciences (BES) | ~$2.5B | Materials, chemistry, geosciences |
| High Energy Physics (HEP) | ~$1.2B | Particle physics, accelerators |
| Biological and Environmental Research (BER) | ~$900M | Genomics, climate modeling |
| Nuclear Physics (NP) | ~$780M | Nuclear structure, heavy-ion physics |
| Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) | ~$1.1B | Supercomputing, quantum information |
| Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) | ~$790M | Fusion energy research |

### National Laboratory System

DOE's 17 national laboratories employ approximately 70,000 researchers, engineers, and support staff. These government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities represent a fundamentally different model from the university grant system -- providing stable, long-term funding for large-scale research programs and operating unique user facilities including particle accelerators, light sources, and supercomputers.

## DARPA Model

### How DARPA Differs

DARPA operates on a fundamentally different model from NIH, NSF, and DOE:

| Feature | Traditional Agencies | DARPA |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| Funding mechanism | Investigator-initiated proposals | Program manager-solicited |
| Risk tolerance | Conservative (proven approaches) | High (transformative goals) |
| Program duration | 3-5 year grants, renewable | 3-5 year programs, then sunset |
| Program managers | Career civil servants | Rotating (4-6 year terms) |
| Success metric | Publications, citations | Capability demonstrations |
| Failure tolerance | Low (career risk) | High (expected and accepted) |
| Budget | $4.1B | $4.1B |

DARPA's model has produced the internet (ARPANET), GPS, stealth technology, and mRNA vaccine platforms. Its key innovation is the empowered program manager -- a technical expert hired for a limited term who defines program goals, selects performers, and actively manages research portfolios toward ambitious milestones.

## The Indirect Cost Problem

### How Indirect Costs Work

When a university receives a federal research grant, the award includes both "direct costs" (personnel, equipment, supplies, travel) and "indirect costs" or "facilities and administrative" (F&A) costs. The F&A rate is negotiated between each university and its cognizant federal agency (typically HHS for biomedical research institutions, ONR for others).

### Current F&A Rates

F&A rates vary significantly by institution but have risen steadily:

| Institution Type | Typical F&A Rate | Range |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Private research universities | 55-68% | 50-69% |
| Public research universities | 45-58% | 40-62% |
| Liberal arts colleges | 35-50% | 30-55% |
| National average (all institutions) | ~53% | -- |

**What this means in practice**: On a $300,000 direct-cost R01 grant, an institution with a 55% F&A rate recovers an additional $165,000 in indirect costs, bringing the total award to $465,000. Of the original appropriation, only 65% funds the research itself.

### Top F&A Rates (Selected Institutions)

| Institution | F&A Rate (on-campus) |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Stanford University | 62% |
| MIT | 59% |
| Harvard University | 69% |
| University of Michigan | 56% |
| Johns Hopkins University | 64% |
| Columbia University | 65% |
| University of Washington | 56% |

### What F&A Covers

Universities argue that indirect costs cover essential research infrastructure:

- **Facilities (26% average)**: Building depreciation, maintenance, utilities, equipment depreciation
- **Administration (27% average)**: Departmental administration, sponsored programs office, general administration, library costs

Critics argue that F&A rates have become a profit center for universities, cross-subsidizing non-research activities and creating incentives to maximize grant volume rather than research quality.

## Geographic Concentration

### State-Level Distribution

Federal research funding is heavily concentrated in a small number of states with major research universities and federal laboratories:

| Rank | State | Federal R&D Obligations | Share of Total |
|------|-------|------------------------|----------------|
| 1 | California | ~$27B | ~16% |
| 2 | Maryland | ~$20B | ~12% |
| 3 | Virginia | ~$12B | ~7% |
| 4 | Massachusetts | ~$10B | ~6% |
| 5 | Texas | ~$8B | ~5% |
| 6 | New York | ~$7B | ~4% |
| 7 | Pennsylvania | ~$6B | ~4% |
| 8 | New Mexico | ~$6B | ~4% |
| 9 | Alabama | ~$5B | ~3% |
| 10 | Ohio | ~$5B | ~3% |
| **Top 10 Total** | | **~$106B** | **~64%** |

### Institutional Concentration

Within states, funding concentrates further at a handful of elite institutions:

- The top 20 universities receive approximately 30% of all federal academic research funding
- The top 100 universities receive approximately 80%
- Approximately 900 additional institutions share the remaining 20%

### EPSCoR Program

The Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) provides supplemental funding to states that receive a disproportionately small share of federal research dollars. Currently 28 states and territories participate. However, EPSCoR's budget (~$250M across participating agencies) represents less than 0.2% of total federal R&D, far too little to meaningfully address geographic disparities.

## Early-Career Researcher Crisis

### Lengthening Time to Independence

The path from graduate student to independent researcher has lengthened dramatically:

| Milestone | 1980 | 2000 | 2024 |
|-----------|------|------|------|
| Median age at PhD completion | 28 | 31 | 33 |
| Average years in postdoc | 2 | 4 | 5-6 |
| Average age at first R01 | 36 | 40 | 43+ |
| Average age at first faculty position | 33 | 37 | 39 |

### Funding Gap

Early-career researchers face a structural funding disadvantage:

- **K99/R00 awards**: Approximately 250-300 awarded annually across all of NIH, compared to ~5,000 new faculty hires per year in biomedical sciences
- **First R01 success rates**: Approximately 18%, below the overall 20% rate
- **New Investigator policies**: NIH and NSF have established preferences for new investigators, but the impact remains modest
- **Startup packages**: Universities provide startup funding (typically $500K-$2M in biomedical sciences), but this creates pressure to win external grants quickly

## CHIPS and Science Act: Authorization vs. Appropriation

### The Gap

The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorized $280 billion in spending, including historic increases for NSF, DOE, and NIST. However, authorizations are not appropriations, and the actual funding has fallen far short:

| Agency/Program | CHIPS Authorization (FY 2024) | Actual Appropriation (FY 2024) | Gap |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| NSF | ~$15.6B | ~$11.3B | -$4.3B (28%) |
| DOE Office of Science | ~$10.9B | ~$8.8B | -$2.1B (19%) |
| NIST | ~$2.3B | ~$1.7B | -$600M (26%) |
| NSF TIP Directorate | ~$2.0B | ~$880M | -$1.1B (56%) |

### Historical Pattern

This gap is not new. Every major research authorization bill in the past two decades has seen similar shortfalls:

| Authorization Act | Authorized Increase | Actual Increase | Gap |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----|
| America COMPETES Act (2007) | Double NSF/DOE/NIST by 2017 | ~20% increase | ~80% |
| America COMPETES Reauthorization (2010) | Sustain doubling path | Flat/decline (sequestration) | ~100% |
| CHIPS and Science Act (2022) | NSF to $19B by FY 2027 | ~$11.3B (FY 2024) | ~40% |

## Budget Instability

### Continuing Resolutions

In 12 of the past 15 fiscal years, the federal government has begun the fiscal year under a continuing resolution (CR), which freezes spending at prior-year levels and prohibits new grants, new programs, and multi-year commitments. Effects on research include:

- **Delayed grant awards**: NIH and NSF delay new grants for months, disrupting research timelines
- **Hiring freezes**: Labs cannot hire staff or extend positions under CR
- **No-cost extensions**: Researchers stretch existing funds rather than starting new work
- **Risk aversion**: Agencies avoid ambitious new programs that might not survive the CR

### Sequestration

The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed automatic spending cuts (sequestration) that reduced non-defense discretionary spending -- including research -- by approximately 5% in FY 2013. While subsequent budget deals partially restored funding, the threat of sequestration created lasting uncertainty and contributed to the funding stagnation of the 2010s.

## International Comparison

### Global R&D Investment

| Country | Total R&D (% of GDP) | Government R&D (% of GDP) | Researcher Workforce |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| United States | ~3.4% | ~0.73% | ~1.6 million |
| China | ~2.6% | ~0.5% | ~2.3 million |
| South Korea | ~4.9% | ~1.0% | ~430,000 |
| Israel | ~5.4% | ~0.8% | ~85,000 |
| Germany | ~3.1% | ~0.9% | ~450,000 |
| Japan | ~3.3% | ~0.7% | ~690,000 |

### China's Trajectory

China's R&D spending has grown at approximately 10-15% per year in real terms over the past two decades. China now publishes more scientific papers than any other country, leads in AI and quantum computing publications, and is approaching parity in citation impact. Chinese government R&D spending is projected to surpass U.S. federal R&D by the late 2020s in purchasing-power-parity terms.

## Current Reform Efforts

### Administrative Actions

- **NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy (2023)**: Requires data management plans for all NIH-funded research
- **NSF proposal page limits**: Reduced proposal length to decrease preparation burden
- **Broader Impacts**: NSF and NIH increasingly emphasize societal impact in review criteria
- **OSTP guidance on research security**: Addressing foreign interference while preserving international collaboration

### Legislative Proposals

- **CHIPS and Science Act implementation**: Ongoing appropriations battles to fund authorizations
