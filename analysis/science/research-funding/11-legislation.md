# Research Funding: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Federal research funding reform requires legislation to address three core failures: chronic budget instability caused by the annual appropriations process, declining real investment relative to GDP and international competitors, and structural inefficiencies in how research dollars are allocated and spent. This document presents two federal bills -- the Federal Research Stabilization Act and the Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act -- along with state model legislation, regulatory framework, and a thorough loopholes analysis. The bills are designed to work independently or together, providing both a funding floor and structural reforms to maximize scientific return on public investment.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Federal Research Stabilization Act

**Purpose**: Establish a mandatory funding floor for federal civilian research tied to GDP, exempt research agencies from continuing resolutions, and create multi-year budget authority to provide the stability essential for long-term scientific planning.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Research Stabilization
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Federal investment in research and development has declined
from 1.9 percent of gross domestic product in 1964 to
approximately 0.73 percent, jeopardizing American scientific
leadership, economic competitiveness, and national security.

(2) Annual appropriations uncertainty, continuing resolutions,
and sequestration have disrupted long-term research planning,
delayed grant awards, and discouraged risk-taking in federally
funded science.

(3) Competitor nations, particularly China, have dramatically
increased government research investment, threatening the
United States' position as the global leader in science and
technology.

(4) Federal research investment generates estimated economic
returns of 20 to 60 percent per year, far exceeding other
categories of public spending.

(5) The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorized historic
increases in research funding, but actual appropriations have
fallen 25 to 50 percent below authorized levels, continuing
a multi-decade pattern of broken commitments.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

the United States as determined by the Bureau of Economic
Analysis of the Department of Commerce.

(d) RESEARCH FUNDING FLOOR.--The term "research funding floor"
means the minimum level of appropriations for covered agencies
established under section 4.

SEC. 4. MANDATORY RESEARCH FUNDING FLOOR.

(a) IN GENERAL.--There is authorized to be appropriated and
there is appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not
otherwise appropriated, for each fiscal year beginning with
fiscal year 2028, an amount for covered agencies that is not
less than the research funding floor calculated under
subsection (b).

(b) CALCULATION.--

    (1) FISCAL YEAR 2028.--For fiscal year 2028, the research
    funding floor shall be 0.50 percent of GDP for the most
    recent fiscal year for which data is available.

    (2) FISCAL YEARS 2029 THROUGH 2032.--For fiscal years 2029
    through 2032, the research funding floor shall increase by

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** establishes a mandatory funding floor tied to GDP, starting at 0.5% and rising to 0.6% over five years. This is the bill's core innovation -- converting research funding from annual discretionary spending to mandatory spending with a GDP-indexed floor, similar to how Social Security operates.
- **Section 4(c)** includes structural requirements: a 60% basic research minimum prevents diversion to development, the 25% early-career set-aside addresses the age-at-first-grant crisis, and the 15% EPSCoR provision addresses geographic concentration.
- **Section 5** exempts covered agencies from continuing resolutions, allowing research to proceed during budget impasses.
- **Section 6** authorizes multi-year budget commitments with milestone reviews, enabling longer-term research projects.
- **Section 7** creates an advisory board with scientific, public, and congressional representation to guide allocation decisions.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Appropriators will oppose mandatory funding | Bill preserves congressional ability to appropriate above the floor; floor only sets a minimum |
| GDP-linked funding may be unpredictable | GDP is relatively stable and grows over time; floor only ratchets up |
| CBO scoring will show large costs | Present as investment with documented 20-60% annual returns |
| Political will may not exist | Frame as national security and economic competitiveness imperative |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Set floor at 1.0% of GDP (approximating 1960s levels)
- **Fallback version**: CR exemption only (Section 5), without mandatory funding
- **Alternative**: Replace mandatory appropriation with a dedicated trust fund funded by specific revenue sources

---

### Bill 2: Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act

**Purpose**: Reform the federal grant system to improve efficiency, reduce proposal burden, increase geographic equity, cap indirect cost rates, and strengthen support for early-career researchers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Research Funding Efficiency and
Equity Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The success rate for NIH R01 research grants has declined
from approximately 30 percent in the late 1990s to approximately
20 percent, meaning that 4 out of 5 meritorious proposals are
rejected for lack of funding.

(2) Researchers at federally funded institutions spend an
estimated 40 to 50 percent of their time writing grant
proposals, reducing time available for research.

(3) Indirect cost rates charged by universities for federally
funded research average above 53 percent of direct costs, with
some institutions charging rates exceeding 65 percent, meaning
that a significant fraction of every Federal research dollar
does not reach the laboratory.

(4) Ten States receive more than 60 percent of all Federal
research funding, depriving the majority of Americans of the
economic and social benefits of a local research enterprise.

(5) The average age at which biomedical researchers receive
their first major independent research grant now exceeds 43,
wasting the most creative years of scientific careers.

(6) The Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research
(EPSCoR) receives less than 0.2 percent of total Federal
research and development funding, insufficient to meaningfully
address geographic disparities.

SEC. 3. TWO-STAGE PROPOSAL REVIEW.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Not later than 2 years after the date of
enactment of this Act, the head of each covered Federal
research agency shall implement a two-stage proposal review
process for all grant programs with a funding rate below
25 percent.

(b) STAGE ONE.--The first stage of review shall consist of--
    (1) a concept paper of not more than 5 pages describing
    the proposed research, its significance, and the
    qualifications of the research team;
    (2) review by qualified peers for scientific merit,
    significance, and innovation; and
    (3) identification of not more than 50 percent of
    submissions for invitation to submit a full proposal.

(c) STAGE TWO.--The second stage of review shall consist of--
    (1) a full proposal of not more than 15 pages;
    (2) detailed review by qualified peers; and
    (3) funding decisions based on scientific merit, broader
    impacts, and portfolio considerations.

(d) RESUBMISSION.--Applicants whose concept papers are not
selected for full proposal development may resubmit in
subsequent review cycles without prejudice.

(e) EXCEPTIONS.--The head of a covered Federal research
agency may exempt specific programs from the requirements
of this section if the agency head certifies that the
two-stage process would be incompatible with the program's
mission or would delay time-sensitive research.

SEC. 4. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION LIMITS.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Not later than 1 year after the date of
enactment of this Act, the head of each covered Federal
research agency shall establish limits on the number of
new research proposals that may be submitted by any
individual investigator in a 12-month period.

(b) LIMITS.--The limits established under subsection (a)
shall--
    (1) permit each investigator to submit not more than 2
    new proposals per 12-month period for grants exceeding
    $250,000 in annual direct costs; and
    (2) permit unlimited submissions for proposals of
    $250,000 or less in annual direct costs, including
    exploratory and pilot grants.

(c) CO-INVESTIGATOR EXCEPTION.--Proposals on which an
investigator serves as co-investigator rather than principal
investigator shall not count toward the limit established
under subsection (b).

(d) EARLY-STAGE INVESTIGATOR EXCEPTION.--Investigators who
have not previously received a major independent research
award from the agency may submit up to 3 new proposals per
12-month period.

SEC. 5. INDIRECT COST RATE REFORM.

(a) GRADUATED RATE CAP.--Effective beginning with fiscal year
2029, indirect cost rates for research grants and contracts
awarded by covered Federal research agencies shall not exceed
the following limits based on the total annual direct costs
of Federal research at each institution:

    (1) For institutions with total annual direct costs of
    $50,000,000 or less: the lesser of the institution's
    negotiated rate or 60 percent.

    (2) For institutions with total annual direct costs
    exceeding $50,000,000 but not exceeding $200,000,000:
    the lesser of the institution's negotiated rate or
    50 percent.

    (3) For institutions with total annual direct costs
    exceeding $200,000,000 but not exceeding $500,000,000:
    the lesser of the institution's negotiated rate or
    45 percent.

    (4) For institutions with total annual direct costs
    exceeding $500,000,000: the lesser of the institution's
    negotiated rate or 40 percent.

(b) PHASE-IN.--The rate caps established under subsection (a)
shall be phased in over 4 fiscal years, with the cap
declining by one-quarter of the difference between the
institution's current negotiated rate and the applicable
cap in each fiscal year.

(c) SAVINGS REALLOCATION.--All savings resulting from the
indirect cost rate caps established under subsection (a)
shall be reallocated to--
    (1) direct research costs for new grants (60 percent
    of savings);
    (2) early-stage investigator awards (25 percent of
    savings); and
    (3) the EPSCoR program and equivalent geographic equity
    programs (15 percent of savings).

(d) TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS.--Not later than 1 year after
the date of enactment of this Act, each institution of
higher education receiving more than $10,000,000 annually
in Federal research funding shall--
    (1) publish on its public website an annual report
    detailing how indirect cost recovery is allocated
    among facilities, administration, departmental support,
    and other categories;
    (2) certify that indirect cost recovery is used
    exclusively for the support of research and related
    activities; and
    (3) submit such report to the cognizant Federal agency
    and to the Director of the Office of Management and
    Budget.

(e) AUDIT.--The Inspector General of the cognizant Federal
agency shall conduct periodic audits of indirect cost
reporting under subsection (d), with findings reported to
Congress.

SEC. 6. GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY IN RESEARCH FUNDING.

(a) EPSCO EXPANSION.--

    (1) AUTHORIZATION.--There is authorized to be appropriated
    for the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive

        succeeding fiscal year.

    (2) CAPACITY BUILDING GRANTS.--Not less than 50 percent
    of EPSCoR funding shall be awarded as capacity-building
    grants with durations of not less than 7 years, for the
    purpose of--
        (A) establishing or expanding research programs at
        institutions in participating States;
        (B) constructing or renovating research facilities;
        (C) acquiring major research equipment; and
        (D) recruiting and retaining research faculty.

    (3) REDUCED MATCHING.--For States with a per-capita
    personal income below 90 percent of the national average,
    the State matching requirement shall be reduced from
    the standard ratio to not more than 25 percent.

(b) GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION REPORTING.--Not later than 6
months after the date of enactment of this Act, the head
of each covered Federal research agency shall--
    (1) publish data on the geographic distribution of
    research awards by State, congressional district,
    institution type, and urban or rural classification;
    (2) establish targets for increasing research funding
    to historically underserved States; and
    (3) include geographic distribution as a portfolio-level
    consideration in program planning, while maintaining
    scientific merit as the primary criterion for individual
    award decisions.

SEC. 7. EARLY-CAREER RESEARCHER SUPPORT.

(a) POSTDOCTORAL INDEPENDENCE AWARDS.--

    (1) ESTABLISHMENT.--Each covered Federal research agency
    that supports postdoctoral researchers shall establish a
    Postdoctoral Independence Award program.

    (2) AWARD TERMS.--Postdoctoral Independence Awards shall--

    (8) the United States Department of Agriculture National
    Institute of Food and Agriculture; and
    (9) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be
necessary to carry out this Act.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

Except as otherwise provided, this Act shall take effect on
October 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3** mandates two-stage review for programs with low success rates, reducing proposal-writing burden by approximately 40% while maintaining rigorous peer review.
- **Section 4** limits major proposal submissions to two per year per PI, reducing system-wide proposal volume and increasing success rates. Early-career investigators get an additional submission.
- **Section 5** implements graduated F&A caps that hit highest-volume institutions hardest while protecting smaller research programs. The 4-year phase-in provides adjustment time. Savings are redistributed to direct research, early-career investigators, and geographic equity.
- **Section 6** expands EPSCoR from $250M to $1.5B over five years, with 7-year capacity-building grants and reduced matching for lower-income states.
- **Section 7** creates 2,000 portable Postdoctoral Independence Awards at $250K/year with minimal (15%) indirect costs, and requires a 25% early-stage investigator set-aside.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| University lobby will oppose F&A caps | Graduated approach protects smaller institutions; transparency builds public support |
| Submission limits may disadvantage prolific researchers | Exception for co-investigator roles; early-career exception; smaller grants exempt |
| Two-stage review adds complexity | Already proven at ERC and some NSF programs; reduces total workload |
| EPSCoR expansion may dilute quality | Funds capacity building, not formula grants; institutions must become competitive |
| 25% early-career set-aside reduces senior funding | Offset by increased overall funding from F&A savings |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Cap all F&A rates at 40% regardless of volume; mandate 30% early-career set-aside
- **Fallback version**: Transparency and reporting requirements only (Section 5(d)), without caps
- **Alternative**: Replace graduated cap with a flat cap of 50% for all institutions

## State Model Legislation

### Research Capacity Investment Act

**Purpose**: Establish state-level matching funds for federal research capacity-building programs and create incentives for research institutions to locate in underserved areas.

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Research Capacity
Investment Act".

SECTION 2. STATE RESEARCH MATCHING FUND.

(a) There is established in the State Treasury the [State]
Research Matching Fund.

(b) The Fund shall be used exclusively to provide matching
funds for Federal research capacity-building programs,
including EPSCoR, regional innovation hubs, and similar
programs.

(c) There is appropriated to the Fund $[amount] for each
fiscal year.

SECTION 3. RESEARCH INSTITUTION INCENTIVES.

(a) Research institutions that establish or expand research
facilities in counties with unemployment rates exceeding
the State average shall be eligible for--
    (1) a State income tax credit equal to 25 percent of
    qualifying research expenditures;
    (2) priority access to State infrastructure funding; and
    (3) expedited permitting for research facility
    construction.

(b) Qualifying research expenditures include laboratory
construction, equipment acquisition, and researcher
recruitment.

SECTION 4. ANNUAL REPORTING.

The [State] Department of Commerce shall publish an annual
report on--
    (1) Federal research funding received by institutions in
    the State;
    (2) State matching fund expenditures;
    (3) research jobs created; and
    (4) economic impact of research activities.
```

**Adaptations**: States with existing research tax credits may integrate these provisions into existing programs. States with strong existing research universities may focus on expanding capacity at regional campuses rather than recruiting new institutions.

## Regulatory Framework

### OMB Circular on Indirect Cost Transparency

**Existing Authority**: OMB has authority under 2 C.F.R. Part 200 (Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards) to establish cost principles for educational institutions receiving federal funds.

**Draft Regulation**:

OMB should issue updated guidance under 2 C.F.R. Part 200 requiring that:

1. Institutions report indirect cost recovery allocations by category (facilities, general administration, departmental administration, sponsored programs administration, library, student services) in a standardized public format
2. F&A rate negotiations consider institutional efficiency benchmarks
3. Institutions certify annually that F&A recovery supports research-related activities
4. Cognizant agencies publish comparative F&A rate data across institutions

**Explanation**: This regulatory action can be taken without legislation under existing OMB authority and would provide the data foundation for legislative F&A reform.

### NIH and NSF Policy on Two-Stage Review

**Existing Authority**: NIH and NSF have broad authority over their grant review processes under their respective organic statutes.

**Implementation**: Agency heads can direct implementation of two-stage review through internal policy directives, without rulemaking or legislation.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Spending Clause**: Congress has broad authority under the Spending Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1) to fund scientific research. The mandatory appropriation mechanism in Bill 1 may face challenge as constraining future Congresses, but precedent exists in Social Security, Medicare, and other mandatory programs.
- **Appropriations Power**: Mandatory funding shifts some power from the Appropriations Committees to the authorizing committees. This is a political challenge rather than a constitutional one -- Congress can create mandatory spending programs.

### Preemption Questions

- **Indirect cost caps** may raise questions about federal interference with institutional autonomy. However, since F&A rates are a condition of voluntary federal funding, they do not raise preemption issues -- institutions are free to refuse federal grants.
- **Career outcome reporting** requirements are similarly voluntary conditions of federal funding, well within Spending Clause authority per *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **F&A compliance**: Enforced through the cognizant agency audit process and Inspector General oversight
- **Geographic distribution targets**: Enforced through reporting requirements and portfolio-level review
- **Early-career set-asides**: Enforced through agency reporting to Congress
- **Proposal submission limits**: Enforced through agency grant management systems (eRA Commons, Research.gov)

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The Research Investment Advisory Board (Bill 1, Section 7) conducts comprehensive review every 5 years
- F&A rate caps (Bill 2, Section 5) include a 4-year phase-in with annual reporting
- EPSCoR expansion (Bill 2, Section 6) authorizes funding through FY 2032 with reauthorization required thereafter

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Federal Research Stabilization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| GDP measurement manipulation | Future administrations could advocate for GDP measurement changes that lower the funding floor | Low |
| Agency designation gaming | OSTP could add agencies to covered list to dilute per-agency funding | Medium |
| Allocation discretion | OSTP/OMB could allocate floor funding to low-impact programs while cutting high-impact ones | Medium |
| CR exemption abuse | Agencies could use CR exemption authority to commit to politically favored projects before appropriations are finalized | Medium |
| Milestone review weakness | Multi-year awards could continue without genuine progress if milestone reviews lack rigor | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Mandatory spending opposition | Bill may never pass due to appropriator resistance | Structural power dynamics in Congress |
| GDP floor may be insufficient | 0.6% of GDP still below 1960s peak and below several competitor nations | Political compromise |
| No enforcement mechanism for floor | If Congress fails to appropriate the floor amount, no penalty exists | Separation of powers |
| Advisory board may lack teeth | Board recommendations are advisory only | Political reality |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Add a provision requiring that if actual appropriations fall below the floor for two consecutive fiscal years, the shortfall is automatically added to the next fiscal year's mandatory appropriation
2. Require Senate confirmation for OSTP director to increase accountability for allocation decisions
3. Establish independent milestone review panels with authority to terminate awards, rather than leaving review to the awarding agency
4. Include a provision that the GDP percentage shall be reviewed and potentially increased every 5 years by the Advisory Board, with recommendations transmitted to Congress

### Research Funding Efficiency and Equity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| F&A rate restructuring | Universities could restructure costs to shift expenses between categories, maintaining effective rates above caps | High |
| Submission limit circumvention | PIs could use co-investigators as nominal PIs to circumvent submission limits | Medium |
| Two-stage review gaming | Researchers could write concept papers designed for broad appeal rather than scientific substance | Low |
| EPSCoR capacity building without sustainability | Institutions could use capacity grants for short-term hiring without building sustainable programs | High |
| Early-career definition manipulation | Institutions could classify established researchers as "early-career" through technicalities | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Graduated F&A cap affects only highest-volume institutions | Majority of institutions unaffected; reform may seem punitive to top universities | Political feasibility tradeoff |
| Submission limits may disadvantage collaborative researchers | Interdisciplinary work requires multiple proposals | Blunt instrument |
| 25% early-career set-aside may be insufficient | Does not address total funding adequacy | Set-aside is redistributive, not expansionary |
| Career outcome reporting lacks consequences | Institutions may report poor outcomes without penalty | No enforcement mechanism for outcomes |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require OMB to issue detailed cost classification guidance preventing F&A rate restructuring that circumvents the graduated cap
2. Implement a proposal tracking system that identifies and flags potential submission limit circumvention patterns
3. Tie EPSCoR capacity-building continuation funding to measurable progress metrics (faculty recruitment, grant success, student training)
4. Define "early-stage investigator" based on career milestones (first independent grant, years since terminal degree) rather than institutional classification, to prevent manipulation
5. Establish consequences for institutions whose doctoral graduates and postdocs consistently report poor career outcomes (reduced training grant allocations)

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| University lobby may weaken F&A provisions during legislative process | Build coalition of early-career researchers, EPSCoR states, and fiscal conservatives |
| Two-stage review may not reduce total proposal effort if Stage 1 becomes highly competitive | Monitor Stage 1 acceptance rates; adjust threshold if necessary |
| Geographic equity provisions may conflict with merit-based funding principles | Maintain merit review for individual awards; apply equity considerations at portfolio level only |
| Mandatory funding may create complacency in agencies | Require outcome-based reporting and periodic independent evaluation |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- All provisions should be subject to GAO evaluation at years 3 and 7 after implementation
- F&A rate caps should be reviewed every 5 years and adjusted based on institutional cost data
- EPSCoR expansion authorization expires in FY 2032, requiring reauthorization with performance review
- Two-stage review and submission limit policies should be evaluated against baseline metrics (proposal volume, success rates, researcher time use) after 3 years
