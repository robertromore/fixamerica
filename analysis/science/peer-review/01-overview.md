# Peer Review: Overview

## Executive Summary

Peer review is the primary quality-control mechanism for scientific research, governing both the publication of findings in journals and the allocation of billions of dollars in federal research funding. Yet this system suffers from well-documented biases, chronic delays, lack of transparency, and perverse incentives that distort the scientific enterprise. Reviewer bias based on gender, institutional prestige, geographic origin, and methodological orthodoxy systematically filters which research reaches the public and which scientists receive funding. The system rewards novelty over rigor, favors established researchers over newcomers, and imposes enormous unpaid labor burdens on the scientific workforce.

The consequences extend far beyond academia. When peer review fails, taxpayer-funded research is misallocated, promising discoveries are delayed or suppressed, and public trust in science erodes. The rise of preprint servers has begun to disrupt the traditional model, but without deliberate reform, the gatekeeping function of peer review will continue to entrench existing hierarchies rather than advance knowledge.

Reforming peer review requires addressing both the journal publication pipeline and the federal grant review process, while preserving the core function of expert evaluation that makes science self-correcting.

## Scope

## The Core Problem

### Two Systems, Common Failures

Peer review operates in two distinct but related domains:

| Domain | Scale | Who Reviews | Key Problems |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Journal publication** | ~3 million articles/year globally | Unpaid volunteer academics | Bias, delay, reviewer fatigue, opacity |
| **Federal grant review** | ~$45 billion/year (NIH + NSF) | Compensated panel members | Conservatism bias, conflicts of interest, demographic skew |

### The Journal Review Pipeline

```text
Submission --> Editorial Triage --> Reviewer Assignment --> Review (weeks-months)
    |               |                     |                      |
    |          ~50% desk                 2-4 reviewers      Revise & resubmit
    |          rejected                  invited            (additional months)
    |                                                            |
    v                                                            v
Rejected --> Resubmit         Accept/Reject decision       Publication
elsewhere    elsewhere        (often months after          (months-years
             (cycle restarts) submission)                   after discovery)
```

### The Grant Review Pipeline

```text
Application --> Agency Staff --> Study Section/Panel --> Scoring --> Funding Decision
    |           Assignment        Review                   |              |
    |                             (2-3 days)               |         Top ~20%
    |                                                      |         funded
    v                                                      v
Unfunded --> Revise       Percentile ranking          Funded
(~80%)      & resubmit    determines fate             (begin research)
            (6-12 months
             cycle)
```

## Key Concepts

### Types of Journal Peer Review

| Model | How It Works | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Single-blind** | Reviewers anonymous; authors known | Protects reviewer candor | Enables bias against authors |
| **Double-blind** | Both parties anonymous | Reduces identity-based bias | Imperfect masking; field experts identifiable |
| **Open** | Both parties identified; reviews may be published | Accountability, transparency | May chill criticism; power dynamics |
| **Post-publication** | Published first, reviewed after | Speed; broader critique | Quality concerns; less gatekeeping |
| **Registered reports** | Methods reviewed before results known | Reduces publication bias | Slower; less flexible |

### Grant Review Structures

**NIH Study Sections**

- Standing committees of ~20-30 scientists
- Meet three times per year (February, June, October)
- Each application assigned 2-3 reviewers and a discussant
- Score on five criteria: significance, investigators, innovation, approach, environment
- Overall impact score on 1-9 scale, converted to percentile

**NSF Panels**

- Ad hoc panels assembled per competition
- Typically 3-6 panelists per proposal
- Score on intellectual merit and broader impacts
- Program officer has significant discretion beyond panel scores

### Impact Factor and Journal Prestige

| Metric | What It Measures | Problems |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Journal Impact Factor (JIF)** | Average citations per article over 2 years | Skewed by outliers; incentivizes sensational findings |
| **h-index** | Researcher productivity and citation impact | Favors prolific publishers; field-dependent |
| **Altmetrics** | Social media, news, policy mentions | Measures attention, not quality |

## Why This Matters

### For Scientific Progress

When peer review is biased, slow, or unreliable, important discoveries are delayed or lost. Conservative bias in grant review means incremental work is funded while potentially transformative research is rejected as too risky. Publication bias means negative results go unpublished, wasting resources on duplicated dead ends.

### For Taxpayer Investment

The federal government spends over $45 billion annually on research through NIH, NSF, DOE, and other agencies. Flawed peer review means this investment is not optimally allocated. The time researchers spend on unfunded proposals represents billions in wasted effort that could be spent doing science.

### For Scientific Equity

Bias in peer review perpetuates demographic and institutional inequities. Early-career researchers, women, scientists of color, and researchers at less prestigious institutions face systematic disadvantages that compound over careers. This narrows the talent pool and limits the diversity of perspectives in science.

### For Public Trust

When the peer review system fails to catch errors, fraud, or irreproducible results, public trust in science suffers. High-profile retractions from prestigious journals undermine confidence in the self-correcting nature of science.
