# Peer Review: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Peer review reform operates primarily through federal agency policy and scientific community norms rather than statute. However, targeted legislation can address critical gaps that voluntary action has failed to close: transparency in taxpayer-funded review processes, equity in grant allocation, and accountability for the billions of dollars in research funding distributed through peer review. This document presents two federal bills addressing review transparency and grant equity, along with regulatory frameworks and model state legislation.

No constitutional amendments are required for peer review reform. The federal government's authority to set conditions on research grants it funds is well established under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) and does not raise significant First Amendment or federalism concerns.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Scientific Peer Review Transparency and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: Require federal agencies to publish anonymized peer review data, mandate reviewer diversity standards, and establish accountability mechanisms for federally funded research review processes.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Scientific Peer Review Transparency
and Accountability Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Federal Government invests over $45,000,000,000 annually
    in scientific research through the National Institutes of Health,
    the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and
    other agencies.
(2) Peer review is the primary mechanism by which Federal agencies
    allocate research funding, yet the peer review process lacks
    systematic transparency and accountability.
(3) Documented biases in peer review based on race, gender,
    institutional affiliation, and geographic origin result in
    inequitable allocation of taxpayer-funded research dollars.
(4) Low inter-reviewer reliability in grant scoring means that
    funding decisions in competitive ranges are often functionally
    arbitrary.
(5) The scientific workforce and the public have a legitimate
    interest in understanding how Federal research funds are
    allocated through peer review.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(a) COVERED AGENCY.--The term "covered agency" means--
    (1) the National Institutes of Health;

    (5) the Department of Defense basic research programs;
    (6) the United States Department of Agriculture National
        Institute of Food and Agriculture; and
    (7) any other Federal agency that allocates more than
        $100,000,000 annually in competitive, peer-reviewed
        research grants, as determined by the Director of the
        Office of Science and Technology Policy.
(b) PEER REVIEW.--The term "peer review" means the evaluation
    of research proposals or manuscripts by qualified experts in

    (3) oversee compliance with the requirements of this Act;
    (4) commission and publish research on peer review
        effectiveness, bias, and reform;
    (5) receive and investigate complaints regarding peer
        review processes at covered agencies;
    (6) issue an annual report to Congress on the state of
        Federal peer review; and
    (7) consult with the scientific community, including
        professional societies, research institutions, and
        advocacy organizations, on peer review improvement.
(d) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.--There is authorized to be
    appropriated to carry out this section $5,000,000 for each
    of fiscal years 2027 through 2032.

SEC. 8. PREPRINT AND OPEN ACCESS REQUIREMENTS.

(a) PREPRINT POSTING.--Not later than 1 year after the date of
    enactment of this Act, each covered agency shall require
    that all peer-reviewed scholarly publications resulting from
    research funded in whole or in part by the agency be posted
    as preprints in a publicly accessible repository approved
    by the agency not later than the date of publication.
(b) REVIEW REPORT AVAILABILITY.--Each covered agency shall
    encourage, and may require as a condition of funding, that
    grantees publish peer review reports received from journals
    alongside their published articles, in anonymized form if
    necessary.

SEC. 9. GAO STUDY.

(a) STUDY.--Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment
    of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States

        randomization in Federal grant allocation; and
    (4) international best practices in peer review reform.
(b) REPORT.--Not later than 4 years after the date of enactment
    of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to Congress
    a report containing the results of the study conducted under
    subsection (a), together with recommendations for further
    legislative action.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** addresses the lack of transparency by requiring agencies to publish anonymized review data disaggregated by demographics. This enables evidence-based monitoring of bias without compromising individual privacy.
- **Section 5** establishes reviewer diversity benchmarks to address the documented underrepresentation of women, minorities, and non-R1 institution scientists on review panels.
- **Section 6** mandates specific process improvements (anonymous review, streamlined applications, timeline standards) that agencies have been slow to implement voluntarily.
- **Section 7** creates a coordinating office to ensure consistent implementation across agencies and provide ongoing oversight.
- **Section 8** codifies preprint and open access requirements, extending the OSTP Nelson Memo into statute.
- **Section 9** commissions a GAO study on partial randomization, building the evidence base for future reforms without mandating an untested approach.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Agency resistance to transparency mandates | Data is anonymized and aggregate; no individual exposure |
| Privacy concerns for applicants/reviewers | Section 4(c) explicitly prevents reidentification |
| Cost of implementation | $5 million/year for OPRI; other costs absorbed into existing budgets |
| Diversity benchmarks perceived as quotas | Benchmarks are targets, not mandates; progress-reporting approach |
| First Amendment concerns about mandating review practices | Spending Clause authority; conditions on grants, not general speech regulation |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Mandate partial randomization for grants in competitive score ranges rather than just studying it
- **Fallback version**: Apply only to NIH and NSF (the two largest agencies) rather than all covered agencies
- **Sunset provision**: Include a 10-year sunset with reauthorization requirement to ensure ongoing congressional review

### Bill 2: Research Reviewer Fair Compensation and Recognition Act

**Purpose**: Establish a federal program to compensate peer reviewers for journal manuscript review of federally funded research, create a national reviewer recognition system, and require that review service count toward career advancement at institutions receiving federal funds.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Research Reviewer Fair Compensation
and Recognition Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Peer review of scientific manuscripts is essential to
    maintaining the quality and integrity of the scientific
    record.
(2) Peer reviewers of journal manuscripts are overwhelmingly
    uncompensated for their labor, despite performing a critical
    function valued at an estimated $1,500,000,000 or more
    annually in the United States alone.
(3) The academic publishing industry generates more than
    $10,000,000,000 in annual revenue in the United States
    while relying on free reviewer labor.
(4) Declining reviewer participation rates threaten the quality
    and timeliness of scientific publication.
(5) Lack of formal recognition for review service disadvantages
    scientists, particularly early-career and underrepresented
    researchers, who perform this essential work without career
    credit.
(6) Federal investment in scientific research depends on a
    functioning peer review system to ensure that published
    findings are reliable and reproducible.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    Registry" means the registry established under section 5.

SEC. 4. FEDERAL REVIEWER COMPENSATION PROGRAM.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established within the National
    Science Foundation a Federal Reviewer Compensation Program
    (in this section referred to as the "Program") to provide
    compensation to qualified reviewers for eligible reviews.
(b) COMPENSATION RATES.--
    (1) STANDARD RATE.--The standard compensation for an
        eligible review shall be $300.
    (2) COMPLEX REVIEW.--For reviews of manuscripts requiring
        specialized statistical, methodological, or

        journal editor, the compensation rate shall be $500.
    (3) ADJUSTMENT.--The Director shall adjust compensation
        rates not less than every 3 years to reflect changes
        in the Consumer Price Index and the scientific labor
        market.
(c) ELIGIBILITY AND APPLICATION.--
    (1) A qualified reviewer who completes an eligible review
        may apply for compensation through the National Reviewer
        Registry established under section 5.

            reporting federally funded research; and
        (B) negotiated contributions from publishers
            participating in the Program.

SEC. 5. NATIONAL REVIEWER REGISTRY.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--Not later than 18 months after the date of
    enactment of this Act, the Director shall establish and
    maintain a National Reviewer Registry to track and
    recognize peer review contributions by qualified reviewers.
(b) REGISTRY FUNCTIONS.--The Registry shall--
    (1) assign unique reviewer identification numbers linked
        to ORCID identifiers;
    (2) maintain verified records of reviews completed,
        including journal, date, and quality ratings;
    (3) generate standardized reviewer activity reports that
        can be included in grant applications, tenure
        dossiers, and other career documents;
    (4) provide aggregate statistics on reviewer demographics,
        participation rates, and workload distribution; and
    (5) integrate with existing platforms including ORCID,

(c) JOURNAL QUALITY STANDARDS.--The Director shall establish
    standards for journal participation in the Registry,
    including--
    (1) editorial governance requirements;
    (2) review process transparency standards;
    (3) anti-predatory publishing criteria; and
    (4) compliance with applicable research integrity
        guidelines.

SEC. 6. INSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS.

(a) REQUIREMENT.--Not later than 2 years after the date of
    enactment of this Act, each covered institution shall--
    (1) include peer review service as a recognized criterion
        in tenure, promotion, and merit review processes;
    (2) accept National Reviewer Registry reports as verified
        documentation of review contributions;
    (3) prohibit the use of journal impact factors as a
        proxy for the quality of individual articles or
        researchers in hiring, tenure, and promotion
        decisions; and
    (4) incorporate peer review service into faculty workload
        and service credit calculations.

    payments are made under section 4, the Director shall
    commission an independent study evaluating--
    (1) the impact of compensation on reviewer participation
        rates, review quality, and timeliness;
    (2) the demographic distribution of compensated reviewers;
    (3) the effect on publication timelines for federally
        funded research;
    (4) the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of expanding
        the Program; and
    (5) any unintended consequences, including effects on
        journal operations and reviewer behavior.
(b) REPORT.--Not later than 4 years after the first
    compensation payments, the Director shall submit a report
    to Congress containing the results of the study and
    recommendations for Program modification.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** establishes the core compensation program. The $300-$500 per review rate is modest relative to the professional time involved (5-10 hours per review) but represents a meaningful recognition of labor. Phased appropriations allow the program to scale as infrastructure is built.
- **Section 4(g)(2)** addresses the fundamental inequity of publishers profiting from unpaid reviewer labor by exploring cost-recovery mechanisms.
- **Section 5** creates a national infrastructure for tracking and recognizing review contributions, solving the fragmentation problem where review service is invisible in career records.
- **Section 6** is the most structurally important provision: it requires institutions receiving federal funds to formally credit review service and abandon journal impact factors in evaluation. This addresses the root cause of the publish-or-perish dynamic.
- **Section 7** builds in evaluation and accountability, ensuring the program is assessed for effectiveness and unintended consequences.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Cost ($500 million/year at scale) | Compare to $45 billion in federal research spending; review quality is essential to that investment |
| Publisher opposition to cost recovery | Assessment is exploratory; negotiated contributions voluntary initially |
| Institutional resistance to Section 6 | 2-year implementation timeline; waiver provisions; tied to existing federal funding relationships |
| Fraud and gaming risks | Fraud prevention provisions in Section 4(f); quality standards in Section 4(d) |
| Impact factor ban perceived as overreach | Prohibition applies only to using IF as proxy for *individual* article or researcher quality |
| AI-generated review concerns | Section 4(f)(1)(C) specifically addresses this emerging risk |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Make publisher cost-sharing mandatory rather than exploratory; extend institutional requirements to all institutions (not just those receiving $1 million+)
- **Fallback version**: Start with registry and recognition only (Sections 5-6), adding compensation in a subsequent authorization
- **Pilot approach**: Limit initial compensation to NIH-funded research reviews only, expanding based on evaluation results

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Research Assessment Reform Act

**Purpose**: Require state universities to adopt research assessment practices that value diverse scholarly contributions and peer review service.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Research Assessment
Reform Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "State institution of higher education" means any public
    university, college, or research institute supported in
    whole or in part by State funds.
(b) "Research assessment" means any evaluation of faculty
    research productivity or quality for the purpose of
    hiring, promotion, tenure, or merit review.
(c) "Journal impact factor" means the average number of
    citations received per article published in a journal
    over a defined period, as calculated by any citation
    indexing service.

SECTION 3. RESEARCH ASSESSMENT STANDARDS.

(a) No State institution of higher education shall use
    journal impact factors as a criterion in research
    assessment of individual faculty members.
(b) Each State institution of higher education shall
    adopt research assessment policies that--
    (1) evaluate research outputs on their own merits,
        including content, rigor, and impact;
    (2) recognize diverse forms of scholarly output,
        including preprints, datasets, software, and
        community engagement;
    (3) value peer review service, editorial service, and
        mentoring as professional contributions; and
    (4) consider the quality of research rather than the
        venue of publication.

SECTION 4. IMPLEMENTATION.

Each State institution of higher education shall revise its
tenure, promotion, and merit review policies to comply with
this Act not later than 2 years after the effective date.

SECTION 5. REPORTING.

Each State institution of higher education shall report
annually to the [State Higher Education Authority] on its
compliance with this Act, including a description of the
research assessment criteria used in tenure and promotion
decisions during the preceding academic year.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

**Explanation**: This model legislation targets the university evaluation system, which is the root driver of impact factor obsession and the publish-or-perish dynamic. By prohibiting impact factor use in individual research assessment and requiring recognition of diverse scholarly contributions (including peer review service), it shifts incentives at the institutional level.

**Adaptations**: States may customize by adjusting the scope (all public institutions vs. research universities only), the timeline for compliance, and the enforcement mechanism (reporting vs. funding conditions).

## Regulatory Framework

### NIH/CSR Regulation: Anonymous Review Implementation

**Existing Authority**: 42 U.S.C. Section 289a (NIH peer review authority); NIH Grants Policy Statement

**Draft Regulation**:

The Center for Scientific Review shall implement the following procedures for all research project grant (R-series) applications:

1. Initial review of the Research Strategy shall be conducted without access to the Biographical Sketch, institutional affiliation, or prior funding history of investigators
2. Reviewer access to investigator information shall be provided only after initial scoring of scientific merit, for the limited purpose of assessing feasibility and environment
3. Applications shall be formatted to remove identifying information from the Research Strategy section, including self-citations presented in a way that reveals author identity

**Explanation**: This regulation implements anonymous review within NIH's existing statutory authority, without requiring legislation. It addresses the documented halo effect of investigator prestige and institutional affiliation on scoring.

### NSF Regulation: Broader Impacts Review Standardization

**Existing Authority**: 42 U.S.C. Section 1862 (NSF authority); NSF Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide

**Draft Regulation**:

The NSF shall:

1. Develop standardized rubrics for evaluating Broader Impacts criteria
2. Require panelists to score Broader Impacts independently from Intellectual Merit
3. Provide specific training on Broader Impacts evaluation for all panel members
4. Publish aggregate data on how Broader Impacts scores correlate with proposal demographics and outcomes

**Explanation**: NSF's Broader Impacts criterion is widely criticized as vaguely defined and inconsistently evaluated. Standardization would improve reliability and equity.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Spending Clause authority**: Congress may attach conditions to federal research grants, including peer review process requirements. *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), establishes that conditions must be related to the federal interest in the program.
- **First Amendment**: Peer review involves expert opinion, which could raise free speech concerns. However, transparency requirements (data publication) do not compel or restrict speech. Anonymous review requirements regulate the *process* of evaluation, not the *content* of reviewer opinions.
- **Academic freedom**: Universities may argue that tenure criteria are protected by academic freedom. However, conditions on federal funding do not dictate tenure decisions; they require consideration of specific factors.

### Preemption Questions

- Federal peer review legislation applies to federally funded research and institutions receiving federal funds. It does not preempt state regulation of state-funded research or private institutional practices.
- State model legislation applies to public institutions; private institutions are not affected unless they receive state funds and the legislation is drafted to cover them.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Bill 1**: Compliance monitored by the Office of Peer Review Integrity; non-compliant agencies subject to OSTP oversight and congressional oversight hearings.
- **Bill 2**: Reviewer compensation administered through NSF; institutional compliance required as a condition of federal research funding eligibility.
- **State legislation**: Compliance reported to state higher education authorities; enforcement through existing institutional governance mechanisms.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Bill 1 authorizes the Office of Peer Review Integrity for 6 years (FY2027-2032) with reauthorization required.
- Bill 2 mandates an independent evaluation study within 4 years of first compensation payments.
- Both bills include GAO study provisions to build an evidence base for future legislative action.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Scientific Peer Review Transparency and Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Data aggregation obscuring disparities | Agencies could aggregate data at levels that mask bias (e.g., all minorities combined) | Medium |
| Diversity benchmark gaming | Agencies could set low benchmarks or count token participation | Medium |
| Anonymous review workarounds | Self-citations and writing style may identify applicants despite anonymization | Medium |
| Timeline standards without enforcement | Maximum review timelines have no penalty for non-compliance | Low |
| Covered agency threshold evasion | Agencies could restructure funding below $100 million threshold | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address journal peer review directly | Journal review bias unaffected by grant-focused legislation | Federal authority limited to funded research |
| No mandatory partial randomization | Conservative bias in scoring persists | Insufficient political support; GAO study is compromise |
| Voluntary preprint posting encouragement | Journals may still delay open access | Publisher opposition to mandatory requirements |
| No penalties for non-compliance | Agencies face reputational but not financial consequences | Political difficulty of punishing federal agencies |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require disaggregated reporting at the level of individual racial and ethnic categories, not aggregated "minority" categories
2. Mandate that diversity benchmarks match or exceed the demographic composition of the relevant scientific workforce, with specific numerical targets
3. Develop AI-assisted anonymization tools that detect and redact identifying stylistic features
4. Attach funding consequences to review timeline non-compliance (e.g., automatic extension of investigator grant periods)
5. Lower the covered agency threshold to $50 million to capture additional agencies

### Research Reviewer Fair Compensation and Recognition Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Fraudulent review claims | Reviewers could submit perfunctory reviews to collect compensation | High |
| Journal quality gaming | Low-quality journals could register to access compensation funds | High |
| Institutional compliance lip service | Universities could formally add review to criteria without weighting it meaningfully | Medium |
| Publisher free-riding | Publishers benefit from compensated labor without contributing to costs | Medium |
| AI-generated reviews | Reviewers could submit AI-generated reviews while claiming compensation | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Compensation limited to federally funded research reviews | International and privately funded research reviews uncompensated | Scope of federal authority |
| $300-500 below market rate for professional time | May not significantly change behavior for senior researchers | Budget constraints |
| Institutional impact factor ban hard to monitor | Informal use of IF may continue | Cultural inertia |
| Cost-recovery from publishers exploratory only | Publishers may not contribute; taxpayers bear full cost | Publisher lobbying power |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Implement mandatory quality scoring of reviews by editors as condition for compensation approval; reviews rated below quality threshold are not compensated
2. Establish rigorous journal registration standards including minimum editorial governance, rejection rates, and anti-predatory criteria
3. Require institutions to document specific evaluation criteria used in each tenure decision and submit to federal audit on request
4. Strengthen publisher cost-recovery language from "explore" to "shall implement" in subsequent reauthorization
5. Deploy AI detection tools to identify machine-generated reviews and require reviewer attestation of personal completion

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Fragmented agency implementation | Office of Peer Review Integrity coordinates standards across agencies |
| Political interference in peer review mandates | Scientific independence protections in Bill 1, Section 7 (Director must be a scientist) |
| International competitiveness concerns | Phase implementation; coordinate with international partners (OECD, EU) |
| Reviewer compensation may not address root cause (publish-or-perish) | Section 6 of Bill 2 directly addresses institutional evaluation practices |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

Both bills include built-in review mechanisms:

- Annual reporting requirements enable ongoing monitoring
- GAO study provisions (3-4 year timelines) ensure independent evaluation
- Authorization periods require reauthorization, enabling congressional adjustments
- Independent evaluation studies mandate evidence-based program modification
