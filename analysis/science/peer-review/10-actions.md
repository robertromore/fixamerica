# Peer Review: Actions

## Overview

This document provides concrete actions that individuals can take to improve the peer review system, organized by role. While systemic reform requires institutional and legislative change, individual actions can build momentum, shift norms, and create demand for larger reforms.

## For Researchers

### As Authors

- **Post preprints**: Upload manuscripts to appropriate preprint servers (arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SSRN) before or simultaneously with journal submission. This accelerates dissemination and establishes priority regardless of review timeline.

- **Submit to journals with transparent review**: Prioritize journals that publish reviewer reports, offer open review options, or participate in portable review consortia (e.g., Review Commons).

- **Use registered reports**: For confirmatory studies, submit to journals offering registered report formats. This eliminates publication bias and incentivizes rigorous design over dramatic results.

- **Request double-blind review**: When submitting to journals offering the option, choose double-blind review to reduce identity-based bias.

- **Transfer reviews**: When rejected, ask editors whether reviews can be transferred to the next journal. Use platforms like Review Commons to obtain journal-independent reviews.

- **Report review experiences**: Document and share review timelines, quality of feedback, and evidence of bias through platforms like SciRev (<https://scirev.org/>) and Publons.

- **Stop chasing impact factor**: Submit to the journal whose readership will most benefit from your work, not the journal with the highest impact factor. Explain this choice in tenure materials.

### As Reviewers

- **Accept review invitations when qualified**: The system depends on expert participation. Declining invitations shifts the burden to less qualified reviewers.

- **Sign your reviews**: When comfortable, identify yourself to authors. This increases accountability and models the norm of transparent evaluation.

- **Provide constructive criticism**: Focus on improving the science, not gatekeeping. Distinguish between fatal flaws and suggestions for improvement.

- **Disclose conflicts of interest**: Report any relationship with authors, competing research interests, or financial conflicts to the editor.

- **Meet deadlines**: Late reviews compound publication delays. If you cannot complete a review on time, notify the editor immediately.

- **Track your reviews**: Register review activity on ORCID and Publons/Web of Science to build a verifiable record of service.

- **Review for diverse venues**: Do not reserve your best reviewing effort for high-impact journals. Mid-tier and specialty journals need rigorous review too.

- **Mentor junior reviewers**: Co-review with postdocs and graduate students to build the reviewer pipeline. Many journals now support co-reviewer arrangements.

## For Graduate Students and Postdocs

- **Learn about peer review**: Read published reviewer reports (available at *BMJ*, *eLife*, *F1000Research*) to understand what constructive review looks like.

- **Practice reviewing**: Ask your advisor to include you as a co-reviewer. Use journal clubs to practice critical evaluation of published papers.

- **Document your review contributions**: Even informal reviews (journal clubs, co-reviews) build skills. Track these on your CV under "service."

- **Advocate within your department**: Raise peer review reform in departmental meetings, graduate student organizations, and professional society events.

- **Choose preprint-friendly advisors**: When selecting mentors, consider whether they support preprint posting, open science practices, and equitable review norms.

- **Support registered reports**: Advocate for and use registered report formats in your research when appropriate.

## For Faculty and Department Chairs

- **Revise tenure criteria**: Update tenure and promotion guidelines to value preprints, datasets, software, and reviewer service alongside traditional journal publications.

- **Sign DORA**: Commit your department or institution to the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment. Follow through by changing actual evaluation practices.

- **Diversify recommendation letter content**: When writing tenure letters, evaluate candidates on research quality and impact rather than counting publications in "high-impact" journals.

- **Support junior colleague review participation**: Provide protected time for review service. Acknowledge review contributions in annual evaluations.

- **Create reviewer mentoring programs**: Establish formal training for graduate students and postdocs in how to conduct rigorous, constructive reviews.

## For University Administrators

- **Adopt DORA principles institutionally**: Revise promotion and tenure guidelines across the university to eliminate journal impact factor as an evaluation criterion.

- **Invest in institutional preprint repositories**: Support institutional open access repositories and encourage faculty to deposit preprints.

- **Negotiate with publishers**: Use institutional bargaining power to demand review transparency and open access from publishers.

- **Track and report review contributions**: Include peer review service in faculty activity reporting systems.

- **Allocate service credit**: Formally recognize peer review as valued professional service in workload calculations.

## For Journal Editors

- **Publish reviewer reports**: Make review reports available alongside published articles, with or without reviewer identification.

- **Offer open review options**: Allow reviewers to sign their reviews and authors to publish responses.

- **Join portable review consortia**: Participate in Review Commons, the Neuroscience Peer Review Consortium, or similar initiatives to reduce redundant re-reviewing.

- **Implement reviewer recognition**: Publicly acknowledge reviewers annually. Provide tangible benefits (fee waivers, early access, etc.).

- **Diversify reviewer pools**: Actively seek reviewers from underrepresented institutions, demographics, and geographic regions.

- **Adopt registered reports**: Offer registered report submission tracks to reduce publication bias.

- **Reduce desk rejection rates**: Evaluate more submissions through full review rather than rejecting based on perceived novelty or fit.

- **Set and enforce review timelines**: Establish clear deadlines, send automated reminders, and reassign reviews when deadlines are missed.

## For Funding Agency Staff

- **Advocate for review reform within your agency**: Support pilots of anonymous review, partial randomization, and streamlined applications.

- **Diversify reviewer recruitment**: Actively recruit study section and panel members from underrepresented institutions and demographics.

- **Support reviewer training**: Develop and require bias awareness training for all review panel members.

- **Publish review outcome data**: Make anonymized data on funding rates by demographics, institution type, and topic area publicly available.

- **Recognize preprints in grant reporting**: Accept preprints as evidence of productivity in progress reports and competing renewals.

## For Congressional Staff and Policymakers

- **Investigate peer review equity**: Hold oversight hearings on demographic disparities in federal research funding.

- **Introduce transparency legislation**: Sponsor legislation requiring federal agencies to publish anonymized review data and outcome statistics (see [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md)).

- **Fund review reform research**: Appropriate funding for empirical research on peer review effectiveness and bias.

- **Mandate reviewer diversity requirements**: Include reviewer panel diversity provisions in research agency authorization bills.

- **Support the OSTP open access mandate**: Ensure adequate funding for agency compliance with the 2022 Nelson Memo.

## For the Public and Science Advocates

- **Learn about peer review**: Understand what peer review does and does not guarantee about the reliability of scientific findings.

- **Support open access**: Advocate for public access to research you fund through taxes.

- **Engage with preprints critically**: When encountering preprints in the news, understand that they have not yet undergone formal review. Look for subsequent peer-reviewed versions.

- **Contact your representatives**: Express support for research funding and peer review reform legislation.

- **Support reform organizations**: Donate to or volunteer with organizations advocating for open science and review reform (SPARC, ASAPbio, Center for Open Science).
