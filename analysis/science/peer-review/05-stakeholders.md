# Peer Review: Stakeholders

## Overview

The peer review system involves a complex web of stakeholders with varying degrees of power, investment, and alignment with reform goals. Understanding who benefits from and who is harmed by the current system is essential for identifying viable reform coalitions.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Researchers (Authors and Reviewers)

**Who they are**: The approximately 8 million active researchers worldwide who both produce and evaluate scientific work. In the US, roughly 1.5 million scientists and engineers are engaged in research.

**Dual role**: Most researchers serve simultaneously as authors (submitting papers and grants) and reviewers (evaluating others' submissions). This dual role creates complex, sometimes contradictory interests.

**As Authors**

| Interest | Current Status | Reform Alignment |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Fast publication | Poorly served (6-18 month delays) | Strong reform supporter |
| Fair evaluation | Poorly served (documented biases) | Strong reform supporter |
| Career advancement | Served through prestige publication | Mixed (benefits from prestige system) |
| Broad dissemination | Increasingly served by preprints | Moderate reform supporter |

**As Reviewers**

| Interest | Current Status | Reform Alignment |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Recognition for review work | Poorly served (invisible labor) | Strong reform supporter |
| Manageable workload | Poorly served (overwhelming volume) | Strong reform supporter |
| Maintaining quality standards | Partially served | Cautious about lowering bars |
| Influence over field direction | Served through anonymous review | May resist transparency reforms |

**Power level**: Collectively high (they are the system), individually low (no single researcher can change norms)

### Early-Career Researchers

**Who they are**: Postdoctoral fellows, assistant professors, and other pre-tenure scientists who are most vulnerable to peer review failures. Approximately 80,000 postdocs and 150,000 tenure-track assistant professors in the US.

**Specific vulnerabilities**

- Cannot challenge reviewer bias without career risk
- Lack reviewer networks to receive fair evaluations
- Disproportionately harmed by conservative grant review (low success rates for new investigators)
- Most affected by publication delays (tenure clock is ticking)
- Least likely to be selected as reviewers, limiting their ability to shape standards

**Power level**: Low. Individually expendable; collectively underorganized.

### Women and Underrepresented Minority Scientists

**Who they are**: Women (approximately 50% of STEM PhDs but lower representation at senior levels), Black scientists (~7% of STEM PhDs), Hispanic scientists (~9% of STEM PhDs), and other groups facing documented bias in peer review.

**Documented harms**

| Group | Evidence of Peer Review Bias |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Women | Lower acceptance rates in single-blind review; higher revision demands; smaller grant awards |
| Black PIs | 55% lower NIH R01 success rate vs. white PIs (Ginther et al., 2011) |
| Hispanic PIs | Lower success rates on R01 grants after controlling for qualifications |
| Scientists at MSIs | Dramatically lower NIH success rates; excluded from reviewer pools |
| Non-native English speakers | Linguistic bias in review; higher rejection rates |

**Power level**: Growing advocacy but structurally disadvantaged by the same system they seek to reform.

### Federal Funding Agencies

**Who they are**: NIH ($48 billion budget), NSF ($10 billion), DOE Office of Science ($8 billion), DARPA ($4 billion), and other agencies allocating federal research funds through peer review.

**Interests**

| Interest | Current Status | Reform Alignment |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Allocate funds to best research | Partially served (low review reliability) | Support targeted reforms |
| Maintain public confidence | Under pressure (equity concerns) | Support transparency reforms |
| Minimize political interference | Peer review serves as shield | Cautious about radical changes |
| Comply with executive and congressional mandates | Subject to OSTP, OMB directives | Responsive to policy direction |

**NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR)**

- Manages ~80% of NIH grant applications
- Operates ~180 chartered study sections
- Employs ~300 staff scientific review officers
- Has initiated several reform pilots (anonymous review, bias training)

**Power level**: High. Agencies set the rules for grant review and can mandate reforms within their authority.

### Academic Institutions (Universities and Research Institutes)

**Who they are**: Approximately 4,000 degree-granting institutions in the US, of which ~130 are classified as R1 (very high research activity).

**Interests**

| Interest | Current Status | Reform Alignment |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Attract top faculty | Served by prestige system | Resist changes to prestige metrics |
| Maximize grant funding | Served by current system (overhead recovery) | Cautious about review changes |
| Rank highly in national assessments | Served by impact factor metrics | May resist DORA principles |
| Promote equity and inclusion | Increasingly important | Support bias reduction reforms |

**The Tenure and Promotion Bottleneck**: Universities are the primary consumers of peer review signals. How they evaluate faculty for tenure determines what researchers prioritize. As long as tenure committees count publications in "high-impact" journals, the entire system bends toward prestige over substance.

**Power level**: High. Universities set hiring, tenure, and promotion criteria that drive researcher behavior.

## Secondary Stakeholders

### Academic Publishers

**Who they are**: The $30+ billion academic publishing industry, dominated by five major corporations.

| Publisher | Market Share (approx.) | Revenue (2024 est.) | Model |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Elsevier (RELX) | ~16% | $3.5 billion | Subscription + APC |
| Springer Nature | ~13% | $2.0 billion | Hybrid |
| Wiley | ~10% | $1.5 billion | Hybrid |
| Taylor & Francis (Informa) | ~7% | $1.0 billion | Hybrid |
| SAGE | ~4% | $0.5 billion | Hybrid |
| Society publishers | ~25% | Varies | Varies |
| Other | ~25% | Varies | Varies |

**Interests**

- Maintain journal prestige as a sellable brand
- Minimize cost of review (free reviewer labor)
- Resist transparency that reveals review arbitrariness
- Transition to open access while maintaining revenue (Article Processing Charges)
- Prevent disintermediation by preprint servers

**Power level**: Very high. Control the platforms, brands, and infrastructure of scholarly communication.

### Journal Editors

**Who they are**: Editors-in-chief and associate editors, typically active researchers who serve part-time (academic-society journals) or full-time (commercial publishers).

**Interests**

| Interest | Current Status | Reform Alignment |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Publish high-quality, impactful work | Central to their role | Support quality reforms |
| Attract good reviewers | Increasingly difficult | Support reviewer incentive reforms |
| Maintain journal reputation | Tied to impact factor | Mixed on impact factor reform |
| Manageable workload | Under strain | Support efficiency reforms |

**Power level**: Medium. Significant discretion within individual journals but limited ability to change systemic norms.

### Professional and Scientific Societies

**Who they are**: Organizations such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), American Chemical Society (ACS), American Physical Society (APS), and hundreds of discipline-specific societies. Many publish journals and set disciplinary standards.

**Interests**

- Advance their discipline's research quality
- Serve member interests (often conflicting)
- Maintain journal revenue (critical funding source for many societies)
- Set ethical and professional standards

**Power level**: Medium. Influential in setting norms but lack enforcement authority.

### Patients and the Public

**Who they are**: The ultimate beneficiaries of scientific research, particularly biomedical research funded by NIH. Approximately 330 million Americans whose health, safety, environment, and economic welfare depend on scientific progress.

**Interests**

| Interest | Current Status | Reform Alignment |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Reliable scientific findings | Poorly served (replication crisis) | Strong reform supporter |
| Rapid translation of discoveries | Poorly served (publication delays) | Strong reform supporter |
| Accountable use of tax dollars | Poorly served (opaque allocation) | Strong reform supporter |
| Access to research findings | Improving (OSTP open access mandate) | Strong reform supporter |

**Power level**: Diffuse. Enormous potential influence through Congress but limited direct engagement with peer review policy.

### Congressional Oversight

**Who they are**: House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology; Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; Appropriations subcommittees for NIH, NSF, and other agencies.

**Interests**

- Accountability for federal research spending
- Scientific leadership and competitiveness
- Constituent concerns (university funding, research benefits)
- Political leverage over science policy

**Historical engagement**: Congress has periodically scrutinized peer review, including:

- 1975: Hearings on NSF peer review practices
- 1993: Congress requires NIH to establish guidelines for study section review
- 2007: America COMPETES Act includes peer review provisions
- 2022: CHIPS and Science Act provisions on research security and review

**Power level**: High but episodic. Congress can mandate reforms through appropriations and authorization but rarely engages with review mechanics.

| Women/URM scientists | Low-Medium | Very High | Strongly supportive |
| Public/patients | Low (diffuse) | High | Supportive if aware |
| Preprint advocates | Low-Medium | Very High | Strongly supportive |

## Coalition Analysis

### Natural Reform Coalition

- Early-career researchers
- Women and underrepresented minority scientists
- Preprint and open science advocates
- Some funding agency leaders
- Public interest groups

**Strength**: Moral clarity, growing numbers, aligned interests

**Weakness**: Limited institutional power, diffuse, underorganized

### Status Quo Coalition

- Major commercial publishers
- Elite institutions benefiting from prestige system
- Senior researchers with established reputations
- Journal editors at high-impact journals

**Strength**: Control of infrastructure, institutional inertia, financial resources

**Weakness**: Increasingly perceived as self-serving, vulnerable to policy mandates

### Potential Swing Stakeholders

- **Professional societies**: Could go either way depending on journal revenue impact
- **Federal agencies**: Support targeted reform but risk-averse about systemic change
- **University administrators**: Responsive to external pressure (DORA, equity mandates) but reluctant to lead
- **Congress**: Could be activated by equity or competitiveness framing
