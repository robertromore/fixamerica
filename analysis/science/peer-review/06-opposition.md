# Peer Review: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to peer review reform comes from multiple directions, driven by economic self-interest, philosophical disagreement, legitimate concerns about unintended consequences, and institutional inertia. Understanding who opposes reform and why is essential for designing strategies that address real concerns while overcoming resistance rooted in self-interest.

## Major Opposition Groups

### Commercial Publishers

**Who**: Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, SAGE, and other for-profit academic publishers.

**Why they oppose reform**:

| Concern | Reasoning | Validity |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Revenue threat | Open review and preprints undermine the "value-added" of journal brands | Partially valid (business model concern) |
| Journal prestige | Transparency reveals arbitrary review decisions, weakening brand | Self-serving |
| Reviewer compensation | Paying reviewers would reduce margins | Self-serving |
| Preprint competition | Preprints reduce demand for journal publication | Partially valid |
| Loss of control | Open models reduce publisher gatekeeping role | Self-serving |

**Tactics**:

- Lobby against federal mandates for open access and review transparency
- Offer incremental "innovations" (faster turnaround, reviewer matching tools) to forestall structural change
- Acquire and co-opt open access competitors (e.g., Springer buying BioMed Central)
- Frame criticism of peer review as attacks on "scientific quality"
- Fund astroturf industry groups (Coalition for Responsible Sharing, etc.)

**Assessment**: Publishers are the most powerful and organized opponents of structural reform. Their opposition is primarily economic, not principled.

### Elite Journal Editors

**Who**: Editors at high-impact journals (*Nature*, *Science*, *Cell*, *NEJM*, *Lancet*, etc.) whose careers and institutions depend on maintaining prestige hierarchies.

**Why they oppose reform**:

- Open review threatens editorial authority and the curated brand
- Post-publication review models eliminate the gatekeeping role
- Preprints reduce the "first publication" value of their journals
- Reviewer compensation could increase costs without clear benefit to their journals
- DORA principles threaten the influence of impact factor metrics

**Key argument**: "We add value through careful editorial selection and rigorous review that preprints and open platforms cannot replicate."

**Assessment**: This argument has some merit but is undermined by evidence of low inter-reviewer reliability, persistent bias, and the fact that desk rejection decisions are often made on novelty/trendiness rather than rigor.

### Senior Established Researchers

**Who**: Full professors, named chairs, and other senior scientists who have succeeded under the current system and whose reputations are partially built on publications in prestigious journals.

**Why they oppose reform**:

| Concern | Reasoning | Validity |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Devaluation of career achievements | If prestige metrics are abandoned, past accomplishments are reframed | Partially understandable |
| Loss of informal influence | Anonymous review allows senior figures to shape fields | Self-serving |
| Quality concerns | Fear that lower barriers mean lower quality | Partially valid |
| Reviewer anonymity protection | Signed reviews could invite retaliation | Legitimate concern |
| Grant review power | Study section membership confers influence | Self-serving |

**Assessment**: Many senior researchers genuinely believe the system, while imperfect, has served them and science well. Their resistance is a mix of legitimate quality concerns and understandable defense of a system that rewarded them.

### R1 University Administrators

**Who**: Provosts, deans, and department chairs at research-intensive universities whose rankings depend partly on faculty publication metrics and grant success rates.

**Why they oppose reform**:

- University rankings incorporate publication metrics (US News, Shanghai, QS)
- Tenure and promotion processes are built around journal prestige signals
- Grant overhead revenue depends on the current funding allocation system
- Institutional prestige bias in review benefits their faculty
- Changing evaluation criteria is administratively burdensome

**Assessment**: University resistance is institutional inertia more than active opposition. Most administrators acknowledge problems but are reluctant to act unilaterally.

## Arguments Against Specific Reforms

### Against Open Peer Review

| Argument | Who Makes It | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Reviewers will self-censor to avoid conflict | Editors, senior researchers | BMJ data shows no decline in review quality after opening |
| Junior reviewers will fear retaliation | Early-career scientists | Legitimate concern; graduated implementation can address |
| Reviews will become less critical | Quality advocates | Evidence mixed; some studies show improved constructiveness |
| Authors will harass critical reviewers | Researchers generally | Real risk; requires institutional support structures |
| Some topics require anonymity (e.g., politically sensitive) | Various | Valid for specific contexts; need not be universal |

### Against Preprint-First Models

| Argument | Who Makes It | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Unreviewed science misleads the public | Public health advocates | COVID experience showed both risks and benefits of preprints |
| Media cannot distinguish preprints from reviewed papers | Science communicators | Valid concern; labeling and education can help |
| Removes incentive for rigorous review | Quality advocates | Overlay review and post-publication review can provide rigor |
| Scooping risk increases | Competitive researchers | Preprints actually establish priority more quickly |
| Patients may act on unverified claims | Clinicians | Legitimate concern for biomedical preprints specifically |

### Against Reviewer Compensation

| Argument | Who Makes It | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Would be prohibitively expensive | Publishers | $500/review x 15 million reviews = $7.5 billion; compare to $30 billion publishing revenue |
| Review should be scholarly service | Traditionalists | Other professional services (legal, medical) are compensated |
| Compensation would attract mercenary reviewers | Quality advocates | Compensation + quality metrics can filter for quality |
| Undermines the voluntarism that ensures independence | Editors | Current system already creates conflicts (career pressure to review for prestige journals) |
| Tax and employment complications | Administrators | Solvable; similar to consulting arrangements |

### Against Grant Review Reform

| Argument | Who Makes It | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Lottery/partial randomization is unscientific | Traditional reviewers | Above the quality threshold, scores are already functionally random |
| Program officer discretion invites politics | Congress, accountability advocates | DARPA model shows it can work; depends on officer quality |
| Reducing application burden lowers quality | Study section members | Shorter applications could focus evaluation on essentials |
| Bias training is insufficient | Equity advocates | Partially valid; structural changes needed alongside training |
| Changing NIH review would disrupt ongoing research | Current grantees | Transition can be managed; cost of not reforming is higher |

## Philosophical Objections

### The Meritocracy Defense

**Core argument**: The peer review system, despite imperfections, is fundamentally meritocratic. The best science rises to the top through expert evaluation. Reforms that reduce selectivity or remove gatekeeping will lower quality.

**Problems with this argument**:

- Documented biases mean "merit" is partially confounded with identity and prestige
- Low inter-reviewer reliability means the system fails its own meritocratic standard
- The Peters and Ceci experiment (1982) showed institutional prestige trumping content quality
- Alternative models (DARPA, HHMI) with less conventional review produce higher-impact work

### The "If It Ain't Broke" Defense

**Core argument**: Peer review has served science well for decades. Scientific progress continues. The problems are exaggerated by reformers with their own agendas.

**Problems with this argument**:

- The replication crisis demonstrates systematic quality failures
- Declining public trust in science has multiple causes, but peer review failures are among them
- The system *is* breaking: reviewer shortage, publication delays, bias evidence
- "Science progresses" does not mean it progresses optimally or equitably

### The Chilling Effect Argument

**Core argument**: Reforms that increase transparency (open review, published reports) will chill honest criticism. Science requires frank, sometimes harsh, evaluation, and this is only possible under anonymity.

**Validity assessment**: This is the most legitimate philosophical objection. Evidence from open review experiments is mixed:

- *BMJ* and *eLife* data suggest no decline in review rigor with signed reviews
- Some researchers report self-censoring negative comments when reviews are public
- Power dynamics (senior-junior, employer-employee) make anonymity genuinely protective in some cases
- Hybrid models (reviewer chooses whether to sign) may address this

## Opposition Strategies

### Delay and Dilute

- Acknowledge problems in principle while arguing against specific reforms
- Commission studies and pilot programs that defer action
- Implement cosmetic changes (reviewer training modules, diversity statements) without structural reform
- Frame each proposed reform as premature pending "more evidence"

### Co-opt and Control

- Publishers adopt the language of open science while maintaining control
- Launch publisher-controlled preprint servers (e.g., SSRN acquired by Elsevier)
- Create publisher-branded reviewer recognition programs
- Offer "transformative agreements" that maintain subscription revenue under open access labels

### Divide the Reform Coalition

- Pit open access advocates against peer review reformers
- Frame reviewer compensation as threatening editorial independence
- Present preprints as competing with rather than complementing review
- Emphasize risks to early-career researchers to divide the natural reform constituency

## Assessment: Overcoming Opposition

### Where Opposition Is Strongest

- Any reform that directly reduces publisher revenue
- Changes to tenure and promotion criteria at elite institutions
- Federal mandates on journal review practices (First Amendment concerns)
- Elimination of anonymity in review

### Where Opposition Is Weakest

- Reviewer recognition and credit systems (low cost, broadly popular)
- Bias training for grant reviewers (already underway)
- Preprint encouragement by funders (OSTP mandate provides cover)
- Reduced application burden for grants (saves everyone time)
- Registered reports adoption (opt-in, no losers)

### Strategic Implications

The most viable path forward targets reforms where opposition is weak and builds momentum for more structural changes. Attempting to directly confront publisher economic interests or eliminate journal prestige hierarchies is unlikely to succeed without building a broader coalition first.
