    - Evidence that registered reports maintain quality while reducing publication bias.

### Publishing Industry and Impact Factor

- Lariviere, Vincent, Stefanie Haustein, and Philippe Mongeon. "The Oligopoly of Academic Publishers in the Digital Era." *PLoS ONE* 10, no. 6 (2015): e0127502.
    - Documents the concentration of academic publishing and its effects on the review system.
