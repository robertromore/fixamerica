# Peer Review: Roadmap

## Overview

Reforming peer review requires a phased strategy that begins with achievable changes within existing institutional authority, builds evidence and coalition support, and progresses toward structural reforms that require broader consensus or legislative action. This roadmap sequences reforms by feasibility, impact, and political viability.

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (Year 1-2)

### Objective

Implement low-cost, high-consensus reforms that build momentum and demonstrate feasibility without requiring legislative action or major institutional restructuring.

### Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Expand NIH anonymous review pilot to all R01 applications | NIH CSR | 12 months | Pilot operational across all study sections |
| Mandate preprint posting for all federally funded research | OSTP/agency heads | 6 months | Policy issued; compliance tracked |
| Launch standardized reviewer credit system across federal agencies | OSTP coordination | 12 months | Unified reviewer recognition database operational |
| Reduce R01 research strategy to 5 pages for initial submission | NIH | 18 months | New page limits in effect for February cycle |
| Expand Early Career Reviewer (ECR) program to 1,000 reviewers per cycle | NIH CSR | 12 months | ECR participation doubled |
| Deploy AI-assisted statistical and methodology checks for all NIH-funded journal publications | NIH/NLM | 18 months | Tools available to editors at PubMed-indexed journals |

### Milestones

- **Month 6**: OSTP preprint mandate issued
- **Month 12**: Anonymous review and reviewer credit systems operational
- **Month 18**: Streamlined R01 applications in use; AI tools deployed
- **Month 24**: First evaluation of Phase 1 reforms published

### Budget Estimate

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Reviewer credit system development | $2-5 million |
| AI tool deployment and integration | $10-15 million |
| ECR program expansion | $3-5 million |
| Evaluation and monitoring | $2-3 million |
| **Total Phase 1** | **$17-28 million** |

## Phase 2: Structural Reforms (Year 2-5)

### Objective

Implement reforms requiring changes to agency regulations, multi-stakeholder coordination, or significant cultural shifts within the research community.

### Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Pilot partial randomization for NIH R21 grants | NIH | Year 2-3 | Pilot completed; impact evaluated |
| Establish diversity benchmarks for all federal review panels | OSTP/agencies | Year 2-3 | Benchmarks published; progress tracked annually |
| Require DORA-aligned evaluation in institutional NIH T32 and P30 applications | NIH | Year 2-4 | Policy incorporated into funding announcements |
| Fund development of open peer review platform for federally funded research | NSF/NIH | Year 2-4 | Platform operational; 100+ journals participating |
| Negotiate portable review agreements across major journal consortia | Professional societies | Year 2-5 | 500+ journals accepting transferred reviews |
| Pilot reviewer compensation programs at 3-5 federal agencies | NIH, NSF, DOE | Year 3-5 | Pilot results evaluated; compensation model validated |

### Milestones

- **Year 2**: Partial randomization pilot launched; diversity benchmarks established
- **Year 3**: DORA requirements in institutional grants; open review platform beta
- **Year 4**: First portable review consortium operational; reviewer compensation pilots running
- **Year 5**: Comprehensive evaluation of Phase 2 reforms; evidence base for Phase 3

### Budget Estimate

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Partial randomization pilot and evaluation | $5-10 million |
| Diversity recruitment and training programs | $15-20 million |
| Open peer review platform development | $20-30 million |
| Reviewer compensation pilots | $50-100 million |
| Portable review infrastructure | $5-10 million |
| Evaluation and monitoring | $5-10 million |
| **Total Phase 2** | **$100-180 million** |

## Phase 3: Systemic Transformation (Year 5-10)

### Objective

Achieve fundamental changes to the incentive structures that drive peer review dysfunction, including tenure criteria, publisher business models, and the relationship between review and publication.

### Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Federal legislation mandating peer review transparency and equity standards | Congress | Year 5-7 | Legislation enacted (see [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md)) |
| Scale partial randomization to R01 grants based on pilot evidence | NIH | Year 5-7 | System-wide implementation for eligible mechanisms |
| University accreditation standards incorporate DORA principles | Regional accreditors | Year 5-8 | Standards revised; compliance monitored |
| Establish federal reviewer compensation fund ($200-500/review) | Congress/agencies | Year 5-8 | Fund operational; reviewer participation rates increase 20%+ |
| Transition federal research dissemination to preprint-first model | OSTP/agencies | Year 6-10 | 80%+ of federally funded research posted as preprints within 30 days |
| International coordination on peer review reform standards | OSTP + international partners | Year 7-10 | Multilateral agreement on review transparency principles |

### Milestones

- **Year 5**: Legislation introduced; R01 randomization scaled
- **Year 7**: Legislation enacted; accreditation standards revised
- **Year 8**: Reviewer compensation fund operational
- **Year 10**: Preprint-first model dominant for federally funded research

### Budget Estimate

| Item | Cost (annual, at scale) |
|------|------------------------|
| Reviewer compensation fund | $500 million - $1 billion |
| Open review platform maintenance and expansion | $10-20 million |
| Accreditation reform support | $5-10 million |
| International coordination | $3-5 million |
| Evaluation and adjustment | $10-15 million |
| **Total Phase 3 (annual at scale)** | **$530 million - $1.05 billion** |

## Critical Path Dependencies

```text
Phase 1: Quick Wins
  |
  +--> Anonymous review pilot --> Evidence on bias reduction --> Scale to all R01
  |
  +--> Preprint mandate --> Preprint adoption grows --> Preprint-first model
  |
  +--> Reviewer credit system --> Career credit accepted --> Compensation fund

```

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Publisher lobbying derails transparency legislation | High | High | Build bipartisan coalition; frame as taxpayer accountability |
| Reviewer compensation creates perverse incentives | Medium | Medium | Tie compensation to quality metrics; monitor gaming |
| Partial randomization perceived as "unscientific" | Medium | High | Communicate evidence on score unreliability; start with exploratory grants |
| University resistance to DORA adoption | High | Medium | Link to accreditation and federal funding requirements |
| International partners do not coordinate | Medium | Low | US unilateral action still valuable; others likely to follow |
| AI tools introduce new biases | Medium | Medium | Regular auditing; human oversight required |
| Political interference in peer review mandates | Medium | High | Design legislation with scientific independence protections |
