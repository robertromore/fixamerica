# Science Advice: Current State

## The Problem Today

### A System That Depends on Presidential Goodwill

The American science advice system functions reasonably well when presidents value scientific input and poorly when they do not. There is no statutory requirement that the president consult OSTP before making science-relevant decisions, no mandate that PCAST recommendations receive formal responses, and no mechanism to prevent the sidelining of agency chief scientists. This structural vulnerability has been exposed repeatedly, most dramatically during the 2017-2021 period when the OSTP Director position went unfilled for the longest stretch in its history, PCAST was not constituted for over two years, and multiple agency scientists reported political interference with their work.

The Biden administration (2021-2025) restored much of the science advice infrastructure, elevating the OSTP Director to Cabinet-level rank for the first time and appointing a full PCAST. However, these gains were achieved through executive action rather than structural reform, leaving them reversible by any subsequent administration. The fundamental pattern remains: science advice in the United States is a privilege granted by sympathetic leaders, not a right embedded in law.

### OSTP in Practice

The Office of Science and Technology Policy was established by the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. ch. 79) to advise the president on science and technology issues affecting domestic and international affairs. In practice, OSTP's influence varies dramatically:

| Administration | OSTP Director | Confirmed | Cabinet Rank | Staff (approx.) | Influence Assessment |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Obama (2009-2017) | John Holdren | Yes (Senate) | No | ~130 | High; deeply involved in climate, biotech, cyber policy |
| Trump (2017-2021) | Kelvin Droegemeier | Yes (2019) | No | ~45-55 | Low-moderate; limited policy influence, two-year vacancy |
| Biden (2021-2025) | Eric Lander, then Arati Prabhakar | Yes | Yes (first time) | ~140 | High; pandemic response, AI, equity in science |

**Current challenges facing OSTP:**

- **Institutional memory loss**: Staff turnover between administrations erases accumulated expertise
- **Dual-hatting problem**: The OSTP Director often also serves as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, creating tension between honest brokerage and political loyalty
- **Coordination burden**: OSTP lacks directive authority over agencies; it can convene and recommend but not compel
- **Budget constraints**: OSTP's annual budget (~$5-6 million) limits its analytic capacity compared to peer offices in other countries

### PCAST: Advisory Power Without Institutional Weight

The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology has existed in various forms since 1933 (originally as the Science Advisory Board). Its modern incarnation is reconstituted by executive order at each president's discretion.

**Current PCAST structure:**

- ~30 external members drawn from academia, industry, and civil society
- Supported by OSTP staff
- Issues reports and recommendations on topics requested by the president or self-initiated
- Meets approximately quarterly
- Reports are public but carry no binding authority

**Recurring weaknesses:**

- Composition at presidential discretion; can be stacked with allies or left vacant
- No requirement for diverse disciplinary, geographic, or demographic representation
- Recommendations frequently ignored without public explanation
- No systematic tracking of recommendation implementation
- Long gaps between appointment and first meeting reduce effectiveness

### Congressional Science Capacity

Congress's ability to independently evaluate scientific and technical claims has deteriorated since the defunding of OTA in 1995:

| Resource | Status | Capacity |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Office of Technology Assessment** | Defunded 1995 | None; $0 budget |
| **Congressional Research Service** | Active | ~600 analysts, but limited dedicated S&T staff (~70) |
| **GAO Science, Technology Assessment, and Innovation (STAI)** | Active; expanded from 2019 | ~70 staff; growing but constrained |
| **Congressional Budget Office** | Active | Economic modeling strong; scientific assessment limited |
| **Personal staff** | Active | Average House staffer is 28; few have STEM backgrounds |
| **Committee staff** | Active | Some committees have PhD-level expertise; uneven |
| **National Academies** | Available on request | Excellent quality but slow (12-24 months per study) |

**The OTA Gap:**

When OTA was defunded, Congress lost its only institution dedicated to providing nonpartisan, in-depth technology assessments. The consequences are measurable:

- Members rely more heavily on lobbyists and industry groups for technical information
- Complex issues like AI regulation, gene editing governance, and cybersecurity are addressed without adequate technical grounding
- GAO's STAI team, while growing, has roughly one-tenth OTA's peak capacity adjusted for current needs
- Multiple bipartisan bills to restore OTA have been introduced since 2019, but none has passed

### Agency Chief Scientists and Science Advisors

Federal agencies vary enormously in how they integrate scientific expertise into decision-making:

| Agency | Chief Scientist/Advisor | Statutory Basis | Authority |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| USDA | Chief Scientist (Under Secretary for REE) | Farm Bill provisions | Significant; oversees $3.6B research portfolio |
| EPA | Science Advisor | EPA statute; position created by administrator | Variable; often sidelined during deregulatory pushes |
| NOAA | Chief Scientist | NOAA organic act provisions | Moderate; influences research priorities |
| DOD | Chief Technology Officer / USD(R&E) | 10 U.S.C. | Strong; controls major acquisition decisions |
| HHS | Chief Science Officer | Secretary's discretion | Variable; ASH has science role but political appointment |
| DOE | Director of Office of Science | DOE Organization Act | Strong for basic research; limited policy influence |
| NASA | Chief Scientist | NASA Authorization Act provisions | Moderate; advisory to administrator |
| State Dept. | Science and Technology Adviser | Secretary's discretion | Historically weak; frequently vacant |
| DHS | Under Secretary for S&T | Homeland Security Act | Moderate; focused on applied research |

**Common problems across agencies:**

- Chief scientists often report to political appointees rather than the agency head directly
- Scientific findings can be filtered, delayed, or altered before reaching decision-makers
- "Science advisor" positions sometimes lack staff, budget, or access to principals
- The Evidence Act created evaluation officers and chief data officers, but their integration into decision-making is inconsistent

### The Evidence Act in Practice

The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-435) was landmark legislation requiring agencies to:

- Designate evaluation officers, chief data officers, and statistical officials
- Develop learning agendas and annual evaluation plans
- Make data more accessible through open data requirements
- Protect confidential information used for statistical and evaluation purposes

**Implementation status (as of 2025):**

| Requirement | Implementation Rate | Quality Assessment |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Evaluation officers appointed | ~95% of CFO Act agencies | Many are mid-level; lack authority |
| Learning agendas published | ~85% | Quality varies widely; some perfunctory |
| Annual evaluation plans | ~80% | Often disconnected from budget decisions |
| Chief data officers appointed | ~90% | IT-focused rather than evidence-focused |
| Open data compliance | Variable | Significant progress but many gaps |

**Key shortcomings:**

- Evaluation findings rarely influence budget or program decisions
- Learning agendas often reflect what agencies already planned rather than genuine evidence needs
- Evaluation officers frequently lack the seniority, budget, and staff to be effective
- OMB's Evidence Team has limited capacity to hold agencies accountable
- No penalties for non-compliance with Evidence Act requirements

### Federal Advisory Committees

The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA, 5 U.S.C. App.) governs approximately 1,000 advisory committees across the federal government. These committees provide a structured mechanism for external expert input, but the system has significant problems:

- **Political stacking**: Administrations have appointed industry representatives to committees that regulate their industries
- **Balanced membership ambiguity**: FACA requires "fairly balanced" membership, but courts have given agencies wide discretion
- **Transparency gaps**: While meetings are generally public, pre-meeting communications and draft deliberations may not be
- **Slow formation**: Creating or renewing a FACA committee involves extensive paperwork and GSA review
- **Disbandment risk**: Executive orders have periodically required committee reductions, eliminating advisory bodies with no review of their value

### International Comparison

Other democracies have built more institutionally robust science advice systems:

| Country | Structure | Key Strength |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| United Kingdom | Government Chief Scientific Adviser (statutory); departmental chief scientists; GO-Science | Cross-government coordination; embedded in all departments |
| Germany | National Academy (Leopoldina); German Ethics Council (statutory) | Independent statutory bodies with formal consultation rights |
| Japan | Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI), Cabinet-level | Direct cabinet integration; long-term planning authority |
| European Union | Group of Chief Scientific Advisors (7 members); European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change | Structured independence; formal right to proactive advice |
| New Zealand | Chief Science Advisor; departmental science advisors | Explicit principles-based framework; international model |
| Canada | Chief Science Advisor (since 2017); departmental advisors | Mandate includes monitoring scientific integrity across government |

**What the U.S. lacks relative to peers:**

- No statutory requirement for science advice before major policy decisions
- No cross-government framework ensuring every department has senior science capacity
- No formal "right of initiative" allowing science advisors to raise concerns proactively
- No independent body empowered to assess whether government decisions align with evidence
