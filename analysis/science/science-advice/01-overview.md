# Science Advice: Overview

## Executive Summary

The quality of government decision-making depends in part on the quality of scientific and technical expertise informing it. From pandemic response to climate policy, from defense technology to drug regulation, policymakers routinely confront questions whose answers depend on scientific evidence and technical judgment. The United States has built an elaborate but fragile infrastructure for channeling scientific expertise into government: the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), agency chief scientists, and a constellation of federal advisory committees.

Yet this infrastructure chronically underperforms. Presidential science advisors have been left vacant for historic stretches. OSTP has oscillated between policy influence and bureaucratic irrelevance depending on individual presidents' receptivity. Congress has dismantled its own technical advisory capacity -- most notably the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1995 -- leaving legislators to rely on lobbyists and think tanks for scientific information. Federal advisory committees are subject to political stacking, and agency chief scientists often lack the institutional authority to ensure that evidence shapes regulatory decisions. The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (the Evidence Act) created new infrastructure for evaluation but implementation has been uneven.

The result is a government that frequently makes decisions of enormous consequence -- affecting public health, environmental quality, economic competitiveness, and national security -- without adequate scientific input or, worse, while actively suppressing inconvenient scientific findings. Restoring and strengthening science advice mechanisms is essential for competent governance.

## Key Questions

### The Problem

- How effectively does scientific expertise currently reach decision-makers in the executive branch and Congress?
- What happens when science advice structures are weakened, politicized, or abolished?
- How well does the Evidence Act infrastructure actually integrate evidence into agency decision-making?
- Why did Congress eliminate its own technology assessment office and what has been the cost?

### Root Causes

- Why is science advice infrastructure so vulnerable to political disruption?
- What structural features make it easy to sideline scientific input?
- Why does the United States lack statutory protections for science advisory functions that other democracies have adopted?
- How do short political cycles conflict with long scientific timelines?

### Solutions

- How should OSTP be reformed to ensure consistent influence regardless of presidential temperament?
- What would a restored and modernized OTA look like?
- How can agency chief scientists be given real authority over evidence quality?
- What statutory frameworks could insulate science advice from political manipulation?

### Strategy

- Which reforms require legislation and which can be achieved through executive action?
- How do science advice reforms connect to scientific integrity protections?
- What international models offer useful precedents?
- How can bipartisan support be built for strengthening government expertise?

## The Core Problem

### Structural Vulnerability

The science advice apparatus depends almost entirely on presidential and congressional willingness to use it:

| Institution | Legal Basis | Vulnerability |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| OSTP | National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. ch. 79) | Director appointment at presidential discretion; staff size and influence variable |
| PCAST | Executive order (varies by president) | Can be dissolved, restaffed, or ignored at will |
| National Academies | Congressional charter (1863) | Reports can be commissioned or not; findings are advisory only |
| OTA (defunct) | Technology Assessment Act of 1972 | Defunded 1995; no institutional successor |
| CRS | Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 | Well-established but limited science capacity |
| Agency chief scientists | Varies by agency -- some statutory, some by secretary's discretion | Authority and access vary enormously |
| Evidence Act officers | Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 | Implementation dependent on agency leadership |

### The Consequences

When science advice fails, the costs are measured in lives, dollars, and strategic position:

- **Public health**: Delays in responding to emerging disease threats, as seen in early COVID-19 testing failures when CDC and HHS leadership overrode technical experts
- **Environmental protection**: Regulatory decisions made without adequate scientific review or in contradiction to agency scientists' recommendations
- **Economic competitiveness**: Failure to anticipate technological disruptions or invest strategically in emerging fields
- **National security**: Inadequate technical assessment of weapons systems, cyber threats, and emerging military technologies
- **Fiscal waste**: Billions spent on programs that evidence shows are ineffective, while proven interventions go unfunded

## By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| OSTP staff (peak, circa 2016) | ~130 |
| OSTP staff (nadir, early 2017-2018) | ~45 |
| Days without Senate-confirmed OSTP Director (2017-2021) | ~1,460 |
| National Academies consensus reports per year | ~200 |
| CRS reports produced annually | ~1,500+ |
| Federal advisory committees (FACA) | ~1,000 |
| Federal advisory committee members | ~70,000 |
| OTA annual budget when defunded (1995) | ~$22 million |
| Equivalent in 2025 dollars | ~$45 million |
| Agencies with chief scientist or equivalent | ~15 |
| Evidence Act evaluation officers appointed | ~24 CFO Act agencies |

### Types of Science Advice

| Type | Characteristics | Example |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| **On-demand assessment** | Commissioned studies answering specific policy questions | National Academies consensus reports |
| **Standing advisory** | Ongoing expert body providing regular guidance | PCAST, EPA Science Advisory Board |
| **Embedded expertise** | Scientists within government agencies | Agency chief scientists, OSTP staff |
| **Legislative support** | Technical analysis for Congress | CRS, GAO, former OTA |
| **Evidence infrastructure** | Systems for integrating data into decisions | Evidence Act evaluation officers |

## Why This Matters

### For Democratic Governance

Citizens expect their government to make decisions grounded in the best available evidence. When science advice structures fail, government becomes less competent and less accountable, eroding public trust in democratic institutions.

### For National Competitiveness

Nations that effectively integrate science and technology expertise into strategic decision-making -- including China, the United Kingdom, and Germany -- gain competitive advantages. The United States cannot maintain its position through research investment alone if the findings never reach the people making policy.

### For Crisis Response

Pandemics, natural disasters, cybersecurity threats, and other emergencies demand rapid, technically informed decision-making. The quality of science advice infrastructure determines whether government response is competent or catastrophic.

### For Regulatory Quality

Federal agencies issue thousands of regulations annually affecting health, safety, the environment, and the economy. The scientific foundations of these regulations determine whether they achieve their goals efficiently or impose costs without corresponding benefits.
