# Science Advice: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to strengthening science advice structures comes from multiple directions, driven by different motivations. Some opposition reflects genuine philosophical disagreements about the role of expertise in democratic governance; some reflects practical concerns about cost and bureaucracy; and some reflects strategic interests in keeping government decision-making untethered from inconvenient evidence. Effective reform requires understanding and addressing all three categories.

## Major Sources of Opposition

### 1. Executive Branch Resistance to Constraints

**Who**: Presidents and senior White House staff of both parties, though intensity varies.

**Motivation**: Presidents view science advice reform as constraining executive discretion. Any statutory requirement to consult science advisors, report on evidence use, or maintain advisory bodies reduces the president's freedom to act unilaterally.

**Arguments made:**

- "The president already has access to whatever expertise is needed"
- "Statutory mandates on advisory structures violate separation of powers"
- "The president must have flexibility to organize the Executive Office as needed"
- "Formal requirements create bureaucratic delays in fast-moving situations"

**Assessment**: This opposition contains a genuine concern -- rigid consultation requirements could slow emergency decision-making -- but also reflects a desire to avoid accountability for ignoring evidence. Reform can address the speed concern through expedited consultation procedures for emergencies while still requiring documented evidence review for non-emergency decisions.

**Strength**: High. Presidential resistance is the single biggest obstacle to statutory science advice reform.

### 2. Fiscal Conservatives and Government-Reduction Advocates

**Who**: Anti-spending members of Congress, taxpayer advocacy groups, libertarian-leaning think tanks (Cato Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute), Heritage Foundation (selective).

**Motivation**: Genuine belief that government should be smaller and that advisory bodies represent unnecessary bureaucracy. OTA was defunded on these grounds.

**Arguments made:**

- "We cannot afford more government offices" (OTA cost $22 million/year when defunded)
- "CRS and GAO already provide technical analysis to Congress"
- "Advisory committees are just another layer of bureaucracy"
- "Government should rely on the private sector for expertise"

**Assessment**: The fiscal argument is weak on its merits -- the budgets involved are trivial relative to the decisions they inform. OSTP's entire annual budget (~$5.8 million) is less than the cost of a single military aircraft. However, the argument has rhetorical power because voters understand "cut spending" more easily than "improve science advice infrastructure."

**Counterargument**: The National Academies estimated in 2015 that poor evidence use in federal programs wastes tens of billions of dollars annually. Science advice infrastructure costs millions; its absence costs billions.

**Strength**: Moderate. Fiscal arguments provide political cover for opposition driven by other motivations.

### 3. Regulated Industries

**Who**: Fossil fuel companies, chemical manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, agricultural chemical companies, tobacco industry (historically), and their trade associations and allied think tanks.

**Motivation**: Independent science advice produces findings that support regulation, increasing compliance costs. Industries benefit when government decisions are made without rigorous evidence review or when advisory processes can be influenced.

**Arguments made:**

- "Advisory committees are biased toward academic perspectives; industry experience is underrepresented"
- "Regulatory science is uncertain and should not be treated as settled"
- "Industry-funded research is valid science that advisory bodies ignore"
- "Advisory processes are too slow and impose unnecessary costs on innovation"

**Tactics:**

| Tactic | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Advisory committee capture | Seek appointment of industry-aligned members | EPA SAB membership shifts, 2017-2020 |
| Doubt manufacturing | Fund research designed to create uncertainty about regulatory science | Tobacco industry playbook; applied to climate, chemicals |
| Think tank laundering | Fund organizations that produce industry-favorable analysis with academic veneer | Heartland Institute (climate), American Council on Science and Health (chemicals) |
| Litigation | Sue agencies over use of scientific evidence in regulations | Challenges to EPA use of epidemiological studies |
| Congressional influence | Fund legislators who control agency oversight and budgets | Campaign contributions to appropriations subcommittee members |

**Assessment**: Industry opposition is the most strategically sophisticated and well-resourced. It often operates indirectly, through think tanks, trade associations, and sympathetic legislators, rather than openly opposing science advice itself.

**Strength**: Very high. Industry resources dwarf those of science advocacy organizations.

### 4. Anti-Establishment Populism

**Who**: Populist politicians and media figures across the political spectrum; anti-elite movements; some libertarian constituencies.

**Motivation**: Distrust of credentialed experts seen as out of touch with ordinary Americans. Science advice structures are perceived as empowering an unaccountable technocratic elite.

**Arguments made:**

- "Unelected scientists should not determine policy for elected officials"
- "Science advisory bodies are captured by liberal academia"
- "Experts have been wrong before and should not be trusted over common sense"
- "Science advice is just another tool for the educated elite to control government"

**Assessment**: This opposition reflects a real democratic tension -- how to reconcile expert knowledge with democratic self-governance. The resolution is not to eliminate expertise from government but to make advisory processes transparent, accountable, and inclusive. However, populist opposition is difficult to address through institutional design alone because it is rooted in cultural identity and trust dynamics.

**Strength**: Moderate to high. Populist anti-expertise sentiment has grown since 2016 and constrains what reforms are politically feasible.

### 5. Ideological Opposition to Evidence-Based Policymaking

**Who**: Primarily concentrated in segments of the conservative movement, though not exclusive to it. Includes some religious right organizations, certain think tanks, and politicians whose policy positions conflict with scientific consensus on specific issues.

**Motivation**: On certain issues -- climate change, evolution, reproductive health, drug policy -- scientific evidence conflicts with ideological or faith-based positions. Strengthening science advice mechanisms threatens the ability to maintain these positions in policy.

**Arguments made:**

- "Science cannot settle value questions; policy is ultimately about values, not evidence"
- "The scientific establishment has a liberal bias"
- "Evidence-based policymaking is a cover for imposing a particular worldview"
- "Scientific consensus has been wrong before and is not infallible"

**Assessment**: The argument that policy involves values, not just evidence, is correct but does not justify ignoring evidence. Evidence tells us the likely consequences of policy choices; values determine which consequences we prefer. Science advice reform does not impose values; it ensures that value-based decisions are made with accurate information about their consequences.

**Strength**: Moderate. This opposition is intense on specific issues but does not extend to all areas of science advice.

### 6. Agency Bureaucratic Resistance

**Who**: Senior agency officials, both career and political, who view new evidence requirements as burdens rather than improvements.

**Motivation**: Evidence Act requirements, scientific integrity policies, and enhanced advisory committee obligations create work without always generating perceived benefits. Agencies that have functioned without formal evidence infrastructure resist adding it.

**Arguments made:**

- "We already use evidence effectively; new requirements are redundant"
- "Evaluation infrastructure diverts resources from program delivery"
- "Evidence requirements slow down agency action"
- "Our existing scientific staff and processes are adequate"

**Assessment**: Some agency resistance reflects legitimate concerns about unfunded mandates and bureaucratic burden. However, agencies that genuinely use evidence well should welcome frameworks that make their practices transparent and accountable. Resistance often correlates with agencies where evidence use is weakest.

**Strength**: Low to moderate. Agency resistance can be overcome through adequate funding, leadership commitment, and demonstration of value.

## Opposition Strategies

### The Procedural Strategy

Rather than opposing science advice reform directly, opponents use procedural tactics:

- **Delay**: Slow committee formation, extend comment periods, defer action on reform bills
- **Defund**: Reduce budgets for advisory bodies rather than abolishing them
- **Stack**: Appoint allies to advisory positions rather than eliminating the positions
- **Ignore**: Allow advisory structures to exist but disregard their output
- **Burden**: Impose administrative requirements that make advisory processes unwieldy

### The Framing Strategy

Opponents frame science advice reform in politically unfavorable terms:

| Reform Proposal | Opponent Framing |
|----------------|------------------|
| Restore OTA | "More government bureaucracy" |
| Require evidence review | "Red tape that slows down government" |
| Protect agency scientists | "Making government workers unaccountable" |
| Reform advisory committees | "Excluding industry perspective" |
| Strengthen OSTP | "Expanding the president's bureaucratic empire" |

### The Substitution Strategy

Rather than opposing all science advice, some opponents offer alternatives that appear similar but lack independence:

- Industry-funded research presented as equivalent to independent government science
- Think tank analysis positioned as a replacement for nonpartisan advisory bodies
- "Sound science" requirements that in practice raise the evidentiary bar so high that regulation becomes nearly impossible
- Consultant reviews substituted for standing advisory committees

## Addressing Opposition

### Reframing the Debate

Effective reform advocacy must reframe science advice from a technocratic issue to a governance competence issue:

| Current Frame | Better Frame |
|---------------|-------------|
| "Scientists should have more power" | "Government should make informed decisions" |
| "Experts know best" | "Taxpayers deserve competent governance" |
| "Science is under attack" | "Bad decisions cost lives and money" |
| "Restore OTA" | "Give Congress the tools to do its job" |

### Building Unexpected Alliances

| Potential Alliance | Common Ground |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Conservative defense hawks + science advocates | Military technology assessment requires expert capacity |
| Fiscal hawks + evidence-based governance advocates | Evidence-based programs waste less money |
| Rural Republicans + science infrastructure advocates | Agricultural science serves farm communities |
| Libertarians + transparency advocates | Open advisory processes reduce government secrecy |

### Addressing Legitimate Concerns

| Concern | Legitimate Component | Reform Response |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Cost | Budget constraints are real | Science advice budgets are trivial; cost-benefit is overwhelming |
| Speed | Emergency decisions cannot wait for lengthy studies | Expedited consultation procedures for time-sensitive decisions |
| Elitism | Advisory bodies should reflect diverse perspectives | Require geographic, demographic, and disciplinary diversity |
| Bias | Academic groupthink is a real phenomenon | Include practitioners, not just academics; mandate viewpoint diversity |
| Executive discretion | Presidents need flexibility | Set floors, not ceilings, for advisory consultation |
