# Science Advice: Roadmap

## Overview

Strengthening science advice requires a sequenced approach that builds political support incrementally, starting with lower-resistance reforms and progressing toward more ambitious structural changes. This roadmap accounts for political feasibility, institutional capacity, and the reality that different reforms require different vehicles (legislation, executive action, appropriations, or administrative procedure).

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (Year 1-2)

### Objective

Achieve tangible improvements that demonstrate value and build momentum without requiring major legislation.

### 1.1 Expand Congressional Science Capacity (Appropriations)

**Action**: Increase funding for GAO STAI and CRS science staff through the annual Legislative Branch appropriations bill.

- Grow GAO STAI from ~70 to 100+ staff
- Add 30+ STEM analysts to CRS
- Triple AAAS Congressional Fellowship placements

**Vehicle**: Legislative Branch Appropriations Act (annual)

**Champions needed**: Bipartisan appropriations subcommittee leadership

**Estimated cost**: $12-15 million/year

**Why start here**: Appropriations are annual, bipartisan, and do not require authorizing legislation. Expanding existing institutions avoids the political fight over creating new ones. Both parties benefit from better congressional expertise.

### 1.2 Emergency Science Advice Protocol (Executive Action + Legislation)

**Action**: Establish an Emergency Science Advisory Mechanism through:

- Executive order creating the protocol framework
- Legislation codifying it for durability

**Key elements:**

- Pre-designated expert roster maintained by OSTP
- 48-hour activation authority
- Expedited National Academies rapid-response capability
- Post-crisis review requirement

**Vehicle**: Executive order (immediate); codification through NDAA or standalone bill

**Champions needed**: OSTP Director; Senate HELP Committee; House Science Committee

**Estimated cost**: $3 million/year

**Why early**: Post-pandemic bipartisan consensus that crisis science advice needs improvement. Low cost. The executive order component can be implemented immediately.

### 1.3 FACA Reform (Legislation)

**Action**: Introduce and pass amendments to the Federal Advisory Committee Act addressing:

- Balanced membership definition
- Conflict-of-interest procedures
- Protection against wholesale disbandment
- Streamlined formation process

**Vehicle**: Standalone bill or attachment to broader government reform legislation

**Champions needed**: Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; House Oversight Committee

**Estimated cost**: $1-2 million/year (mostly oversight costs)

**Why early**: FACA reform is relatively noncontroversial and has bipartisan support. Addressing advisory committee integrity benefits all future policy areas.

## Phase 2: Structural Foundations (Year 2-4)

### Objective

Enact the core statutory reforms that create durable science advice infrastructure.

### 2.1 Codify OSTP Authority (Legislation)

**Action**: Amend the 1976 OSTP Act to:

- Establish minimum staffing and budget
- Require timely Director nomination and confirmation
- Mandate annual National S&T Strategy
- Grant OSTP rulemaking review authority for science-relevant regulations
- Add OSTP Director to NSC and DPC statutory membership

**Vehicle**: Science and technology authorization bill or standalone OSTP Reform Act

**Champions needed**: Senate Commerce Committee; House Science, Space, and Technology Committee; White House support (variable)

**Estimated cost**: $3-5 million incremental per year

**Political strategy**: Frame as "government competence" rather than "more bureaucracy." Bipartisan appeals: defense hawks value OSTP's role in technology assessment; fiscal moderates value evidence-based resource allocation; science-state legislators value research coordination.

### 2.2 Restore the Office of Technology Assessment (Legislation + Appropriations)

**Action**: Reauthorize OTA through the Technology Assessment Act with modern updates.

**Key design decisions:**

| Decision | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Governance | Retain bipartisan Technology Assessment Board (6+6) | Proven model; ensures bipartisan ownership |
| Staff size | 150-200 | Adequate for ~30 major reports and ~50 tech briefs per year |
| Budget | $50-75 million/year | Reflects current costs; OTA 1995 budget =$45M in 2025 dollars |
| Rapid response | Yes; 60-90 day tech briefs | Addresses criticism that OTA was too slow |
| Digital capacity | Dedicated data science and AI assessment team | Modernizes for current technology landscape |
| Public access | All reports publicly available | Increases value and political support |

**Vehicle**: Congressional Office of Technology Assessment Act (bipartisan bill introduced in multiple recent Congresses)

**Champions needed**: Bipartisan sponsors in both chambers; leadership buy-in from Speaker and Majority Leader

**Political strategy**: Multiple bipartisan bills already exist. Frame around specific issues where Congress needs independent technical expertise: AI regulation, cybersecurity, biotechnology, energy transition. Point to European EPTA network as evidence that parliamentary technology assessment works.

### 2.3 Strengthen the Evidence Act (Legislation)

**Action**: Pass Evidence Act amendments:

- Require SES-level evaluation officers
- Mandate "comply or explain" response to evaluation findings
- Fund dedicated evaluation capacity
- Create independent Evidence Advisory Board
- Include evidence use metrics in budget submissions

**Vehicle**: Evidence Act Amendments or inclusion in broader government reform legislation

**Champions needed**: Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; House Oversight Committee; OMB (for implementation)

**Estimated cost**: $30 million/year across agencies

**Political strategy**: Frame around fiscal responsibility -- evidence-based governance prevents waste. The original Evidence Act passed with strong bipartisan support; strengthening it builds on existing consensus.

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Reform (Year 4-6)

### Objective

Implement the more ambitious reforms that require broader political support and institutional groundwork.

### 3.1 Federal Chief Scientist Act (Legislation)

**Action**: Require every cabinet department and major agency to have a Chief Scientist with:

- Direct reporting to agency head
- Review authority over scientific dimensions of agency actions
- Concurrence/non-concurrence mechanism
- Removal only for cause
- Adequate staff and budget

**Vehicle**: Standalone Federal Chief Scientist Act

**Champions needed**: Broad coalition including science committees, agency leadership buy-in, scientific professional societies

**Estimated cost**: $15-25 million/year across agencies

**Political strategy**: Build on successful models (DOD, USDA). Frame around regulatory quality and public health protection, not abstract science policy. Use specific cases where chief scientist authority would have prevented costly mistakes.

### 3.2 Institutionalize PCAST (Legislation)

**Action**: Establish PCAST by statute with:

- Staggered fixed terms
- Diversity and balance requirements
- Self-initiation authority
- Public reporting on recommendation adoption

**Vehicle**: PCAST Authorization Act or inclusion in broader science authorization

**Champions needed**: White House (must accept reduced discretion); science committees

**Estimated cost**: $2-3 million/year

**Political strategy**: The most politically difficult reform because it directly constrains presidential discretion. Wait for a sympathetic administration or a moment when both parties see value in advisory continuity (e.g., post-crisis). Frame around institutional quality, not constraining the president.

### 3.3 Science Advice Transparency Act (Legislation)

**Action**: Require agencies to:

- Publish scientific basis for significant regulations
- Disclose departures from scientific recommendations
- Maintain public advisory committee logs
- Report annually on scientific integrity

**Vehicle**: Standalone Science Advice Transparency Act

**Champions needed**: Government transparency advocates in both parties; science committees; open government organizations

**Estimated cost**: $5 million/year across agencies

**Political strategy**: Build on existing transparency momentum. Frame around accountability and trust. Avoid framing as constraining agencies; instead frame as empowering the public to evaluate government decisions.

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Change in administration reverses executive actions | High | High | Prioritize legislative over executive reforms |
| OTA restoration stalls due to leadership indifference | Moderate | High | Build constituency through specific use cases; continue GAO STAI expansion as fallback |
| Industry opposition blocks FACA or transparency reforms | Moderate | Medium | Frame reforms around process fairness, not industry exclusion |
| Fiscal opposition blocks new spending | Moderate | Medium | Emphasize cost-effectiveness; aggregate savings from better decisions |
| Agencies resist chief scientist authority | Moderate | Medium | Phase in; start with willing agencies as models; provide adequate resources |
| Partisan polarization prevents bipartisan legislation | Moderate | High | Identify issues where both parties benefit (defense tech, AI, biosecurity) |

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Phase 1 Target | Phase 3 Target |
|--------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Congressional STEM analytical staff | ~140 (CRS + GAO STAI) | 200+ | 350+ (with restored OTA) |
| Agencies with statutory chief scientists | ~5 | ~5 | 15+ |
| PCAST continuity across transitions | 0% historically | Still executive order | Statutory; 50% member carryover |
| OSTP staff floor | None (ranged 45-140) | Stabilized via appropriations | Statutory minimum of 80 |
| Evidence Act compliance rate | ~80% nominal | 90%+ | 95%+ with quality metrics |
| Advisory committee recommendation response rate | Untracked | 50% formal responses | 90% within 180 days |
| Time from crisis to expert panel activation | Ad hoc (days to weeks) | 48 hours | 48 hours (codified) |

## Relationship to Other Reforms

Science advice reform connects to and reinforces other science policy priorities:

| Related Reform | Connection |
|----------------|------------|
| Scientific integrity | Chief scientist authority and transparency requirements reinforce integrity protections |
| Scientific freedom | Independent advisory structures provide institutional backing for scientists who report findings honestly |
| Research funding | Evidence-based governance strengthens the case for sustained research investment |
| Open science | Transparency Act provisions align with open science principles |
| Congressional reform | OTA restoration and CRS expansion are part of broader congressional modernization |
