# Science Advice: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes science advice reform through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

Science advice is an area where the traditional left-right divide is less pronounced than on many policy issues. Most perspectives agree in principle that government should make informed decisions; disagreements center on institutional design, the degree of expert authority, and which scientific findings are politically convenient to accept.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of February 2026)

| Bill/Amendment | Type | Current Status | Last Action |
|----------------|------|----------------|-------------|
| Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act | Federal Legislation | Draft (not yet introduced) | Concept developed from prior reform proposals |
| Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act | Federal Legislation | Draft; multiple precursors introduced | OTA restoration bills introduced in 118th and 119th Congress |

*Note: Status reflects 119th Congress (2025-2026). See [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md) for full bill text.*

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine concerns about government expansion mixed with desire to avoid evidence that supports regulation |
| Principle consistency | "Limited government" applied to science advice structures but not to military/intelligence advisory capacity |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate; some conservatives supported OTA during its operation but oppose restoration now |
| Zero-sum behavior | Some reflexive opposition to proposals associated with Democratic priorities |

**Justification:** Conservative positions on science advice reflect a genuine philosophical commitment to limited government and skepticism of technocratic authority. However, the selective application of these principles -- supporting robust advisory capacity for defense and intelligence while opposing it for environmental and health regulation -- indicates mixed motivations. The shift from bipartisan support for OTA in the 1980s to opposition in the 1990s coincided with OTA producing reports inconvenient to conservative industry allies.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *OTA history*: Republican senators and representatives used OTA assessments extensively in the 1980s; defunding was led by fiscal hawks but supported by industry-aligned members whose interests conflicted with OTA findings. See: Bimber, Bruce. *The Politics of Expertise in Congress*. SUNY Press, 1996.
- *Selective advisory support*: Conservative think tanks (Heritage Foundation, AEI) support robust defense advisory capacity (JASON, Defense Science Board) while opposing expansion of environmental and health advisory bodies.
- *Evidence Act*: The Evidence Act passed with bipartisan support in 2018, indicating conservative willingness to engage on evidence infrastructure when framed around fiscal responsibility.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that science advice is important but disputes the framing that conservative administrations have undermined it; emphasizes liberal academic bias in advisory bodies |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Rejects characterization of industry capture as a primary problem; sees government expansion and regulatory overreach as the real issues |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation. "Reforming the Regulatory Process: Restoring Scientific Integrity." Issue Brief, 2023. Frames regulatory science reform as reducing bureaucratic burden.
- American Enterprise Institute. Various policy briefs on evidence-based governance (2019-2024). Generally supportive of evaluation but skeptical of new advisory bodies.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify OSTP authority | 4/10 | "Unnecessary; president already has access to expertise" | Constraining executive discretion; creating unfireable bureaucrats |
| Restore OTA | 4/10 | "Duplicates CRS and GAO; wasteful spending" | OTA reports may support regulatory expansion |
| Federal Chief Scientist Act | 3/10 | "Creates unaccountable bureaucracy within agencies" | Chief scientists may slow deregulatory agenda |
| Strengthen Evidence Act | 6/10 | "Evidence is good; compliance burden is the concern" | Genuinely supportive of evidence if it reduces waste |
| Emergency science protocol | 6/10 | "Emergency preparedness is important" | Defense and security framing resonates |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act | 4/10 | "Overreach; too many mandates on executive branch" | Chief Science Officer authority could slow deregulation; PCAST constraints limit presidential discretion |
| Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act | 5/10 | "Potentially useful if fiscally responsible and truly nonpartisan" | OTA reports historically produced findings inconvenient to industry allies; bipartisan governance offers some reassurance |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Expand GAO STAI as alternative to full OTA restoration (lower cost, existing institutional framework)
- Focus OSTP reform on voluntary best practices rather than statutory mandates
- Strengthen CRS science capacity rather than creating new bodies
- Require cost-benefit analysis of advisory body recommendations before implementation

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Constitutionalist (limited government), Libertarian (anti-bureaucracy)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (evidence-based governance), Populist (on defense/security framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist

---

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to evidence-based governance; sometimes overstates the degree to which science can resolve value disputes |
| Principle consistency | Strong; consistently supports advisory capacity across domains |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; has supported science advice reform through multiple administrations |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; willing to engage with conservative concerns about advisory balance |

**Justification:** Liberal positions on science advice are highly consistent with underlying principles of evidence-based governance and expert-informed policymaking. The main inconsistency is an occasional tendency to conflate scientific evidence with policy conclusions, treating contested value questions as if they were settled by science. This can alienate potential allies who agree on the importance of evidence but disagree on policy implications.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Legislative record*: Democratic members have consistently sponsored OTA restoration, OSTP strengthening, and scientific integrity legislation. See: H.R. 4426 (117th), S. 2424 (118th), and similar bills.
- *Obama administration*: Issued scientific integrity memorandum on first full day; elevated OSTP; commissioned National Academies studies. See: Presidential Memorandum on Scientific Integrity (March 9, 2009).
- *Biden administration*: Elevated OSTP Director to Cabinet rank; issued comprehensive scientific integrity framework. See: Executive Order 14007 (2021).

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement that science advice infrastructure is inadequate and has been deliberately weakened |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees on structural vulnerability, industry capture, and political interference; may underemphasize role of academic insularity |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress. "Restoring Scientific Integrity in Policymaking." Policy Report, 2020.
- Union of Concerned Scientists. "Grading Government Transparency." Annual reports, 2018-2024.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify OSTP authority | 9/10 | "Essential for preventing future hollowing-out" | Genuinely supportive; may resist if current administration has different priorities |
| Restore OTA | 9/10 | "Long overdue; Congress needs independent expertise" | Genuinely supportive |
| Federal Chief Scientist Act | 8/10 | "Important for regulatory quality" | Supportive; may want stronger authority than advisory-only |
| Strengthen Evidence Act | 8/10 | "Good foundation needs teeth" | Genuinely supportive of evidence infrastructure |
| Emergency science protocol | 8/10 | "COVID showed the need" | Genuinely supportive |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act | 8/10 | "Comprehensive and well-designed; would support with minor strengthening" | May want Chief Science Officer authority to be binding rather than advisory |
| Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act | 9/10 | "Restoring OTA is critical for congressional competence" | Strongly supportive; concerned about ensuring adequate funding |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Make Chief Science Officer concurrence binding for environmental and public health regulations
- Require Senate confirmation for agency chief scientists at cabinet departments
- Establish a Congressional Science Office reporting directly to leadership (in addition to OTA)

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on Evidence Act), Populist (on transparency)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on advisory authority)

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to evidence-based governance with additional focus on equity and community input |
| Principle consistency | Strong; consistently supports advisory capacity with emphasis on democratic participation |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on core principles; may push for more expansive reforms than initially proposed |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; but may prioritize equity dimensions over institutional design |

**Justification:** Progressives consistently support strengthening science advice infrastructure but push for advisory processes that include community voices and address environmental justice. This is generally additive rather than contradictory to the core reform agenda. The main tension is a tendency to expand the scope of reform beyond what is politically feasible, potentially slowing progress on achievable changes.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Environmental justice movement*: Progressive advocacy for community representation on EPA advisory committees. See: Executive Order 14008 (2021) on environmental justice advisory council.
- *COVID-19 response*: Progressive criticism focused both on science being ignored and on advisory processes excluding frontline workers and communities of color. See: Congressional Progressive Caucus statements, 2020-2021.
- *Evidence Act support*: Supported original legislation and advocates for stronger implementation. See: Progressive caucus letters to OMB on evaluation capacity, 2022.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement; emphasizes how advisory failures disproportionately harm marginalized communities |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees on structural causes; would add corporate influence and systemic racism as additional root causes |

**Source references:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus. Policy positions on science and evidence (2023-2025).
- Center for Science and Democracy (UCS). "Strengthening Federal Scientific Integrity Policies." Reports, 2022-2024.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify OSTP authority | 8/10 | "Necessary but should include equity mandate" | Want OSTP to address distributional impacts of S&T policy |
| Restore OTA | 9/10 | "Critical; should include environmental justice assessment" | Supportive; want expanded scope |
| Federal Chief Scientist Act | 8/10 | "Good; should include community advisory mechanisms" | Want chief scientists to engage affected communities |
| Strengthen Evidence Act | 8/10 | "Yes, with equity-focused evaluation requirements" | Want evaluation to measure distributional impacts |
| FACA reform | 9/10 | "Essential for preventing industry capture" | Prioritize community and public interest representation |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act | 8/10 | "Strong foundation; would add equity provisions" | Want PCAST diversity requirements to be more specific; want community input mechanisms |
| Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act | 9/10 | "Strongly support; want OTA to assess equity dimensions of technology" | Supportive; would add requirement for distributional impact analysis |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Add mandatory environmental justice analysis to OTA assessments
- Require community advisory panels alongside expert FACA committees
- Create an Office of Science and Society within OSTP focused on equity impacts

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on evidence use), Populist (on anti-corporate provisions)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Libertarian

---

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine principled opposition to expanding government; skepticism of expert authority is philosophically grounded |
| Principle consistency | High; applies limited-government principles consistently across science advice domains |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; opposition to new government bodies is predictable |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; opposition is principled rather than partisan |

**Justification:** Libertarian opposition to science advice expansion is grounded in a consistent philosophy of limited government and skepticism of concentrated authority. Unlike some conservative opposition, libertarian concerns are not selectively applied -- libertarians are equally skeptical of defense advisory bodies and regulatory advisory bodies. This consistency makes libertarian positions predictable and their concerns addressable through structural design.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Cato Institute*: Consistent opposition to expanding government advisory bodies across domains. See: Cato Institute policy analyses on federal advisory committees, 2015-2024.
- *Reason Foundation*: Supports evidence-based governance in principle but opposes creating new government offices. See: Reason policy briefs on government reform, 2020-2024.
- *Cross-domain consistency*: Libertarians opposed expansion of both environmental and defense advisory capacity, demonstrating principled application.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Agrees government decisions should be informed but disputes that more government infrastructure is the answer |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agrees on political manipulation but sees the solution as less government involvement, not more advisory structures |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute. "The Case Against a New Office of Technology Assessment." Policy Analysis, 2020.
- Reason Foundation. "Evidence-Based Policy Without Government Expansion." Policy Study, 2022.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify OSTP authority | 3/10 | "Government does not need more mandated bureaucracy" | Expanding executive office |
| Restore OTA | 3/10 | "Private sector and universities can provide this analysis" | New government spending; government expansion |
| Federal Chief Scientist Act | 2/10 | "Creates unaccountable positions that slow government action" | Embedded bureaucratic resistance to reform |
| Strengthen Evidence Act | 5/10 | "Evidence is good; mandates are not" | Supports transparency; opposes compliance burdens |
| Transparency Act | 7/10 | "Transparency is a libertarian value" | Genuinely supportive of government openness |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act | 3/10 | "Well-intentioned but creates too many mandates and new positions" | Opposes government expansion; skeptical of Chief Science Officer authority |
| Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act | 4/10 | "Congress already has CRS and GAO; private expertise available" | Opposes new government spending; prefers market solutions |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Enhance CRS and GAO within existing budgets rather than creating new offices
- Use competitive contracting for technical assessments (multiple providers, avoid monopoly)
- Focus on transparency and disclosure rather than advisory mandates
- Require sunset provisions for all advisory bodies with mandatory renewal justification

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (limited government), Constitutionalist (enumerated powers)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on transparency), Progressive (on anti-corporate transparency)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal (on advisory mandates), Democratic Socialist (on government expansion)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine constitutional concerns about executive power and separation of powers |
| Principle consistency | High; applies structural constitutional principles consistently |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; constitutional arguments are well-defined |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; opposition is structural rather than partisan |

**Justification:** Constitutionalist concerns about science advice reform are grounded in coherent structural arguments about separation of powers, enumerated powers, and federalism. These concerns are genuinely held and consistently applied. Constitutionalists who object to congressional mandates on executive advisory structures also object to executive overreach in other domains.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Separation of powers doctrine*: Consistent position that Congress should not prescribe how the president organizes advisory functions. See: Federalist Society publications on executive power, 2015-2024.
- *Federalism*: Consistent preference for state-level innovation over federal mandates. See: Heritage Foundation constitutional analysis of science policy proposals.
- *Cross-domain consistency*: Constitutionalist objections to OSTP mandates parallel objections to congressional mandates on other executive functions.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that advisory structures serve important functions but emphasizes constitutional limits on reform |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agrees on structural vulnerability but attributes it to proper constitutional design (executive discretion) rather than to a flaw requiring correction |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society. "Executive Power and the Organization of the Presidency." Panel transcripts, 2020-2024.
- Heritage Foundation. "Constitutional Limits on Science Policy Reform." Issue Brief, 2023.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify OSTP authority | 4/10 | "Congress can establish offices but cannot dictate internal executive organization" | Appointments Clause; separation of powers |
| Restore OTA | 7/10 | "Congress organizing its own support offices is squarely within Article I" | Supportive of congressional capacity as proper constitutional function |
| Federal Chief Scientist Act | 3/10 | "For-cause removal protections may violate unitary executive" | Genuine constitutional concern about removal restrictions |
| Evidence Act enhancements | 5/10 | "Transparency requirements are proper; binding mandates raise concerns" | Supports information requirements; opposes decision mandates |
| State model legislation | 7/10 | "State-level innovation is constitutionally appropriate" | Federalism preference |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act | 4/10 | "Some provisions may violate separation of powers; for-cause removal of Chief Science Officers is constitutionally questionable" | Genuine concern about executive power; supportive of transparency provisions |
| Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act | 7/10 | "Properly within Article I congressional power to organize its own operations" | Supportive; OTA is a legislative branch entity |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Focus reforms on congressional capacity (OTA, CRS expansion) rather than executive branch mandates
- Replace binding mandates with transparency and reporting requirements
- Allow states to lead on chief scientist and evidence infrastructure experimentation
- Remove for-cause removal protections; replace with transparency requirements for removals

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (limited government), Libertarian (constitutional limits)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on OTA restoration), Liberal (on congressional capacity)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (on executive mandates), Democratic Socialist (on government expansion)

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Anti-elite rhetoric mixed with selective support for expert authority (e.g., defense, trade) |
| Principle consistency | Low; "anti-expert" on climate and health but pro-expert on trade and immigration |
| Goalpost stability | Unstable; positions shift based on which political coalition is associated with the proposal |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; tendency to oppose proposals associated with "the establishment" |

**Justification:** Populist positions on science advice are the least consistent of any perspective. Anti-elite sentiment drives opposition to advisory bodies perceived as technocratic, but populists selectively support expert authority when it serves their policy preferences (e.g., trade analysis showing harm from free trade, defense assessments supporting military spending). This inconsistency makes populists unreliable coalition partners on science advice reform, though they can be engaged on specific issues with the right framing.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Selective expertise*: Populist politicians cite expert analysis when it supports trade protection or immigration restriction but dismiss expert consensus on climate change and pandemic response. See: Congressional voting patterns on OTA restoration vs. climate science resolutions, 2019-2024.
- *Anti-establishment framing*: Science advisory bodies are characterized as "elitist" or "ivory tower" when findings conflict with populist preferences. See: Populist media coverage of EPA Science Advisory Board and PCAST, 2017-2024.
- *Defense exception*: Populist support for robust defense advisory capacity (JASON, Defense Science Board) contradicts anti-expert positioning in other domains.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Agrees that government ignores ordinary Americans' concerns but frames science advice as part of the elite problem rather than the solution |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Sees the root cause as elite capture of government generally; rejects framing that more expert bodies would help |

**Source references:**

- Populist media commentary on science advisory bodies (2017-2024): Characterize OSTP and PCAST as "unelected bureaucrats."
- Congressional populist caucus positions on government reform (2023-2025): Support "streamlining" government, which includes reducing advisory committees.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify OSTP authority | 3/10 | "Another way to give unelected elites more power" | Anti-technocratic sentiment |
| Restore OTA | 4/10 | "Congress already has too many offices" | Government spending; elite capture |
| Federal Chief Scientist Act | 3/10 | "Unaccountable scientists should not have veto power" | Anti-expert sentiment |
| Strengthen Evidence Act | 4/10 | "Evidence is code for elite preferences" | Distrust of evaluation establishment |
| Transparency Act | 6/10 | "Transparency is good; expose what government is doing" | Genuinely supportive of government openness |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act | 3/10 | "Gives unelected experts too much authority over elected officials" | Anti-elite; anti-technocratic |
| Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act | 4/10 | "More government spending on elite advice Congress will ignore" | Skeptical of value; fiscal concerns |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Require advisory committee membership to include non-expert citizens and community representatives
- Create "citizen review panels" to evaluate expert recommendations
- Reduce the number of federal advisory committees rather than expanding them
- Require plain-language summaries of all advisory reports

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on anti-bureaucracy), Religious Right (on anti-elite sentiment)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on anti-corporate provisions), Liberal (on transparency)
- **Unlikely partners:** Centrist (fundamentally different view of expertise), Libertarian (different philosophical basis)

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to evidence-based, pragmatic governance |
| Principle consistency | High; consistently supports advisory capacity and evidence use across domains |
| Goalpost stability | Very stable; evidence-based governance is a core centrist principle |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low; actively seeks bipartisan solutions |

**Justification:** Science advice reform is one of the most natural centrist issues. Evidence-based governance, institutional competence, and bipartisan advisory structures align perfectly with centrist values. Centrists have been among the most reliable advocates for OTA restoration, Evidence Act implementation, and OSTP strengthening. Their positions are predictable, principled, and stable.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center*: Consistent advocacy for science advisory capacity and evidence-based governance. See: BPC reports on government reform, 2018-2024.
- *Evidence Act*: The original Evidence Act was championed by centrist legislators from both parties (Speaker Ryan and Senator Murray). See: P.L. 115-435 legislative history.
- *OTA restoration*: Bipartisan OTA restoration bills have been consistently supported by centrist members. See: Congressional Office of Technology Assessment Act cosponsors (118th, 119th Congress).

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement that science advice infrastructure is inadequate and needs strengthening |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees on structural vulnerability and political interference; may underemphasize partisan asymmetry |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center. "Improving the Use of Science in Regulatory Policy." Report, 2009.
- Problem Solvers Caucus. Positions on government modernization and evidence-based policy (2023-2025).

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify OSTP authority | 8/10 | "Sensible institutional reform" | Supportive; may want to moderate some mandates for bipartisan appeal |
| Restore OTA | 9/10 | "Congress needs independent expertise; bipartisan governance is ideal" | Strongly supportive |
| Federal Chief Scientist Act | 7/10 | "Good concept; design details matter" | Supportive with attention to implementation feasibility |
| Strengthen Evidence Act | 9/10 | "Building on bipartisan foundation" | Core centrist priority |
| Transparency Act | 8/10 | "Transparency builds trust" | Supportive |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act | 8/10 | "Comprehensive and well-designed; strong bipartisan potential" | May suggest moderating Chief Science Officer for-cause removal to address constitutional concerns |
| Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act | 9/10 | "This is exactly what Congress needs; bipartisan governance model is right" | Strongly supportive; main concern is ensuring adequate funding through appropriations |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Phase in reforms gradually to build institutional credibility before expanding authority
- Start OTA as a pilot program to demonstrate value before full authorization
- Focus initial Evidence Act enhancements on demonstration projects at willing agencies

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (on evidence-based governance), Conservative defense hawks (on technical capacity)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on fiscal responsibility framing), Constitutionalist (on OTA as Article I institution)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (fundamentally different view of expertise)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine concern about value neutrality in science advice mixed with desire to limit advisory authority on specific issues |
| Principle consistency | Moderate; supports expert authority on some issues (bioethics, drug policy) but opposes it on others (climate, reproductive health) |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate; stable on core value concerns, variable on institutional design |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; some opposition driven by association with liberal priorities |

**Justification:** The Religious Right's relationship with science advice is complex. This perspective genuinely values expert input on issues where science aligns with its values (e.g., fetal development research, addiction treatment) but resists advisory mechanisms that produce findings conflicting with faith-based positions (e.g., climate science, comprehensive sex education). The core concern -- that science advice should not override democratic and moral judgment -- has legitimate elements, but its selective application undermines consistency.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bioethics engagement*: Religious Right organizations engage constructively with bioethics advisory bodies and have provided valuable input on embryonic research, gene editing, and end-of-life issues. See: President's Council on Bioethics (2001-2009) membership and reports.
- *Climate science resistance*: Cornwall Alliance and similar organizations have systematically challenged climate advisory processes. See: Cornwall Alliance. "An Evangelical Declaration on Global Warming" (2009).
- *FDA advisory committees*: Religious Right organizations have engaged with drug approval advisory committees on issues including Plan B contraception and mifepristone. See: FDA advisory committee public comments, 2003-2024.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Partially agrees that science advice matters but sees current advisory bodies as biased toward secular/progressive worldview |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Sees the root cause as advisory bodies excluding faith-based perspectives and treating contested value questions as settled science |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify OSTP authority | 3/10 | "Could empower advisors who exclude faith perspectives" | Secular bias in advisory process |
| Restore OTA | 4/10 | "Depends on whether assessments respect moral dimensions" | OTA may produce findings on reproductive technology, climate, etc. that conflict with values |
| Federal Chief Scientist Act | 3/10 | "Scientists should advise, not govern" | Chief scientists may override value-based policy decisions |
| Strengthen Evidence Act | 5/10 | "Evidence is valuable when properly understood" | Supportive of evidence if it includes moral reasoning |
| FACA reform | 5/10 | "Advisory committees should include diverse viewpoints including faith-based" | Want religious perspectives represented on advisory bodies |

| Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act | 4/10 | "Elevates scientific expertise above moral and democratic judgment" | Concerned that Chief Science Officer authority could override faith-informed policy |
| Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act | 5/10 | "Could be valuable if truly nonpartisan and addresses moral dimensions" | Cautious; want OTA assessments to include ethical analysis |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Require advisory bodies to include ethicists and representatives of faith communities
- Mandate that advisory reports distinguish between scientific evidence and policy recommendations
- Create a separate Ethics Advisory Board alongside science advisory bodies
- Protect conscience rights of advisory committee members who dissent on moral grounds

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on limiting expert authority), Populist (on anti-elite sentiment)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on evidence with values), Liberal (on bioethics engagement)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (fundamentally different values framework), Democratic Socialist

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to public interest science advice; sometimes treats science as validating predetermined conclusions |
| Principle consistency | High; consistently supports public advisory capacity and opposes corporate influence |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; may push for stronger reforms but does not oppose moderate ones |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; supports incremental progress even when it falls short of transformative vision |

**Justification:** Democratic socialists consistently support strengthening science advice as part of a broader commitment to public goods and democratic governance. Their positions are principled and predictable: expand public advisory capacity, reduce corporate influence, and ensure science serves the public interest. The main inconsistency is an occasional tendency to assume that science always supports progressive policy conclusions, overlooking cases where evidence is genuinely uncertain or mixed.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Public science advocacy*: Democratic socialist organizations consistently support expanded public science advisory capacity. See: DSA position on science policy, 2022-2024.
- *Anti-corporate focus*: Consistent opposition to industry influence on advisory committees, with detailed policy proposals. See: Public Citizen. "Corporate Capture of Federal Advisory Committees." Report, 2023.
- *Evidence Act support*: Supported the original legislation and advocates for stronger implementation with emphasis on public accountability. See: Congressional Progressive Caucus letters on Evidence Act implementation, 2022-2024.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement; emphasizes corporate capture and underfunding as central problems |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees on structural causes with additional emphasis on capitalist incentives to undermine public science |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify OSTP authority | 8/10 | "Essential; should go further" | Want stronger mandates and more resources |
| Restore OTA | 9/10 | "Critical public institution; must be well-funded" | Strongly supportive; want larger budget |
| Federal Chief Scientist Act | 9/10 | "Give scientists real authority, not just advisory role" | Want binding rather than advisory authority |
| Strengthen Evidence Act | 8/10 | "Need to ensure evidence serves public, not corporate interests" | Want evidence infrastructure to include equity metrics |
| FACA reform | 9/10 | "Eliminate corporate capture of advisory committees" | Want strict limits on industry representation |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |

| Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act | 9/10 | "Strongly support; want robust funding and public access" | Strongly supportive; want OTA to assess corporate influence on technology |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Make Chief Science Officer concurrence binding for all public health and environmental regulations
- Prohibit advisory committee members with direct financial conflicts from voting
- Create a Public Interest Science Fund to counter industry-funded research
- Require OTA to assess distributional impacts of technology on workers and communities

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Liberal
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on evidence infrastructure), Populist (on anti-corporate provisions)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on government expansion), Libertarian (on mandates)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Restore OTA | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right | Libertarian |
| Strengthen Evidence Act | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Conservative, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | Populist | -- |
| Transparency Act | All except Religious Right (5) and Populist (6) at 5+; broad support | Conservative (5), Religious Right (5) | -- |
| Emergency science protocol | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Conservative, Democratic Socialist | Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right | -- |
| FACA reform | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Populist | -- |
| Codify OSTP authority | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Constitutionalist | Libertarian, Populist, Religious Right |
| Federal Chief Scientist Act | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | -- | Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right |

**Key insight:** Evidence Act strengthening and transparency reforms have the broadest potential coalition (7-8 of 9 perspectives at 5+). OTA restoration has strong support from 5 perspectives and the added advantage of constitutionalist support as an Article I congressional function. The Federal Chief Scientist Act faces the most structural opposition and should be sequenced later.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Evidence and Transparency First*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian + Constitutionalist + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Government decisions should be transparent about their evidence basis, and evaluation infrastructure should be adequately resourced.

**Policy Description:**

A focused bill combining Evidence Act enhancements with science advice transparency requirements:

- Require SES-level evaluation officers at CFO Act agencies
- Mandate "comply or explain" for major decisions departing from evaluation findings
- Require agencies to publish the scientific basis for significant regulatory actions
- Create an independent Evidence Advisory Board to assess implementation
- Provide $30 million in dedicated evaluation funding

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Frames evidence use as fiscal responsibility; reduces waste |
| Liberal | Builds on Evidence Act foundation; increases accountability |
| Centrist | Core bipartisan priority; incremental and pragmatic |
| Libertarian | Transparency and disclosure align with libertarian values; no new advisory bodies |
| Constitutionalist | Reporting and transparency requirements are constitutionally sound |
| Democratic Socialist | Evidence infrastructure serves public interest; accountability for corporate influence |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts new spending on evaluation infrastructure (~$30M/year) |
| Liberal | Accepts incremental approach rather than comprehensive science advice reform |
| Libertarian | Accepts some new government mandates (evaluation officer seniority, reporting requirements) |
| Democratic Socialist | Accepts advisory-only evidence framework rather than binding requirements |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High; builds on existing bipartisan Evidence Act framework; no partisan triggers
- **Implementation Path:** Can be attached to government reform legislation or passed as standalone Evidence Act Amendments

---

### Compromise 2: *Congressional Expertise Restoration*

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Conservative (partial) + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Congress needs independent technical capacity to evaluate executive branch claims and legislate on complex issues.

**Policy Description:**

A focused bill restoring and modernizing OTA with design features addressing conservative and constitutionalist concerns:

- Reestablish OTA with bipartisan governance (6+6 board)
- Initial budget of $50 million, scaling to $75 million over 3 years
- Mandate nonpartisan analysis presenting policy options, not recommendations
- Include rapid-response capability (30-day turnaround for urgent questions)
- Require external peer review and public access for all reports
- Coordinate with (not replace) CRS and GAO STAI
- 3-year pilot period with GAO effectiveness review before permanent authorization

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Restores essential congressional capacity; independent expertise |
| Progressive | OTA can assess equity dimensions of technology; public access ensures accountability |
| Centrist | Bipartisan governance model; evidence-based congressional capacity |
| Constitutionalist | OTA is an Article I institution; strengthens legislative branch vis-a-vis executive |
| Conservative | Bipartisan board ensures balanced work plan; pilot period reduces risk; presents options, not recommendations |
| Democratic Socialist | Public institution providing analysis independent of corporate influence |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts $50-75M in new spending; risks OTA producing inconvenient findings |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts new government body, though within their preferred branch |
| Liberal | Accepts pilot period rather than permanent authorization; accepts no-recommendation mandate |
| Democratic Socialist | Accepts nonpartisan framing rather than explicitly public-interest mandate |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives (5 strong + 1 partial)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/6 core coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High; bipartisan governance and pilot structure reduce political vulnerability; congressional institution building has bipartisan precedent
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act; multiple bipartisan precursor bills already exist

---

### Compromise 3: *Emergency Science Advisory Protocol*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Democratic Socialist + Religious Right

**Core Agreement:** During national emergencies, government decision-makers should have rapid access to scientific expertise.

**Policy Description:**

A narrowly focused provision establishing an Emergency Science Advisory Mechanism:

- Pre-designated roster of scientific experts maintained by OSTP, covering pandemic, natural disaster, cybersecurity, and national security domains
- 48-hour activation authority for the OSTP Director
- Expedited National Academies rapid-response capability
- Requirements that emergency executive actions cite their scientific basis
- Post-emergency review assessing effectiveness of science advisory response
- Sunset after 5 years with reauthorization required

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | National security framing; emergency preparedness is a proper government function |
| Liberal | Institutionalizes lessons from COVID-19 response |
| Progressive | Ensures expert input reaches decision-makers during crises affecting vulnerable populations |
| Centrist | Practical, evidence-based crisis response |
| Constitutionalist | Limited, specific purpose; sunset provision; proper exercise of Article I/II coordination |
| Religious Right | Emergency preparedness protects communities; does not involve contested science issues |
| Democratic Socialist | Public science advisory capacity for crisis response |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts new formal mechanism (though limited in scope) |
| Libertarian | Accepts government advisory structure (narrow exception to anti-bureaucracy stance) |
| Liberal | Accepts narrow emergency focus rather than comprehensive reform |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts some executive-legislative coordination mandate |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High; narrow scope and emergency framing reduce partisan triggers; post-COVID consensus on need
- **Implementation Path:** Can be included in NDAA or standalone emergency preparedness legislation; minimal cost (~$3M/year)

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The strongest coalition combines Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, and Democratic Socialist perspectives (consistent support for comprehensive reform) with selective Conservative and Constitutionalist engagement on specific provisions (OTA as Article I institution, Evidence Act as fiscal responsibility). This coalition achieves 6-7 of 9 perspectives on most reforms.

### Key Obstacles

- **Populist anti-expertise sentiment**: The hardest perspective to engage because opposition is rooted in cultural identity rather than policy disagreement. Framing reforms around "government competence" rather than "expert authority" helps but does not fully resolve the tension.
- **Executive branch resistance**: No president wants statutory constraints on advisory discretion. Reform requires either a sympathetic president or sufficient congressional will to override executive objections.
- **Industry opposition**: Well-resourced and strategically sophisticated; operates through proxies. Counter with transparency requirements that expose industry influence rather than attempting to exclude industry entirely.

### Low Consistency Partners

- **Populist (2/5)**: Engage through specific, concrete examples where better science advice would have served populist constituencies (e.g., Flint water crisis, opioid epidemic). Avoid abstract institutional arguments.
- **Conservative (3/5)**: Engage through defense and national security framing; emphasize fiscal responsibility; address legitimate concerns about advisory body bias by including viewpoint diversity requirements.
- **Religious Right (3/5)**: Engage on bioethics advisory capacity, where this perspective has constructive contributions; separate science advice infrastructure from contested policy issues.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with Evidence Act enhancements and transparency** (Compromise 1) -- broadest coalition, lowest resistance, builds on existing bipartisan framework
2. **Advance OTA restoration** (Compromise 2) -- strong existing support, bipartisan precursor bills, constitutionalist support as Article I institution
3. **Enact emergency science protocol** (Compromise 3) -- broadest coalition including Religious Right and partial Conservative support; leverage post-COVID consensus
4. **Build toward OSTP reform and Chief Scientist Act** -- use demonstrated value of earlier reforms to build support for executive branch mandates
