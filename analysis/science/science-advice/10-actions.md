# Science Advice: Actions

## Overview

Strengthening science advice infrastructure requires sustained civic engagement. While some reforms require legislative action, citizens, scientists, and organizations can take concrete steps now to improve how scientific expertise informs government decisions.

## For All Citizens

### Learn and Engage

- **Understand the current system**: Read OSTP reports and PCAST recommendations, available at <https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/>. These documents show what science advice looks like when it works.
- **Attend FACA meetings**: Federal advisory committee meetings are generally open to the public. The GSA FACA database at <https://www.facadatabase.gov/> lists upcoming meetings. Attending demonstrates public interest and helps monitor advisory quality.
- **Read National Academies reports**: Consensus study reports are free to read online at <https://nap.nationalacademies.org/>. Understanding how expert consensus is developed builds scientific literacy and helps citizens evaluate policy claims.
- **Follow CRS reports**: Publicly available at <https://crsreports.congress.gov/>. CRS reports provide nonpartisan analysis of science policy issues facing Congress.

### Advocate

- **Contact your members of Congress**: Ask your representative and senators to:
    - Support OTA restoration legislation (the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment Act)
    - Fund expanded CRS science and technology capacity
    - Ensure OSTP is adequately funded in annual appropriations
    - Support Evidence Act strengthening legislation
- **Support science advice reform organizations**: Organizations including the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Federation of American Scientists, and the AAAS advocate for science in policy. Supporting them amplifies the reform message.
- **Vote for evidence-based governance**: When evaluating candidates, consider their positions on science advisory appointments, OSTP, and evidence use in government. Ask about these issues at town halls and candidate forums.
- **Testify and comment**: When agencies propose changes to advisory committees or scientific integrity policies, submit public comments. These comments become part of the official record and signal public interest.

### Monitor

- **Track OSTP Director nominations**: When a new administration takes office, the speed and quality of OSTP Director nomination signals the administration's commitment to science advice. Delays of more than 6 months should prompt constituent outreach.
- **Monitor advisory committee changes**: Pay attention to news about advisory committee disbandments, membership changes, or charter revisions. The UCS Scientific Integrity Tracker at <https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/attacks-on-science> documents these changes.
- **Follow Evidence Act implementation**: Agency learning agendas and evaluation plans are publicly available at <https://www.evaluation.gov/>. Reviewing these documents helps assess whether agencies are genuinely building evidence capacity.

## For Scientists and Researchers

### Participate

- **Apply for AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellowships**: The fellowship places scientists in congressional offices and federal agencies for 1-2 years. Information at <https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships>.
- **Serve on advisory committees**: When agencies announce openings on FACA committees, apply. Federal Register notices and the FACA database list opportunities. Diverse expert participation improves advisory quality.
- **Respond to requests for information**: When agencies, National Academies committees, or congressional offices seek expert input, respond. Scientists who engage with the policy process improve the evidence base for decisions.
- **Testify before Congress**: Congressional committees regularly seek expert witnesses. Contact committee staff (available on committee websites) to express willingness to testify in your area of expertise.

### Advocate Within Your Institutions

- **Encourage your professional society to engage on science advice reform**: Societies including AAAS, APS, ACS, and AGU have science policy programs. Advocating for OTA restoration, OSTP strengthening, and advisory committee reform through these organizations amplifies impact.
- **Support colleagues who serve in government**: Scientists who leave academia for government advisory roles often face career penalties. Support policies at your institution that value policy service in tenure and promotion decisions.
- **Mentor early-career scientists in policy engagement**: Many graduate students and postdocs are interested in science policy but lack guidance. Mentoring the next generation of science policy professionals builds long-term capacity.

### Communicate

- **Write op-eds and public commentary**: When science advice issues arise in the news -- advisory committee changes, OSTP vacancies, Evidence Act implementation -- write accessible commentary explaining why these structures matter. Target local media, not just national outlets.
- **Engage elected officials**: Scientists often have credibility that general advocacy does not. Write letters to members of Congress specifically addressing how science advice affects your research area and your community.
- **Document and report political interference**: If you witness political interference with government science advice, report it through official channels (scientific integrity officers, inspector general) and, when appropriate, to monitoring organizations like the Union of Concerned Scientists.

## For Government Scientists

### Protect Advisory Integrity

- **Know your rights**: Understand the scientific integrity policies at your agency. These policies, developed under OSTP guidance, protect your ability to conduct and communicate research without political interference.
- **Use official channels**: When you observe advisory processes being compromised, report through your agency's scientific integrity officer. If internal channels are unresponsive, the Office of Special Counsel protects whistleblowers.
- **Maintain documentation**: Keep records of scientific recommendations, how they were communicated to decision-makers, and any changes made to scientific content during review. Documentation is essential for accountability.

### Build Evidence Capacity

- **Engage with your agency's Evidence Act infrastructure**: Connect with your agency's evaluation officer and chief data officer. Help develop learning agenda questions that address genuinely important evidence gaps.
- **Participate in cross-agency evidence networks**: OMB's evidence community of practice and interagency evaluation groups connect evidence professionals across government. Participation strengthens the overall evidence infrastructure.
- **Champion evidence use in your unit**: Advocate for using evaluation findings in program decisions within your office. Change from within is often more durable than mandates from above.

## For State and Local Government

### Build Local Capacity

- **Establish state science advisor positions**: Several states (e.g., New Jersey, California) have created state science advisors. Advocate for similar positions in your state, drawing on the INGSA framework for subnational science advice.
- **Create state evidence commissions**: Some states have established commissions or offices devoted to evidence-based policymaking. These can serve as models for others.
- **Use federal resources**: The National Academies, CRS reports, and GAO assessments are available to state officials. Building relationships with these institutions improves state-level science capacity.

## For Media and Journalism

### Cover the Infrastructure

- **Report on science advice structures, not just science controversies**: Advisory committee changes, OSTP vacancies, and Evidence Act implementation affect every policy area but receive little media attention.
- **Investigate advisory committee composition**: When agencies change advisory committee membership, investigate whether new members have relevant expertise and conflicts of interest.
- **Follow the evidence trail**: When agencies issue major regulations, examine whether the cited evidence supports the decision. Agency scientific basis documents are public and can be evaluated with expert help.
