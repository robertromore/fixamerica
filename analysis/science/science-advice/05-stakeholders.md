# Science Advice: Stakeholders

## Overview

Science advice reform affects a broad range of actors, from the scientists who provide expertise to the policymakers who use (or ignore) it, and ultimately to the public whose welfare depends on evidence-based governance. Understanding who has power, who is affected, and who has organized interests is essential for mapping the political landscape of reform.

## Primary Stakeholders

### The President and White House Staff

**Role**: Principal consumer of executive branch science advice; appoints OSTP Director, PCAST members, and agency leaders who shape science advisory capacity.

**Interests:**

- Desire for advice that supports preferred policies
- Need for technically competent crisis response
- Interest in appearing scientifically informed (variable by president)
- Resistance to advisory structures that constrain presidential discretion

**Power**: Dominant. The president controls OSTP staffing, PCAST composition, and sets the tone for whether agencies value scientific input.

**Position on reform**: Variable by administration. Reform that limits presidential discretion over science advice faces inherent executive resistance.

### Congress

**Role**: Legislates the structure of science advice; appropriates funding for OSTP, agencies, and congressional science capacity; conducts oversight of evidence use.

**Interests:**

- Independent capacity to evaluate executive branch technical claims
- Technical analysis to inform legislation on complex issues (AI, biotech, energy, defense)
- Oversight tools to assess whether agencies follow the evidence
- Political interest in sometimes avoiding expert input that complicates messaging

**Power**: Controls the legislative framework and funding for all science advice structures. Could restore OTA, strengthen OSTP's statutory mandate, or impose evidence-use requirements.

**Internal divisions:**

| Group | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Science committee chairs (both parties) | Generally supportive of enhanced capacity |
| Appropriations hawks | Skeptical of new spending on advisory bodies |
| Members from states with strong research universities | Tend to support science infrastructure |
| Members aligned with industries facing regulation | May resist independent advisory capacity |
| Bipartisan OTA restoration caucus | Active but lacks leadership priority |

### OSTP Staff and Leadership

**Role**: Provide day-to-day science advice to the president and coordinate science and technology policy across agencies.

**Interests:**

- Institutional survival and growth
- Policy influence and access to the president
- Professional credibility within the scientific community
- Stable career paths (currently, OSTP staff are largely political appointees and detailees)

**Power**: Depends entirely on presidential relationship. Under sympathetic presidents, significant; under dismissive presidents, negligible.

**Key challenges:**

- High turnover between administrations
- Tension between political loyalty and honest brokerage
- Small budget relative to mission scope
- No directive authority over agencies

### Federal Agency Scientists

**Role**: Produce the evidence that informs regulatory decisions, public health guidance, environmental policy, and technology assessments. Tens of thousands of PhD-level scientists and engineers work across the federal government.

**Interests:**

- Ability to conduct research without political interference
- Assurance that findings will be honestly represented in agency decisions
- Career protections for reporting scientific concerns
- Adequate resources for research programs

**Power**: Individually limited; collectively significant through unions (AFGE, NTEU), professional associations, and whistleblower mechanisms. Government scientists' credibility gives them public influence when they speak out.

**Key agencies:**

| Agency | Scientist Population | Key Advisory Role |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| NIH | ~6,000 intramural researchers | Health policy, pandemic response |
| EPA | ~1,800 scientists and engineers | Environmental regulation |
| NOAA | ~4,000+ scientists | Climate, weather, fisheries policy |
| USDA | ~2,000+ research scientists | Agricultural and food policy |
| DOE National Labs | ~30,000+ researchers | Energy, nuclear, materials policy |
| CDC | ~3,500+ scientists | Public health guidance |
| FDA | ~4,500+ reviewers and scientists | Drug and device safety |
| USGS | ~4,000+ scientists | Natural hazards, water, geology |
| NASA | ~3,500+ scientists and engineers | Space, Earth science policy |

### The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine

**Role**: Congressionally chartered independent institution that provides consensus scientific reports on request from government agencies and Congress.

**Interests:**

- Maintaining independence and credibility
- Sufficient government contract revenue (~$300 million/year) to sustain operations
- Protecting the consensus study model from political interference
- Remaining the gold standard for science advice

**Power**: Significant reputational authority but no enforcement mechanism. Academies reports carry weight because of their rigorous peer review process, but recommendations are advisory only.

**Key strengths and weaknesses:**

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Gold-standard peer review process | Reports take 12-24 months; too slow for urgent decisions |
| Volunteer committee model ensures broad expertise | Volunteer model limits availability of top experts |
| Congressional charter provides institutional independence | Independence means no one is required to act on findings |
| ~200 reports per year covers broad range | Government must commission (and pay for) studies |

### Congressional Research Service (CRS)

**Role**: Nonpartisan research arm of Congress providing reports, briefings, and technical analysis to members and committees.

**Interests:**

- Maintaining nonpartisan reputation
- Adequate staffing for STEM-related requests
- Institutional independence from political pressure

**Power**: Significant influence on congressional deliberation through high-quality analysis, but limited STEM capacity (~70 analysts with STEM backgrounds out of ~600 total).

### GAO Science, Technology Assessment, and Innovation (STAI)

**Role**: GAO's dedicated team for technology assessment, created in 2019 to partially fill the OTA gap.

**Interests:**

- Growing its capacity and mandate
- Establishing credibility as a technology assessment body
- Gaining congressional confidence for increasingly complex assignments

**Power**: Growing. STAI has expanded from ~20 staff to ~70 since 2019 and is taking on more ambitious assessments, but remains far smaller than OTA was.

## Secondary Stakeholders

### Research Universities

**Role**: Home to the majority of federally funded researchers; provide expert witnesses, advisory committee members, and OSTP detailees.

**Interests:**

- Stable, evidence-based federal research funding
- Scientific integrity protections that maintain research credibility
- Advisory roles that enhance institutional prestige and influence
- Federal regulatory frameworks informed by university research

**Power**: Significant through associations (AAU, APLU, ACE), individual institutional prestige, and the economic importance of research universities in many congressional districts.

### Scientific Professional Societies

**Role**: Represent disciplinary communities; provide expert witnesses, policy statements, and candidates for advisory positions. Major societies include AAAS, APS, ACS, AGU, and dozens of others.

**Interests:**

- Ensuring government policies are informed by disciplinary expertise
- Protecting members who serve in government from political retaliation
- Maintaining public trust in science
- Adequate federal research investment

**Power**: Moderate. Professional societies command respect as expert voices but lack organized political clout compared to industry lobbies.

### Science Advocacy Organizations

**Role**: Organizations such as the Union of Concerned Scientists, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Research!America advocate for science in policy and monitor government treatment of scientific evidence.

**Interests:**

- Strengthening science advice infrastructure
- Scientific integrity protections
- Adequate research funding
- Public engagement with science

**Power**: Moderate and growing. These organizations have been effective at documenting political interference with science and building public awareness.

### Industry and Regulated Entities

**Role**: Subject to regulations informed by scientific evidence; also source of technical expertise and innovation. Includes pharmaceutical companies, energy companies, chemical manufacturers, technology firms, and agricultural enterprises.

**Interests:**

- Advisory processes that account for economic impacts
- Access to advisory committee membership
- Ability to challenge regulatory science they find unfavorable
- Predictable, stable regulatory environment

**Power**: Very significant. Industries have substantial resources for lobbying, can fund favorable research, and influence advisory committee composition through political contributions and the revolving door.

**Tension**: Industry expertise is often genuinely valuable for policy decisions, but industry financial interests can bias advisory input. The challenge is accessing expertise while managing conflicts of interest.

### State and Local Governments

**Role**: Implement many federal policies; face their own science advice needs; sometimes more advanced than federal government on specific issues.

**Interests:**

- Access to federal scientific expertise and data
- Federal regulations informed by sound evidence
- Science advice structures that account for state implementation challenges
- Capacity building for state-level evidence use

**Power**: Indirect on federal science advice structures, but significant collectively through the National Governors Association and other intergovernmental organizations.

### The General Public

**Role**: Ultimate beneficiary of evidence-based governance; ultimate victim of governance that ignores evidence.

**Interests:**

- Government decisions that protect health, safety, and welfare
- Transparent decision-making that shows how evidence was used
- Confidence that government scientists are free to report findings honestly
- Access to government scientific information

**Power**: Diffuse. The public generally does not mobilize around science advice issues unless a crisis (e.g., pandemic) makes the consequences visible. However, public trust in science affects the political feasibility of evidence-based policy.

## Key Dynamics

### The Awareness Gap

Most stakeholders who would benefit from stronger science advice are unaware of the specific institutional weaknesses. The public supports evidence-based governance in principle but does not engage with the structural details. This creates an opportunity gap: reforms with broad latent support lack the organized advocacy needed to overcome industry and political resistance.

### The Industry Paradox

Industry stakeholders present a paradox: they possess valuable technical expertise that government needs, but their financial interests can bias advisory input. Any reform must address this tension, probably through conflict-of-interest safeguards rather than exclusion.

### The Congressional Self-Interest Problem

Congress would benefit enormously from restored technical capacity (OTA), but individual members may not perceive the benefit, especially if they rely on lobbyist-provided information that supports their existing positions. The collective action problem -- all members benefit from congressional expertise, but no individual member has an incentive to champion it -- has stalled OTA restoration for decades.
