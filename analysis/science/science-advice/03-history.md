# Science Advice: History

## Overview

The relationship between scientific expertise and American governance has evolved through distinct phases: wartime mobilization that demonstrated science's strategic value, Cold War institutionalization that built permanent advisory structures, a period of political backlash that dismantled some of those structures, and ongoing struggles to maintain scientific input against political headwinds. Understanding this history reveals recurring patterns -- science advice structures are built during crises, sustained by champions, and vulnerable to political actors who find expert independence inconvenient.

## Timeline

### Pre-World War II: Ad Hoc Expertise

**1863 -- National Academy of Sciences chartered**: Congress chartered the NAS during the Civil War to "investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art" when called upon by the government. This was the first formal mechanism for scientific advice to the federal government, though it functioned sporadically in practice.

**1884 -- Allison Commission**: Congress investigated the relationship between government and science, debating whether scientific agencies should be consolidated. The commission foreshadowed debates about science advice coordination that continue today.

**1916 -- National Research Council established**: The NAS created the NRC at President Wilson's request to mobilize scientific resources for World War I. This marked the first large-scale attempt to connect the scientific community to national policy.

**1933 -- Science Advisory Board created**: Roosevelt established the first presidential science advisory body, chaired by MIT's Karl Compton. It lasted only two years before political opposition and budget constraints led to its dissolution -- an early demonstration of science advice fragility.

### World War II and the Birth of Modern Science Advising (1940-1950)

**1940-1945 -- OSRD and the Manhattan Project**: The Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), led by Vannevar Bush, demonstrated the transformative power of organized scientific expertise applied to national problems. Radar, penicillin mass production, the proximity fuze, and the atomic bomb established science as a strategic national asset.

**1945 -- *Science, The Endless Frontier***: Bush's landmark report to President Truman argued that government investment in basic research was essential for national security, public health, and economic prosperity. The report laid the intellectual foundation for both the NSF and the principle that government needs ongoing access to independent scientific expertise.

**1946-1950 -- Debate over science organization**: Congress debated how to organize federal science. The Atomic Energy Commission (1946) and the National Science Foundation (1950) were established, but proposals for a powerful central science advisory body were not adopted.

### Cold War Institutionalization (1951-1972)

**1951 -- President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) created**: Truman established PSAC within the Office of Defense Mobilization. Initially focused on military technology, PSAC would become the most influential presidential science advisory body in American history.

**1957 -- Sputnik and the Special Assistant**: The Soviet satellite launch triggered a crisis that led Eisenhower to appoint James Killian as the first Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. Killian had direct Oval Office access and transformed PSAC into a body that could challenge military and intelligence agency assessments with independent technical analysis.

**Key PSAC accomplishments under Eisenhower and Kennedy:**

- Assessed the feasibility of ballistic missile defense (skeptical, saving billions)
- Advised on nuclear test ban treaty verification (enabling diplomatic progress)
- Evaluated the missile gap (debunking inflated threat assessments)
- Recommended major investments in science education after Sputnik
- Provided early warnings about pesticide dangers (supporting Rachel Carson's findings)

**1962 -- Office of Science and Technology established**: Kennedy created OST by executive order to give the science advisor institutional staff support and a formal role in budget review for R&D programs.

**1963 -- Pesticide report**: PSAC's report on pesticide use validated Rachel Carson's *Silent Spring* findings, demonstrating that science advisors could take positions opposed by powerful industries.

**1966 -- National Academy of Engineering chartered**: The NAE was established under the NAS charter to bring engineering expertise into the advisory process.

**1970 -- National Academy of Medicine (then IOM) chartered**: The Institute of Medicine (renamed National Academy of Medicine in 2015) was established to advise on health policy.

**1972 -- Office of Technology Assessment created**: Congress established OTA through the Technology Assessment Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-484) to provide its own independent source of technical analysis, separate from the executive branch.

### Political Backlash and Restructuring (1973-1992)

**1973 -- Nixon abolishes PSAC and OST**: When PSAC members publicly opposed Nixon's anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system and the supersonic transport (SST), Nixon eliminated both PSAC and OST. This was the first major instance of a president dismantling science advisory structures because they produced unwelcome advice. Science advisor Edward David resigned, and the connection between scientific expertise and presidential decision-making was severed.

**1976 -- OSTP established by statute**: Congress responded to the Nixon-era destruction by passing the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-282), creating OSTP as a statutory entity within the Executive Office of the President. The Act was intended to prevent future presidents from simply eliminating science advice. However, it left the president broad discretion over OSTP's organization, staffing, and influence.

**Key features of the 1976 Act:**

- Established OSTP as a permanent office in the EOP
- Required Senate confirmation for the Director
- Defined broad advisory responsibilities
- Did not mandate minimum staffing, budget, or policy influence
- Did not require the president to consult OSTP before decisions

**1985 -- OTA reaches maturity**: By the mid-1980s, OTA had become a respected source of nonpartisan technical analysis, producing roughly 50 in-depth reports per year on topics from missile defense to genetic engineering. Its staff of ~140 and budget of ~$22 million were modest compared to the issues it addressed.

**1986 -- Challenger disaster**: The Rogers Commission investigation revealed failures in NASA's internal science advice process, where engineers' concerns about O-ring performance in cold weather were overridden by management. The disaster underscored the consequences of ignoring technical expertise.

### Erosion and Partial Recovery (1993-2016)

**1995 -- OTA defunded**: The Republican-controlled 104th Congress eliminated OTA's funding as part of budget-cutting efforts led by Speaker Newt Gingrich. The stated rationale was fiscal savings ($22 million/year), but critics noted that OTA had produced reports inconvenient to industry allies. The Congressional Research Service and GAO were expected to fill the gap but lacked OTA's capacity for original, in-depth technology assessment.

**Impact of OTA's loss:**

| Before OTA (pre-1972) | With OTA (1972-1995) | After OTA (1995-present) |
|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Congress dependent on executive branch and lobbyists | Independent, nonpartisan analysis | Return to executive branch and lobbyist dependence |
| Limited technical capacity | 140+ expert staff | CRS has ~70 STEM analysts for all of Congress |
| Ad hoc expert consultation | Systematic technology assessment | GAO STAI team growing but smaller |

**2001 -- PCAST reconstituted under Bush**: George W. Bush reconstituted PCAST, which produced reports on topics including nanotechnology, the hydrogen economy, and cybersecurity. However, critics noted that PCAST membership tilted heavily toward industry representatives.

**2001-2009 -- Scientific integrity controversies**: The George W. Bush administration generated sustained controversy over political interference with science, including:

- Editing of EPA climate reports by White House political appointees
- Suppression of endangered species findings by Interior Department officials
- Stacking of FDA advisory committees with industry-aligned members
- Restrictions on government scientists' ability to communicate findings

The Union of Concerned Scientists documented over 150 instances of political interference, leading to calls for formal scientific integrity policies.

**2009 -- Obama scientific integrity memo**: On his first full day in office, President Obama issued a presidential memorandum directing OSTP to develop government-wide scientific integrity guidelines. The memo stated that "science and the scientific process must inform and guide decisions of my Administration" and that political officials should not "suppress or alter scientific or technological findings."

**2010 -- OSTP Scientific Integrity Guidance**: OSTP Director John Holdren issued a memorandum requiring federal agencies to develop and implement scientific integrity policies, including protections for government scientists and procedures for ensuring scientific findings are not distorted.

**Agency implementation was uneven:**

| Agency | Policy Adopted | Quality Assessment |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| EPA | 2012 | Comprehensive; later tested during deregulatory push |
| NOAA | 2011 | Strong; explicit protections for scientists |
| DOI | 2011 | Initially strong; enforcement weakened 2017-2021 |
| USDA | 2013 | Moderate; enforcement variable |
| HHS/CDC | 2012 | Moderate; COVID-era failures exposed gaps |

### Recent History (2017-2025)

**2017-2021 -- Science advice under strain**: The Trump administration presented the most sustained challenge to science advice structures since the Nixon era:

- OSTP Director position left vacant for two years (longest in history)
- PCAST not constituted until 2019, did not meet until late in term
- Multiple agency science advisory committees disbanded or restaffed
- EPA Science Advisory Board and Board of Scientific Counselors reconstituted to include more industry representatives
- CDC, NOAA, and EPA scientists reported political interference with scientific communications
- COVID-19 pandemic response showed consequences of weakened science advice channels

**2018 -- Evidence Act enacted**: The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (P.L. 115-435) was a bipartisan achievement that created new infrastructure for evidence-based decision-making across the federal government. It required agencies to develop learning agendas, appoint evaluation officers and chief data officers, and improve data accessibility.

**2021-2025 -- Restoration and reform**: The Biden administration took multiple steps to strengthen science advice:

- Elevated OSTP Director to Cabinet rank for the first time
- Reconstituted PCAST with attention to diversity and disciplinary breadth
- Issued comprehensive OSTP scientific integrity framework (2023)
- Directed agencies to update scientific integrity policies
- Expanded use of Evidence Act infrastructure
- Invested in GAO STAI capacity

**2023 -- OSTP Scientific Integrity Framework**: OSTP released a government-wide framework for scientific integrity, representing the most comprehensive attempt to institutionalize protections for science advice across the federal government. The framework addressed evidence-based decision-making, scientific process protections, and reporting mechanisms.

## Recurring Historical Patterns

### Pattern 1: Crisis-Driven Institution Building

Major expansions of science advice capacity have occurred in response to crises:

| Crisis | Institutional Response |
|--------|----------------------|
| World War II | OSRD, NRC mobilization, Manhattan Project |
| Sputnik (1957) | PSAC elevation, Special Assistant for S&T |
| Environmental awakening (1970s) | EPA creation, OTA establishment |
| COVID-19 (2020) | OSTP elevation to Cabinet rank, scientific integrity framework |

### Pattern 2: Political Backlash Against Unwelcome Advice

When science advisors produce findings that conflict with political priorities, advisory structures are vulnerable:

| Episode | Unwelcome Advice | Political Response |
|---------|------------------|--------------------|
| PSAC vs. ABM (1969-1972) | Missile defense technically dubious | Nixon abolishes PSAC and OST |
| OTA vs. industry (1980s-1995) | Reports challenging industry claims | Gingrich defunds OTA |
| EPA/NOAA scientists vs. deregulation (2017-2020) | Climate and pollution findings inconvenient | Advisory committees restaffed, scientists sidelined |

### Pattern 3: Executive Action Is Reversible

Science advice reforms achieved through executive orders and presidential memoranda are inherently temporary:

| Reform | How Achieved | How Reversed |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| PSAC creation | Executive order | Executive order (Nixon) |
| PCAST composition | Executive order | New executive order each administration |
| OSTP Cabinet rank | Presidential decision | Not legally guaranteed |
| Scientific integrity policies | OSTP memoranda | Can be rescinded |

### Pattern 4: Statutory Protections Are Incomplete

Even statutory structures remain vulnerable when legislation leaves implementation details to executive discretion:

| Statute | What It Protects | What It Does Not Protect |
|---------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 1976 OSTP Act | OSTP existence | Staff levels, budget, influence, access |
| FACA | Advisory committee transparency | Committee composition, scope, continuation |
| Evidence Act | Evaluation infrastructure | Use of evidence in actual decisions |

## Lessons for Reform

The historical record suggests that durable science advice reform requires:

1. **Statutory mandates**: Advisory structures created by executive action are reversible; only legislation provides lasting protection
2. **Independent authority**: Advisory bodies must be able to publish findings without prior political review
3. **Congressional capacity**: Congress needs its own technical expertise to evaluate executive branch claims independently
4. **Bipartisan commitment**: Science advice structures survive only when both parties see value in evidence-based governance
5. **Public accountability**: Transparency requirements make it harder to quietly dismantle advisory mechanisms
6. **Cross-branch reinforcement**: Executive advisory bodies, congressional capacity, and independent institutions like the National Academies provide redundancy
