# Science Advice: Solutions

## Overview

Strengthening science advice in American government requires reforms at multiple levels: statutory changes to protect advisory structures from political disruption, institutional innovations to improve the quality and timeliness of scientific input, and cultural shifts to rebuild the expectation that evidence should inform governance. The solutions below are organized by the branch of government they primarily affect.

## Executive Branch Reforms

### Solution 1: Codify OSTP Authority and Minimum Capacity

**Problem addressed**: OSTP's influence, staffing, and budget depend entirely on presidential preference.

**Proposal**: Amend the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to:

- Establish a statutory minimum staff level (no fewer than 80 FTEs)
- Require the OSTP Director to be nominated within 60 days of inauguration and confirmed within the first 6 months
- Mandate that OSTP produce an annual National Science and Technology Strategy, transmitted to Congress
- Require agencies to respond formally to OSTP recommendations within 90 days
- Grant OSTP review authority over agency rulemaking with significant scientific and technical dimensions
- Establish the OSTP Director as a statutory member of the National Security Council and Domestic Policy Council

**Evidence of effectiveness**: Countries with statutorily defined science advisory roles (UK, Germany) show more consistent evidence use across changes in government. The UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser has maintained influence under Conservative, Labour, and coalition governments because the role has institutional backing.

**Implementation**: Requires legislation. Could be included in a broader science policy authorization bill.

### Solution 2: Institutionalize PCAST

**Problem addressed**: PCAST is reconstituted by executive order each administration, with no continuity guarantee.

**Proposal**: Establish PCAST by statute with:

- Fixed 4-year terms for members, staggered so half carry over between administrations
- Minimum membership requirements (no fewer than 20 members)
- Required representation from academia, industry, civil society, and government science
- Diversity mandates covering disciplinary breadth, geographic representation, race, gender, and career stage
- Authority to self-initiate studies (not only respond to presidential requests)
- Requirement to publish findings within 60 days of completion
- Annual public reporting on which recommendations have been adopted and which have not

**Evidence of effectiveness**: Germany's Leopoldina (National Academy) and the UK's Council for Science and Technology maintain influence across government changes because they have institutional permanence and independence.

### Solution 3: Strengthen Agency Chief Scientist Positions

**Problem addressed**: Agency chief scientists vary enormously in authority, access, and institutional support.

**Proposal**: Enact a Federal Chief Scientist Act requiring:

- Every cabinet department and major independent agency to have a Chief Scientist or equivalent
- The Chief Scientist to report directly to the agency head (not through political intermediaries)
- The Chief Scientist to have authority to review agency actions for scientific adequacy before publication
- A "concurrence" or "non-concurrence" mechanism: the Chief Scientist formally documents whether agency decisions are consistent with the best available scientific evidence
- Removal only for cause, with notification to Congress
- Adequate staff and budget for the Chief Scientist's office

**Evidence of effectiveness**: DOD's Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, which has statutory authority and direct reporting relationships, has maintained strong technical capacity across administrations. USDA's Chief Scientist (Under Secretary for REE) has been more effective than EPA's science advisor, largely because of stronger statutory footing.

### Solution 4: Strengthen the Evidence Act

**Problem addressed**: The Evidence Act created infrastructure but did not require that evidence actually inform decisions.

**Proposal**: Amend the Evidence Act to:

- Require evaluation officers to be Senior Executive Service (SES) level or equivalent
- Mandate that agencies explain in writing when major program decisions depart from evaluation findings
- Require OMB to include evidence use metrics in the President's Budget
- Establish an independent Evidence Advisory Board to assess government-wide implementation
- Provide dedicated funding for agency evaluation capacity (not taken from program budgets)
- Create a "comply or explain" framework: agencies must either follow evaluation recommendations or publicly justify why not

**Evidence of effectiveness**: The UK's "What Works" centers and Magenta Book evaluation framework demonstrate that evidence use improves when there are institutional incentives and accountability mechanisms, not just infrastructure.

### Solution 5: Reform Federal Advisory Committees

**Problem addressed**: FACA committees are vulnerable to political stacking, wholesale disbandment, and administrative obstruction.

**Proposal**: Amend FACA to:

- Define "fairly balanced" membership with specific criteria: no more than one-third of members from any single sector (industry, academia, government, civil society)
- Require conflict-of-interest disclosure and recusal procedures for all committee members
- Prohibit wholesale disbandment of committees without individual review and congressional notification
- Streamline the committee creation process to reduce bureaucratic burden
- Require agencies to formally respond to advisory committee recommendations within 180 days
- Create an independent FACA oversight body within GAO

**Evidence of effectiveness**: The EU's framework for expert groups includes specific balance requirements and conflict-of-interest procedures that have maintained advisory quality across changes in European Commission leadership.

## Congressional Reforms

### Solution 6: Restore the Office of Technology Assessment

**Problem addressed**: Congress lacks independent capacity for in-depth technology assessment.

**Proposal**: Reauthorize and fund OTA with modern updates:

- Annual budget of $50-75 million (adjusted for current needs; OTA's 1995 budget was ~$22 million, equivalent to ~$45 million in 2025 dollars)
- Staff of 150-200 technology assessment professionals
- Mandate to produce assessment reports within defined timelines (6-12 months for standard reports, 60-90 days for rapid assessments)
- Bipartisan governance through the existing Technology Assessment Board (6 senators, 6 representatives, evenly divided by party)
- Authority to self-initiate quick-turnaround "tech briefs" on emerging issues
- Public access to all reports
- Digital-era capabilities: data science, AI expertise, cybersecurity assessment, biotechnology review

**Evidence of effectiveness**: OTA produced over 750 reports during its 1972-1995 existence. Studies of OTA's impact found that its assessments saved billions in avoided poor decisions and informed major legislation on topics from acid rain to information technology. The European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network, inspired by OTA, operates successfully in over a dozen European parliaments.

**Status**: Multiple bipartisan bills have been introduced since 2019, including the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment Act. GAO's STAI team was created in 2019 as a partial substitute but has less than half of OTA's peak capacity and a narrower mandate.

### Solution 7: Expand CRS Science and Technology Capacity

**Problem addressed**: CRS has approximately 70 STEM-trained analysts serving all of Congress.

**Proposal**:

- Increase CRS science and technology staff to at least 120 analysts
- Create a dedicated Science, Technology, and Innovation division within CRS
- Authorize CRS to commission short-turnaround studies from the National Academies
- Provide CRS analysts with access to classified materials relevant to technology assessment
- Improve CRS compensation to be competitive with think tanks and agencies

**Evidence of effectiveness**: CRS reports are already widely valued by congressional staff. Expanding STEM capacity would allow CRS to provide the rapid-response technical analysis that an OTA-scale office would complement with deeper studies.

### Solution 8: Congressional Science Fellowship Expansion

**Problem addressed**: Congressional staff lack STEM expertise; average House staffer is 28 years old with limited technical background.

**Proposal**:

- Triple the number of AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellows placed in Congress (currently ~30/year)
- Create a permanent Congressional Science Staff Corps providing multi-year placements
- Require each committee with science-relevant jurisdiction to have at least one PhD-level staff member
- Fund a Science and Technology Extension Service modeled on the agricultural extension system, placing STEM-trained staff in district offices

**Evidence of effectiveness**: AAAS Congressional Fellows report that their presence significantly improves staff capacity to evaluate scientific claims and engage with technical witnesses. Members who have had fellows consistently report high satisfaction.

## Cross-Branch Reforms

### Solution 9: Science Advice Transparency Act

**Problem addressed**: The public and Congress often cannot tell whether scientific evidence was considered in government decisions.

**Proposal**: Require agencies to:

- Publish a "scientific basis" section in all significant regulatory actions identifying the evidence considered
- Disclose when political decisions depart from scientific recommendations, with written justification
- Maintain public logs of advisory committee recommendations and agency responses
- Report annually on scientific integrity complaints and their resolution
- Make all FACA committee deliberations and materials publicly accessible within 30 days

**Evidence of effectiveness**: The EU's "better regulation" framework requires impact assessments that include scientific evidence review. Research shows that transparency requirements improve both the quality of evidence use and public trust in regulatory decisions.

### Solution 10: Emergency Science Advice Protocol

**Problem addressed**: During crises (pandemics, natural disasters, cybersecurity incidents), science advice mechanisms are often too slow or too easily bypassed.

**Proposal**: Establish a statutory Emergency Science Advisory Mechanism:

- Pre-designated roster of scientific experts cleared for rapid activation
- Authority for the OSTP Director to convene an Emergency Science Advisory Panel within 48 hours
- Expedited National Academies rapid-response capability (funded and pre-authorized)
- Requirements that emergency executive actions cite their scientific basis
- Congressional notification when emergency decisions depart from advisory panel recommendations
- Post-crisis review of how well science advice functioned during the emergency

**Evidence of effectiveness**: The UK's SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) provided a formal mechanism for science advice during the COVID-19 pandemic. While not without controversy, SAGE's structure ensured that scientific input was systematically available to decision-makers in ways that the U.S. ad hoc approach did not.
