# Science Advice: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Strengthening science advice in American government requires legislation that addresses two fundamental gaps: the vulnerability of executive branch science advisory structures to political disruption, and the absence of independent congressional technical assessment capacity. This document presents two federal bills -- the Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act (addressing executive branch science advice) and the Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act (restoring and modernizing congressional technology assessment). Together, these bills create a durable, cross-branch framework for evidence-informed governance.

No constitutional amendments are needed for science advice reform. The relevant authorities -- organizing executive advisory structures, establishing legislative branch support offices, and requiring agencies to document evidence use -- fall comfortably within Congress's existing powers under Article I (legislative authority) and Article II (establishing the organizational framework for the executive branch).

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: Codify the authority and independence of executive branch science advisory structures, including OSTP, PCAST, agency chief scientists, and Evidence Act officers, to ensure that scientific expertise consistently informs government decision-making regardless of presidential temperament.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Science Advisory Integrity and
Accountability Act" or the "SAIA Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Office of Science and Technology Policy, established by the
National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities
Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6611 et seq.), plays a critical role in
advising the President and coordinating Federal science and technology
policy.
(2) The effectiveness of OSTP has varied significantly between
administrations due to the absence of statutory requirements for
minimum staffing, timely leadership appointment, or consistent
policy influence.
(3) The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology,
reconstituted by executive order in each administration, lacks the
institutional permanence necessary for sustained, high-quality
advisory function.
(4) Federal agencies vary widely in the authority and independence
of their chief science officers, resulting in inconsistent
integration of scientific evidence into regulatory and policy
decisions.
(5) The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018
(Public Law 115-435) created evaluation infrastructure but did not
require that evidence actually inform agency decisions.
(6) Other democracies, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and
Canada, have established more institutionally robust science advisory
systems with statutory protections for advisory independence.

shall transmit to Congress a report assessing the effectiveness
of the science advisory response.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1 of the fiscal year
following the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** addresses OSTP's structural vulnerability by establishing minimum staffing, timely appointment requirements, an annual strategy mandate, and policy coordination authority. The 80-FTE floor prevents future administrations from hollowing out the office by attrition.
- **Section 5** transforms PCAST from a creature of executive order into a statutory body with staggered terms, diversity requirements, self-initiation authority, and a "respond or explain" mechanism for recommendations.
- **Section 6** creates a government-wide framework for agency chief scientists with real authority -- the concurrence/non-concurrence mechanism ensures that scientific adequacy is documented in the regulatory record even when decision-makers choose to override scientific advice.
- **Section 7** strengthens the Evidence Act by requiring seniority for evaluation officers, creating a "comply or explain" framework, and establishing an independent oversight board.
- **Section 8** institutionalizes emergency science advisory capacity, addressing one of the key lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Executive resistance to OSTP mandates | Framed as supporting, not constraining, the president; NSC/DPC membership increases presidential access to science advice |
| Senate confirmation delays for OSTP Director | Bill requires nomination within 60 days; reporting requirements for extended vacancies create public accountability |
| Agency resistance to Chief Science Officer authority | Non-concurrence mechanism is advisory, not binding; agency heads retain final authority but must explain departures |
| Cost concerns | Total authorization (~$42M/year) is minimal relative to decisions informed; evidence-based governance saves far more |
| Partisan opposition | Bill avoids prescribing policy outcomes; focuses on process and institutional design |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Make Chief Science Officer concurrence binding for environmental and public health regulations
- **Fallback version**: Limit Chief Science Officer requirements to cabinet departments only; make PCAST provisions advisory
- **Compromise version**: Extend nomination timeline to 90 days; reduce PCAST minimum membership to 15

### Bill 2: Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act

**Purpose**: Restore and modernize the Office of Technology Assessment to provide Congress with independent, nonpartisan scientific and technical analysis, closing the capacity gap that has persisted since OTA's defunding in 1995.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Congressional Science and Technology
Assessment Act" or the "CSTA Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Office of Technology Assessment, established by the
Technology Assessment Act of 1972 (2 U.S.C. 471 et seq.), provided
Congress with nonpartisan, expert analysis of complex scientific
and technological issues from 1972 until its defunding in 1995.
(2) Since the defunding of OTA, Congress has lacked dedicated
institutional capacity for in-depth technology assessment, relying
instead on the Congressional Research Service and the Government
Accountability Office, which have different missions and limited
science and technology staff.
(3) The complexity and pace of scientific and technological change
have increased dramatically since 1995, with issues including
artificial intelligence, gene editing, cybersecurity, quantum
computing, climate change, and pandemic preparedness requiring
technical analysis that exceeds Congress's current capacity.
(4) Other legislative bodies, including the European Parliament and
national parliaments in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and
elsewhere, maintain technology assessment offices modeled in part
on OTA.
(5) The Government Accountability Office's Science, Technology
Assessment, and Innovation team, while valuable, has roughly
one-third the capacity needed to fulfill Congress's technology
assessment requirements.
(6) Multiple bipartisan legislative proposals to restore OTA have
been introduced since 2019, reflecting recognition across party
lines that Congress needs enhanced scientific and technical
analytical capacity.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** reestablishes OTA with the bipartisan governance model (6+6+Director) that worked well during OTA's original run. The 6-year Director term provides stability across political cycles.
- **Section 5** defines OTA's functions with a modern portfolio: full assessments for deep dives, technology briefs for mid-range analysis, rapid responses for time-sensitive questions, and horizon scans for anticipatory governance.
- **Section 6** mandates staffing with disciplinary breadth reflecting modern technology challenges (AI, cybersecurity, biotech) while preserving traditional strengths (energy, environment, health).
- **Section 7** ensures quality through mandatory peer review, explicit nonpartisanship requirements, and annual board review.
- **Section 8** provides a phased budget ramp-up, recognizing that building a high-quality analytical organization takes time.
- **Section 9** establishes realistic milestones for becoming operational while ensuring coordination with GAO STAI to avoid duplication.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Congress already has CRS and GAO" | CRS provides short-form analysis; GAO audits programs; neither does in-depth original technology assessment |
| "Too expensive" | $75M/year is 0.001% of the federal budget; a single poorly designed weapons system costs more |
| Partisan opposition to independent analysis | Bipartisan board ensures both parties shape work plan; products present options, not recommendations |
| "OTA was too slow" | New mandate includes rapid response (30-day) and tech brief (60-120 day) products |
| Turf concerns from CRS and GAO | Explicit coordination requirements; complementary rather than competing mandates |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Give OTA subpoena authority for agency information; require agencies to respond formally to OTA findings
- **Fallback version**: Start as a pilot program within GAO with dedicated staff and separate governance
- **Compromise version**: Reduce initial authorization to $40M; start with 100 staff; expand based on performance review after 3 years

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Science Advisory Act

**Purpose**: Establish science advisory infrastructure at the state level, modeled on federal reforms.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Science Advisory Act".

SECTION 2. STATE CHIEF SCIENCE ADVISOR.

(a) The Governor shall appoint a Chief Science Advisor within
180 days of taking office.

(b) The Chief Science Advisor shall--
    (1) hold a doctoral degree or equivalent in a scientific or
    technical field;
    (2) advise the Governor and state agencies on scientific and
    technical matters;
    (3) review proposed regulations with significant scientific
    dimensions; and
    (4) publish an annual State Science and Technology Assessment.

(c) The Chief Science Advisor shall be a nonpartisan position
serving at the pleasure of the Governor but removable only for
cause during the first 3 years of a gubernatorial term.

SECTION 3. STATE EVIDENCE-BASED POLICYMAKING.

(a) Each state agency with an annual budget exceeding
$50,000,000 shall designate an evaluation coordinator.

(b) Evaluation coordinators shall develop annual evaluation
plans identifying priority evidence needs.

(c) Agencies shall publish written explanations when major
program decisions depart from evaluation findings.
```

**Explanation**: This model act creates basic science advisory infrastructure at the state level, adapting federal reforms for state context. States can customize provisions based on their size, budget, and existing institutions.

**Adaptations**: Smaller states may combine the Chief Science Advisor role with existing positions (e.g., state university president). States with strong university systems may rely on university partnerships rather than building new state capacity.

## Regulatory Framework

### OSTP Implementation

**Existing Authority**: The OSTP Director has authority under the 1976 Act to coordinate science and technology policy across agencies.

**Proposed Regulation**: Under the SAIA Act, OSTP would issue a rule establishing:

- Standards for agency Chief Science Officer qualifications and reporting
- Procedures for the concurrence/non-concurrence mechanism
- Templates for annual agency science integrity reports
- Criteria for identifying significant regulatory actions with substantial scientific dimensions
- Emergency Science Advisory Mechanism activation procedures

### OMB Evidence Guidance

**Existing Authority**: OMB Circular A-11 and Evidence Act implementation memoranda.

**Proposed Regulation**: Under Evidence Act enhancements, OMB would issue updated guidance:

- Minimum standards for evaluation officer seniority and resources
- Requirements for "comply or explain" documentation
- Evidence use metrics for budget submissions
- Standards for learning agenda quality

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

Science advice reform operates comfortably within existing constitutional authority:

- Congress's power to organize executive branch offices (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18)
- Congress's power to establish legislative branch support offices (Article I, Section 5)
- The Appointments Clause permits Congress to vest appointment of "inferior Officers" as it chooses (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2)
- The Chief Science Officer provisions raise no separation of powers issues because they are advisory, not binding -- agency heads retain final decision authority

### Preemption Questions

The State Model Legislation does not raise preemption concerns because it creates state infrastructure for state policy decisions. Federal science advice reforms do not preempt state authority to organize their own advisory capacity.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **OSTP reporting requirements**: Congressional oversight committees can compel testimony and documents if reports are not submitted
- **Chief Science Officer protections**: Removal-for-cause provisions enforceable through administrative proceedings and judicial review
- **Evidence Act compliance**: OMB budget review provides administrative enforcement; GAO audits provide congressional oversight
- **OTA operations**: Board governance and annual review ensure accountability; public access requirements enable external scrutiny

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- SAIA Act authorizations run 6 years (FY 2027-2032) with reauthorization required
- CSTA Act authorizations run 6 years with mandatory GAO effectiveness review in year 4
- Evidence Advisory Board issues biennial assessments of government-wide evidence infrastructure
- PCAST annual reporting on recommendation adoption provides ongoing accountability

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Science Advisory Integrity and Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Slow-walking nominations | President nominates unqualified candidates to delay confirmation while technically complying | High |
| Hollow staffing | Meeting 80-FTE minimum with junior staff or non-expert detailees | Medium |
| Pro forma strategy | Annual S&T Strategy becomes a bureaucratic exercise without substantive analysis | Medium |
| Concurrence workaround | Agencies avoid triggering Chief Science Officer review by characterizing actions as non-significant | High |
| Emergency mechanism abuse | Declaring emergencies to bypass standard science advisory procedures | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No enforcement mechanism for PCAST recommendation responses | Presidential administration can ignore recommendations without consequence | Constitutional limits on Congress compelling executive action |
| Chief Science Officer authority is advisory only | Agencies can proceed despite non-concurrence with minimal accountability | Binding authority would raise separation of powers concerns |
| Evidence Act enhancements require ongoing appropriations | Evaluation capacity depends on annual funding decisions | Political vulnerability of evidence infrastructure funding |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Nomination gaming**: Add provision requiring GAO assessment of nominee qualifications against statutory criteria; authorize Senate committee to request alternative nominees
2. **Hollow staffing**: Define minimum qualifications for counted staff (doctoral degree or 10+ years of relevant experience); require annual OSTP workforce report to Congress
3. **Pro forma strategy**: Require strategy to include specific metrics and benchmarks; mandate GAO review of strategy quality every 2 years
4. **Concurrence workaround**: Adopt broad definition of "significant scientific dimensions"; authorize Chief Science Officers to self-identify actions requiring review
5. **Emergency mechanism abuse**: Limit emergency advisory bypass to 90 days; require congressional notification for extensions

### Congressional Science and Technology Assessment Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Board paralysis | Partisan deadlock on bipartisan board prevents approval of work plan | Medium |
| Topic avoidance | Majority party uses board control to avoid assessments on politically sensitive topics | High |
| Defunding by appropriations | Future Congress reduces funding below operational minimum without formal repeal | High |
| Staffing quality erosion | Budget pressure leads to hiring less-qualified staff over time | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No mandate to act on assessments | Congress can commission and ignore OTA reports as it did pre-1995 | Advisory function cannot compel legislative action |
| 6-18 month timeline for full assessments | Many policy decisions are made on shorter timelines | Thoroughness and speed are inherently in tension |
| Potential duplication with GAO STAI | Overlapping mandates could create confusion | Both entities perform technology assessment |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Board paralysis**: Add tiebreaking mechanism (Director votes in case of tie on procedural matters); require minimum work plan approval regardless of political disagreements
2. **Topic avoidance**: Allow ranking members to commission assessments without board approval (up to 25% of Office capacity); authorize Director-initiated horizon scans
3. **Defunding risk**: Establish minimum funding floor tied to legislative branch budget; require supermajority vote for reductions below 75% of authorized level
4. **Staffing quality**: Mandate minimum qualification standards for professional staff; establish fellowship pipeline for talent development
5. **GAO STAI duplication**: Require formal coordination agreement within 1 year of OTA establishment; define complementary roles (OTA for original assessment, GAO STAI for audit-oriented review)

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Political cycling undermines continuity | Staggered terms, statutory mandates, and bipartisan governance structures reduce vulnerability |
| Industry capture of advisory processes | Conflict-of-interest requirements, balanced membership, and public access provisions limit capture |
| Public disengagement from science advice issues | Transparency requirements and annual reporting create accountability even without active public engagement |
| Coordination across numerous new entities | OSTP Annual Strategy provides coordination framework; OTA-GAO STAI agreement prevents duplication |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

Both bills include 6-year authorization periods requiring reauthorization. Additionally:

- GAO shall conduct a comprehensive review of SAIA Act implementation by year 4
- The OTA Board shall commission an independent review of OTA effectiveness by year 4
- The Evidence Advisory Board provides biennial assessments of evidence infrastructure
- Annual congressional oversight hearings on science advice implementation
