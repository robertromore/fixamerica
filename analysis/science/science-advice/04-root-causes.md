# Science Advice: Root Causes

## Overview

The weaknesses in American science advice infrastructure are not accidental. They reflect deep structural features of American governance, political incentives, and cultural attitudes toward expertise. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing reforms that will endure beyond any single administration.

## Structural Causes

### 1. The Unitary Executive and Advisory Vulnerability

The Constitution vests executive power in the president, creating a system where advisory structures exist at the president's pleasure. Unlike parliamentary systems where cabinet-level science ministers have independent institutional standing, American science advisors serve entirely at the will of one person.

**How this causes problems:**

- Presidents can ignore, sideline, or eliminate advisory bodies without legal consequence
- Science advisors who deliver unwelcome advice risk losing access and influence
- The incentive structure rewards telling the president what they want to hear rather than what the evidence shows
- No mechanism exists to ensure continuity between administrations

**International contrast:**

| System | Executive Structure | Science Advice Protection |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| United States | Unitary executive; advisors serve at pleasure | No statutory protection for advisory independence |
| United Kingdom | Cabinet government; departments have permanent secretaries | Government Chief Scientific Adviser role institutionalized across departments |
| Germany | Federal system; ministers have independent standing | National Academy (Leopoldina) has statutory advisory role |
| EU | Commission structure | Group of Chief Scientific Advisors has formal independence framework |

### 2. No Constitutional or Statutory Duty to Consult

There is no legal requirement that the president or Congress consult scientific experts before making decisions with major scientific and technical dimensions. The Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to consider relevant evidence in rulemaking, but this obligation is procedural and applies to agency regulations, not to presidential decisions or legislation.

**Consequences:**

- Presidents can make pandemic response decisions without consulting epidemiologists
- Congress can legislate on AI, gene editing, or cybersecurity without seeking technical assessment
- Agencies can be directed to reach predetermined conclusions regardless of evidence
- The gap between available expertise and actual consultation is enormous

### 3. Congressional Self-Disarmament

Congress has systematically reduced its capacity to independently evaluate scientific and technical claims:

**The OTA defunding:**

- In 1995, Congress eliminated its only dedicated technology assessment office
- The stated rationale -- fiscal savings of $22 million per year -- was trivial relative to the federal budget
- The actual motivation included OTA reports that challenged politically connected industries
- No replacement mechanism was established for 24 years
- GAO's STAI team, created in 2019, has roughly half of OTA's adjusted capacity

**Broader congressional capacity decline:**

- Congressional staff have become younger and less experienced as salaries have stagnated relative to private sector
- Committee staff with deep subject matter expertise have been reduced
- The legislative branch budget has declined as a share of the federal budget
- Members increasingly rely on lobbyists and think tanks for technical information
- CRS, while excellent, cannot produce the kind of original, in-depth assessments OTA did

**The asymmetry this creates:**

```text
    EXECUTIVE BRANCH                    CONGRESS
    ┌────────────────────┐              ┌────────────────────┐
    │ OSTP (~140 staff)  │              │ CRS (~70 STEM)     │
    │ PCAST (~30 members)│              │ GAO STAI (~70)     │
    │ Agency scientists  │              │ No OTA             │
    │ (tens of thousands)│              │ Committee staff    │
    │ National labs      │              │ (limited STEM)     │
    │ FFRDCs             │              │                    │
    └────────────────────┘              └────────────────────┘
           MASSIVE                           MODEST
         CAPACITY                          CAPACITY
```

This asymmetry means Congress cannot independently assess executive branch scientific claims, making legislative oversight of regulatory science and technology policy weak.

### 4. The FACA Framework's Limitations

The Federal Advisory Committee Act (1972) was designed to ensure transparency and balanced representation on advisory committees. In practice, FACA has become both a tool for legitimacy and a vector for manipulation:

**Design flaws:**

- "Fairly balanced" membership is undefined and judicially unenforceable in practice
- The act does not specify how to balance industry, academic, public interest, and government expertise
- Committee creation and renewal involve significant bureaucratic burden, discouraging their use
- Agencies have learned to use "listening sessions" and informal consultations to circumvent FACA requirements

**Political exploitation:**

- Administrations have reinterpreted "balance" to stack committees with industry-friendly members
- Wholesale disbandment of committees has been used to silence advisory input
- Chartering delays can effectively prevent committees from functioning during a presidential term

### 5. Evidence Act Implementation Gaps

The Evidence Act (2018) created important infrastructure but left critical gaps:

**What the Act requires:**

- Evaluation officers, chief data officers, and statistical officials at CFO Act agencies
- Learning agendas identifying priority evidence needs
- Annual evaluation plans
- Open data requirements

**What the Act does not require:**

- That evaluation findings actually influence decisions
- That evaluation officers have seniority, budget, or staff commensurate with their role
- That learning agendas address genuinely important questions rather than easy ones
- That OMB hold agencies accountable for evidence use
- Any consequence for agencies that ignore their own evidence

## Political Causes

### 6. Anti-Expertise Sentiment

Distrust of expert institutions has deep roots in American political culture but has intensified in recent decades:

**Contributing factors:**

- Populist traditions that view expertise as elitism
- Partisan media ecosystems that portray scientific consensus as ideological
- Legitimate grievances about experts being wrong (Iraq WMD intelligence, financial crisis predictions)
- Industry-funded doubt campaigns that deliberately undermine scientific credibility (tobacco, climate, opioids)
- Academic insularity that fails to communicate with non-specialist audiences
- COVID-era controversies that mixed genuine uncertainty with political positioning

**Political incentives:**

- Attacking scientific institutions is low-cost for politicians: scientists lack organized political constituencies
- "Common sense vs. experts" framing resonates with voters who feel excluded from elite institutions
- Science advice reform is not a salient electoral issue, so there is no political reward for championing it

### 7. Short Political Cycles vs. Long Evidence Timelines

Democratic governance operates on 2-4 year electoral cycles. Science advice often requires sustained engagement:

| Activity | Timeline | Political Cycle Mismatch |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| National Academies consensus study | 12-24 months | Results may arrive after the decision is made |
| PCAST formation and first report | 6-12 months | Cuts into administration's policy window |
| Evidence Act learning agenda cycle | 4 years | Coincides with presidential term; reset risk |
| Technology assessment (OTA model) | 12-18 months | Congressional session may end first |
| Long-term research evaluation | 5-20 years | Spans multiple administrations |

This mismatch means politicians face pressure to make decisions before evidence is available, and evidence produced during one administration may not be valued by the next.

### 8. Industry Capture of Advisory Mechanisms

Industries regulated by federal agencies have strong incentives to influence the advisory processes that inform regulation:

**Mechanisms of capture:**

- Lobbying for appointment of industry-aligned advisory committee members
- Funding think tanks that produce industry-favorable "evidence"
- Revolving door between industry and agency advisory positions
- Challenging agency use of independent science through litigation
- Funding congressional campaigns of members who control agency oversight and budgets

**Examples:**

- EPA Science Advisory Board membership shifted toward industry consultants in 2017-2020
- Pharmaceutical industry influence on FDA advisory committee composition and deliberation
- Fossil fuel industry efforts to undermine climate science advisory processes
- Chemical industry challenges to EPA's use of epidemiological studies in risk assessment

### 9. Partisan Asymmetry on Science Advice

While both parties have sometimes ignored scientific evidence when convenient, the parties' institutional positions on science advice have diverged:

- Democratic platforms have generally called for strengthening science advisory capacity
- Republican platforms have generally emphasized reducing government bureaucracy, which science advisory offices are characterized as
- OTA was defunded under Republican leadership; restoration bills have had bipartisan sponsors but face Republican institutional resistance
- Scientific integrity policies adopted under Democratic administrations have been weakened under Republican administrations and vice versa

This asymmetry makes science advice reform vulnerable to partisan cycling rather than cumulative improvement.

## Institutional Causes

### 10. The Honest Broker Problem

Science advisors face a fundamental tension between two roles:

| Role | Requirements | Risk |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Honest broker** | Present evidence objectively; clarify trade-offs without advocating | May be ignored as irrelevant or indecisive |
| **Issue advocate** | Use expertise to advance specific policy outcomes | May lose credibility as objective source |

Most science advice structures try to maintain the honest broker role, but political dynamics pull advisors toward advocacy. When advisors resist political pressure, they risk losing access; when they accommodate it, they risk losing credibility. There is no institutional mechanism to protect advisors who maintain independence.

### 11. Fragmented Federal Science Enterprise

The federal science enterprise is spread across dozens of agencies with different missions, cultures, and relationships to scientific evidence:

- No single entity is responsible for ensuring evidence quality across government
- Agencies have different standards for what counts as adequate scientific basis for decisions
- Coordination mechanisms (OSTP, NSTC) are convening rather than directive
- Budget decisions about science are made through agency-specific appropriations, not a unified science budget

This fragmentation means that science advice reforms must be replicated across many agencies, creating numerous failure points.

### 12. Lack of Public Demand

Unlike some policy areas where organized constituencies demand reform, science advice lacks a natural political base:

- Scientists are not organized as a political constituency
- The public generally does not understand how science advice structures work
- Media coverage of science advice failures is episodic rather than sustained
- No advocacy organizations focus specifically on science advice reform (though groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists address related issues)
- The beneficiaries of good science advice -- the general public -- are diffuse, while the opponents -- industries facing unwelcome evidence -- are concentrated

## Interaction Effects

These root causes interact and reinforce each other:

```text
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Anti-expertise   │────▶│ Political reward │
│ sentiment        │     │ for attacking    │
└────────┬────────┘     │ science advice   │
         │              └────────┬────────┘
         ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Weakened science │────▶│ Worse policy     │

         │                       │
         ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│ Public loses     │────▶│ Trust in         │
│ benefits of      │     │ government       │
│ evidence-based   │     │ declines         │
│ policy           │     │                  │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

Breaking this cycle requires reforms that address structural vulnerabilities, not just individual episodes of political interference.
