# Scientific Integrity: Solutions

## Overview

Strengthening scientific integrity requires coordinated action across five domains: federal oversight, institutional governance, publication standards, whistleblower protection, and research culture. No single intervention is sufficient; the systemic nature of integrity failures demands systemic reform.

## Federal Oversight Reform

### Strengthen and Expand ORI

**Problem**: ORI is chronically underfunded, understaffed, and jurisdictionally limited.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **Increase ORI budget to $50 million**: Commensurate with the scale of research it oversees; current funding of ~$9 million for ~$48 billion in PHS research is grossly inadequate
- **Expand staff to 100+ FTEs**: Including specialized investigators, forensic analysts, and data scientists
- **Grant subpoena power**: Enable ORI to compel production of evidence and testimony from institutions and individuals
- **Establish independent investigation capacity**: Allow ORI to conduct investigations directly when institutional investigations are inadequate or conflicted
- **Create a forensic laboratory**: Dedicated facility for image analysis, data forensics, and document examination

**Evidence**: The Danish Committee on Research Misconduct provides a model of an independent, well-resourced integrity body with binding decision-making authority. Its investigations are faster and more consistent than the U.S. institutional model.

### Create a Unified Federal Research Integrity Office

**Problem**: Jurisdictional fragmentation means that misconduct in DOD, DOE, NASA, and privately funded research often goes uninvestigated.

**Proposed reform:**

- Establish a single Federal Research Integrity Office with jurisdiction over all federally funded research, regardless of funding agency
- Model on the structure of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or the inspectors general system
- Maintain agency-specific expertise through divisional structure
- Coordinate with existing agency OIG offices

**Benefits:**

| Current System | Unified System |
|---------------|---------------|
| ORI covers PHS only; NSF OIG covers NSF only; other agencies have no dedicated integrity body | Single point of accountability for all federally funded research |
| Inconsistent definitions and procedures across agencies | Uniform standards, procedures, and sanctions |
| Gaps in coverage enable misconduct to go undetected | Comprehensive coverage reduces jurisdictional arbitrage |
| Fragmented data prevents pattern detection | Centralized database enables cross-institutional and cross-agency analysis |

### Modernize the Federal Misconduct Definition

**Problem**: The FFP-only definition excludes harmful practices that erode research reliability.

**Options for reform:**

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| Expand FFP definition | Add categories like "misrepresentation" or "obstruction" | Closes gaps; addresses data withholding, conflicts | Risk of overreach; may chill legitimate conduct |
| Create tiered system | FFP as "misconduct"; QRPs as "detrimental research practices" with separate procedures | Addresses spectrum of problems; proportional responses | Complex to implement; definitional challenges |
| Maintain FFP but strengthen QRP policies | Keep narrow definition but mandate institutional policies on QRPs | Politically feasible; preserves consensus | Leaves enforcement to conflicted institutions |

**Recommended approach**: Tiered system that maintains FFP as serious misconduct with severe sanctions while creating a separate framework for questionable research practices with educational and corrective responses.

## Institutional Governance Reform

### Independent Investigation Mechanisms

**Problem**: The self-policing model creates unacceptable conflicts of interest.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **Require external investigators for cases involving senior faculty or large grants**: Institutions should be required to use independent, external investigators when the accused researcher holds a leadership position or manages grants exceeding a specified threshold
- **Create regional research integrity consortia**: Groups of institutions that share investigation resources and provide mutual oversight, similar to institutional review board (IRB) consortia
- **Establish ombudsperson offices**: Independent, confidential resources where researchers can raise concerns before filing formal complaints
- **Mandate investigation timelines**: Set maximum durations for inquiry (60 days) and investigation (180 days) phases, with ORI review triggered by delays

### Research Integrity Officer (RIO) Professionalization

**Problem**: RIO positions are often assigned as secondary duties to administrators with no specialized training.

**Proposed reforms:**

- Require full-time, professionally trained RIOs at all institutions receiving more than $10 million in annual federal research funding
- Establish professional certification for RIOs through a recognized body
- Guarantee RIO independence from institutional leadership (reporting directly to board of trustees, not the provost)
- Provide federal funding for RIO training and professional development

### Institutional Accountability Measures

**Problem**: Institutions face insufficient consequences for failing to investigate or report misconduct.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **Compliance audits**: Random and for-cause audits of institutional compliance with misconduct investigation requirements
- **Transparency reporting**: Annual public reports on the number of allegations received, investigations conducted, and findings made
- **Financial incentives**: Tie a portion of indirect cost recovery to demonstrated compliance with integrity standards
- **Institutional debarment**: Strengthen and apply institutional (not just individual) debarment for systematic failure to investigate

## Whistleblower Protection Reform

### Comprehensive Federal Whistleblower Statute

**Problem**: No federal statute specifically protects research misconduct whistleblowers in the academic or private sectors.

**Proposed legislation:**

- **Coverage**: Protect all individuals who report suspected research misconduct in good faith, including employees, students, fellows, and contractors at any institution receiving federal research funding
- **Protected activity**: Filing a formal complaint, cooperating with investigations, refusing to participate in misconduct, and publicly disclosing misconduct after exhausting internal channels
- **Prohibited retaliation**: Termination, demotion, denial of tenure, reduction of responsibilities, denial of lab space or resources, harassment, and any adverse action taken in response to protected activity
- **Remedies**: Reinstatement, back pay, compensatory damages, attorneys' fees, and injunctive relief
- **Burden shifting**: Once a complainant establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse action
- **Statute of limitations**: Three years from the date of the retaliatory act
- **Anti-SLAPP provision**: Protect whistleblowers from strategic defamation lawsuits filed to silence them

### Whistleblower Support Infrastructure

- **ORI Whistleblower Support Office**: Dedicated unit providing guidance, legal referrals, and psychological support to whistleblowers
- **Legal defense fund**: Federal or foundation-funded legal assistance for whistleblowers facing retaliation or defamation suits
- **Anonymous reporting mechanisms**: Secure, confidential channels for reporting misconduct without immediate identification
- **Career transition support**: Assistance for whistleblowers whose careers are damaged by retaliation

## Publication and Post-Publication Reform

### Mandatory Data and Code Availability

**Problem**: Inability to verify published results enables fraud and prevents error correction.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **Federal mandate**: Require that all publications resulting from federally funded research make underlying data and analysis code available in trusted repositories upon publication
- **Repository infrastructure**: Federal investment in discipline-specific data repositories with long-term preservation guarantees
- **Verification requirements**: Journals should require independent verification of key analyses before publication of high-impact claims
- **Exceptions framework**: Clear, narrow exceptions for privacy-sensitive data (human subjects, classified information) with compensating controls

### Retraction Reform

**Problem**: Retraction processes are slow, opaque, and poorly enforced.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **Standardized retraction notices**: Require detailed, standardized retraction notices that clearly identify whether retraction is due to misconduct, honest error, or other causes
- **Retraction timelines**: Mandate that journals complete retraction decisions within 90 days of receiving evidence of misconduct
- **Central retraction registry**: Federally maintained registry of retracted publications, integrated with major bibliographic databases
- **Citation flagging**: Require citation databases and reference managers to flag retracted papers for all users
- **Author consent not required**: Journals should be empowered to retract papers without author consent when evidence of misconduct is sufficient

### Predatory Journal Countermeasures

**Problem**: Predatory journals contaminate the literature and provide outlets for fraudulent research.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **Federal whitelist**: Establish a list of journals meeting minimum quality standards for counting publications in federal grant applications and career evaluations
- **Accreditation system**: Create a voluntary journal accreditation system based on peer review practices, editorial standards, and transparency
- **Institutional policies**: Require institutions receiving federal funding to adopt policies that do not reward publication in non-accredited journals for hiring, tenure, and promotion
- **Education**: Include predatory journal awareness in all RCR training programs

## Technology and Detection

### Federal Investment in Detection Tools

**Problem**: Detection technology lags behind fraud capabilities; tools are fragmented and underfunded.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **National Research Integrity Technology Center**: Federal investment in developing and deploying AI-based detection tools for image manipulation, data fabrication, plagiarism, and paper mill products
- **Shared screening infrastructure**: Provide detection tools as a shared service available to all journals, institutions, and integrity investigators
- **Training for investigators**: Ensure that institutional investigators and RIOs have access to and training in current detection technologies
- **AI arms race management**: Continuous investment in upgrading detection capabilities to keep pace with AI-generated fraud

### Proactive Screening

**Problem**: Most misconduct is detected only when someone notices and reports it; systematic screening is rare.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **Mandatory image screening**: Require all journals to screen submitted images for manipulation using validated tools
- **Statistical forensics**: Develop and deploy automated statistical tests (e.g., GRIM, SPRITE, Benford's law analysis) for detecting fabricated datasets
- **Cross-database checking**: Create systems to detect duplicate publications, recycled images, and paper mill template patterns across the entire published literature
- **Post-publication monitoring**: Automated monitoring of citation patterns, retraction watch flags, and PubPeer comments for published papers

## Research Culture and Prevention

### Reform Research Evaluation

**Problem**: Metrics-based evaluation incentivizes quantity over quality and creates conditions for misconduct.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **DORA implementation**: Require federal agencies and institutions receiving federal funds to implement the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment
- **Narrative evaluation**: Shift toward narrative assessment of research contributions, replacing or supplementing quantitative metrics
- **Quality indicators**: Develop and adopt indicators that measure research quality, rigor, and reproducibility alongside or instead of volume metrics
- **Slow science recognition**: Create funding mechanisms and career rewards that support careful, reproducible research rather than rapid publication

### Strengthen Research Integrity Education

**Problem**: Current RCR training is widely regarded as perfunctory and ineffective.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **Case-based, mentor-led training**: Replace or supplement online compliance modules with facilitated, case-based discussions integrated into laboratory meetings and departmental seminars
- **Ongoing training requirement**: Move from one-time training to ongoing professional development throughout a research career
- **Mentorship training**: Require principal investigators to receive training in ethical mentorship, including their responsibilities for integrity within their laboratories
- **International researcher orientation**: Tailored integrity education for international students and postdocs that addresses cross-cultural differences in research norms

### Address Power Dynamics

**Problem**: Hierarchical laboratory culture makes it difficult for trainees to report misconduct by supervisors.

**Proposed reforms:**

- **Independent thesis committees**: Strengthen the role of thesis and advisory committees as independent oversight of laboratory practices
- **Exit interviews**: Conduct confidential exit interviews with departing laboratory members, asking about laboratory culture and integrity
- **Multiple mentoring**: Encourage or require trainees to have mentoring relationships with multiple faculty members, reducing dependence on a single advisor
- **Laboratory culture assessments**: Periodic anonymous surveys of laboratory climate and culture, with results reviewed by departmental leadership
