# Scientific Integrity: Citizen Actions

## Overview

While scientific integrity reform requires federal legislation and institutional change, individuals at every level can take meaningful actions to strengthen research honesty and accountability. This guide provides concrete steps for citizens, researchers, students, and advocates.

## For All Citizens

### Stay Informed

- **Follow Retraction Watch**: Subscribe to Retraction Watch (<https://retractionwatch.com/>) for accessible coverage of misconduct cases and integrity issues
- **Understand how science works**: Learn the basics of peer review, replication, and how research misconduct differs from honest scientific disagreement
- **Be skeptical of sensationalized claims**: When a single study makes dramatic claims, check whether results have been replicated and whether the study has been scrutinized by independent experts
- **Distinguish integrity failures from anti-science narratives**: Misconduct exists, but the existence of some fraud does not invalidate the entire scientific enterprise; be wary of those who exploit integrity concerns to undermine evidence-based policy

### Contact Elected Officials

- **Support funding for ORI**: Contact your congressional representatives to advocate for increased appropriations for the Office of Research Integrity
- **Support whistleblower protection legislation**: Ask representatives to cosponsor legislation protecting research misconduct whistleblowers
- **Respond to oversight hearings**: When congressional committees hold hearings on research integrity, submit public comments and contact committee members
- **Support research funding stability**: Advocate for stable, adequate research funding that reduces the hypercompetitive pressures driving misconduct

**Key contacts:**

### Support Integrity Organizations

- **Donate to Retraction Watch**: The Retraction Watch project operates on limited funding and relies on donations
- **Support the Center for Open Science**: Contribute to organizations advancing transparency and reproducibility
- **Advocate for research integrity reform**: Join or support organizations like the Government Accountability Project that protect whistleblowers
- **Engage with local research institutions**: Attend public lectures, open houses, and advisory board meetings at universities in your area

## For Researchers

### Practice Research Integrity

- **Preregister studies**: Register hypotheses, methods, and analysis plans before data collection using the Open Science Framework or discipline-specific registries
- **Share data and code**: Make data and analysis code publicly available upon publication; use trusted repositories (Dryad, Zenodo, Figshare, or discipline-specific alternatives)
- **Use transparent reporting standards**: Follow reporting guidelines such as CONSORT (clinical trials), PRISMA (systematic reviews), or ARRIVE (animal research)
- **Disclose conflicts of interest fully**: Report all financial and non-financial conflicts in publications, grant applications, and presentations
- **Document methods rigorously**: Maintain detailed laboratory notebooks and electronic records that would allow independent replication
- **Correct errors promptly**: When you discover errors in your published work, pursue corrections or retractions immediately

### Report Suspected Misconduct

- **Know your institutional process**: Familiarize yourself with your institution's policies for reporting suspected misconduct, including the identity and contact information of your Research Integrity Officer (RIO)
- **Document everything**: Before filing a complaint, gather and preserve evidence including emails, lab notebooks, data files, and images; store copies securely outside institutional systems
- **Consider consulting counsel**: Before filing a formal complaint, consult with an attorney familiar with research misconduct cases; some legal aid organizations provide free consultations
- **Use available channels**: If institutional channels are inadequate or conflicted, consider reporting directly to the relevant federal agency (ORI for PHS-funded research, NSF OIG for NSF-funded research)
- **Know your rights**: Understand whatever protections exist in your jurisdiction; document any retaliatory actions taken against you

### Contribute to Post-Publication Review

- **Comment on PubPeer**: Post constructive, evidence-based comments on published papers where you identify potential problems
- **Review for quality**: When reviewing manuscripts for journals, check data integrity, image quality, and statistical analyses, not just scientific logic
- **Support open peer review**: Participate in open peer review experiments and advocate for transparency in the review process
- **Replicate key findings**: Dedicate time to replicating important findings in your field; publish replication results regardless of outcome

### Mentoring and Culture

- **Model integrity**: Demonstrate honest practices in your own work; discuss integrity openly with trainees
- **Create safe reporting environments**: Make clear to students and staff that reporting concerns is valued and protected
- **Provide genuine mentoring**: Invest time in training rather than treating trainees as labor; teach responsible research practices by example
- **Evaluate quality, not quantity**: In hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions within your influence, advocate for assessment of research quality and rigor over publication volume

## For Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Researchers

### Protect Yourself

- **Keep independent records**: Maintain personal copies of your data, analysis code, and laboratory notebooks; do not rely solely on lab-owned systems
- **Know your rights**: Understand your institution's policies on authorship, data ownership, and misconduct reporting
- **Build diverse mentoring relationships**: Do not rely on a single advisor; cultivate relationships with multiple faculty who can provide guidance and support
- **Document interactions**: Keep records of important conversations, instructions, and requests, particularly if they raise integrity concerns

### Respond to Concerns

- **Trust your instincts**: If something seems wrong -- data that looks too clean, results that appear before experiments are complete, instructions to selectively report -- take the concern seriously
- **Seek confidential advice**: Before filing a formal complaint, consult with a trusted faculty member outside your laboratory, your institution's ombudsperson, or a professional organization
- **Understand the risks**: Recognize that reporting misconduct by an advisor carries significant career risk; make an informed decision about how to proceed and seek legal advice if possible
- **Support peers**: If a colleague is concerned about integrity in their laboratory, provide emotional support and help them access resources

### Build Skills

- **Take RCR training seriously**: Even if institutional training programs are imperfect, engage with the material and seek out supplementary resources
- **Learn statistical methods**: Understanding statistics deeply helps you recognize questionable practices like p-hacking and selective reporting
- **Learn data management**: Proper data management practices protect both integrity and your own work
- **Attend integrity workshops**: Many professional conferences include integrity workshops and panels; attend and participate

## For Journal Editors and Reviewers

### Strengthen Review Practices

- **Screen images**: Use available tools to check submitted images for manipulation
- **Request raw data**: Ask authors to provide underlying data for key figures and tables
- **Check statistics**: Verify that reported statistics are internally consistent
- **Watch for paper mill indicators**: Be alert to tortured phrases, formulaic structure, suspiciously smooth data, and mismatched affiliations

### Handle Allegations Responsibly

- **Follow COPE guidelines**: Use COPE flowcharts for handling suspected misconduct
- **Act promptly**: Do not delay investigation of credible allegations
- **Protect complainants**: Keep the identity of those who raise concerns confidential
- **Issue clear retraction notices**: When retracting papers, provide specific, detailed explanations

## For Institutional Administrators

### Strengthen Institutional Infrastructure

- **Fund the RIO office adequately**: Ensure that your Research Integrity Officer has sufficient time, training, and resources
- **Guarantee RIO independence**: Ensure that the RIO can investigate freely without interference from administrators who might have conflicting interests
- **Train investigators**: Provide regular training for members of investigation committees
- **Set investigation timelines**: Establish and enforce maximum timelines for inquiry and investigation phases

### Protect Whistleblowers

- **Adopt strong anti-retaliation policies**: Go beyond minimum federal requirements
- **Monitor for retaliation**: Proactively check on the status of complainants during and after investigations
- **Provide support**: Offer confidential counseling and, where appropriate, legal guidance to those who report concerns
- **Hold retaliators accountable**: Treat retaliation against whistleblowers as a serious disciplinary matter

### Foster Integrity Culture

- **Reform evaluation criteria**: Reduce reliance on publication volume and journal prestige in hiring, tenure, and promotion
- **Reward transparency**: Recognize and reward researchers who share data, preregister studies, and publish null results
- **Conduct exit interviews**: Ask departing laboratory members about research culture and integrity
- **Assess laboratory climate**: Use anonymous surveys to monitor research culture across departments

## Advocacy Campaigns

### Campaign 1: Pass the Research Integrity Whistleblower Protection Act

**Objective**: Enact federal legislation providing comprehensive protections for research misconduct whistleblowers.
