# Scientific Integrity: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap sequences reforms across three phases, balancing urgency with political feasibility. The strategy prioritizes foundational reforms (whistleblower protection, ORI strengthening) that enable subsequent structural changes (institutional governance reform, evaluation reform). Each phase builds on the preceding one.

## Phase 1: Immediate Priorities (Years 1-2)

### 1.1 Enact Federal Research Integrity Whistleblower Protection Act
