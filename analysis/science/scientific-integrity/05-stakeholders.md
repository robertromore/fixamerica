# Scientific Integrity: Stakeholders

## Overview

Scientific integrity involves a complex web of stakeholders with often competing interests. Understanding who is affected by integrity failures, who has power to drive reform, and who benefits from the status quo is essential for designing effective policy interventions.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Researchers

**Role**: Producers of scientific knowledge; both potential perpetrators and victims of misconduct.

**Key interests:**

- Career advancement and professional recognition
- Fair evaluation based on research quality, not just quantity
- Protection from false accusations
- Due process in misconduct investigations
- Freedom to pursue novel and risky research without fear of career consequences for honest failures

**Internal divisions:**

| Group | Specific Interest | Integrity Relationship |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Principal investigators | Maintaining laboratory funding, reputation | May face pressure to produce results; may supervise misconduct unknowingly or knowingly |
| Junior faculty | Achieving tenure | Most intense publication pressure; limited power to challenge norms |
| Postdoctoral researchers | Securing permanent positions | Extremely vulnerable to advisor misconduct; most likely to witness problems |
| Graduate students | Degree completion, career launch | Dependent on advisors; most vulnerable to retaliation |
| Research staff/technicians | Job security | May be pressured to produce specific results; often overlooked in protections |
| Emeritus/senior faculty | Legacy and reputation | May resist oversight seen as challenging established careers |

**Estimated population**: ~300,000 federally funded researchers in the U.S.; ~1.5 million total research workforce

### The Public

**Role**: Ultimate funders of publicly supported research through taxes; consumers of research-informed products, treatments, and policies.

**Key interests:**

- Reliable scientific findings that inform health decisions, public policy, and technology
- Responsible stewardship of taxpayer investments in research
- Trust that the scientific enterprise is honest and accountable
- Access to accurate information about research quality and integrity

**Impact of integrity failures:**

- Fraudulent clinical research can lead to harmful medical treatments
- Fabricated environmental data can distort public health and environmental policy
- Erosion of public trust in science fuels anti-science movements and vaccine hesitancy
- Wasted research funding represents lost opportunity for genuine discovery

### Patients and Research Subjects

**Role**: Individuals who participate in clinical trials and whose treatment decisions are informed by published research.

**Key interests:**

- Safety in clinical trials based on honest preclinical data
- Treatment decisions guided by reliable evidence
- Assurance that risks undertaken in research participation are justified by valid science
- Informed consent based on accurate information

**Vulnerability**: Patients and subjects are among the most directly harmed by research misconduct. Fabricated preclinical data can lead to clinical trials that expose patients to risks without genuine scientific justification. Fraudulent clinical trial data can lead to approval of ineffective or dangerous treatments.

## Institutional Stakeholders

### Research Universities

**Role**: Primary employers of academic researchers; conduct the majority of federally funded basic research; responsible for initial investigation of misconduct allegations.

**Key interests:**

- Institutional reputation and prestige rankings
- Federal grant revenue (including indirect cost recovery, typically 50-65% of direct costs)
- Faculty recruitment and retention
- Minimizing legal liability from both misconduct and from wrongful accusation claims
- Compliance with federal regulations to maintain eligibility for funding

**Conflict of interest**: Universities face a fundamental tension between their role as integrity enforcers and their financial and reputational interests in minimizing misconduct findings.

**Estimated number**: ~900 doctorate-granting institutions; ~130 R1 (very high research activity) universities

### Scientific Journals and Publishers

**Role**: Gatekeepers of the published scientific record through peer review; responsible for retracting or correcting flawed publications.

**Key interests:**

- Revenue from subscriptions or article processing charges
- Prestige and impact factor (for journals)
- Publication volume (for publishers)
- Reputation for rigorous peer review
- Avoiding legal liability for publishing fraudulent work

| Publisher Type | Revenue Model | Integrity Incentive | Integrity Disincentive |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Subscription journals | Reader-pays | Reputation protection | Retractions damage prestige |
| Open-access journals | Author-pays (APCs) | Reputation protection | More papers = more revenue |
| Mega-journals | Author-pays, high volume | Economies of scale for screening | Volume makes thorough review difficult |
| Predatory journals | Author-pays, minimal review | None meaningful | Revenue maximized by accepting everything |

**Major publishers**: Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, SAGE, MDPI, PLOS, Frontiers

### Professional Societies

**Role**: Set standards for research conduct within specific disciplines; publish major journals; organize conferences; influence policy.

**Key interests:**

- Maintaining disciplinary standards and reputation
- Serving member interests (which may conflict with strict enforcement)
- Influencing federal policy on research funding and regulation
- Journal revenue

**Key organizations**: American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), disciplinary societies (ACS, APS, ASM, etc.)

## Government Stakeholders

### Office of Research Integrity (ORI)

**Role**: Primary federal oversight body for research misconduct in PHS-funded research.

**Key interests:**

- Effective enforcement of research misconduct policies
- Maintaining institutional compliance
- Prevention through education and training
- Adequate resources to fulfill its mandate

**Constraints**: Limited budget, no subpoena power, dependence on institutional cooperation, narrow jurisdictional scope.

### National Science Foundation Office of Inspector General (NSF OIG)

**Role**: Investigates misconduct in NSF-funded research; conducts its own investigations rather than relying primarily on institutions.

**Key interests:**

- Protecting the integrity of NSF-funded research
- Deterring misconduct through investigation and sanctions
- Coordinating with ORI on cross-agency cases

### Congressional Oversight Committees

**Role**: Legislative authority over research funding and integrity policy; conduct oversight hearings.

**Key interests:**

- Responsible stewardship of taxpayer research investments
- Responding to constituent concerns about waste and fraud
- Advancing legislative agendas (which may be bipartisan or partisan)
- Oversight of federal agencies

**Key committees**: House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology; Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; Senate HELP Committee; House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees

### Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)

**Role**: Advises the President on science policy; issues government-wide policy frameworks for research integrity.

**Key interests:**

- Ensuring scientific integrity across all federal agencies
- Protecting government scientists from political interference
- Coordinating interagency approaches to research integrity

### Department of Justice (DOJ)

**Role**: Prosecutes criminal fraud involving federal grant funds; handles False Claims Act cases.

**Key interests:**

- Recovering fraudulently obtained federal funds
- Deterring grant fraud through criminal prosecution
- Managing limited prosecutorial resources

## Independent Actors

### Whistleblowers

**Role**: Individuals who report suspected misconduct; the primary detection mechanism for research fraud.

**Key interests:**

- Protection from retaliation
- Assurance that their allegations will be investigated fairly and thoroughly
- Resolution within a reasonable timeframe
- Recognition that reporting misconduct serves the public interest

**Vulnerability**: Whistleblowers are consistently the most disadvantaged stakeholders in the research integrity system. They face:

- Career damage (termination, denial of tenure, blacklisting)
- Social ostracism from colleagues
- Legal threats from accused researchers
- Psychological harm from prolonged investigations
- Financial costs of legal representation
- Minimal legal protections in most jurisdictions

### Independent Integrity Investigators

**Role**: Individuals and organizations that investigate suspected misconduct outside official channels.

**Key examples:**

- **Elisabeth Bik**: Image forensics investigator; has screened tens of thousands of papers
- **Retraction Watch**: Tracks and publicizes retractions
- **PubPeer**: Platform for anonymous post-publication review and misconduct reporting
- **Data Colada**: Blog that has exposed misconduct in behavioral science
- **For Better Science (Leonid Schneider)**: Investigative reporting on research fraud
- **Smut Clyde and Tiger BB8**: Pseudonymous investigators who have identified thousands of paper mill products

**Key interests:**

- Access to published data and images for analysis
- Protection from legal threats (anti-SLAPP protections)
- Recognition of the value of independent oversight
- Integration of independent findings into formal investigation processes

### Patients and the General Public

**Role**: Ultimate beneficiaries of honest research; bear the costs of integrity failures.

**Key interests:**

- Reliable scientific evidence for medical, environmental, and technological decisions
- Accountability for misuse of public research funds
- Transparent communication about the reliability of published findings
