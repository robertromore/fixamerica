# Scientific Integrity: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

The legislative framework for scientific integrity in the United States is fragmented and inadequate. The current system relies primarily on administrative regulations (42 C.F.R. Part 93 for PHS-funded research) and agency-specific policies rather than comprehensive legislation. This document proposes two federal bills to address the most critical gaps: whistleblower protection for those reporting research misconduct, and modernization of the federal research integrity infrastructure.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Research Integrity Whistleblower Protection Act

**Purpose**: To provide comprehensive legal protections for individuals who report suspected research misconduct in federally funded research, and to establish a support infrastructure for whistleblowers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Research Integrity Whistleblower
Protection Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
    (1) Federally funded research represents an annual investment of
        more than $200,000,000,000 in taxpayer funds.
    (2) Research misconduct, including fabrication, falsification,
        and plagiarism, wastes public resources, misdirects
        subsequent research, and can endanger public health and
        safety.
    (3) Whistleblowers who report suspected misconduct are the
        primary mechanism by which research fraud is detected.
    (4) Existing legal protections for research misconduct
        whistleblowers are inadequate, resulting in retaliation
        against the majority of those who report misconduct.
    (5) Fear of retaliation deters reporting and enables misconduct
        to persist undetected.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to—
    (1) protect individuals who report suspected research
        misconduct from retaliation;
    (2) establish remedies for those who experience retaliation;
    (3) create support infrastructure for whistleblowers; and
    (4) strengthen the detection and correction of research fraud
        in federally funded research.

            person from engaging in protected activity.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—No covered institution, and no officer, employee,
    or agent of a covered institution, shall retaliate against a
    covered individual who engages in protected activity.
(b) GOOD FAITH REQUIREMENT.—The protections of this Act apply to
    covered individuals who engage in protected activity in good
    faith. A covered individual acts in good faith if the individual
    reasonably believes that the information disclosed or the
    complaint filed relates to research misconduct, even if
    subsequent investigation does not confirm the allegation.

SEC. 5. REMEDIES.

(a) ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT.—A covered individual who believes
    that he or she has been subjected to retaliation in violation
    of section 4 may file a complaint with the Office of Research
    Integrity or its successor office not later than 3 years after
    the date on which the retaliatory act occurred.
(b) INVESTIGATION AND DETERMINATION.—The Office of Research
    Integrity shall investigate each complaint filed under
    subsection (a) and issue a written determination not later
    than 180 days after the date on which the complaint is filed.

    (1) PRIMA FACIE CASE.—A covered individual establishes a prima
        facie case of retaliation by demonstrating that—
        (A) the individual engaged in protected activity;
        (B) the individual suffered an adverse action; and
        (C) the protected activity was a contributing factor in the
            adverse action.
    (2) BURDEN SHIFTING.—Once a prima facie case is established,
        the burden shifts to the covered institution to demonstrate
        by clear and convincing evidence that the institution would
        have taken the same adverse action in the absence of the
        protected activity.
(d) RELIEF.—If the Office of Research Integrity determines that
    retaliation has occurred, the Office may order any or all of
    the following:
    (1) Reinstatement to the position held before the retaliation,
        or to an equivalent position.
    (2) Back pay with interest.
    (3) Compensatory damages, including damages for emotional
        distress.
    (4) Reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
    (5) Injunctive relief to prevent further retaliation.
    (6) Other relief necessary to make the covered individual whole.
(e) CIVIL ACTION.—If the Office of Research Integrity has not
    issued a determination within 180 days, or if the covered
    individual is dissatisfied with the determination, the
    individual may bring a civil action in the appropriate United
    States district court.

    action is filed based on the covered individual's protected
    activity may file a special motion to dismiss the action.
(b) STAY OF DISCOVERY.—Upon the filing of a special motion under
    subsection (a), all discovery in the action shall be stayed
    pending a ruling on the motion.
(c) STANDARD.—The court shall grant the special motion unless the
    party filing the action demonstrates that the claim is likely
    to succeed on the merits and is not based on the covered
    individual's protected activity.
(d) FEES AND COSTS.—If the court grants the special motion to
    dismiss, the court shall award the covered individual
    reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

SEC. 7. WHISTLEBLOWER SUPPORT OFFICE.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
    establish within the Office of Research Integrity a
    Whistleblower Support Office to—
    (1) provide guidance to individuals considering filing

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3** provides broad definitions that cover the full range of individuals who may witness misconduct, including graduate students and visiting researchers who are often most vulnerable
- **Section 4** establishes a clear prohibition on retaliation with a good-faith standard that protects whistleblowers even when allegations are not ultimately sustained
- **Section 5** creates both administrative and judicial remedies with a burden-shifting framework modeled on employment discrimination law
- **Section 6** addresses the growing threat of defamation lawsuits against whistleblowers by providing anti-SLAPP protections at the federal level
- **Section 7** creates institutional support for whistleblowers, including a legal defense fund to address the financial asymmetry between individual whistleblowers and institutions or accused researchers
- **Section 8** requires institutions to implement anti-retaliation policies and report on compliance

**Potential Challenges**:

- University lobbying associations (AAU, APLU) will likely oppose the burden-shifting framework and mandatory reporting requirements
- Some scientists may argue that broad whistleblower protections will encourage frivolous complaints
- The anti-SLAPP provision may face constitutional challenges in some circuits
- Appropriations for the legal defense fund may face budget constraints

**Refinements**:

- Consider adding a confidential ombudsperson requirement for institutions as an intermediate step before formal complaints
- Include provisions for interim protection (e.g., temporary restraining orders) to prevent retaliation while complaints are pending
- Add a sunset provision with mandatory reauthorization to allow for adjustments based on implementation experience
- Consider establishing a specific standard for "good faith" that provides clearer guidance to courts and institutions

        underfunded, with a budget of approximately $9,000,000 to
        oversee approximately $48,000,000,000 in Public Health
        Service-funded research.
    (4) Emerging threats including paper mills, AI-generated
        fraud, and image manipulation require new detection
        capabilities.
    (5) Institutional investigation of research misconduct is
        compromised by conflicts of interest, inconsistent
        procedures, and inadequate resources.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to—
    (1) strengthen and modernize the federal research integrity
        infrastructure;
    (2) create uniform standards for investigating research
        misconduct across all federally funded research;
    (3) invest in technology for detecting research fraud;

that sections 6, 9, 10, and 11 shall take effect 1 year after
the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** creates a unified office with jurisdiction over all federally funded research, eliminating the current fragmentation where ORI covers only PHS-funded research and other agencies have no dedicated integrity oversight
- **Section 4(b)** provides the Director with a fixed term and removal only for cause, ensuring independence from political pressure
- **Section 4(d)** grants critical authorities currently lacking, including subpoena power and independent investigation capacity
- **Section 5** ensures broad stakeholder input through an advisory board that includes whistleblower representatives
- **Section 6** establishes firm timelines to address the chronic delays that plague current investigations, while preserving due process protections for the accused
- **Section 7** creates dedicated infrastructure for fraud detection technology, addressing the growing threat of paper mills and AI-generated fraud
- **Section 8** initiates a careful, evidence-based process for modernizing the misconduct definition, avoiding the political pitfalls that derailed previous efforts
- **Section 9** creates an audit program to hold institutions accountable for their investigation obligations
- **Section 10** professionalizes the RIO role and guarantees independence from conflicted administrators

**Potential Challenges**:

- The broad jurisdictional scope may face opposition from agencies (particularly DOD and DOE) that prefer to handle misconduct internally
- The subpoena power provision may face constitutional objections in the context of academic institutions
- The $50 million authorization may face appropriations resistance in a constrained budget environment
- The institutional audit program may be characterized as burdensome government overreach by university lobbying associations
- The fixed-term Director with for-cause removal may face Senate confirmation challenges

**Refinements**:

- Consider phased jurisdictional expansion, beginning with PHS and NSF and adding other agencies over 3-5 years
- Include safe harbor provisions for institutions that self-report misconduct discoveries promptly and cooperatively
- Add provisions for memoranda of understanding with agency OIGs to clarify respective roles
- Consider establishing the office as an independent agency rather than within HHS to further ensure independence
- Add provisions for international cooperation agreements

## Regulatory Framework

### ORI Regulation Modernization

**Existing Authority**: 42 C.F.R. Part 93

**Proposed Regulatory Updates**:

- Require external investigators for cases involving researchers with grants exceeding $2 million or who hold institutional leadership positions
- Establish minimum qualifications and training requirements for members of institutional investigation committees
- Mandate sequestration and preservation of research data and materials upon receipt of an allegation
- Require institutions to provide interim protections for complainants during investigations
- Establish reporting requirements for the disposition of retraction requests arising from misconduct findings

### Data Sharing Regulation

**Existing Authority**: NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy (2023)

**Proposed Expansion**:

- Extend data and code sharing requirements to all federally funded research through OSTP guidance
- Establish minimum metadata standards for shared datasets
- Require journals to verify data availability as a condition of publishing federally funded research
- Create exception frameworks for classified, privacy-sensitive, and proprietary data

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Academic freedom**: Integrity enforcement must be carefully designed to avoid chilling legitimate scientific inquiry; the distinction between misconduct and honest error must be maintained
- **Due process**: The proposed legislation includes robust due process protections (notice, opportunity to respond, counsel, appeal) to withstand Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment challenges
- **First Amendment**: Anti-SLAPP provisions and whistleblower protections implicate First Amendment rights; courts have generally upheld such provisions when narrowly tailored
- **Spending Clause**: Federal conditions on research funding (institutional accountability measures) must be clearly stated and germane to the funding purpose

### Preemption Questions

- The proposed legislation does not preempt stronger state whistleblower protections
- State-level tort claims (defamation, wrongful termination) remain available as supplementary remedies
- The unified federal office would preempt inconsistent agency-specific misconduct procedures, creating a uniform national standard

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- Administrative sanctions (debarment, funding conditions) enforced by the Office
- Civil remedies for whistleblower retaliation enforced through federal courts
- Criminal referrals to DOJ for cases involving grant fraud (18 U.S.C. Section 1001, 31 U.S.C. Sections 3729-3733)
- Institutional compliance enforced through audit program and funding conditions

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Research Integrity Whistleblower Protection Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Constructive retaliation | Institutions may use subtle, hard-to-prove methods (social ostracism, letter of recommendation sabotage) that do not meet the statutory definition | High |
| Good faith manipulation | Institutions may argue that whistleblowers did not act in "good faith" to deny protections | Medium |
| Jurisdictional avoidance | Moving accused researchers to non-federally-funded positions to place misconduct outside federal jurisdiction | Medium |
| Statute of limitations gaming | Institutions may delay retaliatory actions to fall outside the 3-year limitation period | Medium |
| Contractor classification | Classifying researchers as independent contractors rather than employees to argue they are not covered | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No protection for privately funded research | Significant and growing segment of research enterprise excluded | Constitutional limits on federal authority |
| Reliance on individual initiative | Whistleblowers must still bear the burden of initiating complaints despite protections | Structural limitation of complaint-driven systems |
| Resource asymmetry persists | Even with legal defense fund, institutions have vastly greater resources | Inherent power imbalance between individuals and institutions |
| Cultural change not legislated | Legal protections do not address the cultural stigma attached to whistleblowing | Laws change behavior but not attitudes |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Add "constructive retaliation" to the definition of retaliation, covering patterns of subtle adverse actions that collectively constitute retaliation
2. Establish a rebuttable presumption of good faith for any complaint filed with an institutional RIO or federal agency
3. Extend protections to researchers who move between federally and non-federally funded positions within a covered institution
4. Provide that the statute of limitations is tolled during any period in which the retaliatory nature of an action was concealed
5. Define "covered individual" to include independent contractors performing research at covered institutions

### Federal Research Integrity Modernization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Institutional investigation capture | Institutions may comply formally with timelines while conducting superficial investigations | High |
| Definition stalling | The NASEM study and subsequent rulemaking process could be indefinitely delayed | Medium |
| Audit gaming | Institutions may prepare for audits without maintaining year-round compliance | Medium |
| Agency resistance | DOD, DOE, and other agencies may resist jurisdictional transfer through interagency negotiation | High |
| RIO independence circumvention | Institutions may technically comply with reporting requirements while undermining RIO authority informally | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Incentive structure unchanged | Legislation does not directly reform publish-or-perish incentives that drive misconduct | Beyond scope of integrity enforcement |
| International gap | No authority over misconduct in international collaborations outside U.S. institutions | Sovereignty limitations |
| Paper mill enforcement gap | No criminal enforcement mechanism specifically targeting paper mill operators | Cross-border criminal jurisdiction challenges |
| Detection technology lag | Authorized funding may not keep pace with rapidly evolving AI capabilities | Technology moves faster than government procurement |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require institutional investigations to address specific evidentiary standards and methodology requirements, not just timelines
2. Include a mandatory deadline for the NASEM study (2 years) and subsequent rulemaking (1 year), with fallback provisions if deadlines are missed
3. Implement unannounced compliance spot-checks in addition to scheduled audits
4. Include provisions for phased jurisdictional expansion with specific milestones and timelines for each agency
5. Strengthen RIO independence by requiring that RIO performance evaluations be conducted solely by the governing board, not by institutional administrators

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Budget vulnerability | Authorize mandatory funding (not discretionary) for at least the first 5 years |
| Political interference | Strengthen Director independence with for-cause removal protection and term that spans administrations |
| Regulatory capture | Rotate advisory board members; include whistleblower and public representatives |
| Technology obsolescence | Authorize annual technology assessment and rapid procurement authority |
| International enforcement gap | Authorize bilateral and multilateral agreements; condition research collaboration on partner integrity standards |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Both Acts should include a 10-year reauthorization requirement with mandatory GAO evaluation at year 7
- The NASEM study under the Modernization Act includes a built-in review of the misconduct definition
- The Detection Center should undergo biennial technology assessment to ensure continued relevance
- Institutional accountability standards should be reviewed every 5 years in light of compliance data
