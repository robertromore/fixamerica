# Diversity in STEM: Root Causes

## Overview

The persistent underrepresentation of women, racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ individuals in STEM is not the result of any single factor. It emerges from the interaction of structural, institutional, cultural, and interpersonal forces that operate at every stage of the STEM pipeline. This analysis identifies the root causes driving underrepresentation and explains why decades of programmatic intervention have failed to produce systemic change.

## K-12 Educational Inequity

### Unequal Access to Quality STEM Education

The foundation of STEM underrepresentation is laid in the K-12 system, where access to rigorous science and mathematics education is profoundly unequal:

- **Advanced coursework**: Schools serving predominantly Black and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to offer Advanced Placement courses in STEM subjects. Approximately 60 percent of high schools with majority-minority enrollment do not offer AP Computer Science, compared to 30 percent of schools with majority-white enrollment (College Board, 2023).
- **Teacher quality**: Schools in low-income and minority communities have higher rates of out-of-field teaching in math and science. A teacher teaching chemistry without a chemistry degree or certification is far more common in under-resourced schools.
- **Facilities and equipment**: Laboratories, computing equipment, and hands-on STEM learning materials are often inadequate or absent in under-resourced schools.
- **Gifted and talented identification**: Black and Hispanic students are significantly underidentified for gifted programs even when they score at equivalent levels on standardized assessments. A 2016 study by Grissom and Redding found that Black students are 66 percent less likely than white students to be identified for gifted programs, even controlling for test scores.

### Stereotype Threat and Identity

- **Stereotype threat**: The phenomenon identified by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson (1995) -- where awareness of negative stereotypes about one's group impairs performance on tasks associated with those stereotypes -- has been replicated extensively in STEM contexts. Women and minorities underperform on standardized math and science assessments when stereotype threat is activated and perform at equivalent levels when it is removed.
- **STEM identity**: Students form their sense of belonging in STEM early. Research shows that by middle school, girls and minority students are less likely to see themselves as "science people" or "math people," driven by classroom dynamics, peer culture, teacher expectations, and media representation.
- **Counseling and tracking**: School counselors and teachers, often unconsciously, steer students from underrepresented groups away from advanced STEM coursework. Black and Hispanic students who express interest in STEM careers are less likely to be encouraged to take AP math and science courses than white and Asian students with comparable achievement levels.

## Institutional and Structural Barriers in Higher Education

### Admissions and Financial Barriers

- **Standardized testing**: The GRE, widely used in STEM graduate admissions, has documented score gaps by race and gender that do not predict graduate school success. A 2014 study by Miller and Stassun found that GRE scores were poor predictors of doctoral completion and publication rates but were strong predictors of demographic composition. The movement to make the GRE optional in STEM admissions gained momentum during the pandemic but remains inconsistent.
- **Financial barriers**: STEM doctoral programs in the sciences generally offer funding (tuition remission and stipends), but stipends are often insufficient, particularly at institutions in high-cost areas. The median STEM doctoral stipend in 2022-2023 was approximately $35,000 -- below the cost of living in most major research metro areas. Students from low-income backgrounds and those with family obligations are disproportionately affected.
- **Hidden costs**: Application fees ($50-$100 per program), GRE fees ($220), campus visit costs, and relocation expenses create barriers that disproportionately affect students from underrepresented groups.

### Faculty Hiring and Promotion

- **Search committee bias**: Studies consistently show that faculty search committees evaluate candidates through lenses shaped by implicit bias. Identical CVs receive different ratings depending on the perceived race and gender of the applicant (Moss-Racusin et al., 2012; Eaton et al., 2020).
- **"Culture fit" and network effects**: Faculty hiring in STEM relies heavily on informal networks, advisor recommendations, and assessments of "fit" that systematically favor candidates from well-connected research groups at elite institutions. These networks are overwhelmingly white and male, reproducing demographic homogeneity.
- **Tenure criteria**: The tenure clock (typically 6-7 years) is rigidly structured around an assumption of uninterrupted, full-time productivity that disadvantages anyone with caregiving responsibilities, health challenges, or other disruptions. While tenure clock extensions exist at many institutions, their use is stigmatized and may not actually improve tenure outcomes.
- **Service burden**: Faculty from underrepresented groups bear a disproportionate burden of committee service, diversity work, and student mentoring -- labor that is often expected but not rewarded in tenure decisions. This "cultural taxation" reduces the time available for research and publication.

### Funding Structure

- **Peer review bias**: The peer review system for federal grants has documented disparities by race and gender. The NIH R01 funding gap for Black investigators (approximately 10 percentage points below white investigators) persists after controlling for research record, training, and institutional affiliation (Ginther et al., 2011; Hoppe et al., 2019).
- **Topic bias**: Research on topics disproportionately studied by investigators from underrepresented groups -- such as health disparities, environmental justice, and community-based research -- receives lower priority scores from study sections, not because of the quality of the science but because of reviewer attitudes toward the topics (Hoppe et al., 2019).
- **Institutional prestige effects**: Grant success rates are strongly correlated with institutional prestige. Scientists at HBCUs, HSIs, and less-resourced institutions face lower success rates partly because of reviewers' association of institutional prestige with research quality.
- **Preliminary data requirements**: Most major grants require preliminary data, creating a "rich get richer" dynamic in which scientists who already have funding can generate the data needed for the next grant, while newcomers -- disproportionately from underrepresented groups -- cannot.

## Workplace Climate and Culture

### Harassment as a Structural Problem

Harassment is not merely a matter of individual bad actors. It is enabled by institutional structures:

- **Power asymmetry**: The academic model in which a single faculty advisor controls a trainee's career trajectory -- access to data, publications, letters of recommendation, and professional networks -- creates the conditions for abuse.
- **Institutional incentives**: Universities have financial incentives to protect productive (grant-generating) faculty even when they are the subject of harassment complaints. High-profile harassers at multiple institutions have been allowed to resign quietly and move to new institutions with their grant funding intact.
- **Inadequate accountability**: Title IX offices, which handle harassment complaints, often prioritize institutional liability over complainant safety. Investigation timelines are long, outcomes are frequently opaque, and sanctions are often minimal.
- **Retaliation**: Complainants face significant professional risks. A 2019 survey found that more than 70 percent of researchers who reported harassment experienced some form of retaliation, including negative performance evaluations, exclusion from collaborations, or termination.

### Microaggressions and Exclusion

- **Daily indignities**: Underrepresented individuals in STEM report frequent microaggressions -- subtle verbal and behavioral slights that communicate devaluation. Being mistaken for administrative staff, having contributions attributed to others, being interrupted or talked over in meetings, and being subjected to lowered expectations are commonly reported experiences.
- **Isolation**: Being the only woman or the only person of color in a department, lab, or classroom creates psychological burden. Research on "solo status" shows that being a numerical minority in a group increases self-consciousness, anxiety, and stereotype threat.
- **Imposter phenomenon**: The combination of stereotype threat, microaggressions, and isolation contributes to imposter phenomenon (the persistent feeling of being a fraud despite evidence of competence). Rates of imposter phenomenon are significantly higher among women and minorities in STEM than among white men.

### Meritocracy Ideology

The belief that STEM is a pure meritocracy -- that outcomes are determined solely by talent and effort -- is itself a barrier to change:

- **Denial of bias**: When institutions and individuals believe they are operating on pure merit, they become resistant to evidence of bias. Studies show that organizations that emphasize meritocracy actually produce more biased outcomes because the meritocratic framing reduces scrutiny of decision-making processes (Castilla and Benard, 2010).
- **Attributing gaps to individual deficiency**: The meritocracy narrative frames underrepresentation as the result of pipeline supply problems or individual choices rather than structural barriers. This shifts responsibility from institutions to underrepresented individuals.
- **Resistance to structural reform**: If the system is believed to be meritocratic, then interventions that change the system (such as reforming hiring criteria or grant review processes) are viewed as compromising quality rather than correcting bias.

## Compounding and Intersectional Disadvantage

### Intersectionality in STEM

The concept of intersectionality -- that multiple dimensions of identity interact to produce unique patterns of advantage and disadvantage -- is essential to understanding STEM underrepresentation:

- **Women of color**: Black women, Hispanic women, and Native American women face the compounded effects of both racial and gender bias. Their experiences are not simply the sum of "being a woman" and "being a minority" but involve unique challenges that neither gender-only nor race-only analyses capture.
- **LGBTQ+ scientists**: LGBTQ+ individuals in STEM face both professional exclusion and, in some geographic and institutional contexts, legal and social hostility. Transgender scientists face particular barriers related to name changes, pronoun usage, and access to appropriate facilities.
- **Scientists with disabilities**: Physical and cognitive disabilities intersect with STEM workplace and laboratory design, fieldwork requirements, and cultural assumptions about what a scientist "looks like" and how they should work.
- **First-generation and low-income students**: Socioeconomic disadvantage compounds racial and gender barriers. First-generation college students in STEM lack the social capital (family networks, knowledge of academic norms) that facilitates navigation of the pipeline.

### Cumulative Disadvantage

Small disadvantages at each career stage compound over time into large gaps:

- A 2 percent disadvantage in each hiring, funding, and promotion decision, compounded over a 30-year career, produces enormous disparities in outcomes.
- Underrepresented scientists publish slightly fewer papers per year on average (partly due to service burden and resource disparities), which compounds into large publication gaps over time, affecting tenure and promotion decisions.
- Each transition point (undergraduate to graduate, graduate to postdoc, postdoc to faculty) has a higher attrition rate for underrepresented groups. The cumulative effect of differential attrition at each stage produces the dramatic representation gaps observed at the senior faculty and leadership levels.

## Programmatic Limitations

### Why Programs Have Not Solved the Problem

Federal programs like NSF ADVANCE, LSAMP, and NIH diversity supplements have produced positive results for individual participants and grantee institutions but have not altered systemic patterns because:

- **Scale mismatch**: The scale of federal investment ($1-2 billion annually) is small relative to the size of the problem (a $600 billion higher education sector and a $160 billion federal research enterprise).
- **Grant-cycle limitations**: Most programs operate on 3-5 year grant cycles. Institutional culture change requires sustained effort over decades.
- **Voluntary participation**: Federal programs are optional. Institutions that most need reform may be least likely to seek diversity grants.
- **Focusing on individuals rather than structures**: Many programs provide support to individuals (scholarships, mentoring, training) without changing the institutional structures that create barriers. This approach treats symptoms rather than causes.
- **Evaluation challenges**: Many programs lack rigorous evaluation designs (randomized controls, longitudinal tracking), making it difficult to distinguish program effects from secular trends.
