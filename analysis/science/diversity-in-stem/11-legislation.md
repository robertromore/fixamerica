# Diversity in STEM: Legislation

## Overview

Federal authority over STEM diversity policy derives primarily from Congress's spending power under Article I, Section 8. The federal government funds more than $160 billion annually in research and development, and conditions attached to this funding are the primary mechanism through which Congress influences institutional practices at universities, laboratories, and research organizations. Additional authority comes from Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (prohibiting discrimination in federally funded programs), Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education), and the America COMPETES Act and its reauthorizations (establishing NSF's broadening participation mandate).

This legislative framework proposes two complementary federal bills. The first, the STEM Opportunity and Equity Act, addresses structural barriers in research funding, institutional accountability, and support for minority-serving institutions. The second, the STEM Workplace Safety and Anti-Harassment Act, addresses the hostile climate and harassment that drive underrepresented individuals out of STEM careers. Together, these bills attack the diversity problem from both sides: removing structural barriers to entry and advancement, and making the environments that underrepresented individuals enter safe and supportive.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for STEM diversity reform.* Congress's spending power -- the authority to attach conditions to the disbursement of federal funds -- provides ample constitutional basis for the reforms proposed here. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's authority to condition federal funding on institutional compliance with a wide range of requirements, provided the conditions are related to the federal interest in the program being funded (see *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987)).

The post-SFFA legal landscape requires careful attention to the Equal Protection Clause. The legislation proposed here is designed to be legally durable by relying on race-neutral mechanisms (institutional type, socioeconomic criteria, geographic factors) where possible, and by attaching conditions to federal funding rather than imposing direct mandates. Where race-conscious provisions are included (such as data disaggregation and reporting), they are structured as transparency measures rather than preferences.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To increase equity in federal STEM research funding, strengthen research
capacity at minority-serving institutions, reform peer review processes,
improve data transparency, and establish accountability mechanisms for
institutions receiving federal research funding.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "STEM Opportunity and Equity Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States faces persistent and significant underrepresentation of
women, Black, Hispanic, Native American, and other minority groups in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at every level from
undergraduate enrollment to senior faculty and research leadership.
(2) Black applicants for National Institutes of Health R01 research grants are
approximately 10 percentage points less likely to receive funding than white
applicants, even after controlling for education, training, prior research
awards, and publication record (Ginther et al., Science, 2011; Hoppe et al.,
Science Advances, 2019).
(3) Historically Black Colleges and Universities receive approximately 2 percent
of total federal research funding despite producing approximately 17 percent of
Black STEM bachelor's degree recipients.
(4) The concentration of federal research funding at a small number of elite
institutions perpetuates inequity by limiting the research capacity of
minority-serving institutions.
(5) Current median doctoral stipends for federally funded graduate research
assistants are below the cost of living in most major metropolitan areas,
creating financial barriers that disproportionately affect first-generation
and minority students.
(6) The nation's long-term scientific competitiveness depends on its ability to
develop the full talent of its diverse population.

    (b) Section 7 (Doctoral Stipend Floor) shall take effect for the academic
    year beginning after August 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (MSI Research Capacity Fund)**: The $2.5 billion authorization over 5 years addresses the structural funding inequity that limits research capacity at institutions that produce a disproportionate share of underrepresented STEM graduates. The eligible activities are designed to build sustainable institutional capacity, not just fund individual projects.
- **Section 5 (Peer Review Reform)**: Blinded review pilots directly test whether removing investigator identity information reduces the documented racial funding gap. Reviewer diversity targets address the composition of the panels making funding decisions.
- **Section 6 (Data Transparency)**: Transparency is a prerequisite for accountability. Currently, most federal agencies do not publish comprehensive disaggregated data on their funding patterns. This section requires it.
- **Section 7 (Doctoral Stipend Floor)**: Living-wage stipends address the financial barrier that disproportionately affects first-generation and minority students. The 2-year transition period allows institutions to adjust.
- **Section 8 (Bridge Funding)**: Near-miss proposals from early-career investigators at under-resourced institutions are disproportionately likely to be from underrepresented groups. Bridge funding provides a race-neutral mechanism for increasing equity in funding outcomes.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Blinded review is technically challenging and may reduce the ability to assess investigator track record.
- MSI research capacity investments will face scrutiny from institutions that view them as diverting funding from established research programs.
- Institutional reporting requirements will face resistance from universities that view them as unfunded mandates.

**Refinements**:

- Include a 5-year sunset clause on blinded review pilots, requiring reauthorization based on evaluation data.
- Phase institutional reporting requirements: voluntary in Years 1-2, mandatory for institutions receiving more than $50 million in Years 3-4, mandatory for all institutions receiving more than $10 million in Year 5.
- Provide technical assistance and template tools for institutional reporting to reduce administrative burden.

### The STEM Workplace Safety and Anti-Harassment Act

**Purpose**: To protect individuals in federally funded STEM research environments from sexual harassment, racial harassment, and other forms of workplace misconduct by establishing mandatory reporting requirements, funding consequences for perpetrators, independent investigation mechanisms, and support for affected individuals.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Universal Reporting**: Requires all institutions receiving federal research funding to report findings of harassment by investigators to the relevant funding agency.
2. **Funding Consequences**: Establishes graduated consequences for investigators found to have engaged in harassment, up to and including permanent debarment from federal funding.
3. **Independent Investigation**: Provides funding for institutions to establish independent investigation offices.
4. **Retaliation Protection**: Strengthens protections for individuals who report harassment in federally funded research environments.
5. **Climate Surveys**: Requires biennial climate surveys at major research institutions.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To protect individuals in federally funded STEM research environments from
sexual harassment, racial harassment, and other forms of workplace misconduct,
and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States
of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "STEM Workplace Safety and Anti-Harassment Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) More than 50 percent of women faculty and staff in academic science,
engineering, and medicine have experienced sexual harassment, according to the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2018).
(2) Women who experience sexual harassment are 6.5 times more likely to leave
their positions, representing a significant loss of talent and investment.
(3) Racial harassment and hostile climate conditions disproportionately affect
Black, Hispanic, and Native American researchers and contribute to attrition
from STEM fields.
(4) LGBTQ+ individuals in STEM experience higher rates of exclusion and
career-limiting harassment than their non-LGBTQ+ peers.
(5) Current institutional mechanisms for addressing harassment -- primarily
Title IX compliance offices -- are widely perceived as inadequate, conflicted,
and oriented toward institutional liability management rather than complainant
protection.
(6) The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 established reporting requirements for
NSF-funded institutions, but these provisions do not extend to all federal
research agencies and do not include sufficient enforcement mechanisms.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) COVERED INSTITUTION.—The term "covered institution" means any institution
of higher education, research organization, or other entity receiving research
funding from a covered agency.
(2) COVERED AGENCY.—The term "covered agency" has the meaning given in section
3 of the STEM Opportunity and Equity Act of 2026.
(3) COVERED INDIVIDUAL.—The term "covered individual" means any individual who
is a principal investigator, co-principal investigator, senior personnel, or
other key person identified on a proposal or award from a covered agency.
(4) FINDING OF HARASSMENT.—The term "finding of harassment" means—
    (a) an institutional determination, following investigation, that a covered
    individual has engaged in sexual harassment, sexual assault, racial
    harassment, stalking, or retaliation related to a complaint of such
    conduct; or
    (b) the placement of a covered individual on administrative leave or the
    imposition of any sanction related to an allegation of such conduct.
(5) RETALIATION.—The term "retaliation" means any adverse action taken against
an individual because the individual—
    (a) made a complaint of harassment;
    (b) participated in an investigation of harassment; or
    (c) opposed conduct that the individual reasonably believed constituted
    harassment.

SEC. 4. MANDATORY REPORTING.

(a) INSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION.—Each covered institution shall notify the
relevant covered agency not later than 30 days after—
    (1) making a finding of harassment against a covered individual;
    (2) placing a covered individual on administrative leave related to an
    allegation of harassment; or
    (3) reaching a settlement or agreement with a covered individual related
    to an allegation of harassment, regardless of whether the settlement
    includes a non-disclosure provision.
(b) CONTENT OF NOTIFICATION.—The notification shall include—
    (1) the name and position of the covered individual;
    (2) the nature of the finding, leave, or settlement;
    (3) the grant or award numbers associated with the covered individual;
    (4) the sanctions imposed by the institution; and
    (5) any actions taken to protect affected individuals.
(c) FAILURE TO REPORT.—An institution that fails to report as required by this
section shall be subject to—
    (1) suspension of new award eligibility for a period of not less than 6
    months; and
    (2) review of all active awards at the institution for compliance with
    applicable terms and conditions.

SEC. 5. FUNDING CONSEQUENCES.

(a) GRADUATED RESPONSE.—Upon receipt of a notification under section 4, the
head of the relevant covered agency shall—
    (1) for a first finding: require the covered institution to submit a
    remediation plan and to remove the covered individual from all active
    federal awards for a period of not less than 1 year;
    (2) for a second finding involving the same individual: suspend the
    covered individual's eligibility to serve as principal investigator or
    senior personnel on any federal award for a period of not less than 5
    years; and
    (3) for a third finding, or for a finding involving sexual assault:
    permanently debar the covered individual from eligibility for federal
    research funding.
(b) AGENCY DISCRETION.—Nothing in this section shall prevent a covered agency
from imposing more severe consequences than the minimums specified in
subsection (a), based on the severity of the conduct.
(c) TRANSFER PROHIBITION.—A covered individual who is removed from federal
awards at one institution shall not become eligible for federal awards at
another institution until the applicable suspension period has expired, and
the receiving institution has been notified of the prior finding.
(d) REGISTRY.—The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy
shall establish and maintain a confidential registry of covered individuals
who have been subject to funding consequences under this section, accessible
to covered agencies for purposes of award eligibility determination.

SEC. 6. INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION.

(a) GRANT PROGRAM.—The Director of the National Science Foundation shall
establish a grant program to assist covered institutions in establishing
independent investigation offices for complaints of harassment in research
environments.
(b) INDEPENDENCE REQUIREMENTS.—Investigations funded under this section shall
be conducted by individuals who—
    (1) are not employees of the covered institution;
    (2) have training in workplace harassment investigation, including
    STEM-specific dynamics;
    (3) have no financial or professional relationship with the parties
    involved; and
    (4) report findings directly to institutional leadership and, where
    applicable, to the relevant covered agency.
(c) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be appropriated
$30,000,000 per fiscal year for grants under this section.

SEC. 7. RETALIATION PROTECTION.

(a) PROHIBITION.—No covered institution shall take any adverse action against
an individual because the individual engaged in protected activity as defined
in section 3(5).
(b) PRESUMPTION.—An adverse action taken within 1 year of a protected activity
shall create a rebuttable presumption of retaliation.
(c) REMEDIES.—An individual who is subjected to retaliation in violation of
this section may—
    (1) file a complaint with the relevant covered agency, which shall
    investigate and, if retaliation is found, may impose sanctions on the
    institution including suspension of new award eligibility; and
    (2) bring an action in Federal district court for injunctive relief,
    compensatory damages, and reasonable attorney's fees.

SEC. 8. CLIMATE SURVEYS.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—Each covered institution receiving more than $10,000,000
annually in total research funding from covered agencies shall conduct a
biennial climate survey assessing the experiences of faculty, staff,
postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students, including experiences of
harassment, discrimination, microaggressions, belonging, and satisfaction.
(b) PUBLICATION.—Anonymized aggregate results of each survey shall be
published on the institution's website and reported to the relevant covered
agencies within 6 months of survey completion.
(c) ACTION PLANS.—Each institution shall develop and publish an action plan
responding to survey findings, with measurable goals and timelines.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026, except that—
    (a) Section 4 (Mandatory Reporting) shall take effect 180 days after the
    date of enactment; and
    (b) Section 8 (Climate Surveys) shall take effect for the first survey
    cycle beginning after January 1, 2028.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Mandatory Reporting)**: Extends the CHIPS and Science Act's NSF-specific reporting requirement to all federal research agencies. The 30-day reporting timeline and the inclusion of settlements (even those with NDAs) close loopholes that have allowed institutions to quietly resolve harassment cases without consequences for perpetrators.
- **Section 5 (Funding Consequences)**: Graduated consequences provide proportional responses. The transfer prohibition addresses the practice of serial harassers resigning from one institution and moving to another with their grant funding intact. The confidential registry enables cross-agency awareness without public shaming.
- **Section 6 (Independent Investigation)**: Recognizes that institutional Title IX offices have conflicts of interest. Federal funding for independent investigators removes the financial barrier that prevents institutions from establishing truly independent processes.
- **Section 7 (Retaliation Protection)**: The rebuttable presumption of retaliation for adverse actions within 1 year of a complaint is modeled on whistleblower protection statutes and addresses the documented chilling effect of retaliation on reporting.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Universities will resist mandatory reporting requirements as intrusions on institutional autonomy and will argue that they create liability risks.
- The confidential registry may face legal challenges related to due process if investigators believe they are being informally blacklisted.
- Independent investigation offices require trained personnel who may be in short supply.

**Refinements**:

- Include due process protections for investigated individuals: notice, opportunity to respond, and appeal procedures.
- Phase the mandatory reporting requirement: apply first to institutions receiving more than $50 million annually, then expand.
- Establish standards for climate survey instruments to ensure comparability across institutions.

## State Model Legislation

### State STEM Pipeline Investment Act (Model State Bill)

**Purpose**: To invest in STEM education access and quality at the state level, particularly in underserved communities.

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] STEM Pipeline Investment Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that—
(a) Access to rigorous STEM education in [State] is unevenly distributed,
with schools in low-income and minority communities significantly less likely
to offer Advanced Placement STEM courses or well-equipped science laboratories.
(b) STEM workforce growth in [State] depends on developing the full talent
of all communities.

SECTION 3. UNIVERSAL AP STEM ACCESS.

(a) Not later than the academic year beginning in [date + 3 years], every
public high school in [State] shall offer at least one Advanced Placement
course in each of the following subjects: Computer Science, Biology, Chemistry,
and Physics, or equivalent college-level STEM courses approved by the [State]
Department of Education.
(b) The [State] Department of Education shall provide grants to school
districts to cover the costs of teacher training, laboratory equipment, and
AP exam fees necessary to comply with this section.

SECTION 4. STEM TEACHER PIPELINE.

(a) The [State] shall establish a STEM Teacher Scholarship Program that
provides full tuition and a living stipend to individuals who commit to
teaching STEM subjects in high-need schools for at least 4 years.
(b) Not fewer than [number] scholarships shall be awarded annually.

SECTION 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are appropriated from the General Fund $[amount] for fiscal years
[range] to carry out this Act.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

**Adaptations**: States may customize the AP course requirements, scholarship amounts, and funding levels based on their specific educational landscape and budget capacity.

## Regulatory Framework

### OSTP Directive: Equity in Federal Research Funding

**Existing Authority**: Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and the America COMPETES Act provide the framework for OSTP to coordinate science agency policies.

**Draft Directive**: The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall direct all federal agencies that fund research to:

1. Conduct biennial analyses of award patterns by applicant race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, career stage, and institutional type.
2. Identify and report any statistically significant disparities in award rates that are not explained by differences in application quality as measured by review scores.
3. Develop and implement corrective action plans for any identified disparities, which may include changes to review processes, reviewer composition, program design, or funding mechanisms.
4. Report progress to OSTP annually.

**Explanation**: This administrative action can be taken without legislation and complements the statutory requirements in the STEM Opportunity and Equity Act.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Spending Clause**: The conditions attached to federal funding in these bills are authorized under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8). The conditions are related to the federal interest in ensuring equitable use of research funds and are clearly stated to give institutions notice of their obligations.
- **Equal Protection**: The legislation is designed to be legally durable in the post-SFFA environment. It does not require race-conscious admissions or hiring preferences. Data reporting disaggregated by race is permissible as a transparency measure. The MSI Research Capacity Fund awards based on institutional designation (HBCU, HSI, TCU), which is a classification based on institutional mission and student enrollment demographics, not on the race of individual investigators.
- **Due Process**: The anti-harassment provisions include graduated consequences, notice, and appeal procedures to satisfy due process requirements for investigators who may lose funding eligibility.

### Preemption Questions

- **State DEI Restrictions**: Federal research funding conditions preempt state laws that would prevent institutions from complying with federal requirements. If a state prohibits diversity statements but a federal grant requires climate survey reporting, the federal requirement prevails under the Supremacy Clause.
- **Title IX Coordination**: The anti-harassment provisions complement but do not replace Title IX obligations. Institutions must comply with both sets of requirements.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Funding conditions**: The primary enforcement mechanism. Institutional failure to comply with reporting, survey, or remediation requirements results in suspension of new award eligibility.
- **Private right of action**: Retaliation victims can bring suit in federal court.
- **Agency oversight**: Covered agencies conduct compliance reviews and audits.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### STEM Opportunity and Equity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| MSI fund capture by well-resourced MSIs | A small number of well-resourced HBCUs and HSIs may dominate awards, leaving less-resourced MSIs behind | High |
| Blinded review workarounds | Reviewers in small fields may identify investigators through research descriptions, citation patterns, or preliminary data | Medium |
| Data aggregation hiding disparities | If privacy thresholds (cell size <5) are applied broadly, data disaggregation may obscure disparities at the departmental level | Medium |
| Stipend floor unfunded mandates | Institutions may fund the stipend increase by reducing the number of supported students rather than increasing total investment | High |
| Bridge funding as consolation prize | Bridge awards may become a substitute for equitable primary funding rather than a pathway to it | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not directly address faculty hiring | The bill addresses funding and data but does not reform the hiring practices that reproduce demographic homogeneity | Hiring is an institutional decision; federal mandates on hiring face strong academic freedom objections |
| Does not address K-12 pipeline at federal level | The bill focuses on higher education and research; K-12 STEM inequity is primarily a state and local issue | Federal role in K-12 is limited; state model legislation addresses this gap |
| MSI fund is temporary | The 5-year authorization may not be renewed, leaving MSIs without sustained support | Political uncertainty about long-term appropriations |
| Peer review reform is limited to pilots | Blinded review pilots may produce positive results but may not be adopted system-wide if institutional resistance is strong | Agency discretion on whether to adopt pilot findings at scale |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Cap the percentage of the MSI Research Capacity Fund that any single institution can receive at 5 percent of the annual total, ensuring broad distribution across the MSI sector.
2. Develop field-specific blinding protocols that address the challenges of small fields, including the use of external (non-field-specialist) reviewers for the blinded phase and field specialists for a subsequent un-blinded phase.
3. Establish a minimum cell size exception process under which agencies may publish data with smaller cell sizes (with institutional consent) when doing so is necessary to identify meaningful disparities.
4. Require that institutions certify that stipend increases do not reduce the number of supported students, and provide supplemental funding mechanisms for institutions that demonstrate financial hardship.
5. Require that bridge funding recipients receive mentored resubmission support, including assignment to a senior advisor and access to program officer feedback, to ensure that bridge awards lead to successful resubmissions rather than dead ends.

### STEM Workplace Safety and Anti-Harassment Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Institutional stalling of investigations | Institutions may delay investigations to avoid triggering the 30-day reporting requirement | High |
| NDAs circumventing reporting | While settlements are covered, informal arrangements that do not constitute formal "settlements" may escape the reporting requirement | Medium |
| Perpetrator migration between agencies | An investigator debarred by NSF may seek funding from a non-covered agency or private foundation | Medium |
| Climate survey fatigue | If surveys are not well-designed, response rates may decline, rendering results unreliable | Low |
| Registry scope limitations | The registry covers federal funding eligibility but does not prevent universities from hiring or retaining harassers in unfunded positions | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address harassment by non-federally-funded personnel | Harassment by faculty who do not hold federal grants is not covered by funding-based enforcement | Federal jurisdiction is limited to federally funded activities |
| Independent investigation supply | Qualified independent investigators may be scarce, particularly in rural areas and at smaller institutions | New profession with limited training infrastructure |
| Due process tension | Rapid funding consequences may precede completion of full investigation | Balancing complainant protection against respondent rights |
| Does not address systemic enabling | Individual perpetrators are sanctioned, but the institutional cultures that enable them are addressed only through climate surveys | Institutional culture change is difficult to mandate |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Define "finding of harassment" to include any administrative action taken in response to an allegation (including reassignment, separation agreement, or departmental sanctions), not just formal Title IX findings, to prevent institutions from using informal processes to avoid reporting.
2. Expand the covered agency definition to include all federal agencies that fund research (including Department of Defense basic research and USDA research programs) to minimize the gap for perpetrator migration between agencies.
3. Establish a training and certification program for independent harassment investigators in STEM settings, funded through the NSF grant program in Section 6, to build the supply of qualified investigators.
4. Include interim protective measures (reassignment of complainants to alternative mentors, lab access protections, financial continuity) that take effect immediately upon filing of a complaint, without waiting for investigation completion.
5. Require that climate survey results be tied to institutional action plans with measurable goals, and that failure to demonstrate improvement on key metrics over two survey cycles triggers enhanced agency oversight.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Inter-agency coordination | Direct OSTP to establish a STEM Diversity Coordination Committee with representatives from all covered agencies, meeting quarterly |
| Cost growth risk | Include annual spending caps with automatic program reviews triggered at 110% of authorized spending |
| Congressional oversight gaps | Require biennial briefings to the House Science Committee and Senate Commerce Committee on implementation progress |
| Political vulnerability | Structure all provisions as race-neutral interventions tied to institutional type, career stage, and socioeconomic factors to maximize legal durability |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All novel authorities created by these bills (blinded review pilots, bridge funding, independent investigation grants, mandatory reporting) should include 5-year sunset clauses with mandatory GAO evaluation at the 3-year mark. Reauthorization should be conditioned on demonstrated effectiveness against the metrics established in the legislation. The MSI Research Capacity Fund authorization should be reviewed at the 3-year mark to assess whether investments are producing measurable improvements in research capacity and whether funding distribution is equitable across the MSI sector.
