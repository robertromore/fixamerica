# Diversity in STEM: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the persistent underrepresentation of women, racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ individuals in STEM requires interventions at every level of the system -- from K-12 education through senior faculty positions and research leadership. No single program or policy will solve the problem. The solutions presented here are organized by domain and designed to be mutually reinforcing, targeting both the structural barriers that create inequity and the climate factors that drive attrition.

## K-12 Pipeline Investment

### Equalize Access to Advanced STEM Coursework

- **Universal AP STEM access**: Require all high schools receiving federal funding to offer at least AP Computer Science, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and AP Physics or equivalent college-level STEM coursework. Provide federal grants to cover the costs of teacher training, laboratory equipment, and AP exam fees for Title I schools.
- **STEM teacher quality**: Expand the Noyce Scholarship Program (NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship) to increase the supply of STEM teachers in high-need schools. Target a 50 percent increase in Noyce scholars over 5 years, with service requirements in under-resourced districts.
- **Early research experience**: Fund partnerships between research universities and local middle and high schools that provide students from underrepresented groups with authentic research experiences, mentored by graduate students and faculty. The existing STEM ecosystem programs at NSF provide a model but operate at insufficient scale.

### Address Stereotype Threat and Identity

- **Growth mindset and belonging interventions**: Integrate evidence-based interventions that address stereotype threat and foster STEM identity into standard curricula. Brief interventions (such as values affirmation exercises and growth mindset framing) have been shown to significantly narrow achievement gaps in controlled studies (Walton and Cohen, 2011; Yeager et al., 2016).
- **Representation in curriculum**: Ensure that K-12 science and math curricula include the contributions of scientists from diverse backgrounds -- not as sidebars but as integral parts of the scientific narrative.
- **Mentoring networks**: Fund community-based STEM mentoring programs that connect underrepresented youth with STEM professionals who share their backgrounds. Models such as the MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement) program have demonstrated effectiveness.

## Higher Education Reform

### Admissions Reform

- **GRE de-emphasis**: Eliminate or make optional the GRE for STEM graduate admissions. Evidence consistently shows that GRE scores are poor predictors of doctoral completion and publication success but are strong predictors of demographic composition. Programs that have dropped the GRE have seen increases in applications from underrepresented groups without declines in student quality (Miller and Stassun, 2014; Langin, 2019).
- **Holistic review training**: Train admissions committees in holistic review methods that evaluate applicants' research potential, persistence, creativity, and contributions to their communities in addition to traditional academic metrics. Provide structured evaluation rubrics to reduce the role of subjective impressions.
- **Bridge programs**: Expand funded bridge programs (such as the Fisk-Vanderbilt Master's-to-PhD Bridge Program) that provide structured pathways from less-resourced institutions to doctoral programs at research universities. These programs have demonstrated dramatically higher doctoral completion rates for underrepresented students.

### Financial Support

- **Stipend reform**: Increase STEM doctoral stipends to at least 100 percent of the local living wage. Current median stipends (~$35,000) are below the cost of living in most major research metro areas, creating a financial barrier that disproportionately affects first-generation and minority students.
- **Application fee elimination**: Eliminate or waive application fees for STEM graduate programs for all applicants from underrepresented groups, first-generation students, and those with demonstrated financial need.
- **Emergency funding**: Establish institutional emergency funds for STEM graduate students facing unexpected financial crises (medical emergencies, family obligations, housing loss) that might otherwise force them to leave their programs.

### Mentoring and Support

- **Structured mentoring**: Replace the sole-advisor model with mentoring committees for all doctoral students. Multiple mentors provide diverse perspectives, reduce the power asymmetry of the single-advisor relationship, and provide safety nets when one relationship fails.
- **Peer cohort models**: Create funded cohort programs that provide underrepresented students with a community of peers navigating the same challenges. Cohort-based models (such as those used in the NIH IMSD program) have demonstrated significantly higher retention rates.
- **Mental health support**: Provide free, confidential mental health services specifically designed for graduate students, with clinicians trained in the unique stressors of academic STEM careers. Normalize help-seeking through institutional messaging and faculty training.

## Faculty Hiring and Promotion Reform

### Hiring Practices

- **Cluster hiring**: Hire groups of faculty in related areas simultaneously, with diversity as an explicit goal of the cluster. Research shows that cluster hires are more likely to include underrepresented candidates and that hired faculty experience less isolation than individual diversity hires (Urban Universities for HEALTH, 2015).
- **Open recruitment**: Replace the informal network-based hiring system (where candidates are identified through personal connections) with structured, transparent searches that use broad advertising, standardized evaluation criteria, and trained search committees.
- **Evaluation rubric reform**: Develop and require the use of structured evaluation rubrics that assess teaching, research, mentoring, and service contributions, reducing the role of subjective judgments of "fit" that are susceptible to bias.
- **Implicit bias training**: Require all members of search committees and tenure review committees to complete evidence-based implicit bias training. While training alone does not eliminate bias, it raises awareness and, when combined with structural changes, produces measurable improvements (Devine et al., 2012).

### Tenure and Promotion

- **Tenure clock flexibility**: Normalize tenure clock extensions for childbirth, caregiving, serious illness, and other disruptions. Ensure that extensions are available automatically (not by application), gender-neutral, and do not negatively affect tenure evaluations.
- **Service credit**: Reform tenure criteria to recognize diversity-related service (mentoring underrepresented students, committee work, outreach) as legitimate scholarly contributions, weighted equivalently to other forms of service in tenure and promotion evaluations.
- **Broader impacts evaluation**: Require that tenure and promotion portfolios include documentation of efforts to broaden participation in science, consistent with the "Broader Impacts" criterion already required for NSF proposals.

## Research Funding Reform

### Peer Review

- **Blinded review pilots**: Pilot double-blinded grant review processes (where reviewers do not know the identity or institutional affiliation of the applicant) at NSF and NIH. Studies suggest that blinding reduces demographic biases in evaluation, though it introduces other challenges (inability to assess track record).
- **Reviewer diversity**: Increase the demographic diversity of grant review panels. Study sections and review panels that are more diverse in terms of gender, race, career stage, and institutional type produce more equitable funding outcomes.
- **Topic bias assessment**: Conduct systematic reviews of whether certain research topics (health disparities, environmental justice, community-based research) receive systematically lower scores due to reviewer bias rather than scientific quality. Adjust scoring criteria as needed.

### Funding for Minority-Serving Institutions

- **MSI research capacity fund**: Create a dedicated federal fund ($500 million annually) to build research infrastructure at HBCUs, HSIs, and TCUs. Investments should target laboratory facilities, computing infrastructure, and research staff positions.
- **Partnership requirements**: Require that large-scale federal research centers and initiatives (such as NSF Science and Technology Centers and NIH-funded clinical trial networks) include MSI partners with meaningful research roles and funding shares, not merely token participation.
- **Indirect cost rate reform**: Reform the federal indirect cost rate calculation to better support institutions with developing research infrastructure. The current system, which bases indirect cost rates on existing research expenditures, perpetuates the funding concentration at already well-resourced institutions.

### Investigator Support

- **Bridge funding**: Establish a bridge funding mechanism at NIH and NSF for investigators from underrepresented groups whose grants are scored in the "near-miss" range, providing 1-2 years of support to strengthen resubmissions. NIH's SCORE program provides a partial model but is limited in scope.
- **Mentored grants**: Expand mentored research awards (K-series at NIH, CAREER at NSF) that provide both research funding and career development support for early-career investigators from underrepresented groups.
- **Startup package equity**: Develop guidelines for equitable startup packages for new faculty, ensuring that researchers at less-resourced institutions receive adequate support to establish competitive research programs.

## Climate and Culture Reform

### Anti-Harassment Measures

- **Mandatory reporting to funders**: Expand the CHIPS and Science Act requirement that NSF-funded institutions report findings of harassment to include all federal research agencies (NIH, DOE, NASA, DOD). Require that findings of harassment result in automatic review of the perpetrator's federal grant eligibility.
- **Independent investigation**: Encourage institutions to establish independent investigation offices for harassment complaints, separate from Title IX compliance offices, with investigators who are trained in STEM workplace dynamics and not employed by the institution.
- **Funding consequences**: Establish clear consequences for principal investigators found to have engaged in harassment: temporary or permanent suspension of federal grant eligibility, depending on severity. Create a national registry (administered by OSTP or NSF) of investigators who have been sanctioned.

### Institutional Culture

- **Climate surveys**: Require all institutions receiving more than $10 million annually in federal research funding to conduct biennial climate surveys assessing the experiences of faculty, staff, and students from underrepresented groups. Publish anonymized aggregate results.
- **Departmental accountability**: Develop metrics for departmental-level diversity and inclusion that are incorporated into institutional accreditation and strategic planning processes.
- **Bystander intervention training**: Implement evidence-based bystander intervention training for all STEM faculty, staff, and graduate students, focusing on recognizing and intervening in harassment, microaggressions, and exclusionary behavior.

## Data and Accountability

### Transparency

- **Disaggregated data**: Require all federal research agencies to publish annually disaggregated data on grant application rates, success rates, and award sizes by race, gender, disability status, and institutional type. NSF and NIH currently publish some data but not consistently across all programs.
- **Institutional diversity reporting**: Require institutions receiving federal research funding to report annually on the demographic composition of their STEM faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, along with hiring, promotion, and attrition rates by demographic group.

### Evaluation

- **Rigorous program evaluation**: Require all federally funded STEM diversity programs to include rigorous evaluation designs with comparison groups, longitudinal tracking, and standardized outcome metrics. Tie continued funding to demonstrated effectiveness.
- **Longitudinal tracking**: Build a national STEM workforce tracking system that follows individuals from undergraduate enrollment through career outcomes, disaggregated by demographics. This data infrastructure is essential for understanding where attrition occurs and which interventions work.
