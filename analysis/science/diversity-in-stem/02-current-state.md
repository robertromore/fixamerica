# Diversity in STEM: Current State

## Representation in STEM Education

### Undergraduate Degrees

Women have achieved or exceeded parity in overall bachelor's degree attainment but remain significantly underrepresented in several STEM fields. The distribution is highly uneven across disciplines.

#### STEM Bachelor's Degrees by Gender (2021-2022)

| Field | Women's Share | Trend (10-year) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Biological/Biomedical Sciences | 63% | Stable | NSF NCSES, 2023 |
| Chemistry | 50% | Slight increase | NSF NCSES, 2023 |
| Mathematics/Statistics | 42% | Stable | NSF NCSES, 2023 |
| Physical Sciences (overall) | 40% | Slight increase | NSF NCSES, 2023 |
| Engineering | 24% | Slow increase (from 19% in 2012) | NSF NCSES, 2023 |
| Computer Science | 22% | Recovering (from 18% nadir in 2013) | NSF NCSES, 2023 |
| Physics | 21% | Stable | APS, 2023 |

#### STEM Bachelor's Degrees by Race/Ethnicity (2021-2022)

| Group | Share of U.S. Population (18-24) | Share of STEM Bachelor's | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| White | 51% | 54% | +3 |
| Hispanic/Latino | 22% | 16% | -6 |
| Black/African American | 14% | 9% | -5 |
| Asian | 7% | 11% | +4 |
| Native American/Alaska Native | 1% | 0.5% | -0.5 |
| Two or More Races | 5% | 5% | 0 |

### Graduate Degrees

Representation gaps widen at the graduate level, particularly for doctoral degrees in the physical sciences, engineering, and computer science.

#### STEM Doctoral Degrees Awarded to U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents (2022)

| Group | Share of STEM Doctorates | Share of U.S. Population | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Women | 41% | 50.5% | NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates, 2023 |
| Black/African American | 6% | 13.6% | NSF SED, 2023 |
| Hispanic/Latino | 9% | 19.1% | NSF SED, 2023 |
| Native American/Alaska Native | 0.4% | 1.3% | NSF SED, 2023 |
| Asian | 8% | 6.3% | NSF SED, 2023 |
| White | 65% | 58.9% | NSF SED, 2023 |

Women's doctoral representation varies significantly by field: 54 percent in biological sciences, 38 percent in chemistry, 33 percent in mathematics, 25 percent in engineering, 23 percent in computer science, and 20 percent in physics.

### Role of Minority-Serving Institutions

Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) play an outsized role in producing STEM graduates from underrepresented groups:

- HBCUs enroll approximately 9 percent of Black college students but produce approximately 17 percent of Black STEM bachelor's degree recipients and are the baccalaureate origin of approximately 29 percent of Black doctoral recipients in STEM fields.
- HSIs, which constitute approximately 18 percent of all higher education institutions, enroll approximately 67 percent of all Hispanic undergraduate students.
- TCUs serve approximately 10 percent of Native American college students and are often the only postsecondary option in their communities.
- NSF data consistently show that HBCUs produce a higher rate of Black students who subsequently earn STEM doctorates than do predominantly white institutions (PWIs).

## Representation in the STEM Workforce

### Overall STEM Employment

The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the STEM workforce comprises approximately 10.8 million workers. Representation gaps that begin in education persist and in some cases widen in employment.

#### STEM Workforce Demographics (2023)

| Group | Share of STEM Workforce | Share of Total Workforce | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Women | 28% | 47% | -19 |
| Black/African American | 9% | 12.6% | -3.6 |
| Hispanic/Latino | 8% | 18.9% | -10.9 |
| Asian | 14% | 6.7% | +7.3 |
| Native American/Alaska Native | 0.3% | 0.7% | -0.4 |
| Persons with Disabilities | ~3% | ~4.4% | -1.4 |

### Academic Faculty

The academic STEM workforce -- where research priorities are set, the next generation is trained, and scientific culture is shaped -- has the most severe representation gaps.

#### STEM Faculty Demographics at Research Universities (2021)

| Group | Assistant Professor | Associate Professor | Full Professor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Women | 38% | 33% | 23% |
| Black/African American | 5% | 4% | 3% |
| Hispanic/Latino | 6% | 5% | 4% |
| Asian | 19% | 17% | 14% |

*Source: NSF NCSES, Survey of Doctorate Recipients, 2021.*

The "leaky pipeline" pattern is evident: representation declines at each successive career stage. Women constitute 41 percent of STEM doctoral recipients but only 23 percent of full professors. Black Americans earn 6 percent of STEM doctorates but hold 3 percent of full professorships.

### Industry

Private-sector STEM employment shows similar patterns. Major technology companies have disclosed workforce demographics under pressure from shareholders and advocacy groups:

- At the five largest U.S. technology companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta), women constitute approximately 30-35 percent of the overall workforce but only 20-25 percent of technical roles.
- Black employees constitute 5-8 percent of overall staff but 3-5 percent of technical roles.
- Hispanic employees constitute 7-10 percent of overall staff but 4-7 percent of technical roles.
- Leadership positions (director-level and above) are even less diverse than the overall technical workforce.

## Harassment and Hostile Climate

### Prevalence

Sexual harassment, racial harassment, and hostile workplace climates are pervasive in STEM and constitute a major driver of attrition for underrepresented groups.

- The 2018 National Academies report *Sexual Harassment of Women in Academic Science, Engineering, and Medicine* found that 58 percent of women faculty and staff in academia had experienced sexual harassment, including gender harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion.
- Rates of harassment were highest in fields where women are most underrepresented: engineering, physics, and computer science.
- Women of color experience rates of harassment and discrimination that exceed those of white women. A 2021 study in the *Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering* found that Black women in STEM reported experiencing racial microaggressions at rates nearly double those of white women and gender microaggressions at rates comparable to white women, resulting in compounded burden.
- LGBTQ+ individuals in STEM report significant rates of exclusion and harassment. A 2021 survey published in *Science Advances* found that LGBTQ+ STEM professionals were more likely to experience career-limiting harassment and exclusion than their non-LGBTQ+ peers, and that approximately 30 percent considered leaving their field.
- A 2019 National Academies survey found that approximately 20 percent of undergraduate and graduate women in STEM had experienced sexual harassment by faculty or staff.

### Consequences

- Women who experience sexual harassment are 6.5 times more likely to leave their positions, according to the 2018 National Academies report.
- One in three women scientists reports having been sexually harassed during fieldwork, and harassment during field research is associated with higher rates of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms (Clancy et al., *PLOS ONE*, 2014).
- The estimated cost of sexual harassment to the U.S. scientific enterprise, in terms of talent loss and reduced productivity, is in the billions of dollars annually.

### Institutional Response

Most STEM institutions rely on Title IX compliance offices to handle harassment complaints. These offices have been criticized for:

- Conflicts of interest (protecting the institution rather than the complainant)
- Slow investigation timelines (averaging 6-12 months at many universities)
- Low rates of meaningful sanctions against perpetrators, particularly senior faculty who generate significant grant revenue
- Inadequate protection against retaliation

The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act included provisions requiring NSF-funded institutions to report findings of sexual harassment, but enforcement mechanisms remain limited.

## Funding Disparities

### NIH Grant Success Rates

A landmark 2011 study by Ginther et al. in *Science* found that Black applicants for NIH R01 research grants were approximately 10 percentage points less likely to receive funding than white applicants, even after controlling for education, training, prior research awards, and publication record. Follow-up studies by Hoppe et al. (2019) in *Science Advances* confirmed that the gap persists and identified topic choice as a contributing factor: Black scientists were more likely to propose research on topics (such as health disparities) that receive lower priority scores from study sections.

#### NIH R01 Award Rates by Race (2011-2020)

| Group | Award Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| White PIs | ~30% | Hoppe et al., 2019 |
| Black PIs | ~20% | Hoppe et al., 2019 |
| Hispanic PIs | ~25% | NIH Data Book, 2021 |
| Asian PIs | ~23% | NIH Data Book, 2021 |

NIH has acknowledged these disparities and launched the UNITE initiative in 2021 to identify and address structural racism in biomedical research funding.

### NSF Award Patterns

NSF does not publish equivalent disaggregated data on award rates by race, though internal analyses have identified similar patterns. NSF has committed to greater transparency and to evaluating its review processes for bias.

### Institutional Funding Concentration

Research funding is heavily concentrated among a small number of elite institutions. The top 100 research universities receive approximately 80 percent of all federal research funding. HBCUs, HSIs, and TCUs -- which are critical to producing underrepresented STEM graduates -- receive a disproportionately small share:

- HBCUs receive approximately 2 percent of total federal research funding despite producing 17 percent of Black STEM bachelor's degrees.
- The 10 highest-funded research universities receive more total R&D funding than all 107 HBCUs combined.

## Federal Diversity Programs

### NSF ADVANCE

Established in 2001, NSF ADVANCE supports institutional transformation to increase the participation and advancement of women in academic STEM careers. The program has funded more than 250 institutions with cumulative investments exceeding $500 million.

**Outcomes**: ADVANCE has been associated with measurable increases in the proportion of women STEM faculty at grantee institutions, improved policies for tenure clock extension and family leave, and greater awareness of implicit bias. However, gains have been concentrated at the institutions that received grants, and the broader academic STEM system has not changed at the same rate.

### NSF INCLUDES

Launched in 2016, NSF INCLUDES (Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science) is a comprehensive initiative to build collaborative networks that broaden participation in STEM. The program uses a collective impact framework to coordinate efforts across institutions, sectors, and regions.

**Outcomes**: INCLUDES has funded more than 100 collaborative projects and 5 national alliances. Evaluation of its systemic impact is ongoing, but early assessments suggest that the collaborative model shows promise for scaling interventions that work in individual institutions.

### NIH Diversity Supplements

NIH Research Supplements to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research provide additional funding to existing research grants to support individuals from underrepresented groups. These supplements fund undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and early-career investigators who join active research projects.

**Outcomes**: Diversity supplements have supported thousands of trainees since the program began in 1989. Studies show that supplement recipients are more likely to remain in biomedical research than comparable peers who did not receive supplements, though the effect varies by career stage and field.

### Other Federal Programs

| Program | Agency | Focus | Annual Funding (est.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) | NSF | Undergraduate STEM persistence | ~$50M |
| Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program | Education | Graduate school preparation | ~$56M |
| NSF S-STEM (Scholarships in STEM) | NSF | Need-based STEM scholarships | ~$120M |

## Current Political and Legal Landscape

The landscape for STEM diversity efforts has shifted significantly since 2023. The Supreme Court's 2023 decision in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* (SFFA) struck down race-conscious admissions at colleges and universities. While the ruling directly addresses admissions, its implications extend to:

- **Graduate admissions in STEM**: Programs that considered race as a factor in admissions decisions must be restructured.
- **Fellowship programs**: Race-targeted fellowship programs face legal challenges. Several NSF and DOE programs have already been modified to use race-neutral eligibility criteria.
- **Faculty diversity programs**: Cluster hiring and targeted recruitment programs are under scrutiny.
- **DEI infrastructure**: Several states have passed or proposed legislation restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at public universities, directly affecting STEM diversity offices and initiatives.

At the federal level, the political environment for diversity programs has become more contested. Congressional appropriations riders restricting the use of federal funds for "diversity statements" or "DEI training" in STEM have been proposed in multiple NDAA and appropriations bills since 2023.
