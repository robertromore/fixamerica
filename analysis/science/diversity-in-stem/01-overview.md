# Diversity in STEM: Overview

## Overview

The United States leads the world in scientific research and technological innovation, but its science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce does not reflect the diversity of its population. Women, Black, Hispanic, Native American, and other underrepresented groups remain significantly underrepresented at every level of the STEM pipeline -- from undergraduate enrollment to faculty positions to research leadership. This underrepresentation is not merely a matter of fairness. It represents a structural failure to develop the nation's full talent pool, constrains the quality and scope of scientific inquiry, and undermines the competitiveness of American science in a global market where talent is the decisive resource.

The numbers are stark. Women earn approximately 35 percent of STEM bachelor's degrees but hold only 28 percent of STEM jobs and occupy fewer than 25 percent of full professorships in STEM fields at research universities. Black Americans constitute 13.6 percent of the U.S. population but earn only 9 percent of STEM bachelor's degrees and hold 9 percent of STEM jobs. Hispanic Americans make up 19.1 percent of the population but earn only 16 percent of STEM bachelor's degrees and hold 8 percent of STEM jobs. Native Americans and Alaska Natives, at 1.3 percent of the population, earn less than 1 percent of STEM doctoral degrees. These gaps are not closing at a rate commensurate with demographic change, and in some fields -- notably computer science and engineering -- they have widened in recent years.

The problem extends beyond access. Those who do enter STEM fields face hostile climates, harassment, bias in hiring and promotion, inequitable access to mentorship and funding, and institutional cultures that systematically disadvantage those who do not fit the traditional mold. A 2018 National Academies report found that more than 50 percent of women faculty and staff in science, engineering, and medicine had experienced sexual harassment. These conditions drive talented people out of STEM at every career stage, compounding the pipeline losses that begin in K-12 education.

Federal agencies -- primarily the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Department of Energy (DOE), and NASA -- have invested billions in diversity programs over the past two decades, including NSF ADVANCE, NSF INCLUDES, NIH diversity supplements, and numerous pipeline programs targeting underrepresented minorities. These programs have produced measurable gains in specific contexts but have not altered the systemic patterns of underrepresentation. The gap between program-level success and system-level stagnation reveals a deeper problem: diversity initiatives operate at the margins of institutions whose core structures -- hiring, promotion, funding, and culture -- remain largely unchanged.

## Scope

This analysis covers the dimensions of diversity and inclusion in STEM fields:

- **Representation Gaps**: Quantitative data on the participation of women, racial and ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ individuals in STEM education and employment, from K-12 through senior leadership.
- **Pipeline and Pathways**: The educational trajectory from K-12 through doctoral programs and postdoctoral positions, identifying where attrition occurs and why.
- **Workplace Climate**: Harassment, discrimination, bias, microaggressions, and hostile environments in academic and industry STEM settings.
- **Funding Equity**: Disparities in research funding by principal investigator demographics, including grant success rates, award sizes, and funding agency practices.
- **Institutional Culture**: How norms around meritocracy, objectivity, and "culture fit" perpetuate exclusion while appearing neutral.
- **Federal Programs**: Assessment of existing federal diversity initiatives (NSF ADVANCE, NSF INCLUDES, NIH diversity supplements, LSAMP, McNair, S-STEM) and their effectiveness.
- **Intersectionality**: How race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and other identities interact to compound disadvantage.
- **International Comparison**: How the U.S. approach to STEM diversity compares to practices in Europe, East Asia, and other research-intensive nations.

## Core Tensions

- **Merit vs. Equity**: Defenders of the status quo argue that STEM should be governed purely by merit, while critics argue that existing systems define and measure "merit" in ways that reflect and reproduce existing power structures.
- **Individual vs. Structural Interventions**: Pipeline programs target individuals (scholarships, mentoring, training), but the barriers are often structural (hiring criteria, funding mechanisms, promotion standards). Individual interventions alone cannot change structural outcomes.
- **Diversity vs. Excellence**: Some argue that diversity initiatives compromise scientific quality. Research consistently shows the opposite -- diverse teams produce more innovative and rigorous science -- but the perception persists and shapes institutional resistance.
- **Institutional Autonomy vs. Federal Mandates**: Universities resist external mandates on hiring, promotion, and culture. Federal agencies must balance their leverage as research funders against the tradition of academic self-governance.
- **Short-Term Programs vs. Long-Term Culture Change**: Most federal programs are grant-funded with finite durations. Culture change requires sustained, generational effort that outlasts any grant cycle.
- **Representation vs. Inclusion**: Increasing the numbers of underrepresented groups without changing the culture they enter may produce attrition rather than lasting diversification.

## Key Questions

1. Why have decades of federal investment in STEM diversity programs failed to close representation gaps at the systemic level, despite producing positive results in individual programs?
2. What structural features of the academic STEM pipeline -- admissions, mentoring, qualifying exams, hiring, tenure, funding -- systematically filter out underrepresented groups?
3. How does harassment and hostile climate in STEM workplaces interact with other forms of disadvantage to drive attrition?
4. Can federal research funding agencies use their leverage to drive meaningful institutional change, or does this overreach academic freedom?
5. What policies would most effectively address the intersection of race and gender disadvantage in STEM, particularly for women of color who face compounded barriers?

## Vision of Success

A successful approach to diversity in STEM would:

- **Close Representation Gaps**: The demographic composition of the STEM workforce at all levels -- from entry-level positions to full professorships to research leadership -- reflects the demographic composition of the nation within a generation.
- **Eliminate Harassment**: No one leaves STEM because of harassment, discrimination, or hostile climate. Institutions have effective, trustworthy systems for preventing, detecting, and addressing misconduct.
- **Achieve Funding Equity**: Grant success rates, award sizes, and total research funding do not vary by the race, gender, or institutional affiliation of the principal investigator after controlling for research quality.
- **Transform Institutional Culture**: STEM institutions define and measure excellence in ways that recognize diverse approaches, methodologies, and questions. "Culture fit" is no longer a mechanism for reproducing homogeneity.
- **Sustain the Pipeline**: Underrepresented students who enter STEM fields persist and advance at rates comparable to their majority peers, with support structures that address both academic and non-academic barriers.
- **Strengthen American Science**: The United States produces more innovative, more rigorous, and more impactful research because it draws on the full talent and perspective of its diverse population.
