# Diversity in STEM: History

## The Exclusion Era (Pre-1960s)

### Formal Barriers

For most of American history, access to scientific education and careers was formally restricted by race and gender. These restrictions were not incidental; they were codified in law, institutional policy, and professional practice.

- **Women**: Most major research universities did not admit women to graduate programs in science and engineering until the mid-20th century. Harvard did not award doctoral degrees to women through its own graduate school until 1963 (women could earn degrees through Radcliffe). MIT admitted its first female student in 1871 but maintained informal quotas on women's enrollment in engineering well into the 1960s.
- **Black Americans**: Segregation excluded Black students from most research universities. The Morrill Act of 1890 established "separate but equal" land-grant colleges for Black students, creating the foundation for HBCUs, but these institutions received a fraction of the funding allocated to white land-grant colleges. In 1954, the year of *Brown v. Board of Education*, fewer than 50 Black Americans held doctoral degrees in the natural sciences.
- **Hispanic, Native American, and Asian Americans**: Access varied by region and institution, but all faced formal or informal barriers. Asian Americans were excluded from many institutions by quotas, while Hispanic and Native American access was limited by geographic isolation, language barriers, and underfunded school systems.
- **Professional societies**: Major scientific organizations, including the American Chemical Society and the American Physical Society, had no formal membership barriers by race, but their annual meetings were held in segregated hotels, effectively excluding Black scientists from professional networking and collaboration.

### Pioneering Exceptions

Despite these barriers, individual scientists from excluded groups made extraordinary contributions:

- **Ernest Everett Just** (1883-1941), a Black marine biologist, conducted pioneering research on cell fertilization at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, though he was largely denied access to faculty positions at research universities.
- **Chien-Shiung Wu** (1912-1997), a Chinese-American physicist, conducted the experiment that disproved the law of conservation of parity -- one of the most important physics experiments of the 20th century -- but was not awarded the Nobel Prize that went to her male colleagues for the theoretical prediction.
- **Katherine Johnson**, **Dorothy Vaughan**, and **Mary Jackson**, Black mathematicians and engineers at NASA, performed critical calculations for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs while working in a segregated facility.
- **David Blackwell** (1919-2010), a Black mathematician, became the first Black member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1965 and made foundational contributions to statistics and game theory.

## The Civil Rights and Feminist Eras (1960s-1980s)

### Legal Foundations

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and subsequent legislation established the legal framework for addressing discrimination in STEM education and employment:

- **Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (1964)**: Prohibited discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in federally funded programs, including university research and education.
- **Title IX (1972)**: Prohibited sex-based discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funding. While best known for athletics, Title IX has had profound effects on women's access to STEM education.
- **Executive Order 11246 (1965)**: Required federal contractors, including universities receiving federal research funding, to take affirmative action to ensure equal employment opportunity.
- **The Equal Employment Opportunity Act (1972)**: Extended Title VII protections to educational institutions.

### Early Federal Programs

The federal government began investing in STEM diversity in the 1970s and 1980s:

- **NSF Minority Programs**: NSF launched its first programs specifically targeting minority participation in science in the 1970s, including the Minority Graduate Fellowship Program (later renamed the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program with diversity priorities).
- **NIH Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC)**: Established in 1971, MARC provided research training support for students at minority-serving institutions.
- **NIH Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS)**: Launched in 1972, MBRS funded research capacity-building at institutions with significant minority enrollment.
- **McNair Program (1986)**: The Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program, named after the Black physicist and astronaut who died in the Challenger disaster, provided preparation for graduate study to first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students.

### Affirmative Action in Higher Education

The Supreme Court's decision in *Regents of the University of California v. Bakke* (1978) struck down racial quotas in university admissions but permitted the consideration of race as one factor among many. This framework governed STEM admissions for decades, enabling graduate programs in science and engineering to consider applicants' racial and ethnic backgrounds as part of holistic review.

### Women's Movement in Science

The feminist movement produced significant challenges to the exclusion of women from STEM:

- The Association for Women in Science (AWIS) was founded in 1971 to advocate for women's participation in science.
- The Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) programs emerged at universities across the country in the 1970s and 1980s.
- NSF established the Program for Women in Science in 1981, which later evolved into the ADVANCE program.
- Despite these efforts, progress was slow. Women's share of STEM bachelor's degrees rose from approximately 15 percent in 1970 to approximately 30 percent by 1990, but the rate of increase decelerated significantly in the 1990s.

## The Broadening Participation Era (1990s-2010s)

### Shifting Language and Framework

The framing of the problem shifted from "discrimination" to "broadening participation" during this period. Key developments:

- **National Science Board, "A Companion to Science and Engineering Indicators 2004"**: Warned that the United States could not maintain its scientific competitiveness without drawing on its full demographic potential.
- **NSF coined "broadening participation"** as a strategic priority, framing STEM diversity as a national competitiveness issue rather than solely an equity concern.
- **National Academies, "Beyond Bias and Barriers: Fulfilling the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering" (2007)**: A landmark report documenting the structural barriers facing women in academic STEM and recommending comprehensive institutional reform.

### NSF ADVANCE (2001-Present)

NSF ADVANCE, launched in 2001, represented a paradigm shift from supporting individual women to changing the institutions that excluded them. The program funded institutional transformation grants of $3-5 million over 5 years, requiring universities to identify and reform the specific policies, practices, and cultures that impeded women's advancement. Key innovations:

- Implicit bias training for hiring and promotion committees
- Tenure clock extension for childbirth and caregiving
- Dual-career hiring programs
- Departmental climate assessment tools
- Mentoring network development

By 2020, ADVANCE had funded more than 250 institutions and contributed to measurable increases in women's representation among STEM faculty at grantee institutions.

### Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) (1991-Present)

Established in 1991 and named after Congressman Louis Stokes, LSAMP created multi-institutional alliances to increase the number of underrepresented minority students earning STEM bachelor's degrees. The program has grown to 56 alliances involving more than 700 institutions and is associated with a significant increase in minority STEM bachelor's degree production at member institutions.

### The Rise of Implicit Bias Research

Research on implicit bias -- unconscious associations that affect judgment -- transformed the understanding of how discrimination operates in STEM:

- **Project Implicit (1998)**: Anthony Greenwald, Mahzarin Banaji, and Brian Nosek launched the Implicit Association Test (IAT), revealing widespread unconscious associations linking science with male and white identities.
- **Moss-Racusin et al., "Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students," *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* (2012)**: A randomized controlled trial demonstrating that STEM faculty rated identical applications lower when they bore a female name, offering lower salaries and less mentoring.
- **Milkman et al., "What Happens Before? A Field Experiment Exploring How Pay and Representation Differentially Shape Bias on the Pathway Into Organizations," *Journal of Applied Psychology* (2015)**: Found that faculty were less likely to respond to prospective graduate student inquiries from women and minorities.

### The Leaky Pipeline Model

Research during this period established the "leaky pipeline" as the dominant metaphor for STEM attrition. Key findings:

- Women and minorities leave STEM at every transition point: high school to college, bachelor's to graduate school, graduate school to postdoctoral position, postdoc to faculty, and assistant professor to tenure.
- The attrition is not explained by ability or interest differences. Studies controlling for academic preparation and expressed interest consistently find that climate and institutional factors drive the differential attrition.
- The pipeline metaphor was later criticized for implying a single linear path and ignoring the structural factors that push people out. Alternative frameworks ("pathway," "ecosystem") gained traction but the fundamental attrition data remained robust.

## The #MeToo Reckoning and SFFA Era (2017-Present)

### Harassment in STEM

The #MeToo movement, beginning in 2017, brought unprecedented public attention to sexual harassment in STEM:

- High-profile cases of sexual harassment by prominent scientists at institutions including UC Berkeley, Caltech, Boston University, and Dartmouth revealed patterns of institutional protection of perpetrators.
- The 2018 National Academies report *Sexual Harassment of Women in Academic Science, Engineering, and Medicine* provided comprehensive evidence that harassment was systemic, not isolated, and recommended sweeping institutional reforms.
- In response, NSF implemented a new policy in 2018 requiring grantee institutions to report findings of sexual harassment by principal investigators. This was the first time a federal funding agency used its grant-making authority to address harassment.
- The 2022 CHIPS and Science Act codified and expanded NSF's anti-harassment provisions and directed other federal agencies to develop similar policies.

### NSF INCLUDES (2016-Present)

NSF INCLUDES, launched in 2016, represented the agency's most ambitious attempt at systemic change. Unlike previous programs that funded individual institutions, INCLUDES created collaborative networks using a collective impact framework:

- Design and Development Launch Pilots tested collaborative approaches at the local level.
- Alliances brought together multiple institutions and organizations around specific broadening participation challenges (e.g., Native American STEM success, community college transfer, STEM faculty diversity).
- The INCLUDES National Network connected all projects and alliances into a coordinated infrastructure.

### *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* (2023)

The Supreme Court's June 2023 decision in *SFFA v. Harvard* struck down race-conscious admissions at colleges and universities, overturning the framework established by *Bakke* (1978) and *Grutter v. Bollinger* (2003). The decision:

- Directly prohibits the consideration of race as a factor in admissions decisions at universities receiving federal funding.
- Has prompted the restructuring of STEM graduate admissions processes at universities nationwide.
- Has chilled the use of race-targeted criteria in fellowship programs, hiring initiatives, and pipeline programs, even where the legal applicability of the ruling is uncertain.
- Has emboldened legislative efforts at the state level to restrict or defund DEI programs and offices at public universities, directly affecting STEM diversity infrastructure.

### State-Level DEI Restrictions (2023-Present)

Following the SFFA decision, multiple states have enacted or proposed legislation restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at public universities:

- **Florida**: The "Stop WOKE Act" (2022) and subsequent legislation restricted DEI training and diversity statements at public universities.
- **Texas**: SB 17 (2023) prohibited DEI offices and programs at public universities, requiring institutions to dismantle existing infrastructure.
- **Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Utah**: Similar legislation enacted or pending as of 2025.

These state-level restrictions directly affect STEM diversity programs, including NSF ADVANCE-funded initiatives, faculty cluster hiring programs, and student support services.

### NIH UNITE Initiative (2021-Present)

In response to persistent racial disparities in NIH funding, NIH launched the UNITE initiative in 2021 with five committees focused on:

- Ending structural racism in NIH-supported science
- Workforce diversity
- Evaluating research topics and funding processes for bias
- Internal NIH accountability
- Extramural community engagement

UNITE produced recommendations for changes to peer review, grant evaluation criteria, and funding mechanisms for minority-serving institutions, though implementation has been uneven and politically contested.
