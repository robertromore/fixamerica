# Diversity in STEM: Stakeholders

## Overview

STEM diversity policy affects a broad ecosystem of individuals, institutions, and organizations. The stakeholder landscape is shaped by power asymmetries -- those who set the rules of the STEM system (funding agencies, university administrators, senior faculty) are often demographically different from those most affected by its failures. Understanding who has a stake, what they want, and how much power they exercise is essential for designing reforms that can attract sufficient support to be enacted and sustained.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Underrepresented STEM Students and Trainees

**Interest**: Equitable access to quality STEM education, mentoring, research opportunities, financial support, and a campus climate free from harassment and discrimination.

**Power**: Low-to-moderate. Students are transient members of institutions and have limited formal power. Their influence operates through collective organizing (student associations, protests, public testimony), social media, and increasingly through their market value as recruits in a competitive talent landscape. Graduate students have some leverage through their labor (as research and teaching assistants) but are highly dependent on individual faculty advisors.

**Key Concerns**:

- Access to advanced coursework and research opportunities
- Financial support (stipends, fellowships, tuition)
- Mentoring relationships that are supportive and equitable
- Protection from harassment and discrimination
- A sense of belonging and identity in STEM

### Underrepresented STEM Faculty and Researchers

**Interest**: Equitable hiring, promotion, tenure, funding, and freedom from harassment. Recognition of the diversity-related service they perform. Research support at institutions where they are employed.

**Power**: Moderate. Individual faculty have limited leverage, but their collective voice is amplified through professional associations, advocacy organizations, and their role as mentors and role models. Their departures from institutions and from STEM fields constitute a measurable signal of systemic failure.

**Key Concerns**:

- Fair evaluation in hiring and tenure processes
- Equitable access to research funding (particularly the NIH R01 gap)
- Relief from disproportionate service burden ("cultural taxation")
- Protection from harassment and retaliation
- Adequate research infrastructure at minority-serving institutions

### Minority-Serving Institutions (HBCUs, HSIs, TCUs)

**Interest**: Adequate federal research funding, recognition of their role in producing underrepresented STEM graduates, capacity-building for research infrastructure, and equitable treatment in federal funding competitions.

**Power**: Moderate and growing. MSIs collectively educate a disproportionate share of underrepresented STEM students. Their political influence is exercised through congressional delegations (particularly the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus), through organizations like the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU), and through their alumni networks.

**Key Concerns**:

- The dramatic funding gap between MSIs and predominantly white research universities
- Capacity to compete for federal research grants
- Recognition in federal policy as partners rather than afterthoughts
- Retaining faculty who are recruited away by larger institutions
- Infrastructure and equipment needs

### Federal Funding Agencies (NSF, NIH, DOE, NASA)

**Interest**: Maintaining the health, diversity, and quality of the national research enterprise. Meeting statutory mandates for broadening participation. Demonstrating accountability for taxpayer investment in research.

**Power**: High. Federal agencies distribute more than $160 billion annually in research funding and set the terms and conditions under which that funding is spent. They can require diversity plans, mandate reporting, and condition funding on institutional behavior.

**Key Concerns**:

- Ensuring that the best science is funded regardless of investigator demographics
- Maintaining the integrity and legitimacy of the peer review process
- Demonstrating that broadening participation investments produce measurable returns
- Navigating the post-SFFA legal landscape for race-conscious programs
- Balancing diversity objectives with academic freedom and institutional autonomy

## Secondary Stakeholders

### Research Universities

**Interest**: Maintaining faculty quality and research productivity, competing for federal grants, attracting top graduate students, and managing reputational risk related to diversity and harassment.

**Power**: High. Research universities are the primary employers of STEM faculty, the primary trainers of doctoral students, and the primary performers of federally funded research. Their policies on hiring, promotion, tenure, and climate set the terms of STEM careers.

**Key Concerns**:

- Attracting and retaining diverse faculty in a competitive market
- Complying with evolving legal requirements (Title IX, SFFA, state DEI restrictions)
- Managing the tension between diversity goals and faculty governance
- Protecting institutional reputation
- Maintaining competitive positions in research funding rankings

### K-12 Education Systems

**Interest**: Preparing students from all backgrounds for STEM higher education and careers.

**Power**: Moderate. K-12 systems shape the pipeline but are fragmented across approximately 13,000 school districts with highly variable resources. State-level policies on curriculum, testing, and teacher preparation have significant influence.

**Key Concerns**:

- Unequal access to advanced STEM coursework
- Teacher preparation and recruitment in high-need schools
- Early identification and support of STEM talent in underrepresented communities
- Integration of computational thinking and data science across the curriculum

### STEM Professional Societies

**Interest**: Advancing their discipline, supporting their members, and demonstrating commitment to diversity and inclusion.

**Power**: Moderate. Professional societies (American Chemical Society, American Physical Society, IEEE, Association for Computing Machinery, etc.) set professional standards, organize conferences, publish journals, and provide career development resources. Their diversity statements and programs influence institutional norms.

**Key Concerns**:

- Membership demographics and conference accessibility
- Publishing pipeline (reviewer and editor diversity)
- Professional development for underrepresented groups
- Codes of conduct and anti-harassment policies at professional events

### STEM Industry Employers

**Interest**: Access to a diverse, skilled STEM workforce. Corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion goals. Customer and market diversity.

**Power**: High. Major technology, pharmaceutical, engineering, and defense companies employ the majority of STEM workers. Their hiring practices, workplace cultures, compensation structures, and diversity programs have direct influence on STEM career outcomes.

**Key Concerns**:

- Talent pipeline: sufficient graduates from underrepresented groups in high-demand fields
- Retention: reducing attrition of underrepresented employees
- Innovation: leveraging diverse perspectives for product development and problem-solving
- Regulatory and legal compliance
- Public accountability (diversity reports, shareholder pressure)

### Advocacy and Civil Rights Organizations

**Interest**: Advancing equity in STEM as part of broader social justice goals.

**Power**: Moderate. Organizations like the NAACP, National Urban League, UnidosUS, American Association of University Women (AAUW), and Society of Women Engineers (SWE) exercise influence through public advocacy, litigation, congressional testimony, and coalition-building.

**Key Concerns**:

- Systemic barriers to STEM participation for communities of color
- Sexual harassment and gender discrimination in STEM
- Federal program funding and accountability
- Legal threats to diversity programs post-SFFA

## Tertiary Stakeholders

### Congressional Committees

The committees with primary jurisdiction over STEM diversity policy are:

- **House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology**: Authorization of NSF and OSTP programs
- **Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation**: Authorization of NSF programs and science policy
- **House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees**: Funding for NSF, NIH, DOE, NASA
- **Senate HELP Committee**: Higher education policy, Title IX
- **House Committee on Education and the Workforce**: Higher education policy

### State Legislatures

State legislatures exercise growing influence through:

- DEI restriction legislation affecting public universities
- Funding for state university systems and community colleges
- K-12 curriculum standards and teacher preparation requirements
- State-level scholarship and pipeline programs

### General Public and Taxpayers

The public has an indirect but significant stake in STEM diversity as taxpayers who fund federal research and as citizens who benefit from the scientific and technological innovation that a fully utilized talent pool would produce.
