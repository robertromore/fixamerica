# Diversity in STEM: Actions

## Overview

Improving diversity in STEM requires action from citizens, communities, institutions, and organizations at every level. While federal agencies and universities are the primary decision-makers, public awareness, advocacy, community engagement, and individual practice changes play critical roles in building the political will for reform and directly supporting underrepresented individuals in STEM.

## What Citizens Can Do

### Learn and Understand

- **Understand the data.** Read the NSF's "Diversity and STEM" report (available at <https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf23315/>) to understand the scope of underrepresentation. The report is free, publicly accessible, and updated biennially.
- **Learn about structural barriers.** The 2018 National Academies report on sexual harassment in STEM (available at <https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24994/>) documents the systemic nature of harassment and climate problems. The 2007 National Academies report *Beyond Bias and Barriers* remains essential reading on structural barriers to women's advancement.
- **Recognize implicit bias.** Take the Implicit Association Tests at <https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/> to understand your own unconscious associations. This is not about guilt; it is about awareness.
- **Understand the post-SFFA landscape.** The Supreme Court's 2023 decision in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* has fundamentally changed the legal framework for diversity efforts. Understanding what is and is not permissible under current law is essential for effective advocacy.

### Advocate

- **Contact elected representatives.** Call, write, or email your senators and House member about STEM diversity issues:
    - Urge support for increased funding for NSF ADVANCE, LSAMP, NIH diversity supplements, and other proven programs.
    - Advocate against state-level legislation restricting DEI programs at universities.
    - Support the STEM Opportunity Act and other legislation that addresses funding equity for minority-serving institutions.
    - Push for anti-harassment provisions in federal research funding.
- **Testify at state and federal levels.** When Congress or state legislatures hold hearings on STEM education, research funding, or higher education policy, citizens can submit written statements for the record. Personal stories from underrepresented STEM professionals are particularly powerful.
- **Engage with professional associations.** If you are a member of a STEM professional society (ACS, APS, IEEE, ACM, AAAS, etc.), advocate within that organization for stronger diversity initiatives, equitable conference policies, and inclusive publishing practices.
- **Support legal defense.** Contribute to organizations that are defending diversity programs from legal challenges and working to develop legally sustainable approaches in the post-SFFA environment.

### Support Directly

- **Mentor.** If you are a STEM professional, volunteer as a mentor for underrepresented students through organizations like MESA, SACNAS, NSBE, or your institution's mentoring programs. Effective mentoring is one of the highest-impact interventions available.
- **Hire equitably.** If you are an employer or hiring manager in STEM, examine your hiring practices for bias. Use structured interviews, standardized evaluation criteria, and diverse hiring panels. Do not rely on "culture fit" as a selection criterion.
- **Write inclusive letters of recommendation.** Research shows that letters of recommendation for women and minorities are systematically shorter, less enthusiastic, and more likely to emphasize communal rather than agentic qualities. Use evidence-based letter-writing practices (available from the ADVANCE Resource and Coordination Network).
- **Cite diversely.** When writing research papers, review your citation practices to ensure that relevant work by women and minority scholars is not overlooked. Citation analysis tools can help identify gaps.

## What Educators Can Do

### K-12

- **Expand access.** Advocate within your school or district for offering AP STEM courses, particularly AP Computer Science, at all high schools. If your school does not offer these courses, work with administration and school board to make them available.
- **Identify talent broadly.** Use multiple criteria to identify STEM talent, not just standardized test scores. Creativity, curiosity, persistence, and problem-solving ability are not captured by tests but are essential to scientific success.
- **Counter stereotypes.** Integrate the contributions of diverse scientists into everyday instruction, not as special-topic sidebars but as part of the standard curriculum. Use growth mindset language that emphasizes effort and learning over innate ability.
- **Create belonging.** Implement evidence-based belonging interventions (values affirmation, growth mindset framing, social belonging exercises) that have been shown to narrow achievement gaps in controlled studies.

### Higher Education

- **Reform admissions.** If you serve on a graduate admissions committee, advocate for making the GRE optional, using holistic review, and evaluating research potential rather than pedigree. Push for structured evaluation rubrics.
- **Restructure mentoring.** Establish mentoring committees for all doctoral students rather than relying on a single advisor. Ensure that mentoring includes career development, not just technical training.
- **Address climate.** If you observe harassment, microaggressions, or exclusionary behavior, intervene. Report through appropriate channels. If you are a department chair or program director, conduct regular climate assessments and act on the results.
- **Recognize service.** If you serve on tenure and promotion committees, ensure that diversity-related service is recognized and valued, not penalized. Advocate for explicit criteria that credit mentoring, outreach, and broader impacts.
- **Support financially.** Advocate for doctoral stipends at or above the local living wage. Support the elimination of application fees. Create emergency funds for students facing financial crises.

## What Institutions Can Do

### Universities and Research Organizations

- **Conduct climate surveys.** Implement biennial climate surveys assessing the experiences of faculty, staff, and students from underrepresented groups. Publish results and develop action plans based on findings.
- **Reform hiring practices.** Adopt cluster hiring, broad advertising, structured evaluation rubrics, and implicit bias training for search committees. Track hiring outcomes by demographic group.
- **Establish independent investigation.** Create an independent office for investigating harassment complaints, separate from the Title IX compliance office, with investigators who are not employed by the institution and who specialize in STEM workplace dynamics.
- **Build accountability.** Set measurable diversity goals at the departmental level, track progress annually, and hold department leadership accountable for outcomes. Do not rely on voluntary individual action to produce institutional change.
- **Invest in MSIs.** If you are a research university, establish genuine partnerships with minority-serving institutions that include faculty exchanges, shared research infrastructure, and joint mentoring programs -- not just pipeline recruitment.

### Federal Agencies

- **Reform peer review.** Implement blinded review pilots, diversify review panels, and assess whether certain research topics receive biased evaluations.
- **Invest in MSIs.** Create and scale dedicated funding streams for research capacity-building at HBCUs, HSIs, and TCUs.
- **Enforce accountability.** Require funded institutions to report demographic data on hiring, promotion, attrition, and climate. Use these data to inform future funding decisions.
- **Coordinate programs.** Reduce duplication and fragmentation among federal STEM diversity programs through inter-agency coordination led by OSTP.

### Professional Societies

- **Reform conferences.** Establish and enforce codes of conduct at all professional meetings. Provide childcare at conferences. Offer virtual participation options.
- **Diversify leadership.** Set targets for the demographic composition of editorial boards, award committees, and governing boards. Track progress.
- **Publish equitably.** Examine publishing pipelines for bias. Track acceptance rates by author demographics. Diversify reviewer pools.

## What Employers Can Do

### Technology and Industry

- **Track and publish data.** Continue and expand annual diversity reports that disaggregate workforce data by role, level, and demographic group. Include attrition data, not just hiring data.
- **Address retention.** Focus on retaining underrepresented employees, not just recruiting them. Conduct exit interviews, analyze attrition patterns, and address climate and culture issues.
- **Support ERGs.** Fund and empower Employee Resource Groups for underrepresented communities. Give ERGs a voice in policy decisions.
- **Invest in pipeline.** Fund STEM education programs in underserved communities, internships for underrepresented students, and partnerships with HBCUs and HSIs.
- **Pay equitably.** Conduct annual pay equity audits and close any gaps by race, gender, and other demographic dimensions.
