# Diversity in STEM: Reform Roadmap

## Overview

Transforming STEM diversity from the current state of persistent underrepresentation to a system that fully develops and utilizes the nation's talent requires a phased approach that sequences actions based on urgency, legal feasibility, political viability, and implementation complexity. The post-SFFA legal environment and the political contestation of DEI programs require careful strategic sequencing -- leading with reforms that have broad support and strong legal foundations, building momentum for structural changes, and sustaining effort over the decade-plus timescale required for generational change.

## Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on actions that can be taken within existing authorities, do not require race-conscious criteria (and are therefore legally durable post-SFFA), and have broad bipartisan appeal.

### Administrative Actions (No Legislation Required)

- **Expand GRE-optional policies**: Federal agencies (NSF, NIH, DOE) issue guidance encouraging or requiring that funded graduate programs evaluate the GRE's predictive validity and consider making it optional. This is a race-neutral intervention that disproportionately benefits underrepresented groups.
- **Peer review reform pilots**: NSF and NIH launch blinded review pilots in 2-3 program areas, evaluating proposals without knowledge of investigator identity or institutional affiliation.
- **Climate survey mandate**: NSF and NIH require all institutions receiving more than $10 million in annual research funding to conduct biennial climate surveys and publish anonymized aggregate results.
- **Harassment reporting expansion**: All federal research agencies adopt the CHIPS and Science Act reporting framework, requiring funded institutions to report harassment findings against PIs.
- **MSI partnership requirements**: Federal agencies require that new large-scale center grants include meaningful MSI partnerships with defined research roles and minimum funding shares.

### Quick Legislative Wins

- **Noyce Scholarship expansion**: Increase annual appropriations for the NSF Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program by 50 percent ($30 million increase) to expand the pipeline of STEM teachers for high-need schools.
- **Application fee waivers**: Direct NSF and NIH to prohibit funded graduate programs from charging application fees to applicants who qualify for fee waivers.
- **Stipend floor**: Establish a minimum doctoral stipend for federally funded graduate research assistants at the local living wage level, as calculated by MIT's Living Wage Calculator.

### Success Metrics (Year 2)

| Metric | Target | Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| STEM graduate programs with GRE-optional admissions | 60% of federally funded programs | ~40% (est.) |
| Institutions conducting biennial climate surveys | 100% of those receiving >$10M | ~30% (est.) |
| Federal research agencies with harassment reporting requirements | All major agencies | NSF only |
| Noyce scholars funded annually | 1,500 | ~1,000 |
| Blinded review pilots launched | 5 programs across NSF/NIH | 0 |

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

This phase addresses the deeper structural barriers -- funding inequity, hiring practices, and institutional culture -- through a combination of legislation and agency policy.

### Legislative Actions

- **STEM Opportunity Act**: Enact comprehensive legislation (see [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md)) that addresses funding equity for MSIs, peer review reform, anti-harassment enforcement, and data transparency.
- **MSI Research Capacity Fund**: Appropriate $500 million annually for a dedicated research infrastructure fund for HBCUs, HSIs, and TCUs.
- **National STEM Workforce Data System**: Fund the development of a longitudinal tracking system that follows individuals from undergraduate enrollment through career outcomes, disaggregated by demographics and institutional type.

### Agency Policy

- **Hiring practice guidelines**: NSF and NIH issue guidelines for faculty hiring at funded institutions, recommending cluster hiring, structured evaluation rubrics, and implicit bias training for search committees. Compliance is voluntary but tracked.
- **Tenure criteria reform**: Federal agencies issue guidance encouraging funded institutions to recognize diversity-related service, mentoring, and broader impacts contributions in tenure and promotion evaluations.
- **Indirect cost rate reform**: OMB revises Uniform Guidance (2 CFR 200) to provide favorable indirect cost rate treatment for MSIs developing their research infrastructure, increasing the competitiveness of their grant applications.

### Institutional Initiatives

- **Bridge program expansion**: Scale proven bridge programs (Fisk-Vanderbilt, Cal-Bridge, APS Bridge) to cover all major STEM fields, with federal co-funding from NSF, NIH, and DOE.
- **Cohort mentoring models**: Fund institutional adoption of structured cohort-based mentoring programs for underrepresented graduate students at the top 100 research universities.
- **Independent harassment investigation**: Institutions receiving federal research funding establish independent investigation offices for research misconduct and harassment complaints, separate from compliance offices.

### Success Metrics (Year 5)

| Metric | Target | Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| Federal research funding to MSIs | 5% of total federal R&D | ~2% |
| NIH R01 award rate gap (Black vs. White PIs) | <5 percentage points | ~10 percentage points |
| Women's share of STEM assistant professorships | 42% | 38% |
| STEM doctoral stipend (median) | 100% of local living wage | ~85% (est.) |
| Institutions with independent harassment investigation | 75% of R1 universities | ~15% (est.) |
| National STEM workforce data system operational | Yes | No |

## Phase 3: Institutional Transformation (Years 6-10)

This phase focuses on deep culture change, sustained accountability, and the integration of diversity into the fundamental structures of STEM institutions.

### Sustained Federal Investment

- **Reauthorize and scale programs**: Reauthorize the STEM Opportunity Act with increased funding based on Phase 2 evaluation data. Scale successful programs and sunset ineffective ones.
- **MSI research parity**: Increase the MSI Research Capacity Fund to $1 billion annually, targeting research-intensive programs at HBCUs, HSIs, and TCUs that can compete for major federal grants.
- **K-12 pipeline continuation**: Maintain expanded investment in Noyce, MESA, LSAMP, and other pipeline programs that feed the higher education system.

### Culture Change

- **Departmental diversity audits**: Require all departments at institutions receiving federal research funding to conduct triennial diversity audits examining hiring, promotion, attrition, funding, service burden, and climate, with results reported to institutional leadership and federal funders.
- **Leadership development**: Fund programs that prepare underrepresented STEM professionals for leadership positions (department chairs, deans, center directors, agency program officers).
- **Professional society reform**: Work with major professional societies to reform conference cultures, publishing pipelines, and award criteria to be more inclusive.

### Accountability and Evaluation

- **Conditional funding**: Begin conditioning a portion of institutional federal research funding on demonstrated progress toward equity goals, using metrics developed during Phase 2 and tracked through the national data system.
- **Program evaluation cycle**: Complete comprehensive evaluations of all major federally funded STEM diversity programs, publishing results and using findings to guide reauthorization decisions.
- **Longitudinal outcome tracking**: Use the national data system to track cohort-level outcomes for underrepresented STEM students and researchers, identifying where interventions are working and where gaps persist.

### Success Metrics (Year 10)

| Metric | Target | Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| Women's share of STEM full professorships | 35% | 23% |
| Black/Hispanic share of STEM doctorates | Proportional to population (+/- 3 pp) | -5 to -10 pp below proportionality |
| NIH R01 funding equity | No statistically significant gap by race | ~10 pp gap |
| Federal R&D funding to MSIs | 8% of total | ~2% |
| STEM faculty reporting positive climate (by group) | >80% across all demographic groups | ~60% for URM groups (est.) |
| Institutions with meaningful harassment accountability | 90% of R1 universities | ~15% (est.) |

## Risk Factors and Contingencies

### Political Risk

- **DEI backlash**: If state-level DEI restrictions expand to include restrictions on federal programs, Phase 2 and 3 reforms may need to be restructured around race-neutral mechanisms (socioeconomic criteria, institutional type, geographic factors) that achieve similar outcomes.
- **Congressional opposition**: If Congress restricts appropriations for diversity programs, agencies may need to integrate diversity objectives into existing program authorities rather than creating new dedicated programs.
- **Legal challenges**: Ongoing litigation related to *SFFA* may further constrain race-conscious interventions. Contingency planning should ensure that all reforms have race-neutral alternatives that can be activated if legal constraints tighten.

### Implementation Risk

- **Institutional resistance**: Research universities may resist mandatory reporting, climate surveys, and accountability mechanisms. Phasing requirements (voluntary adoption in Years 1-2, conditional in Years 3-5, mandatory in Years 6-10) allows institutions time to adapt.
- **Data infrastructure**: Building the national STEM workforce data system is technically complex and will require sustained investment and inter-agency coordination. Delays in this system would impair the evaluation infrastructure for Phase 3.
- **Workforce capacity**: Expanding diversity programs requires qualified staff -- program managers, evaluators, mentors, investigators. Workforce development for these roles must be planned in parallel.
