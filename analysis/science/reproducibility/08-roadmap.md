- **Milestones**:
    - International accord on reproducibility standards for publicly funded research
    - Cross-national replication projects in key fields
    - Harmonized data sharing and pre-registration standards across major funding agencies

#### 3.4 Sustained Replication Infrastructure

| Compliance without substance (performative adoption) | High | Medium | Develop enforcement mechanisms and audit tools |
| Political backlash against mandates | Medium | High | Frame reforms as efficiency and accountability measures |
| Researcher burnout from additional requirements | Medium | Medium | Invest in infrastructure that reduces compliance burden |
| Disciplinary resistance from non-experimental fields | Medium | Medium | Develop field-specific standards rather than one-size-fits-all |
| Insufficient funding for implementation | Medium | High | Build bipartisan support based on fiscal responsibility |
| Unintended consequences of statistical reform | Low | Medium | Pilot new standards before broad adoption |
