# Reproducibility: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes research reproducibility reform through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints. Research reproducibility is a relatively low-salience political issue compared to topics like health care or immigration, which means positions are less polarized and coalitions may be more flexible than on higher-profile policy questions.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of 2026-02-05)

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Stated concern for fiscal accountability aligns with genuine interest in ensuring return on taxpayer investment in research* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently applies limited-government principles: supports accountability but opposes new regulatory mandates* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions are stable: support transparency, resist new bureaucracy* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Low; reproducibility is not a partisan flashpoint* |

**Justification:** Conservatives approach reproducibility through a consistent fiscal responsibility lens. Their support for transparency and accountability in government spending is genuine and aligns with broader principles about stewardship of public funds. Their resistance to new mandates and bureaucratic structures is also principled and predictable.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Republican members of the House Science Committee have raised concerns about the return on investment for federally funded research

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuine concern about systemic dysfunction in knowledge production aligns with structural reform orientation* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently applies systemic analysis to science policy, viewing reproducibility crisis as product of capitalist incentive structures* |
| Goalpost stability | *May push for more radical reform but positions are directionally stable* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Low on this issue; sees broad coalition potential* |

**Justification:** Progressives view the reproducibility crisis as a symptom of deeper structural problems in the academic-industrial complex, including the commodification of knowledge, exploitative labor practices for early-career researchers, and the dominance of corporate interests in shaping research agendas. This analysis is consistent with their broader framework and produces stable, predictable positions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Progressive academic organizations have consistently advocated for structural reform of academia
- Sanders and Warren have introduced legislation addressing academic labor conditions and public access to research
- Progressive think tanks have connected reproducibility to broader critiques of knowledge production

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement; view the crisis as more severe than the analysis suggests, extending to structural inequality in whose research gets funded and published* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | *Strong agreement with systemic incentive analysis; would add critique of capitalism's distortion of knowledge production* |

**Source references:**

- Academic labor organizations' position papers on publish-or-perish culture
- Progressive policy proposals for public access to research

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Pre-registration* | 7/10 | *Support as necessary but insufficient reform* | *Want pre-registration embedded in broader structural change* |
| *Open data* | 9/10 | *Strong support; view as public right to publicly funded knowledge* | *Connect to broader open access and knowledge commons agenda* |
| *Registered reports* | 8/10 | *Strong support; see as addressing publication bias structurally* | *Want to go further by reforming the commercial publishing model entirely* |
| *Tenure/hiring reform* | 9/10 | *Strong support; view as essential for addressing root causes* | *Want comprehensive reform of academic labor, not just metrics* |
| *Replication funding* | 8/10 | *Support dedicated funding* | *Want to ensure funding reaches early-career researchers and underrepresented institutions* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Reproducibility and Integrity Act* | 7/10 | *Support but view as insufficient; want stronger provisions and more fundamental reform* | *Would add provisions addressing academic labor conditions and equity* |
| *Scientific Transparency in Federally Funded Research Act* | 7/10 | *Support the Initiative; want higher funding levels and broader scope* | *Would increase the 3% set-aside and add equity requirements for grant distribution* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would also support:

- Fundamental reform of the academic publishing system, including public ownership of scientific journals
- Guaranteed funding for early-career researchers to reduce publish-or-perish pressure
- Elimination of the journal impact factor and all prestige-based research metrics
- Public access to all research regardless of funding source

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-elite accountability), Centrist (on evidence-based reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on scope of government intervention), Libertarian (on regulatory approach)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Principled opposition to government mandates in research is consistent and genuine* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies minimal-government principle uniformly: supports voluntary reform, opposes mandates regardless of subject* |
| Goalpost stability | *Very stable; positions follow directly from first principles* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *None; this is not a partisan issue for libertarians* |

**Justification:** Libertarians apply their principles consistently to science policy. They support transparency for government-funded research as a condition of accepting public money, but oppose mandated practices, new government agencies, and expanded federal spending. Their positions are highly predictable because they derive from clear first principles.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute and Reason Foundation analyses consistently apply free-market principles to science policy
- Libertarian opposition to government mandates is consistent across policy domains
- Support for transparency in government spending is a longstanding libertarian position

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Agree that problems exist but attribute them to government distortion of incentives (federal funding creating perverse incentives) rather than market failure* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Disagree with systemic analysis; see the root cause as government subsidization of research creating moral hazard; would prefer market-driven solutions* |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute analyses of federal research spending
- Reason Foundation reports on government accountability

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Pre-registration* | 6/10 | *Acceptable as voluntary practice or condition of government grants; oppose as general mandate* | *Support accountability for public money; oppose telling private researchers what to do* |
| *Open data* | 7/10 | *Support for publicly funded research; oppose for privately funded* | *Taxpayers have a right to see what they paid for* |
| *Registered reports* | 5/10 | *View as matter for journals and market to sort out* | *Oppose government promotion of specific publication formats* |
| *Tenure/hiring reform* | 2/10 | *Strongly oppose government involvement in university personnel* | *Fundamental opposition to government dictating institutional practices* |
| *Replication funding* | 3/10 | *Oppose new government spending; prefer market-driven replication* | *Would reduce overall government research funding rather than add new programs* |
| *Statistical reform* | 3/10 | *Oppose government dictating scientific methodology* | *View as overreach regardless of technical merit* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Reproducibility and Integrity Act* | 3/10 | *Oppose new mandates, new compliance bureaucracy, and new spending* | *View as government overreach; would prefer reducing federal research funding and letting market discipline research quality* |
| *Scientific Transparency in Federally Funded Research Act* | 2/10 | *Oppose new agency, 3% set-aside, and $100M authorization* | *Fundamental opposition to new government programs; prefer private replication initiatives* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would prefer:

- Reducing federal research funding and allowing private philanthropy and industry to fund research with market-based quality controls
- Voluntary transparency standards developed by the scientific community without government mandate
- Private replication services funded by industry and philanthropy
- Eliminating tenure and allowing market competition to reward reliable researchers

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on limited government), Constitutionalist (on federal overreach)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on transparency provisions only)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Liberal, Democratic Socialist (on regulatory approach)

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Principled focus on enumerated powers and federalism applied consistently to science policy* |
| Principle consistency | *Uniformly applies constitutional limits analysis regardless of policy merits* |
| Goalpost stability | *Very stable; positions derive from constitutional text* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *None; evaluates on constitutional grounds independent of partisan dynamics* |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists evaluate science policy through the lens of enumerated powers, federalism, and constitutional limits. Their analysis is consistent and predictable: they accept that Congress can condition federal grants on reproducibility practices (spending power), but question the creation of new federal programs and resist federal intrusion into state-level education policy.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Consistent application of enumerated powers analysis to federal programs
- Federalist Society analyses of spending power conditions
- Historical positions on limits of federal authority over state universities

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Accept the factual analysis but question whether it is a federal responsibility to address* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *View federal funding itself as a root cause of distorted incentives; skeptical of systemic analysis that leads to more federal intervention* |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society analyses of federal spending conditions
- Constitutional analyses of federal authority over research

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Pre-registration* | 5/10 | *Acceptable as spending condition; oppose as general mandate* | *Must be clearly tied to specific federal spending programs* |
| *Open data* | 6/10 | *Support for federally funded research under spending power* | *Must respect state sovereignty and institutional autonomy* |
| *Registered reports* | 3/10 | *Oppose government promotion of specific publication formats* | *No enumerated power to regulate scientific publishing* |
| *Tenure/hiring reform* | 1/10 | *Strongly oppose as federal overreach into state and institutional authority* | *Education and personnel are reserved to states and institutions* |
| *Replication funding* | 4/10 | *Accept under spending power but question necessity of new program* | *Prefer existing agencies administer replication within current budgets* |
| *Statistical reform* | 2/10 | *Oppose government dictating scientific methodology* | *No constitutional basis for federal standards on scientific methods* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Reproducibility and Integrity Act* | 4/10 | *Spending conditions are constitutional but legislation is overly broad and prescriptive* | *Reproducibility Officers and compliance audits expand federal administrative state* |
| *Scientific Transparency in Federally Funded Research Act* | 3/10 | *Question whether a new initiative within OSTP is necessary; prefer using existing agencies* | *3% set-aside constrains agency discretion in constitutionally questionable ways* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would prefer:

- Executive branch directives to existing agencies rather than new legislation
- State-level reforms for state-funded research at public universities
- Voluntary standards developed by the scientific community
- Reducing federal research funding footprint to reduce the scope of the problem

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian, Conservative
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on well-designed spending conditions)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on expanded federal role)

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuine anti-elite sentiment aligns with accountability demands; but may shift focus to politically convenient targets* |
| Principle consistency | *Anti-elite principle applied selectively: strong on demanding accountability from academic establishment, inconsistent when findings align with populist priors* |
| Goalpost stability | *Moderate; positions can shift based on which findings are being questioned* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Moderate; may frame reproducibility selectively to discredit findings that challenge populist positions (e.g., climate science)* |

**Justification:** Populists are drawn to the reproducibility issue because it validates their suspicion of academic and scientific elites. However, their commitment to reform is selective: they are most enthusiastic about questioning findings they disagree with and least interested in applying the same scrutiny to findings that support their positions. This selectivity reduces their reliability as coalition partners.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Populist rhetoric has selectively invoked the reproducibility crisis to question climate science, vaccine research, and other politically inconvenient findings
- Genuine populist concern about elite accountability is inconsistent in application
- Some populist politicians have supported research transparency provisions while opposing the scientific consensus on specific topics

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | *Agree that academic elites produce unreliable research; frame it as evidence of institutional corruption* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | *Agree on elite self-interest as a cause; less interested in statistical and methodological analysis; prefer narrative of institutional corruption* |

**Source references:**

- Populist political rhetoric on "establishment science"
- Anti-elite framing of research accountability

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Pre-registration* | 6/10 | *Support as mechanism to hold elites accountable* | *Interest is in accountability rather than methodological improvement per se* |
| *Open data* | 8/10 | *Strong support; public has a right to see what elites are doing with public money* | *Transparency as a check on elite power* |
| *Registered reports* | 4/10 | *Less interested in publication reform* | *Prefer direct accountability measures over process reforms* |
| *Tenure/hiring reform* | 6/10 | *Support challenging the academic establishment* | *Anti-elite sentiment; want to break up entrenched academic power* |
| *Replication funding* | 6/10 | *Support checking up on elite researchers* | *Interest depends on which findings are being replicated* |
| *Statistical reform* | 3/10 | *Low interest in technical methodological details* | *Prefer accessible accountability over technical standards* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Reproducibility and Integrity Act* | 5/10 | *Support accountability provisions; suspicious of creating new elite positions (Reproducibility Officers)* | *Want direct public accountability, not another layer of bureaucratic insiders* |
| *Scientific Transparency in Federally Funded Research Act* | 5/10 | *Support replication of elite findings; suspicious of Advisory Board composition* | *Want to ensure advisory board includes non-elite voices, not just establishment academics* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would also support:

- Public access to all research data with minimal restrictions
- Term limits for NIH study section members and journal editors
- Citizen oversight boards for federally funded research
- Whistleblower protections for researchers who expose unreliable findings

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on accountability), Religious Right (on questioning establishment science)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on anti-elite accountability), Liberal (on transparency)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on government oversight role)

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuine commitment to evidence-based, pragmatic reform aligns with reproducibility goals* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently applies cost-benefit analysis and pragmatic approach* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable; willing to compromise on details while maintaining core commitment to reform* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Very low; actively seeks bipartisan solutions* |

**Justification:** Centrists are natural champions of reproducibility reform because the issue aligns with their core commitment to evidence-based policy. Their positions are stable, pragmatic, and focused on achievable incremental improvements. They are the most reliable coalition partners because they are willing to compromise on specific mechanisms while maintaining commitment to the underlying goals.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan support for research transparency provisions in past science authorization bills
- Evidence-based policy organizations (Results for America, Pew-MacArthur) have championed reproducibility
- Centrist members of science committees have supported incremental reform

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | *Strong agreement with evidence-based analysis of the crisis; focus on practical implications and costs* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | *Agree with systemic incentive analysis; prefer practical rather than ideological framing of solutions* |

**Source references:**

- Results for America evidence-based policy framework
- Bipartisan Policy Center analyses of research effectiveness

| *Statistical reform* | 6/10 | *Support community-driven reform; cautious about mandates* | *Defer to scientific community while encouraging improvement* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Reproducibility and Integrity Act* | 7/10 | *Support overall approach; may want to phase in requirements more gradually* | *Practical concerns about implementation burden and timeline* |
| *Scientific Transparency in Federally Funded Research Act* | 7/10 | *Support the concept; may prefer smaller initial funding with expansion based on results* | *Want pilot program before full-scale implementation* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would also support:

- Pilot programs that test reproducibility interventions before scaling
- Bipartisan commission to develop consensus recommendations
- Graduated implementation timelines based on institutional capacity
- Public-private partnerships for reproducibility infrastructure

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Conservative (on fiscal responsibility provisions)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on transparency), Progressive (on systemic reform), Populist (on accountability)
- **Unlikely partners:** None---centrists seek to work with all perspectives

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Stated concern for research integrity is genuine but intersects with skepticism of specific scientific findings (evolution, climate change, gender identity research)* |
| Principle consistency | *Inconsistent: demand rigorous scrutiny of findings that conflict with religious values while accepting findings that support them with less scrutiny* |
| Goalpost stability | *Moderate; positions depend on which research is under scrutiny* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Moderate; may use reproducibility concerns instrumentally to challenge specific scientific conclusions* |

**Justification:** The Religious Right has a complex relationship with reproducibility reform. There is genuine concern about the integrity of science that intersects with skepticism of specific scientific findings that conflict with religious commitments. This creates inconsistency: reproducibility critiques are embraced when they target inconvenient findings but resisted when they reinforce mainstream scientific conclusions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Religious Right organizations have selectively invoked reproducibility concerns regarding gender identity research, climate science, and evolutionary biology
- Some faith-based organizations have genuinely supported research integrity and ethical conduct
- Inconsistent application of reproducibility standards depending on the research topic

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Agree that some research is unreliable; particularly interested in challenging findings that conflict with traditional values* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *View secular academic culture as a root cause; less interested in statistical or incentive-structure analysis* |

**Source references:**

- Family Research Council positions on research methodology in social science
- Religious liberty organizations' positions on academic freedom

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Pre-registration* | 5/10 | *Moderate support; want it applied to politically sensitive research* | *Interest in scrutinizing findings that conflict with religious values* |
| *Open data* | 7/10 | *Support transparency; want access to challenge findings* | *Transparency enables external review by faith-based organizations* |
| *Registered reports* | 4/10 | *Limited interest in publication reform* | *More interested in directly challenging specific findings* |
| *Tenure/hiring reform* | 5/10 | *Support challenging secular academic establishment* | *Want to ensure religious perspectives are not excluded from academia* |
| *Replication funding* | 5/10 | *Support replication of politically sensitive findings* | *Interest depends on which findings are targeted* |
| *Statistical reform* | 3/10 | *Limited interest in technical statistical debate* | *View the issue through cultural rather than methodological lens* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Reproducibility and Integrity Act* | 5/10 | *Support transparency; concerned about government defining research standards* | *Want to ensure standards do not exclude faith-informed research perspectives* |
| *Scientific Transparency in Federally Funded Research Act* | 5/10 | *Support replication in principle; concerned about advisory board composition* | *Want representation on advisory board for faith perspectives* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Religious Right would also support:

- Ensuring religious liberty protections for researchers with faith-based perspectives
- Including faith-based organizations as stakeholders in reproducibility governance
- Applying reproducibility scrutiny to politically sensitive research areas
- Protecting academic freedom for researchers whose findings challenge secular consensus

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Populist (on questioning establishment)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on academic freedom), Centrist (on specific transparency provisions)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Liberal (on application scope)

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuine commitment to public knowledge and democratic control of research aligns with reproducibility goals* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently applies public goods framework to research; views reproducibility crisis as product of capitalist incentive structures* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable; consistently pushes for stronger public investment and structural reform* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Low; views reproducibility as a class and public interest issue* |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists view the reproducibility crisis as a predictable consequence of the commodification of knowledge, the exploitation of academic labor, and the profit-driven publishing industry. This analysis is consistent with their broader framework and produces stable, predictable positions that strongly favor public investment, open access, and structural reform.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic socialist politicians have supported open access to research and academic labor reform
- Left academic organizations have connected reproducibility to critiques of neoliberal university governance
- Consistent support for public investment in research infrastructure

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement; view the crisis as even more severe when accounting for structural inequality in research* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | *Strong agreement; would add that capitalist incentive structures, not just academic incentives, are the fundamental cause* |

**Source references:**

- Democratic socialist policy platforms on public investment in research
- Academic labor union positions on publish-or-perish culture

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Pre-registration* | 7/10 | *Support as necessary reform* | *Want pre-registration embedded in broader structural change* |
| *Open data* | 10/10 | *Strongest possible support; all publicly funded knowledge should be public* | *View knowledge as a public good that should not be commodified* |
| *Registered reports* | 8/10 | *Strong support; want to go further by eliminating commercial publishing gatekeeping* | *Registered reports are a step toward public ownership of scientific publishing* |
| *Tenure/hiring reform* | 9/10 | *Strong support; connect to broader academic labor reform* | *View tenure reform as part of democratizing the university* |
| *Replication funding* | 9/10 | *Very strong support for robust public investment* | *Want significantly higher funding levels than proposed* |
| *Statistical reform* | 6/10 | *Support in principle; less focused on technical details* | *More interested in structural reform than methodological reform* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Reproducibility and Integrity Act* | 7/10 | *Support but view as insufficient; want stronger provisions on academic labor and equity* | *Would add provisions on researcher working conditions and equity in compliance burden* |
| *Scientific Transparency in Federally Funded Research Act* | 8/10 | *Strong support; would increase funding levels substantially* | *Want $200M+ annually and higher set-aside percentage* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic Socialists would also support:

- Public ownership of scientific publishing infrastructure (replacing commercial journals with publicly funded platforms)
- Guaranteed basic research funding for all scientists, reducing publish-or-perish pressure
- Worker cooperatives for academic research
- Universal public access to all research, not just federally funded research

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Liberal
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-elite accountability), Centrist (on evidence-based reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on scope of government), Libertarian (on public ownership)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| *Open data for federally funded research* | *All 9 perspectives* | *None* | *None* |
| *Pre-registration of confirmatory studies* | *Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist (8)* | *Religious Right* | *None* |
| *Registered reports* | *Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist (4)* | *Conservative, Libertarian, Populist, Religious Right (4)* | *Constitutionalist* |
| *Replication funding* | *Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Populist, Democratic Socialist (5)* | *Conservative, Constitutionalist, Religious Right (3)* | *Libertarian* |
| *Tenure/hiring reform* | *Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Democratic Socialist (4)* | *Centrist, Religious Right (2)* | *Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist (3)* |
| *Statistical reform* | *Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist (4)* | *Conservative, Populist, Religious Right (3)* | *Libertarian, Constitutionalist (2)* |

**Key insight:** Open data and pre-registration enjoy near-universal support and should be the foundation of any bipartisan reproducibility legislation. Tenure/hiring reform and statistical mandates face significant opposition and are better pursued through non-legislative channels (professional societies, funders, voluntary institutional commitments).

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Bipartisan Research Transparency Act*

**Bridges:** *Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist + Democratic Socialist*

**Core Agreement:** All perspectives agree that taxpayer-funded research should be transparent and accountable. Open data, pre-registration of confirmatory studies, and basic methods reporting represent common ground.

**Policy Description:**

A narrower bill focused exclusively on transparency provisions with broad bipartisan appeal:

- Require open data and code sharing for all federally funded research (with privacy exceptions)
- Require pre-registration of confirmatory studies on approved registries
- Require enhanced methods reporting following discipline-specific guidelines
- No new agencies, initiatives, or significant new spending
- Implementation through existing agency authority with modest ($15M) authorization for infrastructure

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | *Fiscal accountability without new bureaucracy or spending; transparency for taxpayer-funded work* |
| Liberal | *Institutional reform advancing evidence-based policy; foundation for further action* |
| Centrist | *Pragmatic, achievable reform with bipartisan appeal* |
| Populist | *Holds academic elites accountable; public access to publicly funded data* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Advances public ownership of publicly funded knowledge* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | *Accept minimal new spending ($15M) and compliance requirements* |
| Liberal | *Accept a narrower bill without replication funding or institutional reform provisions* |
| Centrist | *Accept less ambitious scope in exchange for bipartisan viability* |
| Populist | *Accept technocratic implementation rather than populist oversight mechanisms* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Accept incremental reform rather than systemic transformation* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (with potential support from Libertarian and Constitutionalist for the transparency-only, minimal-spending version)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *High---transparency requirements are difficult to repeal once established and create constituencies for enforcement*
- **Implementation Path:** *Could be attached to research authorization or appropriations bills; low political cost for supporters*

---

### Compromise 2: *Federally Funded Research Verification Pilot*

**Bridges:** *Liberal + Conservative + Centrist + Progressive*

**Core Agreement:** All perspectives agree that the federal government should verify the reliability of research it funds. A pilot program tests the concept before committing to large-scale implementation, addressing conservative fiscal concerns while advancing liberal and progressive goals.

**Policy Description:**

A 3-year pilot program at NIH and NSF to test replication funding:

- $25M annually for replication grants, with priority for early-career researchers
- Advisory committee sets replication priorities using transparent, evidence-based criteria
- All replication results published in a public database regardless of outcome
- Mandatory evaluation of pilot effectiveness before expansion
- No set-aside requirement; funded from new appropriations

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | *Limited, time-bound spending; pilot model allows evaluation before scaling; accountability for existing spending* |
| Liberal | *Creates federal infrastructure for replication; prioritizes early-career researchers* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based approach with built-in evaluation; moderate spending level* |
| Progressive | *Establishes the principle of federal replication investment; early-career priority* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | *Accept new (modest) spending program* |
| Liberal | *Accept smaller scale than desired; no permanent authorization* |
| Centrist | *Accept that pilot may not cover all disciplines initially* |
| Progressive | *Accept incremental approach rather than immediate systemic reform* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives (with potential Populist and Democratic Socialist support)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *Moderate---pilot programs can be terminated if evaluation is unfavorable, but successful pilots create pressure for continuation*
- **Implementation Path:** *Can be included in NIH and NSF reauthorization; low political visibility and cost*

---

### Compromise 3: *Voluntary Research Rigor Standards with Recognition*

**Bridges:** *Libertarian + Conservative + Centrist + Liberal + Religious Right*

**Core Agreement:** All perspectives support improving research quality; this proposal achieves it through voluntary standards, institutional recognition, and market incentives rather than government mandates.

**Policy Description:**

A non-regulatory approach that creates incentives for reproducibility without mandates:

- OSTP convenes scientific community to develop voluntary reproducibility standards
- Federal agencies give priority consideration in grant review to applications demonstrating adoption of reproducibility practices
- Create a national Research Rigor Award program recognizing institutions and researchers who lead in reproducibility
- Encourage (but do not mandate) journals to adopt TOP Guidelines
- No new mandates, compliance requirements, or enforcement mechanisms

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Libertarian | *Voluntary standards respect freedom; no government mandates* |
| Conservative | *No new spending, bureaucracy, or regulatory burden* |
| Centrist | *Pragmatic approach that avoids political conflict* |
| Liberal | *Begins to shift incentives toward rigor; creates foundation for stronger action* |
| Religious Right | *Voluntary approach does not impose standards that might conflict with faith-based research perspectives* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Libertarian | *Accept government role in convening and recognizing (though not mandating)* |
| Conservative | *Accept federal involvement in promoting standards (though voluntary)* |
| Centrist | *Accept weaker approach than preferred* |
| Liberal | *Accept voluntary rather than mandatory standards; significant concession* |
| Religious Right | *Accept that standards may still favor mainstream methodological approaches* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *Low to moderate---voluntary standards have limited teeth; effectiveness depends on sustained attention and competitive pressure*
- **Implementation Path:** *Can be implemented through executive action without legislation; very low political cost*

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable coalition for reproducibility reform centers on the **Liberal-Centrist-Conservative** axis, united by shared commitment to fiscal accountability and evidence-based policy. This coalition can agree on transparency requirements (open data, pre-registration, methods reporting) and modest investment in replication infrastructure. Adding Progressive and Democratic Socialist support strengthens the coalition on the left while maintaining centrist leadership that reassures the right.

The key to this coalition is framing reproducibility reform as **accountability for public spending** rather than as **regulation of scientific practice**. The former framing appeals to fiscal conservatives; the latter triggers libertarian and constitutionalist opposition.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Low political salience**: Reproducibility reform is not a voter-mobilizing issue, making it difficult to build legislative momentum
2. **Scientific community resistance**: Some established researchers and institutions resist mandates that change familiar practices
3. **Selective application**: Populist and Religious Right support is contingent on which findings face scrutiny, creating an unreliable coalition base
4. **Funding competition**: New reproducibility spending competes with other research funding priorities in a constrained fiscal environment

### Low Consistency Partners

Populist (3/5) and Religious Right (3/5) perspectives show mixed consistency. Their support for reproducibility reform is genuine but selective---strongest when the research being scrutinized challenges their priors. To work with these perspectives:

- Focus on universal transparency requirements that apply to all research, not just politically sensitive topics
- Emphasize fiscal accountability and anti-elite framing
- Avoid engaging on specific scientific controversies (climate, evolution, gender) where selective application is most likely
- Build on genuine common ground (open data, public access) rather than expecting comprehensive agreement

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with transparency**: Open data and pre-registration enjoy near-universal support and should be the foundation of any legislative effort
2. **Pilot replication funding**: A modest, time-limited pilot program can build the evidence base for larger investment while minimizing political opposition
3. **Use executive authority**: Many reforms can be implemented through existing OSTP and agency authority without legislation, bypassing congressional gridlock
4. **Build scientific community support**: Work with professional societies and reform organizations to build bottom-up demand for reproducibility reform, reducing the perception of top-down government mandates
5. **Frame as accountability**: Emphasize return on investment for taxpayers and responsible stewardship of public funds, a framing that appeals across the political spectrum
