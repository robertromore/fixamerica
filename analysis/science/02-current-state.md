# Science Policy: Current State

## Overview

The American scientific enterprise in 2024 operates in a landscape of contradiction: total national R&D investment has reached historic highs in absolute terms, yet federal R&D as a share of GDP has declined from its Cold War peak of nearly 2% to approximately 0.73%. The private sector now funds roughly 75% of all U.S. R&D, but this spending is heavily concentrated in development rather than basic research. Meanwhile, China has reached rough parity with the United States in total R&D expenditure and now leads in several key metrics including total scientific publications and patent filings. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorized historic increases in research funding, but appropriations have fallen far short of authorized levels.

## Federal R&D Spending

### Overall Trends

| Metric | FY 2020 | FY 2022 | FY 2024 (est.) |
|--------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Total federal R&D | $164.1B | $185.6B | $204.0B |
| Basic research | $42.4B | $47.8B | $50.2B |
| Applied research | $40.3B | $44.6B | $48.8B |
| Development | $81.4B | $93.2B | $105.0B |
| Federal R&D as % of GDP | 0.78% | 0.74% | 0.73% |

### Historical Context

| Era | Federal R&D as % of GDP |
|-----|------------------------|
| Pre-Sputnik (1955) | 0.8% |
| Post-Sputnik peak (1964) | 1.86% |
| Post-Apollo decline (1975) | 1.1% |
| Reagan defense buildup (1985) | 1.2% |
| Post-Cold War low (1999) | 0.8% |
| Stimulus era (2010) | 0.9% |
| Current (2024) | 0.73% |

### R&D as Share of GDP

| Category | 2024 (est.) |
|----------|-------------|
| Total U.S. R&D / GDP | ~3.4% |
| Federal R&D / GDP | ~0.73% |
| Business R&D / GDP | ~2.5% |
| Higher education R&D / GDP | ~0.15% |
| Nonprofit R&D / GDP | ~0.05% |

## Agency Budgets

### Major R&D Agencies (FY 2024)

| Agency | R&D Budget | Basic Research | Applied Research | Development |
|--------|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Department of Defense | $75.7B | $2.8B | $7.2B | $65.7B |
| NIH (HHS) | $48.3B | $22.2B | $22.8B | $3.3B |
| Department of Energy | $22.4B | $8.2B | $7.5B | $6.7B |
| NASA | $15.2B | $4.1B | $2.7B | $8.4B |
| NSF | $11.3B | $7.5B | $2.1B | $1.7B |
| USDA | $3.8B | $1.5B | $1.9B | $0.4B |
| Commerce (NIST/NOAA) | $3.4B | $0.9B | $1.4B | $1.1B |
| EPA | $0.7B | $0.1B | $0.5B | $0.1B |

### CHIPS and Science Act Implementation

| Authorized Program | Authorized (FY 2023-2027) | Appropriated to Date | Gap |
|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----|
| NSF total (CHIPS Act target) | $81B over 5 years | ~$55B | ~$26B |
| NSF Technology Directorate | $20B over 5 years | ~$4B | ~$16B |
| DOE Office of Science | $50B over 5 years | ~$42B | ~$8B |
| NIST | $10B over 5 years | ~$6B | ~$4B |
| Regional innovation hubs | $10B | ~$0.5B | ~$9.5B |
| STEM education programs | $13B over 5 years | ~$4B | ~$9B |

The CHIPS and Science Act authorized transformative increases in civilian R&D, but Congress has consistently appropriated far below authorized levels. The resulting gap undermines the competitiveness goals the legislation was designed to address.

## Global Competition

### International R&D Spending Comparison (2024 est.)

| Country | Total R&D ($B PPP) | R&D as % of GDP | Researchers per Million |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| United States | $886B | 3.4% | 4,400 |
| China | $812B | 2.4% | 1,400 |
| European Union | $480B | 2.2% | 4,200 |
| Japan | $183B | 3.3% | 5,400 |
| South Korea | $130B | 4.9% | 8,600 |
| Germany | $147B | 3.1% | 5,300 |
| Israel | $24B | 5.6% | 8,300 |

### U.S.-China Comparison

| Metric | United States | China |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Total R&D spending (PPP) | $886B | $812B |
| Basic research share | ~15% | ~6% |
| S&E publications (2022) | ~460,000 | ~890,000 |
| Top 1% cited publications | ~27% of global | ~28% of global |
| STEM bachelor's degrees/year | ~900,000 | ~3.5 million |
| STEM PhDs awarded/year | ~45,000 | ~55,000 |
| Patent applications (2023) | ~520,000 | ~1.6 million |
| Government R&D share | ~25% | ~20% |

China surpassed the U.S. in total publications around 2018, in highly cited publications around 2022, and in total patent filings in 2011. However, the U.S. retains significant advantages in basic research intensity, institutional depth, and the quality-adjusted impact of its research enterprise.

| 2016 | 76% | D: 80%, R: 72% |
| 2019 | 73% | D: 83%, R: 63% |
| 2021 | 64% | D: 79%, R: 45% |
| 2024 | 57% | D: 75%, R: 38% |

## Research Security

### China Initiative Aftermath

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| China Initiative cases filed (2018-2022) | ~24 |
| Cases dismissed or acquitted | ~10 |
| Conviction rate (grant fraud only) | ~50% |

| NIH foreign influence investigations | ~200+ |
| Researchers who lost positions | ~100+ |
| DOJ pivot to "Disruptive Technology Strike Force" | February 2022 |

The DOJ's China Initiative, launched in 2018 and rebranded in 2022, investigated researchers with ties to China for potential espionage and grant fraud. While some cases uncovered genuine violations, the initiative's broad scope and high-profile failures created a chilling effect on international collaboration, particularly among Asian American scientists.

## Emerging Challenges

### AI and Research

- AI tools (large language models, protein folding algorithms) are transforming research workflows
- Federal agencies developing policies on AI use in grant applications and peer review
- Questions about AI-generated data, authorship, and reproducibility
- Potential for AI to reduce inequality in access to research tools

### Funding Instability

- Federal research agencies have operated under continuing resolutions for 8 of the last 10 fiscal years
- Budget uncertainty forces labs to delay hiring, slow experiments, and hold back commitments
- Multi-year research projects are particularly vulnerable to year-to-year budget fluctuations
- Sequestration (Budget Control Act) reduced research budgets by $2.5 billion in FY 2013

### Workforce Challenges

- Average age of first NIH R01 grant is 43, up from 36 in 1980
- Postdoctoral salaries (NRSA minimum: $56,484) lag behind industry alternatives
- International students and researchers face visa uncertainty
- Faculty positions have not kept pace with PhD production
