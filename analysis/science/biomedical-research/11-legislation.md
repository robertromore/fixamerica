# Biomedical Research: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Reform of the biomedical research enterprise requires legislative action to restructure NIH grant mechanisms, improve accountability for the use of public research funds, and modernize the clinical trial system. This document presents two federal bills: the NIH Reform and Accountability Act (addressing grant mechanisms, indirect costs, reproducibility, and funding diversification) and the Clinical Trial Modernization Act (addressing decentralized trials, real-world evidence, patient access, and diversity requirements). Each bill includes full draft text, explanatory analysis, and identification of potential weaknesses.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: NIH Reform and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: Restructure NIH grant mechanisms to incentivize longer-term, higher-impact research; cap and bring transparency to indirect cost recovery; diversify the funding portfolio across investigators and institutions; and mandate reproducibility standards for all NIH-funded research.

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "NIH Reform and Accountability Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds the following:
    (1) The National Institutes of Health is the world's largest
        public funder of biomedical research, investing approximately
        $48,000,000,000 annually.
    (2) Grant funding success rates have declined from approximately
        30 percent in 2003 to approximately 20 percent, despite
        increases in the nominal budget.
    (3) Researchers report spending 30 to 50 percent of their time
        on grant applications rather than conducting research.
    (4) Facilities and administrative cost recovery rates at many
        institutions exceed 60 percent of direct costs, diverting
        significant resources from research.
    (5) A small number of investigators and institutions receive a
        disproportionate share of NIH funding, limiting diversity
        and innovation.
    (6) Studies estimate that 50 to 90 percent of preclinical
        research findings cannot be independently reproduced,
        costing billions of dollars annually.

(b) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this Act is to--
    (1) reform NIH grant mechanisms to reduce administrative burden
        and incentivize high-impact research;
    (2) increase transparency and accountability in indirect cost
        recovery;
    (3) diversify the distribution of research funding; and
    (4) establish mandatory reproducibility standards.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** addresses the grant mechanism dysfunction by extending grant periods, reducing application burden, and piloting investigator-based funding. The 7-year default with milestone reviews balances stability with accountability.
- **Section 5** tackles the contentious issue of indirect costs with a phased cap, transparency requirements, and a separate infrastructure fund to ease the transition. The waiver provision acknowledges that some institutions face genuinely higher costs.
- **Section 6** redistributes funding opportunity to early-career and diverse investigators through set-asides and a meaningful Grant Support Index cap.
- **Section 7** mandates the reproducibility reforms that the scientific community has called for but has been slow to implement voluntarily.
- **Section 8** addresses workforce exploitation through minimum compensation standards and career transparency.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| University opposition to F&A caps | 5-year phase-in and infrastructure fund reduce disruption |
| Senior PI opposition to GSI cap | Waiver provision for exceptional cases; redistribution benefits system |
| Reproducibility mandate burden | Phased implementation; technology support for pre-registration |
| Cost of new programs | Partially offset by F&A savings and improved research efficiency |
| Constitutional issues | NIH funding conditions are well-established spending clause authority |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Eliminate F&A waiver provision; set GSI cap without exceptions
- **Fallback version**: Implement transparency requirements without the F&A cap; make GSI cap advisory rather than mandatory
- **Bipartisan appeal**: Emphasize accountability, taxpayer value, and reduced bureaucracy

        the United States population, with minority groups,
        elderly patients, and rural residents underrepresented.
    (4) Traditional trial designs requiring frequent visits to
        academic medical centers impose significant burdens on
        participants, particularly those in underserved communities.
    (5) The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the feasibility and
        value of decentralized trial elements, including remote
        monitoring, telemedicine, and direct-to-patient services.
    (6) Real-world evidence from electronic health records,
        registries, and claims data can complement traditional
        trial evidence to support regulatory decision-making.

(b) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this Act is to--
    (1) establish a framework for decentralized clinical trials;
    (2) integrate real-world evidence into regulatory decision-
        making;
    (3) improve patient access to clinical trial participation;

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** establishes the decentralized trial framework that the COVID-19 pandemic proved feasible. The Community Clinical Trial Network brings trial infrastructure to underserved communities, while the patient-trial matching platform reduces the enrollment bottleneck.
- **Section 5** formalizes real-world evidence integration and creates platform trials that can continuously evaluate interventions more efficiently than traditional single-intervention trials.
- **Section 6** addresses the financial and logistical barriers that prevent many patients from participating in trials. Reimbursing transportation, childcare, and lost wages removes barriers that disproportionately affect low-income and rural patients.
- **Section 7** mandates diversity through action plans and broadened eligibility. Rather than imposing rigid quotas, it requires sponsors to demonstrate proactive recruitment strategies and report outcomes.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Industry concerns about decentralized data integrity | Guidance includes cybersecurity and data quality standards |
| Privacy risks from patient matching platform | Consent-based system with robust privacy protections |
| Cost of community trial network | Long-term savings from reduced enrollment failure and faster trials |
| Real-world evidence reliability concerns | Framework includes standards for quality, bias control |
| Diversity mandates perceived as burdensome | Action plan approach (not quotas) balances goals with flexibility |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Require demographic parity in trial enrollment with mandatory pause if targets not met
- **Fallback version**: Make diversity action plans advisory rather than mandatory; limit platform trials to 3 disease areas
- **Bipartisan appeal**: Emphasize patient access, rural inclusion, and efficiency gains

## Regulatory Framework

### NIH Grant Policy Reform

**Existing Authority**: 42 U.S.C. Section 241 (research authority); 42 U.S.C. Section 282 (Director's authority)

**Draft Regulation**: NIH could implement many of the NIH Reform and Accountability Act provisions through changes to the NIH Grants Policy Statement without congressional action, including extended grant periods, streamlined applications, and reproducibility requirements. The F&A cap, however, would likely require legislation.

**Explanation**: NIH has broad administrative authority over grant mechanisms and conditions. Using this authority for initial reforms builds momentum and demonstrates feasibility before legislative action.

### FDA Clinical Trial Guidance

**Existing Authority**: 21 U.S.C. Section 355 (drug approval); 21 CFR Part 312 (investigational new drugs)

**Draft Regulation**: FDA can issue guidance on decentralized trial elements, electronic consent, and real-world evidence under existing authority. The 21st Century Cures Act (Section 3022) specifically directs FDA to develop a framework for real-world evidence.

**Explanation**: FDA guidance is legally non-binding but practically influential because sponsors rely on it for regulatory predictability. Codifying these provisions in legislation provides greater certainty and durability.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

Both bills operate within well-established congressional spending power authority. NIH grant conditions are permissible under *South Dakota v. Dole* (1987) as they are germane to the purpose of federal research funding and do not coerce states. The F&A cap may face legal challenge under contract law theories, but the government's power to set conditions on its own grants is broad.

### Preemption Questions

Neither bill preempts state law. The Clinical Trial Modernization Act would interact with state medical practice acts (telemedicine provisions) and pharmacy regulations (direct-to-patient delivery), requiring FDA to coordinate with state regulators.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **NIH Reform Act**: Enforcement through grant conditions; noncompliance results in loss of funding eligibility
- **Clinical Trial Modernization Act**: Enforcement through FDA regulatory authority and NIH grant conditions
- Both bills include GAO review for independent evaluation

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- People-Not-Projects pilot sunsets after 10 years unless reauthorized
- GAO review required at 5 years for both bills
- Annual reporting to Congress ensures ongoing oversight

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### NIH Reform and Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| F&A waiver abuse | Institutions could manufacture justifications for extraordinary cost waivers to circumvent the 40% cap | High |
| GSI gaming | PIs could distribute funding across co-PI arrangements to stay under the cap while effectively controlling more resources | High |
| Application padding | Two-stage applications could be gamed by submitting vague initial proposals that reveal little about actual research direction | Medium |
| Pre-registration exceptions | Researchers may classify exploratory work as hypothesis-free to avoid pre-registration requirements | Medium |
| Milestone review leniency | Without clear standards, milestone reviews could become rubber stamps that rarely terminate funding | Medium |
| Institutional workarounds | Universities may shift costs from F&A to direct cost categories, maintaining total recovery | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address pharmaceutical pricing | Publicly funded discoveries can still lead to unaffordable drugs | Political infeasibility of pricing provisions |
| Limited international coordination | Does not harmonize with EU or other funding frameworks | Jurisdictional limitations |
| No mandatory training pipeline reduction | Workforce oversupply continues without binding enrollment limits | University and faculty resistance |
| Voluntary diversity measures | Set-asides and transparency are necessary but may be insufficient to close racial funding gaps | Systemic bias is deeply embedded |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **F&A waiver abuse**: Require independent audit of all waiver applications; limit waivers to 3-year periods with mandatory reapplication; publish all waiver decisions publicly
2. **GSI gaming**: Count all grants on which an investigator serves as PI or co-PI toward their GSI; include subcontracts and cooperative agreements
3. **Milestone review standards**: Develop specific, quantitative milestone criteria for each institute; require external reviewers (not the original study section) to conduct milestone reviews
4. **Institutional cost-shifting**: Include a "maintenance of effort" requirement preventing institutions from increasing direct cost charges to compensate for F&A reductions
5. **Pre-registration enforcement**: Require journals publishing NIH-funded research to verify pre-registration status; link compliance to future funding eligibility

### Clinical Trial Modernization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Diversity plan check-boxing | Sponsors may submit perfunctory diversity plans that satisfy formal requirements without genuine commitment | High |
| Data quality in decentralized settings | Remote data collection may introduce variability and quality concerns that are difficult to monitor | Medium |
| Platform trial capture | Industry sponsors could dominate platform trial agendas, directing them toward commercially valuable rather than clinically important questions | High |
| Expanded access diversion | Sponsors could use expanded access to generate marketing data rather than genuinely serve patient needs | Medium |
| Real-world evidence manipulation | Selective use of real-world data could support predetermined conclusions | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Community network startup time | Full implementation requires years of capacity building | Infrastructure must be built from scratch in many communities |
| Technology access disparities | Decentralized trials assume technology access that not all patients have | Digital divide persists |
| Informed consent complexity | Multimedia consent may not fully replace in-person discussion for vulnerable populations | Technology limitations |
| Cost burden on NIH | Patient support provisions increase per-participant trial costs | Necessary investment but budget impact is real |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Diversity plan enforcement**: Require independent review of diversity plans by community representatives; tie continued funding to demonstrated enrollment progress with interim reporting
2. **Data quality assurance**: Establish a decentralized trial quality certification program; require source data verification protocols adapted for remote settings
3. **Platform trial governance**: Require that platform trial steering committees include patient representatives, independent academics, and NIH officials in addition to industry sponsors; establish transparent priority-setting processes
4. **Real-world evidence standards**: Require pre-specification of real-world evidence analyses; mandate sensitivity analyses and transparent reporting of limitations

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Regulatory capture by industry | Robust conflict-of-interest requirements; public advisory committees |
| Political interference with NIH | Statutory protections for scientific independence; arms-length funding decisions |
| Budget constraints limiting reform | Phase in reforms; demonstrate cost savings from efficiency; build bipartisan support |
| Cultural resistance in academia | Link reforms to funding eligibility; provide transition support |
| Data infrastructure gaps | Invest in interoperable systems before mandating data sharing |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- All pilot programs include mandatory evaluation and sunset provisions
- Annual congressional reporting ensures accountability
- 5-year GAO review provides independent assessment
- Provisions for regulatory updating as technology and science evolve
