# Biomedical Research: Stakeholders

## Overview

The biomedical research enterprise involves a complex network of stakeholders with varying degrees of power, interest, and alignment on reform. Understanding these relationships is essential for identifying viable reform coalitions and anticipating resistance.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Researchers

#### Principal Investigators (PIs)

**Who they are:** Faculty members at universities and research institutions who lead research programs, secure grants, mentor trainees, and publish findings. Approximately 30,000-40,000 active NIH-funded PIs at any given time.

**Interests:**

- Sustained, predictable research funding
- Reduced administrative burden and grant application overhead
- Academic freedom to pursue investigator-initiated research
- Recognition through publications and grants
- Career stability and tenure

**Power:** Moderate. PIs have expertise-based authority and institutional influence but limited collective political power. They are well represented on NIH study sections and advisory councils.

**Position on reform:** Generally supportive of increased funding and reduced bureaucracy, but divided on structural changes that might redistribute resources. Senior, well-funded PIs may resist changes to the grant system that currently favors them.

#### Early-Career Researchers

**Who they are:** Graduate students (~90,000 in biomedical fields), postdoctoral researchers (~60,000-70,000), and junior faculty seeking tenure. The most numerous and least powerful group in the research enterprise.

**Interests:**

- Livable wages and benefits during training
- Reasonable training duration
- Transparent, achievable career pathways
- Fair competition for grants and positions
- Work-life balance and mental health support

**Power:** Low. Trainees depend on their mentors for recommendation letters, publications, and career opportunities, creating power imbalances that discourage advocacy. Graduate student and postdoc unions have grown but remain limited.

**Position on reform:** Strongly supportive of workforce reform, increased pay, shorter training periods, and expanded career pathways. Most supportive stakeholder group for comprehensive structural reform.

#### Staff Scientists and Research Professionals

**Who they are:** Non-faculty researchers who provide technical expertise, manage core facilities, and conduct research on a permanent basis. A growing but still underrecognized workforce.

**Interests:**

- Stable employment and career progression outside the tenure track
- Professional recognition and development
- Competitive compensation
- Inclusion in the research enterprise as valued contributors

**Power:** Low to moderate. Staff scientists provide essential expertise but lack the prestige and institutional voice of faculty.

### Patients and Patient Advocacy Groups

**Who they are:** Individuals with diseases or conditions that biomedical research aims to treat, along with organizations that advocate on their behalf. Major organizations include the American Cancer Society, Alzheimer's Association, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and hundreds of disease-specific groups.

**Interests:**

- Faster development of effective treatments
- Affordable access to therapies developed with public funding
- Inclusion in research priority-setting
- Diverse representation in clinical trials
- Transparent communication about research progress

**Power:** Moderate to high. Patient advocacy groups wield significant political influence through lobbying, grassroots mobilization, and emotional appeals. They have successfully driven funding increases for specific diseases (cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Alzheimer's).

**Position on reform:** Generally supportive of reforms that accelerate translation, reduce drug costs, and improve clinical trial access. May resist changes that redirect funding away from their specific disease.

### NIH Leadership and Staff

**Who they are:** The NIH Director, institute and center directors, program officers, review administrators, and approximately 20,000 NIH employees. The NIH Director is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

**Interests:**

- Organizational effectiveness and public trust
- Budget growth and stability
- Scientific excellence and innovation
- Balanced portfolio across diseases and disciplines
- Institutional autonomy from political interference

**Power:** High within the research ecosystem. NIH leadership sets funding priorities, designs grant mechanisms, and implements policies that shape the entire research enterprise. However, they are constrained by congressional appropriations and executive branch oversight.

**Position on reform:** Supportive of incremental reforms (longer grants, early-career support, reproducibility initiatives). Cautious about structural changes that might reduce institutional authority or create political vulnerabilities.

## Institutional Stakeholders

### Research Universities

**Who they are:** Approximately 150 research-intensive universities (Carnegie R1 classification) that receive the majority of NIH extramural funding. The top 20 institutions receive roughly 30% of all NIH grant funding.

**Interests:**

- Maximizing research funding and indirect cost recovery
- Maintaining research infrastructure and prestige
- Attracting top faculty and students
- Technology transfer and licensing revenue
- Institutional autonomy in managing research operations

**Power:** Very high. Universities are major employers, economic engines, and political constituencies. Their associations (Association of American Universities, Association of American Medical Colleges) are influential lobbyists.

**Position on reform:** Supportive of increased NIH funding but resistant to indirect cost caps, grant mechanism changes that reduce institutional flexibility, or workforce reforms that limit graduate student enrollment.

### Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Industry

**Who they are:** Large pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Merck, etc.), mid-size biotech firms (Amgen, Gilead, Regeneron), and thousands of small biotech startups. The global pharmaceutical industry invests over $250 billion annually in R&D.

**Interests:**

- Access to academic discoveries and talent
- Intellectual property protection
- Favorable regulatory environment
- Return on investment for shareholders
- Market exclusivity and pricing freedom
- Predictable regulatory pathways

**Power:** Very high. The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most profitable and politically influential sectors in the U.S. economy. PhRMA (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America) and BIO (Biotechnology Innovation Organization) are major lobbying forces.

**Position on reform:** Supportive of increased basic research funding (which they benefit from downstream) but opposed to pricing conditions on publicly funded research, compulsory licensing, or restrictions on intellectual property. Selectively supportive of regulatory streamlining.

### Disease Advocacy Organizations

**Who they are:** Nonprofits focused on specific diseases or conditions, ranging from large organizations with billion-dollar budgets (American Cancer Society, American Heart Association) to small patient-led groups for rare diseases.

**Interests:**

- Increased funding for their specific disease area
- Faster drug development and approval
- Patient access to clinical trials
- Affordable treatments
- Research into prevention as well as treatment

**Power:** Moderate to high, depending on disease prevalence, political connections, and fundraising capacity. Organizations representing common diseases (cancer, heart disease, diabetes) have more political influence than those representing rare diseases.

**Position on reform:** Disease-specific organizations may resist reforms that redistribute funding toward neglected areas or away from their priorities. However, they are often powerful allies for overall funding increases.

## Government Stakeholders

### Congress

**Who they are:** The House and Senate Appropriations Committees control NIH funding. The House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate HELP Committee have authorizing jurisdiction. Key subcommittees include the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittees.

**Interests:**

- Directing research funding to constituents' priorities and institutions
- Responding to disease advocacy pressure
- Demonstrating returns on taxpayer investment
- Oversight of NIH management and accountability
- Directing funding to institutions in their districts or states

**Power:** Very high. Congress controls the NIH budget and can mandate or prohibit specific research activities through appropriations language.

**Position on reform:** Bipartisan support for NIH funding increases (historically), but divided on structural reforms. Congressional interest in specific diseases often drives earmarked funding and can distort NIH's ability to allocate resources based on scientific opportunity.

### Executive Branch

**Who they are:** The President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary.

**Interests:**

- Demonstrating health and economic returns from research investment
- Advancing administration priorities (Cancer Moonshot, pandemic preparedness)
- Managing federal budget constraints
- Responding to public health crises

**Power:** High. The President proposes the NIH budget, appoints the NIH Director, and can use executive orders to influence research policy.

### Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

**Who they are:** The FDA regulates drugs, biologics, and medical devices. FDA regulatory requirements directly shape clinical trial design, drug development timelines, and research-to-treatment pathways.

**Interests:**

- Ensuring drug safety and efficacy
- Efficient review processes
- Balancing speed of approval with rigor
- Adapting to new technologies and trial designs

**Power:** High. FDA decisions determine which therapies reach patients and how quickly.

## Other Stakeholders

### Scientific Publishers

**Who they are:** Commercial publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley) and society publishers (AAAS, PNAS) that control the peer-reviewed publication system.

**Interests:**

- Subscription and article processing charge revenue
- Journal prestige and impact factors
- Intellectual property over published content
- Maintaining the peer review system

**Power:** Moderate. Publishers control access to scientific literature and shape incentive structures through journal prestige hierarchies. However, open access mandates (including NIH's 2023 policy) are shifting the power balance.

**Position on reform:** Resistant to open access mandates, preprint servers, and alternative metrics that threaten their business model. Selectively supportive of reproducibility initiatives that increase journal credibility.

### Venture Capital and Private Funders

**Who they are:** Venture capital firms, philanthropic foundations (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Gates Foundation, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative), and angel investors that fund biotech startups and research programs.

**Interests:**

- Return on investment (VC) or mission impact (foundations)
- Access to promising discoveries and talent
- Favorable IP and regulatory environment
- Translational infrastructure

**Power:** Growing. Private funders increasingly fill gaps left by NIH, particularly in translational research and high-risk ventures. Their influence on research priorities is expanding.
