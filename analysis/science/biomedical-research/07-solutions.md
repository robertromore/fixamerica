# Biomedical Research: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming the biomedical research enterprise requires addressing interconnected problems simultaneously. No single intervention will suffice. The solutions presented here are organized into six domains: NIH funding reform, translational pipeline improvements, clinical trial modernization, reproducibility and rigor, workforce reform, and research priority alignment. Each solution is evaluated for feasibility, impact, and political viability.

## Solution 1: NIH Funding Reform

### Longer, Larger, and More Flexible Grants

**The problem:** Short grant cycles (3-5 years) force researchers into constant application cycles, consuming time that should be spent on research. Small, project-specific grants discourage the long-term, high-risk work that produces breakthroughs.

**The solution:**

- **Extend R01 grant periods to 7 years** with milestone-based reviews at years 3 and 5
- **Create "Pioneer Grants"** of $500,000-$1 million/year for 10 years to support high-risk, high-reward research (expanding on the existing NIH Director's Pioneer Award)
- **Implement "People, Not Projects" funding** that provides investigators with stable baseline support, supplemented by project-specific grants
- **Reduce application burden** by shortening initial proposals to 5 pages with detailed follow-up only for competitive applications

**Evidence:**

- The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) model of funding people, not projects, with 5-7 year renewable terms has produced disproportionate numbers of high-impact discoveries
- The European Research Council (ERC) provides 5-year grants with less administrative burden and reports higher researcher satisfaction
- NIH's own data shows that the quality difference between funded and unfunded grants (near the payline) is minimal, suggesting the system already identifies more meritorious research than it can fund

**Feasibility:** Medium. Requires NIH policy changes and potentially congressional authorization. Does not require new funding, though additional funding would ease implementation.

### Diversifying the Funding Portfolio

**The problem:** NIH funding is heavily concentrated among a small number of institutions and investigators. The top 20 institutions receive ~30% of all NIH funding, and the top 10% of PIs receive ~40% of research dollars.

**The solution:**

- **Implement a Grant Support Index (GSI)** with a meaningful cap on total funding per PI (NIH has explored this but implemented only a weak version)
- **Expand research capacity at emerging institutions** through targeted infrastructure grants and mentoring partnerships
- **Create a "New Investigator" set-aside** guaranteeing that 25% of R01-equivalent funding goes to first-time PIs
- **Pilot a modified lottery system** for applications scored above a quality threshold, acknowledging the randomness already present in peer review

**Evidence:**

- Studies show that additional grants beyond 2-3 per PI yield diminishing marginal returns in publications and citations
- A 2017 analysis in *eLife* found that distributing the same total funding across more investigators would produce more total research output
- SNSF (Swiss National Science Foundation) has piloted lottery systems for competitive applications with positive preliminary results

**Feasibility:** Medium to high. GSI implementation is within NIH authority. Lottery proposals face cultural resistance but have growing scholarly support.

### Reforming Indirect Costs

**The problem:** Facilities and administrative (F&A) cost rates of 50-65% divert a large share of every grant dollar to institutional overhead. Lack of transparency makes it impossible to assess whether these rates are appropriate.

**The solution:**

- **Cap F&A rates at 40% of direct costs** (phased in over 5 years to avoid disruption)
- **Require transparent reporting** of how F&A funds are used, with annual audits
- **Create a separate infrastructure fund** to support research facilities directly, rather than embedding these costs in every grant
- **Redirect savings to direct research costs** or new grants

**Feasibility:** Low to medium. Universities will strongly oppose any F&A cap. Previous attempts (Reagan-era cap of 26% on the administrative component) were partially reversed. Congressional action may be required.

## Solution 2: Bridging the Translational Valley of Death

### Expanding NCATS and ARPA-H

**The problem:** The gap between basic discovery and clinical development lacks adequate funding and infrastructure.

**The solution:**

- **Double NCATS budget** to ~$1.8 billion to expand translational science programs
- **Grow ARPA-H to $5 billion annually** with authority to fund high-risk translational projects outside traditional NIH mechanisms
- **Create regional translational hubs** connecting academic researchers with drug development expertise, regulatory consultants, and manufacturing partners
- **Establish a Translational Research Service Corps** of experienced pharmaceutical development scientists who rotate between industry, NIH, and academia

**Evidence:**

- DARPA's model of funding high-risk, high-reward research with program managers empowered to make rapid decisions has produced transformative technologies (internet, GPS, mRNA vaccine foundations)
- The UK's Medical Research Council and Wellcome Trust have established translational funds that have successfully moved discoveries into clinical development

**Feasibility:** Medium. ARPA-H has bipartisan support. Expanding NCATS is within NIH authority. Translational hubs would require congressional appropriations.

### Reforming Technology Transfer

**The problem:** The Bayh-Dole Act enables universities to patent publicly funded inventions, but licensing practices sometimes impede rather than facilitate translation. Exclusive licenses can block follow-on research, and march-in rights have never been exercised.

**The solution:**

- **Require non-exclusive licensing as the default** for publicly funded inventions, with exclusive licenses available only when necessary for development
- **Exercise march-in rights** when publicly funded drugs are priced beyond reach of patients
- **Mandate transparency in licensing agreements** so the public can see terms for taxpayer-funded inventions
- **Streamline technology transfer processes** with standardized licensing terms and faster timelines

**Feasibility:** Low. The pharmaceutical industry and universities will strongly oppose changes to Bayh-Dole. March-in rights could be exercised by executive action but face intense political and legal resistance.

## Solution 3: Clinical Trial Modernization

### Decentralized Trials

**The problem:** Traditional clinical trials require patients to travel to academic medical centers for every visit, limiting enrollment (particularly from rural and minority populations) and increasing costs.

**The solution:**

- **Expand FDA guidance on decentralized trial elements**: remote consent, telemedicine visits, wearable monitoring devices, direct-to-patient drug delivery
- **Create a national clinical trial infrastructure** with community health centers, pharmacies, and primary care offices as trial sites
- **Fund technology platforms** for remote data collection, electronic patient-reported outcomes, and real-time monitoring
- **Establish a patient registry network** for efficient recruitment across demographics

**Evidence:**

- COVID-19 vaccine trials demonstrated feasibility of decentralized elements
- Studies show decentralized trials can reduce costs by 30-50% and improve enrollment diversity
- The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (2022) provides a regulatory framework for decentralized elements that could inform U.S. policy

**Feasibility:** High. FDA has already issued favorable guidance. Industry is moving in this direction. Bipartisan congressional support exists.

### Adaptive and Platform Trials

**The problem:** Traditional randomized controlled trials are slow, expensive, and test one intervention at a time. Many promising treatments are never tested because individual trials are too costly.

**The solution:**

- **Expand use of adaptive trial designs** that allow modification of trial parameters based on interim results
- **Fund permanent platform trials** in major disease areas that can continuously test multiple interventions against a common control arm
- **Integrate real-world evidence** from electronic health records, registries, and insurance claims into the regulatory evidence base
- **Harmonize international trial requirements** to allow multi-country trials with a single protocol

**Evidence:**

- The RECOVERY trial (UK) tested multiple COVID-19 treatments simultaneously and identified dexamethasone as an effective therapy within months
- I-SPY 2 (breast cancer) uses adaptive Bayesian design to evaluate multiple drugs efficiently
- FDA has published guidance supporting adaptive designs and real-world evidence

**Feasibility:** Medium to high. Requires FDA regulatory flexibility, NIH investment in trial infrastructure, and industry willingness to participate.

### Clinical Trial Diversity

**The problem:** Clinical trial populations do not reflect the diversity of patients who will use the resulting therapies. Minorities, elderly patients, and those with comorbidities are systematically underrepresented.

**The solution:**

- **Mandate diversity enrollment targets** tied to disease demographics for NIH-funded trials
- **Fund community engagement infrastructure** in underserved communities
- **Broaden eligibility criteria** to include patients with common comorbidities and prior treatments
- **Require diversity data reporting** as a condition of FDA approval
- **Provide financial support for trial participants** (transportation, childcare, lost wages)

**Feasibility:** Medium. FDA has issued guidance on diversity plans. Congressional support exists (DEPICT Act). Industry resistance varies.

## Solution 4: Reproducibility and Rigor Mandates

### Pre-registration and Registered Reports

**The problem:** Selective reporting and publication bias distort the scientific literature.

**The solution:**

- **Require pre-registration of all NIH-funded studies** in a public registry before data collection begins
- **Incentivize "registered reports"** where journals commit to publishing results before the study is conducted, based on the quality of the question and methodology
- **Fund replication studies** through a dedicated NIH program (perhaps 2-3% of the research budget)
- **Create a public registry of negative and null results** to reduce waste from duplicated failures

**Evidence:**

- ClinicalTrials.gov pre-registration has improved transparency for clinical trials (though compliance is imperfect)
- Journals using registered reports (e.g., *Cortex*, *PLOS ONE*) report higher rates of null results, suggesting reduced publication bias
- The Reproducibility Project demonstrated that systematic replication can identify unreliable findings

**Feasibility:** Medium. Pre-registration is increasingly accepted. NIH already requires clinical trial registration. Extending to preclinical research faces practical challenges but growing support.

### Research Reagent and Materials Standards

**The problem:** Poorly characterized antibodies, contaminated cell lines, and variable reagents contribute to irreproducible results.

**The solution:**

- **Establish a National Biomedical Standards Program** to certify key reagents (antibodies, cell lines, assay kits)
- **Require researchers to use authenticated cell lines** and verify key reagent specificity
- **Fund central repositories** for standardized biological materials
- **Include reagent validation in grant review criteria**

**Feasibility:** High. Low political controversy. NIH can implement through grant conditions. Industry would benefit from improved reproducibility.

## Solution 5: Workforce Reform

### Right-Sizing the Training Pipeline

**The problem:** The biomedical enterprise trains far more PhDs than it can employ in research positions.

**The solution:**

- **Tie training grant numbers to labor market data**: Reduce funded training positions to align with projected career opportunities
- **Require transparent career outcome data**: All NIH-funded training programs must publish placement data (academic, industry, government, other)
- **Expand professional development**: Mandate that training grants include career exploration, business skills, and non-academic pathways
- **Create a "staff scientist" career track**: NIH-funded positions for experienced researchers outside the PI/tenure system

**Evidence:**

- The National Academies' 2018 report *The Next Generation of Biomedical and Behavioral Sciences Researchers* recommended many of these measures
- The UK Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers provides a model for structured career support

**Feasibility:** Medium. Training programs will resist reductions. Cultural change is slow. Transparent outcome data has bipartisan support.

### Improving Compensation and Working Conditions

**The problem:** Postdoctoral researchers earn a median of ~$56,000 after 6+ years of graduate training. Graduate stipends are below living wages in many cities.

**The solution:**

- **Raise the NIH postdoctoral salary floor to $70,000** (indexed to inflation)
- **Set a minimum graduate student stipend of $40,000** for NIH-funded positions
- **Require benefits parity**: Health insurance, retirement contributions, and parental leave for all NIH-funded trainees
- **Limit postdoctoral appointments to 5 years** to prevent indefinite trainee exploitation

**Evidence:**

- Multiple studies show that low pay drives talented scientists to leave research, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds
- Increased postdoc salaries at HHMI did not reduce research productivity; they improved retention and morale

**Feasibility:** Medium to high. NIH can set stipend and salary floors for funded positions. Cost implications are modest relative to the total budget.

### Addressing Diversity Gaps

**The problem:** Black and Hispanic scientists are severely underrepresented in the NIH-funded workforce.

**The solution:**

- **Expand and strengthen the NIH FIRST program** (institutional recruitment of diverse faculty cohorts)
- **Double funding for diversity supplements** that support underrepresented researchers on existing grants
- **Address bias in peer review** through reviewer training, blinded review pilots, and diverse study section composition
- **Fund bridge programs** for underrepresented scientists during funding gaps
- **Investigate and address systemic factors** driving funding disparities (institutional resources, mentorship, network access)

**Feasibility:** Medium. NIH has implemented several initiatives, but progress is slow. Requires sustained commitment and accountability metrics.

## Solution 6: Research Priority Alignment

### Disease Burden-Based Funding

**The problem:** NIH funding allocation does not closely track actual disease burden (measured by disability-adjusted life years, mortality, or economic impact).

**The solution:**

- **Publish an annual "Disease Burden Report"** comparing NIH spending by disease to DALY-based burden estimates
- **Require NIH to explain significant misalignments** between funding and burden in annual budget justifications
- **Create a formula-based floor** for underfunded disease areas, while preserving flexibility for scientific opportunity
- **Expand PCORI-like mechanisms** that incorporate patient priorities into research agenda-setting

**Evidence:**

- Multiple analyses have documented misalignment between NIH spending and disease burden. Some diseases (HIV/AIDS) receive disproportionate funding relative to burden; others (musculoskeletal disorders, mental health) receive disproportionately little
- The UK's NIHR has implemented burden-based priority-setting with positive results

**Feasibility:** Medium. Publishing data is easy; changing allocations is politically difficult because disease advocacy organizations fiercely defend their funding shares.
