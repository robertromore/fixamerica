# Biomedical Research: What Citizens Can Do

## Overview

Biomedical research policy may seem distant from everyday civic engagement, but citizens play a critical role in setting research priorities, funding levels, and accountability standards. The following actions are organized by effort level and potential impact.

## Immediate Actions (Low Effort)

### Educate Yourself

- **Learn about NIH**: Visit the NIH website (<https://www.nih.gov/>) to understand what the agency funds and how
- **Track your representatives' votes**: Check how your members of Congress vote on NIH appropriations and science policy legislation
- **Follow research policy news**: Subscribe to newsletters from Research!America, FASEB, or Science Magazine's policy section
- **Understand the clinical trial system**: Visit ClinicalTrials.gov (<https://clinicaltrials.gov/>) to see what research is happening in your community

### Communicate with Elected Officials

- **Contact your representatives**: Call, email, or write to express support for NIH funding increases and research reform
- **Attend town halls**: Ask questions about science funding and drug development policy
- **Respond to budget proposals**: When NIH cuts are proposed (as they periodically are), contact elected officials immediately
- **Share personal stories**: If you or a family member has benefited from medical research, share that story with your representatives

### Support Research Participation

- **Consider participating in a clinical trial**: Use ClinicalTrials.gov or ResearchMatch (<https://www.researchmatch.org/>) to find studies relevant to your health
- **Join the All of Us Research Program**: NIH's precision medicine initiative recruiting 1 million+ diverse participants (<https://allofus.nih.gov/>)
- **Donate to disease research organizations**: Support organizations funding research in areas important to you
- **Share clinical trial information**: Help people in your community learn about trial opportunities

## Ongoing Actions (Medium Effort)

### Advocate for Research Funding

- **Join Research!America**: The largest U.S. advocacy alliance for research funding, with tools to contact legislators and track policy (<https://www.researchamerica.org/>)
- **Join a disease advocacy organization**: Organizations like the American Cancer Society, Alzheimer's Association, or NORD regularly organize advocacy campaigns
- **Participate in Hill Day events**: Many scientific organizations coordinate annual visits to Congress where constituents can advocate for research funding
- **Support the March for Science**: Participate in marches and events that raise public awareness of science policy

### Engage with Research Policy

- **Comment on NIH policies**: NIH regularly solicits public comment on funding policies, data sharing requirements, and strategic plans through Requests for Information (RFIs)
- **Attend NIH Advisory Council meetings**: Most institute advisory council meetings are open to the public (often via webcast)
- **Participate in PCORI engagement**: The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute seeks patient and public input on research priorities
- **Monitor FDA advisory committees**: FDA advisory committee meetings on drug approvals are open to the public, and citizens can submit testimony

### Support Workforce Reform

- **Advocate for fair trainee pay**: Support campaigns for higher graduate student stipends and postdoctoral salaries at local universities
- **Encourage diverse participation**: Support pipeline programs that bring underrepresented students into science
- **Mentor or sponsor**: If you work in a relevant field, mentor early-career scientists or support diversity initiatives

## Deep Engagement (High Effort)

### Organize and Lead

- **Start or join a local science advocacy chapter**: Organizations like 314 Action and Science Rising have local chapters
- **Run for school board or city council**: Local officials influence STEM education, public health, and support for research institutions
- **Serve on a community advisory board**: Many research institutions have community advisory boards that provide public input on research priorities and ethics

### Drive Policy Change

- **Draft or support state legislation**: Some states have their own research funding programs (California's Proposition 71 for stem cell research, Texas CPRIT for cancer)
- **Advocate for drug pricing reform**: Support policies that ensure publicly funded research leads to affordable treatments
- **Push for open science**: Advocate for policies requiring taxpayer-funded research to be freely available to the public

### Participate in the Research Enterprise

- **Serve as a patient advocate on study sections**: NIH allows patient representatives on some grant review panels
- **Contribute to citizen science**: Participate in projects that contribute to biomedical knowledge (Foldit, Galaxy Zoo Health, etc.)
- **Join a research ethics board (IRB)**: Institutional Review Boards include community members who review research involving human subjects

## Making Your Voice Count

### Most Effective Communication with Congress

1. **Personal stories**: Share how medical research has affected you or your family
2. **Local impact**: Emphasize research institutions and jobs in your district or state
3. **Bipartisan framing**: NIH funding has historically enjoyed bipartisan support; appeal to shared values
4. **Specific asks**: Request support for specific bills, funding levels, or policy changes
5. **Follow up**: Track responses and follow up with additional contacts

### Key Talking Points

- NIH funding generates $2.50-$3.20 in local economic activity for every dollar invested
- The United States' global leadership in biomedical innovation depends on sustained public investment
- Every major medical advance of the past century (vaccines, cancer treatments, HIV therapies, COVID vaccines) built on NIH-funded basic research
- Reform can make research more productive, equitable, and responsive to public health needs without increasing costs
- Clinical trial modernization can bring treatments to patients faster and ensure diverse populations benefit
