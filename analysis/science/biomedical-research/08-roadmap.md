# Biomedical Research: Roadmap

## Implementation Strategy

Reform of the biomedical research enterprise must be sequenced to build momentum, demonstrate results, and create political support for more ambitious changes. The roadmap is organized into three phases, with each phase building on the accomplishments and coalition-building of the previous one.

## Phase 1: Immediate Reforms (Years 1-2)

### Priority: Low-Hanging Fruit and Coalition Building

**Objective:** Implement reforms that can be achieved through NIH administrative action, executive orders, or bipartisan legislation. Demonstrate early wins to build support for broader reform.

### 1.1 Grant Mechanism Improvements

**Actions:**

- NIH extends default R01 grant period from 5 to 7 years for new awards
- Implement shortened initial applications (5-page specific aims and significance) with full proposals only for competitive applications
- Expand the Early Stage Investigator (ESI) set-aside to guarantee 25% of R01 funding for first-time PIs
- Pilot a modified lottery system for applications scoring within the competitive range at 2-3 institutes

**Responsible parties:** NIH Director, Institute Directors, Center for Scientific Review

**Success metrics:**

- Researcher time spent on grant writing reduced by 20%
- First-time PI success rate increased to 25%+
- Pilot lottery evaluation completed with stakeholder feedback

### 1.2 Reproducibility and Rigor

**Actions:**

**Responsible parties:** NIH Office of Extramural Research, training program directors, universities

**Success metrics:**

- Postdoctoral salary floor implemented across all NIH-funded positions
- Career outcome data published by 90%+ of training programs
- Staff scientist positions created and filled at 50+ institutions

## Phase 2: Structural Changes (Years 3-5)

### Priority: Legislative Action and Institutional Reform

**Objective:** Enact legislation that codifies Phase 1 reforms and enables deeper structural changes. Build on demonstrated results to overcome institutional resistance.

### 2.1 NIH Reform and Accountability Act

**Actions:**

- Pass comprehensive legislation restructuring NIH grant mechanisms (see [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md))
- Implement F&A transparency requirements with annual public reporting
- Begin phased F&A rate cap reduction (from current rates toward 40% over 5 years)
- Establish an independent NIH Inspector General for research integrity

**Responsible parties:** Congress (HELP Committee, Appropriations), HHS, NIH

**Success metrics:**

- Legislation enacted with bipartisan support
- F&A transparency reports published by all NIH-funded institutions
- Measurable increase in direct research spending as a share of total NIH expenditure

### 2.2 Clinical Trial Modernization Act

**Actions:**

- Pass legislation codifying decentralized trial framework (see [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md))
- Establish permanent platform trials in 5 major disease areas (cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, infectious disease, rare diseases)
- Implement real-world evidence integration standards
- Create a National Clinical Trial Participant Bill of Rights

**Responsible parties:** Congress, FDA, NIH, industry partners

**Success metrics:**

- Platform trials operational in all 5 disease areas
- Real-world evidence accepted in 20%+ of new drug applications
- Average Phase III trial cost reduced by 20%

### 2.3 Translational Pipeline Expansion

**Actions:**

- Double NCATS budget to ~$1.8 billion
- Grow ARPA-H to $5 billion with expanded translational authority
- Establish 10 Regional Translational Research Hubs
- Create a Translational Research Service Corps (100 experienced developers rotating between sectors)

**Responsible parties:** Congress, HHS, NCATS, ARPA-H

**Success metrics:**

- Number of NIH-funded discoveries entering clinical development increased by 50%
- Average time from discovery to IND application reduced by 2 years
- Translational hubs operational in all 10 HHS regions

### 2.4 Workforce Structural Reform

**Actions:**

- Tie training grant allocations to labor market data (phased reduction where oversupply exists)
- Raise postdoctoral salary floor to $70,000 (indexed to CPI)
- Raise graduate stipend floor to $40,000 with mandatory benefits
- Limit NIH-funded postdoctoral appointments to 5 years
- Expand the Staff Scientist Initiative to 2,000 positions

**Responsible parties:** NIH, universities, training programs

**Success metrics:**

- PhD production in oversupplied fields begins to decline
- Postdoctoral stint average duration decreases
- Staff scientist career track established at 100+ institutions
- Trainee satisfaction scores improve on NIH surveys

## Phase 3: Systemic Transformation (Years 5-10)

### Priority: Long-Term Structural Realignment

**Objective:** Complete the transformation of the biomedical research enterprise toward sustainable, efficient, and equitable operation.

### 3.1 Funding Model Transformation

**Actions:**

- Implement full "People, Not Projects" funding for a significant share (~20%) of the NIH research portfolio
- Complete F&A rate reform with cap at 40% and full transparency
- Establish disease burden-based funding floors for underserved research areas
- Create a permanent NIH Strategic Investment Fund for emerging scientific opportunities

**Success metrics:**

- Research output per dollar invested increases measurably
- Grant application burden reduced by 40%+ from baseline
- Funding distribution more closely aligned with disease burden
- U.S. maintains global leadership in biomedical publications and patents

### 3.2 Clinical Translation Ecosystem

**Actions:**

- Integrate all translational mechanisms (NCATS, ARPA-H, SBIR/STTR, CTSAs) into a coordinated pipeline
- Implement conditional pricing agreements for drugs developed with significant public funding
- Establish international clinical trial harmonization agreements with EU, UK, Japan, and Canada
- Create a public-private drug development fund for neglected diseases and antibiotic resistance

**Success metrics:**

- Time from discovery to patient access reduced by 30% from baseline
- Clinical trial participation reflects U.S. demographic diversity
- Neglected disease drug development pipeline expanded by 100%

### 3.3 Research Culture Change

**Actions:**

- Reform academic promotion and tenure criteria to reward rigor, reproducibility, and mentorship alongside discovery
- Replace journal impact factor-based evaluation with comprehensive research contribution metrics
- Establish a National Research Integrity Board to monitor and enforce standards
- Achieve diversity in the research workforce that reflects U.S. demographics

**Success metrics:**

- Replication success rates improve to 70%+ in major fields
- NIH-funded PI demographics approach U.S. population proportions
- Researcher career satisfaction and mental health improve on longitudinal surveys
