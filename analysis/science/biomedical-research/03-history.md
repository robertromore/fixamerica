# Biomedical Research: History

## Origins of Federal Biomedical Research

### The Laboratory of Hygiene (1887-1930)

The NIH traces its origins to the Laboratory of Hygiene, a one-room bacteriology laboratory established in 1887 at the Marine Hospital on Staten Island. Its mission was modest: investigate infectious diseases affecting immigrants and sailors. Under Joseph Kinyoun, the lab conducted pathbreaking work on cholera and diphtheria.

**Key milestones:**

- **1887**: Laboratory of Hygiene established within the Marine Hospital Service
- **1891**: Laboratory relocated to Washington, D.C.
- **1901**: Reorganized under the Hygienic Laboratory; Congress authorized investigations of "infectious and contagious diseases and matters pertaining to public health"
- **1930**: Ransdell Act renamed it the National Institute of Health and authorized fellowships for research

### The Prewar Foundation (1930-1941)

The newly named National Institute of Health expanded slowly during the Depression, but important precedents were set:

- **1935**: Rocky Mountain Laboratory (Montana) became first NIH field station
- **1937**: National Cancer Institute Act created the NCI, the first disease-specific institute, with authority to award extramural grants
- **1938**: NIH moved to its current Bethesda, Maryland campus (donated by Luke and Helen Wilson)
- **1940**: NIH budget reached $2.8 million (approximately $60 million in 2025 dollars)

The NCI's creation established the model for disease-specific institutes that would define NIH's structure. Crucially, the NCI was authorized to fund research at external institutions, creating the extramural grant system that would become NIH's primary function.

## The Postwar Expansion (1945-1970)

### Vannevar Bush and "Science, the Endless Frontier"

Vannevar Bush's 1945 report to President Truman, *Science, the Endless Frontier*, argued that government-funded basic research was essential to national health, security, and economic prosperity. Bush proposed creating a single national research foundation, but political disputes delayed the creation of the National Science Foundation until 1950.

In the interim, NIH filled the vacuum. Congressional champions, particularly Senator Lister Hill (D-AL) and Representative John Fogarty (D-RI), secured dramatic funding increases and created new institutes.

### The "Golden Age" of Expansion

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1946 | NIH grants program expanded | Extramural research became dominant model |
| 1948 | National Heart Institute and others created | Name changed to National Institutes of Health (plural) |
| 1949 | NIH budget exceeded $50 million | Rapid postwar growth |
| 1953 | Clinical Center opened in Bethesda | World's largest research hospital |
| 1955 | Polio vaccine (Salk) | NIH-supported research produced landmark achievement |
| 1962 | NIH budget exceeded $1 billion | Dramatic expansion under Hill-Fogarty |
| 1965 | Medicare enacted | Expanded clinical research opportunities |

### Establishment of the Intramural-Extramural Balance

During this period, NIH evolved from primarily an intramural research institution (conducting research in its own labs) to primarily an extramural funder (awarding grants to universities and research institutions). Today, roughly 80% of the NIH budget supports extramural research, while ~10% supports intramural programs and the remainder covers administration and other functions.

## The War on Cancer and Its Legacy (1971-1990)

### The National Cancer Act of 1971

President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act on December 23, 1971, declaring a "war on cancer." The Act gave the NCI enhanced authority and funding, including:

- Direct presidential appointment of the NCI director
- NCI authority to submit budget requests directly to the president (bypassing NIH director)
- Expanded NCI authority for clinical trials and cancer centers
- Creation of the National Cancer Advisory Board

**Impact and lessons:**

The War on Cancer demonstrated both the power and limits of targeted research campaigns. Cancer death rates eventually declined significantly (a ~33% reduction in age-adjusted mortality between 1991 and 2020), but progress was slower than advocates promised. The campaign revealed that cancer is not one disease but hundreds, each requiring different approaches. It also established a precedent for disease-specific advocacy driving funding decisions, sometimes at the expense of basic research and less politically prominent diseases.

### The Bayh-Dole Act (1980)

The Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act (Bayh-Dole) allowed universities, small businesses, and nonprofits to patent inventions arising from federally funded research. This transformed the relationship between academic research and commercial development.

**Effects:**

- Created university technology transfer offices
- Generated revenue from licensing agreements (billions of dollars collectively)
- Incentivized applied research and industry collaboration
- Raised questions about conflicts of interest and public access to publicly funded discoveries
- March-in rights (allowing government to license patents to third parties if public health needs are not met) have never been exercised despite repeated petitions

### The HIV/AIDS Crisis

The emergence of HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s reshaped biomedical research and its relationship with patient advocacy.

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1981 | First CDC reports of unusual pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma |
| 1984 | HIV identified as the cause of AIDS (Gallo and Montagnier) |
| 1987 | AZT becomes first FDA-approved HIV drug; ACT UP founded |
| 1988 | NIAID establishes AIDS Clinical Trials Group |
| 1990 | Ryan White CARE Act provides treatment funding |

The AIDS activist movement, particularly ACT UP, pioneered a new model of patient engagement with the research process. Activists demanded seats at the table in clinical trial design, challenged FDA approval timelines, and successfully pushed for expanded access to experimental treatments. This movement permanently changed how patient advocates interact with the research enterprise.

## The NIH Doubling (1998-2003)

### Political Context

In the late 1990s, a remarkable bipartisan consensus emerged in Congress to double the NIH budget over five years. Champions included Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), and Representative John Porter (R-IL). The doubling was supported by disease advocacy organizations, universities, and the pharmaceutical industry.

### The Numbers

| Fiscal Year | NIH Budget | Year-over-Year Increase |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| FY1998 | $13.6 billion | Baseline |
| FY1999 | $15.6 billion | +14.7% |
| FY2000 | $17.9 billion | +14.7% |
| FY2001 | $20.5 billion | +14.5% |
| FY2002 | $23.3 billion | +13.7% |
| FY2003 | $27.2 billion | +16.7% |

### Consequences of the Doubling

The doubling produced genuine scientific benefits, including the completion of the Human Genome Project, expansion of clinical and translational research, and establishment of new research programs. However, it also created structural problems that persist:

**Positive effects:**

- Accelerated genomic research and personalized medicine
- Expanded clinical and translational science awards (CTSAs)
- Increased researcher diversity (modestly)
- Built new research facilities nationwide

**Negative effects:**

- Universities expanded research infrastructure assuming continued growth
- Faculty hiring surged during the doubling, creating obligations that flat budgets could not sustain
- Grant applications increased faster than budgets, driving down success rates
- The "cliff" after FY2003 (budgets flattened in nominal terms, declined in real terms) was devastating

## Post-Doubling Stagnation (2004-2015)

### The Lost Decade

From FY2003 to FY2015, the NIH budget grew only modestly in nominal terms and *declined* in real terms when adjusted for the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index (BRDPI), which tracks the actual costs of conducting biomedical research.

**Key consequences:**

- Grant success rates plummeted from ~30% to below 20%
- Established investigators lost funding; new investigators struggled to enter the system
- Research shifted toward "safe" incremental projects likely to be funded
- The average age at which scientists received their first R01 grant rose from ~38 to ~43
- Postdoctoral periods lengthened as researchers waited for faculty positions and grants

### Sequestration (2013)

The Budget Control Act of 2011 triggered automatic spending cuts (sequestration) beginning in March 2013. NIH lost approximately $1.6 billion (about 5%) in a single year.

**Effects:**

- ~700 fewer new grants funded
- Labs reduced staff, curtailed experiments, and deferred equipment purchases
- Training positions eliminated
- Clinical trials enrollment slowed
- Morale declined across the research workforce

### The Ebola Wake-Up Call (2014)

The West African Ebola outbreak highlighted how decades of underfunding infectious disease research left the world unprepared. NIH Director Francis Collins noted that an Ebola vaccine had shown promise in animal studies years earlier but was delayed by funding constraints. The crisis spurred modest emergency appropriations and renewed attention to pandemic preparedness research.

## Modern Era (2016-Present)

### 21st Century Cures Act (2016)

This landmark bipartisan legislation provided:

- $4.8 billion in NIH funding over 10 years (above regular appropriations)
- $1.8 billion for the Cancer Moonshot initiative
- $1.4 billion for the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us)
- $1.6 billion for the BRAIN Initiative
- Streamlined FDA regulatory pathways
- Support for real-world evidence in drug approval

The Act represented a significant investment but was criticized for providing time-limited funding rather than sustained base increases.

### The COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2023)

The pandemic was the most significant event in biomedical research since the postwar era. NIH played a central role:

- **Foundational science**: Decades of NIH-funded research on coronaviruses, mRNA technology (Karik and Weissman, NIH-supported), and viral immunology enabled the rapid vaccine response
- **Operation Warp Speed**: Federal investment of ~$18 billion compressed vaccine development from the typical 10-15 years to under 1 year
- **ACTIV (Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines)**: Public-private partnership coordinated therapeutic development
- **RADx (Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics)**: Accelerated diagnostic test development and deployment
- **Research disruption**: Non-COVID research was significantly delayed, with lasting effects on careers and programs

### Post-Pandemic Developments

- **ARPA-H established (2022)**: New agency within HHS for high-risk, high-reward health research
- **Budget recovery**: NIH budgets have grown, but inflation has eroded real purchasing power
- **Workforce reckoning**: COVID exposed the fragility of the research workforce, particularly for early-career scientists
- **AI revolution**: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are transforming biomedical research, from drug discovery (AlphaFold) to clinical trials to medical imaging
- **Political tensions**: NIH has faced increased political scrutiny over gain-of-function research, lab safety, and COVID origins investigations

## Historical Patterns and Lessons

### Boom-and-Bust Funding

The history of NIH funding reveals a recurring pattern of enthusiasm-driven surges followed by stagnation or decline. The postwar expansion, the NIH doubling, and COVID-era supplemental funding all followed this pattern. Each boom expanded the research enterprise, and each subsequent plateau or contraction created painful adjustments.

### Disease Advocacy and Political Dynamics

Funding decisions have always been influenced by disease advocacy as much as scientific merit. Cancer, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's, and rare diseases have all benefited from organized advocacy campaigns. Diseases that disproportionately affect politically marginalized populations (mental illness, substance use disorders, tropical diseases) have historically been underfunded relative to their burden.

### The Tension Between Direction and Discovery

Every generation debates whether research should be directed at specific problems or left to investigator curiosity. History suggests both approaches are necessary: directed programs (War on Cancer, Human Genome Project, COVID vaccines) achieve targeted goals, while investigator-initiated basic research (the discovery of restriction enzymes, CRISPR, mRNA biology) generates the foundational knowledge that makes directed programs possible.
