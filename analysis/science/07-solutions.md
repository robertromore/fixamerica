# Science Policy: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

Reforms to American science policy should be guided by:

- **Stability**: Research requires predictable, long-term investment; reforms should insulate science from political cycles
- **Merit and equity**: The best ideas should be funded regardless of where they originate or who proposes them
- **Openness**: Publicly funded research should be publicly accessible
- **Accountability**: Public investment demands transparency and responsible stewardship
- **Efficiency**: Reduce administrative burden and redirect resources from process to discovery
- **Diversity**: A thriving scientific enterprise draws from the full talent pool of the nation
- **Security with proportionality**: Protect against genuine threats without chilling legitimate collaboration

## Funding Stability Reforms

### Multi-Year Research Appropriations

**Problem**: Annual appropriations cycles create funding uncertainty that disrupts multi-year research.

**Solution**: Establish multi-year appropriations authority for federal research agencies, similar to the model used for military construction and some defense programs.

- Authorize 3-5 year funding commitments for research agency budgets
- Include automatic continuing resolution provisions specific to research agencies
- Create a Research Stabilization Fund that smooths year-to-year fluctuations
- Protect research funding from government shutdowns through advance appropriations

**Evidence**: The Department of Veterans Affairs medical care is funded one year in advance, providing a model for research funding. NIH's National Cancer Institute received mandatory funding through the 21st Century Cures Act, demonstrating feasibility.

### Increase Federal R&D Investment to 1% of GDP

**Problem**: Federal R&D has declined from 1.86% of GDP (1964) to 0.73% (2024).

**Solution**: Set a national target of federal R&D investment at 1% of GDP, phased in over 10 years.

- This would represent approximately $270 billion per year at current GDP levels
- Increase would be distributed across agencies based on strategic priorities
- Fund the full CHIPS and Science Act authorizations
- Create new programs for emerging technologies (AI, quantum, biotech)

**International comparison**: South Korea invests 4.9% of GDP in R&D; Israel invests 5.6%. Even reaching 1% of GDP in federal spending would bring total U.S. R&D closer to 4% of GDP, still below these leaders.

## Grant System Reform

### Streamline the Application Process

**Problem**: Researchers spend 40-50% of their time writing grants, and success rates are below 25%.

**Solutions**:

- **Shorter initial proposals**: Require 3-5 page preliminary proposals; full proposals only for those advancing past initial review
- **Standardized formats**: Create common application elements across agencies to reduce duplication
- **Reduce resubmission cycles**: Allow one resubmission with streamlined review rather than starting from scratch
- **Longer grant durations**: Increase standard grant duration from 3-5 years to 5-7 years, with mid-term review
- **Rolling deadlines**: Replace fixed deadlines with rolling submission and review

### People-Based Funding

**Problem**: Project-based funding forces researchers to predict results in advance, penalizing exploratory work.

**Solution**: Expand people-based funding models that support researchers rather than specific projects.

- Expand NIH's Pioneer Awards, HHMI Investigator model, and NSF CAREER awards
- Create a "Research Scholars" program providing 5-7 year unrestricted funding to top researchers
- Implement lottery-based funding for proposals that pass quality thresholds (as tested by New Zealand's Health Research Council)
- Reduce the share of funding allocated through traditional project grants from ~80% to ~60%

**Evidence**: HHMI investigators produce higher-impact and more innovative research than equivalently funded NIH investigators, according to studies published in *Research Policy* and *PNAS*.

### Indirect Cost Reform

**Problem**: Indirect cost rates of 50-65% mean that a significant share of grant funding goes to institutional overhead rather than research.

**Solutions**:

- Cap indirect cost rates at 40% for all federal research grants
- Require transparency in how indirect cost funds are spent
- Create a separate infrastructure funding stream so research grants focus on research
- Reward institutions that reduce administrative overhead without cutting research support
- Phase in changes over 5 years to allow institutional adaptation

## Open Science

### Universal Open Access

**Problem**: Taxpayer-funded research is often locked behind paywalls.

**Solutions**:

- Fully implement the Nelson Memo requiring immediate open access for all federally funded publications
- Fund agency-operated repositories (PubMed Central, NSF-PAR) as critical infrastructure
- Cap Article Processing Charges to prevent new barriers for underfunded researchers
- Support preprint servers as first-release venues
- Require machine-readable, FAIR-compliant data deposits for all federally funded research

### Data Sharing and Reproducibility

**Solutions**:

- Mandate sharing of all research data, code, and materials within 12 months of publication
- Fund data repositories and curation infrastructure
- Require pre-registration of clinical trials and other confirmatory studies
- Support replication studies through dedicated funding programs
- Develop community standards for data sharing across disciplines

---

## Workforce Development

### Fix the Postdoc Problem

**Problem**: Postdocs are underpaid, overworked, and face dim career prospects.

**Solutions**:

- Raise NRSA minimum stipend to $70,000, with annual cost-of-living adjustments
- Limit postdoctoral appointments to 5 years maximum
- Require postdoc mentoring plans and career development as grant conditions
- Create "staff scientist" positions at universities and national labs as an alternative to the faculty-or-bust pipeline
- Mandate benefits (health insurance, retirement, parental leave) for all postdocs

### Diversify the STEM Workforce

**Problem**: Black, Hispanic, and Native American researchers are severely underrepresented.

**Solutions**:

- Increase funding for research at minority-serving institutions (HBCUs, HSIs, TCUs)
- Expand bridge programs between undergraduate and graduate education
- Fund mentorship networks and professional development for underrepresented scientists
- Require diversity, equity, and inclusion plans in institutional grants
- Address financial barriers through expanded fellowships and loan forgiveness
- Track and publish diversity metrics for all federally funded programs

### Support International Talent

**Problem**: Visa uncertainty and the China Initiative's chilling effect are driving away international researchers.

**Solutions**:

- Streamline visa processing for researchers (H-1B, J-1, O-1)
- Create a dedicated "STEM visa" with expedited processing and path to permanent residency
- Eliminate per-country green card caps for STEM workers
- Implement research security measures that target behavior (undisclosed conflicts) rather than nationality
- Rebuild trust with Asian and Asian American scientific communities

## Scientific Integrity

### Codify Scientific Integrity Protections

**Problem**: Agency scientific integrity policies are executive actions that can be reversed by new administrations.

**Solutions**:

- Enact legislation codifying scientific integrity requirements for all federal agencies
- Create independent scientific integrity officers with removal protections
- Establish whistleblower protections for government scientists who report political interference
- Prohibit political appointees from altering or suppressing scientific findings
- Require public disclosure of any changes to scientific reports or communications

### Restore Congressional Science Capacity

**Problem**: Congress has limited ability to understand or oversee science policy since abolishing OTA in 1995.

**Solutions**:

- Restore the Office of Technology Assessment or create an equivalent body
- Increase staffing for congressional science committees
- Expand the Government Accountability Office's science and technology assessment capabilities
- Create a Congressional Science Fellowship program modeled on AAAS fellowships

---

## Research Security

### Balanced Approach to Research Security

**Problem**: Legitimate security concerns have been addressed through overbroad measures that chill collaboration.

**Solutions**:

- Focus enforcement on undisclosed conflicts of interest and actual IP theft, not national origin
- Standardize disclosure requirements across agencies to reduce confusion
- Provide clear guidance on permissible international collaboration
- Create a Research Security Advisory Board with academic, agency, and security representation
- Fund research security offices at universities to help researchers navigate requirements
- Separate genuine espionage cases from grant compliance issues
