# Science Policy: History

## Overview

American science policy is largely a post-World War II creation. Before the war, the federal government played a limited role in research, with notable exceptions in agriculture and public health. The wartime mobilization of science -- exemplified by the Manhattan Project, radar development, and penicillin production -- demonstrated the power of organized research and fundamentally altered the relationship between government and science. The seven decades since have seen recurring cycles of investment and neglect, shaped by geopolitical competition, economic priorities, and shifting attitudes toward expertise.

## Pre-World War II (Before 1940)

### Early Federal Science

- **1807**: Thomas Jefferson establishes the U.S. Coast Survey, one of the first federal scientific agencies
- **1862**: Morrill Land-Grant Act creates public universities with research missions; USDA established
- **1863**: National Academy of Sciences chartered by Congress to advise the government
- **1870**: U.S. Weather Bureau established
- **1901**: National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) created
- **1912**: Public Health Service formalized
- **1915**: National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, predecessor to NASA) established

### Interwar Period

- Federal research spending was minimal -- approximately $70 million in 1940 (roughly $1.5 billion in 2024 dollars)
- Most research was conducted by private industry (Bell Labs, GE Research, DuPont) and private universities
- Agricultural experiment stations and the Public Health Service were the primary federal research operations
- The National Institutes of Health was established in 1930, evolving from the Hygienic Laboratory

---

## The Wartime Transformation (1940-1945)

### Mobilizing Science for War

- **1940**: Vannevar Bush convinces President Roosevelt to create the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)
- **1941**: NDRC reorganized as the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), with Bush as director
- **1942-1945**: Manhattan Project develops the atomic bomb, employing 125,000 workers at a cost of $2 billion ($30 billion in 2024 dollars)
- **1943-1945**: MIT Radiation Laboratory develops radar systems that prove decisive in the war
- **1944**: Mass production of penicillin achieved through government-university-industry collaboration
- Federal R&D spending increases from $70 million (1940) to $1.6 billion (1945)

### Lessons Learned

The wartime experience established several enduring principles:

- Government investment in research yields enormous strategic and economic returns
- Universities are essential partners in the research enterprise
- Basic research, not just weapons development, was critical (e.g., radar emerged from fundamental physics)
- A permanent relationship between government and science was needed to sustain national security

---

## The Postwar Settlement (1945-1957)

### *Science: The Endless Frontier* (1945)

At Roosevelt's request, Vannevar Bush authored the foundational document of American science policy. *Science: The Endless Frontier* argued that:

- Basic research is the "pacemaker of technological progress"
- Government should fund research but not control it -- scientists should self-govern through peer review
- A new federal agency should support basic research across all disciplines
- The nation needed a robust pipeline of trained scientists and engineers

This report established the "linear model" of innovation -- the idea that basic research leads to applied research, which leads to development, which leads to economic and social benefits.

### Creation of Key Institutions

| Year | Institution | Significance |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1946 | Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) | Civilian control of nuclear research; predecessor to DOE |
| 1946 | Office of Naval Research (ONR) | First sustained federal support for university research |
| 1947 | National Security Act | Created the Department of Defense and CIA |
| 1948 | NIH extramural grants program | Systematic federal funding of university biomedical research |
| 1950 | National Science Foundation | Dedicated agency for basic research across all fields |
| 1951 | National Science Board | Oversight body for NSF, advisory to the President |

### The NSF Debate

The creation of NSF was delayed five years by a dispute between Bush (who wanted a scientist-controlled agency) and Senator Harley Kilgore (who wanted democratic accountability and geographic distribution). Truman vetoed Bush's version in 1947. The 1950 compromise created a presidentially appointed director with a National Science Board providing oversight -- a structure that persists today.

## The Sputnik Revolution (1957-1968)

### The Space Race

- **October 4, 1957**: Soviet Union launches Sputnik, the first artificial satellite
- The "Sputnik shock" triggers a massive expansion of federal science and education spending
- Federal R&D spending triples from $3.4 billion (1957) to $12 billion (1964)
- Federal R&D as a share of GDP reaches its all-time peak of 1.86% in 1964

### Key Responses

| Year | Action | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1957 | DARPA established | High-risk, high-reward defense research (later creates the internet) |
| 1958 | NASA created | Consolidates space research from NACA and military programs |
| 1958 | National Defense Education Act (NDEA) | Massive investment in science and math education, graduate fellowships |
| 1958 | Science advisor to the President | Formalized role for science advice in the White House |
| 1961 | Kennedy's Moon speech | Apollo program commits $25 billion ($200+ billion in 2024 dollars) |
| 1965 | Higher Education Act | Federal support for universities and student aid |
| 1965 | Medicare/Medicaid enacted | Increases demand for biomedical research |
| 1965 | NSF budget quadruples | From $134 million (1960) to $480 million (1965) |

### The Biomedical Expansion

NIH funding grew from $81 million in 1955 to $1.4 billion by 1967, driven by bipartisan support for medical research and effective advocacy by disease-specific lobbies. This established the pattern of NIH as the largest funder of civilian research.

---

## Retrenchment and Redirection (1968-1980)

### Post-Apollo Decline

- Federal R&D spending as a share of GDP declines from 1.86% (1964) to 1.0% (1975)
- Nixon abolishes the White House science advisory structure in 1973 (restored by Ford in 1976)
- Vietnam War diverts federal spending from civilian research
- Student protests and public skepticism of technology erode support for the scientific establishment

### New Priorities

| Year | Development | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1970 | EPA established | Environmental regulation creates demand for environmental science |
| 1971 | National Cancer Act ("War on Cancer") | Nixon doubles NCI budget; creates model for disease-specific research pushes |
| 1974 | National Research Act | Creates institutional review boards (IRBs) for human subjects research |
| 1975 | Asilomar Conference | Scientists voluntarily pause recombinant DNA research to assess safety |
| 1976 | OSTP Act | Creates Office of Science and Technology Policy in the White House |
| 1976 | Government in the Sunshine Act | Increases transparency requirements for advisory committees |

### The Mansfield Amendment (1969)

Senator Mike Mansfield's amendment to the defense authorization bill required that all DOD-funded research have a "direct and apparent" military application. This shifted basic research from DOD to civilian agencies (particularly NSF) and accelerated the transition from defense-driven to civilian science policy.

---

## The Innovation Policy Era (1980-1992)

### The Bayh-Dole Revolution

The **Bayh-Dole Act (1980)** allowed universities and small businesses to patent inventions made with federal funding. This single piece of legislation transformed the relationship between academic research and commercial innovation:

- Universities created technology transfer offices
- Patent licensing revenue grew from negligible to billions per year
- Critics argue it created perverse incentives that distort research priorities
- Supporters credit it with the biotechnology industry, medical device innovation, and thousands of startups

### Other Key Developments

| Year | Development | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1980 | Stevenson-Wydler Act | Encourages technology transfer from federal labs |
| 1982 | Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) | Requires federal agencies to set aside funds for small business R&D |
| 1983 | Strategic Defense Initiative ("Star Wars") | Reagan increases defense R&D dramatically |
| 1985 | Gramm-Rudman-Hollings | First automatic budget cuts threaten research funding |
| 1986 | Federal Technology Transfer Act | Enables cooperative R&D agreements (CRADAs) between labs and companies |
| 1988 | Human Genome Project proposed | Largest coordinated biological research project in history |
| 1989 | Fall of the Berlin Wall | Begins shift of defense R&D to civilian priorities |
| 1991 | High Performance Computing Act (Gore Bill) | Seeds the development of the internet for civilian use |

### Reagan-Era Defense Buildup

Defense R&D nearly doubled under Reagan, from $22 billion (1980) to $42 billion (1989), while civilian R&D remained relatively flat. The defense share of federal R&D reached 69% by 1986.

## The 1990s: Genome, Internet, and the Peace Dividend (1992-2001)

### Human Genome Project

- Launched formally in 1990 as a joint NIH-DOE effort
- Cost approximately $2.7 billion over 13 years
- Competition with Craig Venter's Celera Genomics accelerated the timeline
- Draft sequence announced in 2000; completed in 2003
- Estimated to have generated $141 in economic activity for every $1 invested
- Established model for big science in biology

### Post-Cold War Transitions

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Superconducting Super Collider canceled (1993) | $11 billion physics project killed by Congress after $2 billion spent |
| Space Station redesigned (1993) | International Space Station becomes collaboration with Russia |
| Defense R&D declines | "Peace dividend" reduces defense share of federal R&D |
| IT revolution | Federal investments (ARPANET, GPS, early web) yield enormous economic returns |
| Climate science grows | IPCC established (1988); U.S. Global Change Research Program formalized (1990) |

### Doubling the NIH Budget (1998-2003)

Congress doubled the NIH budget from $13.6 billion (FY 1998) to $27.3 billion (FY 2003) in a rare display of sustained bipartisan support. This five-year doubling:

- Expanded the biomedical research enterprise significantly
- Created expectations of sustained growth that would not be met
- The post-doubling plateau led to a decade of flat or declining real funding
- Many researchers hired during the expansion struggled to maintain funding

---

## Post-9/11 and the Competitiveness Debate (2001-2015)

### Security Concerns Reshape Science

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2001 | USA PATRIOT Act | New restrictions on hazardous materials, visa processing delays |
| 2001 | Anthrax attacks | Massive increase in biodefense research funding |
| 2002 | DHS established | New R&D mission, but also new bureaucracy |
| 2004 | Visa delays | International students and researchers face months-long waits |

### The Competitiveness Alarm

- **2005**: National Academies publish *Rising Above the Gathering Storm*, warning that declining investment threatens U.S. competitiveness
- **2007**: America COMPETES Act authorizes increased funding for NSF, DOE Office of Science, and NIST
- **2010**: *Rising Above the Gathering Storm, Revisited* finds the situation has worsened
- **2011**: America COMPETES Reauthorization Act continues authorized increases

### Sequestration and Austerity

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2011 | Budget Control Act | Imposes caps on discretionary spending; threatens sequestration |
| 2013 | Sequestration takes effect | 5% across-the-board cuts to research agencies (~$2.5B reduction) |
| 2013 | Government shutdown (16 days) | Research disrupted, clinical trials delayed |
| 2014-2015 | Flat budgets | Real purchasing power of NIH drops 20% below 2003 levels |

The sequestration era demonstrated the vulnerability of research funding to deficit politics. NIH lost an estimated 1,600 grants in FY 2013, and the disruption to ongoing research was far greater than the dollar amount suggests.

## COVID-19 and the CHIPS Era (2016-Present)

### Pre-Pandemic Developments

- **2016**: 21st Century Cures Act provides $6.3 billion in NIH funding over 10 years, including BRAIN Initiative and Precision Medicine
- **2017**: March for Science draws hundreds of thousands worldwide, reflecting concern about political interference with science
- **2018**: DOJ launches "China Initiative" targeting researchers with ties to China
- **2019**: NIH begins investigations of undisclosed foreign ties; approximately 200 scientists investigated

### COVID-19 and Operation Warp Speed (2020-2021)

The pandemic demonstrated both the power of scientific investment and the fragility of public trust:

| Development | Significance |
|-------------|--------------|
| mRNA vaccine development | Decades of federally funded basic research enabled vaccines in under a year |
| Operation Warp Speed | $18 billion public-private partnership; delivered 3 vaccines in record time |
| NIH/BARDA collaboration | Government funding de-risked industry investment |
| Public health communication | Mixed messages eroded trust; politicization deepened partisan divide |
| Ivermectin/hydroxychloroquine debates | Misinformation challenged evidence-based medicine |

### CHIPS and Science Act (2022)

The most significant science policy legislation in decades:

- **CHIPS Act**: $52 billion for semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.
- **Science Act**: Authorized $170+ billion over 5 years for research agencies
- Created NSF Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (TIP) directorate
- Authorized 10 regional innovation hubs
- Expanded STEM education and workforce programs
- Appropriations have consistently fallen short of authorizations

### Recent Developments (2022-2024)

| Development | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Nelson Memo (OSTP 2022) | Zero-embargo open access for federally funded research by end of 2025 |
| ARPA-H established (2022) | Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, initial budget ~$2.5B |
| China Initiative ended (2022) | Rebranded as "Disruptive Technology Strike Force" |
| Scientific integrity frameworks | OSTP issues government-wide scientific integrity framework (2023) |
| AI executive order (2023) | Directs agencies to address AI safety and use in research |
| CHIPS Act implementation | Semiconductor fab construction begins; research provisions lag |

## Recurring Themes Across Eras

### Cycles of Investment and Neglect

Every major increase in science funding -- post-Sputnik, the NIH doubling, the CHIPS Act -- has been followed by plateaus or declines. The research enterprise is poorly designed to absorb large funding surges or withstand sudden cuts, yet the political system produces exactly these patterns.

### Crisis-Driven Investment

Federal science investment has consistently been driven by external threats (WWII, Sputnik, 9/11, COVID-19, China competition) rather than sustained commitment to discovery. This reactive pattern produces inefficient boom-bust cycles.

### Tension Between Control and Autonomy

From the NSF founding debate to the China Initiative, the relationship between political accountability and scientific autonomy has been repeatedly contested. Each era produces its own version of this fundamental tension.

### Expanding Research Enterprise Without Proportional Funding

The number of researchers, universities, and research programs has expanded continuously, while funding has not kept pace, leading to ever-more-competitive grant systems and growing pressure on individual investigators.
