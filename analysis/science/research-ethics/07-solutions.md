# Research Ethics: Solutions

## Overview

The solutions proposed here address the root causes identified in this analysis: fragmented oversight, institutional conflicts of interest, the private sector gap, inadequate enforcement, evolving research methodologies, and persistent trust deficits. They are organized from highest to lowest priority based on urgency, feasibility, and potential impact.

---

## Solution 1: Modernize and Extend the Common Rule

### Problem Addressed

The Common Rule applies only to federally funded research at institutions with a Federal Wide Assurance. Privately funded research, technology company experiments, and research at unaffiliated institutions may lack ethical oversight entirely.

### Proposal

Enact federal legislation extending human subjects research protections to all research involving U.S. persons, regardless of funding source, through a tiered risk-based framework:

- **Tier 1 (Minimal risk)**: Registration and self-certification. Applies to surveys, observational studies, secondary data analysis with de-identified data
- **Tier 2 (Moderate risk)**: Expedited review by registered ethics committee. Applies to research involving identifiable data, behavioral interventions, technology platform experiments
- **Tier 3 (High risk)**: Full committee review. Applies to clinical trials, research involving vulnerable populations, studies with potential for serious harm
- **Tier 4 (Critical risk)**: Full committee review plus federal-level review. Applies to DURC, enhanced potential pandemic pathogen research, first-in-human gene therapy

### Key Design Elements

- Require all entities conducting systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge about human subjects to register with OHRP
- Apply protections based on research risk level rather than funding source
- Permit use of commercial IRBs, academic IRBs, or a new federal ethics review option for entities without institutional affiliation
- Establish safe harbor for genuine product improvement testing that does not generate generalizable knowledge
- Provide small business and academic researcher exemptions for compliance costs through federal grants

### Evidence Base

- The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Clinical Trials Regulation demonstrate that comprehensive research oversight is feasible without destroying research productivity
- Canada's Tri-Council Policy Statement applies to all research at institutions receiving federal funds, regardless of specific project funding
- Australia's National Statement covers all research, with proportionate review based on risk level

## Solution 2: Reform IRB Structure and Function

### Problem Addressed

IRBs suffer from institutional conflicts of interest, mission creep toward compliance over ethics, inconsistency across institutions, and lack of expertise for emerging research types.

### Proposal

Restructure the IRB system to reduce conflicts of interest and improve quality:

- **Independent ethics review panels**: For high-risk research (Tiers 3-4), require review by panels with at least 50% external members (not employed by the research institution)
- **Specialized review tracks**: Create designated review pathways for AI research, big data studies, and synthetic biology, staffed by reviewers with relevant technical expertise
- **Ethics consultation model**: For lower-risk research, shift from gatekeeping review toward consultative ethics support, where ethics professionals advise researchers during study design rather than only evaluating finished protocols
- **Community representation**: Increase community member requirements on IRBs from one to at least two, and require that community members receive ongoing training and appropriate compensation
- **Performance metrics**: Develop standardized metrics for IRB effectiveness that measure participant protection outcomes rather than processing speed alone

### Evidence Base

- The UK Health Research Authority model demonstrates that centralized, specialized ethics review can be both efficient and rigorous
- Studies comparing commercial and academic IRB decisions show significant inconsistency, suggesting that structural reforms could improve standardization
- Research on ethics consultation in clinical settings shows improved ethical reasoning and satisfaction compared to purely gatekeeping models

## Solution 3: Close the Animal Research Coverage Gap

### Problem Addressed

The AWA exclusion of purpose-bred rats, mice, and birds from federal protection leaves approximately 95% of research animals without the regulatory floor that Congress established for animal welfare.

### Proposal

Phase in AWA coverage for currently excluded species over a five-year period:

- **Year 1**: Require USDA registration for all facilities using rats, mice, and birds in research
- **Year 2**: Require annual reporting of numbers and categories of use for all vertebrate research animals
- **Year 3**: Extend IACUC protocol review requirements to all vertebrate species, with standardized review criteria
- **Year 4**: Begin USDA inspections of facilities using previously excluded species
- **Year 5**: Full AWA coverage, including housing standards and veterinary care requirements

### Supporting Measures

- Increase USDA-APHIS inspection staffing to support expanded coverage (estimated 50-75 additional inspectors)
- Establish federal grants for development and validation of non-animal research methods (replacement alternatives)
- Create a National Center for Alternative Methods within NIH to coordinate 3Rs research and implementation
- Require all grant applications involving animal research to include a 3Rs justification demonstrating that alternatives were considered

### Evidence Base

- The EU Directive 2010/63/EU covers all vertebrate species and cephalopods without demonstrably reducing European research competitiveness
- The original USDA cost estimate of $350 million annually for rat/mouse/bird coverage is likely overstated; phased implementation and existing PHS Policy infrastructure would reduce incremental costs
- Non-animal methods (organoids, organ-on-chip, computational models) are increasingly capable of replacing animal studies for many research questions

## Solution 4: Establish Comprehensive DURC and GOF Governance

### Problem Addressed

The current framework for governing dual-use research of concern and gain-of-function research relies on fragmented policies, institutional self-identification, and advisory bodies without enforcement authority.

### Proposal

Create a statutory framework for DURC and GOF oversight:

- **Independent Biosecurity Review Board**: Establish a permanent, independent board (not housed within any research-funding agency) to review all federally funded research meeting DURC or ePPP criteria. Board members should include biosecurity experts, public health officials, biosafety professionals, and public representatives
- **Mandatory pre-research review**: All research meeting defined risk thresholds must receive board approval before initiation, not merely institutional review
- **Transparency requirements**: Publish summaries of all board decisions (with necessary security redactions) and annual reports on the scope of DURC conducted in the United States
- **International coordination**: Direct the State Department to negotiate multilateral agreements on DURC governance standards, building on the Biological Weapons Convention framework
- **Whistleblower protections**: Establish specific statutory protections for researchers, laboratory workers, and biosafety professionals who report biosafety concerns

### Evidence Base

- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission provides a model for independent oversight of dangerous technology that is separate from promotional agencies
- The UK Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens demonstrates that centralized biosecurity review is feasible
- Post-Fukushima nuclear safety reforms show that independent oversight produces better safety outcomes than self-regulation

## Solution 5: Build AI Research Ethics Infrastructure

### Problem Addressed

Artificial intelligence research ethics lacks regulatory frameworks, institutional expertise, and professional norms adequate to the scale and impact of current AI development.

### Proposal

Develop a multi-layered AI research ethics framework:

- **Define AI research obligations**: Establish clear criteria for when AI development activities constitute research requiring ethical review, including large-scale experiments on user behavior, training on personal data, and deployment of decision-making systems affecting individuals
- **AI Ethics Review Boards**: Require organizations conducting AI research above defined risk thresholds to establish AI ethics review boards with interdisciplinary membership (computer scientists, ethicists, social scientists, affected community representatives)
- **Algorithmic impact assessments**: Require pre-deployment impact assessments for AI systems used in high-stakes contexts (healthcare, criminal justice, employment, housing, education)
- **Training data transparency**: Require disclosure of training data sources, composition, and known biases for AI systems used in research and high-stakes applications
- **Federal AI Research Ethics Office**: Create a dedicated office within OSTP to coordinate AI research ethics policy, provide guidance, and support institutional capacity building

### Evidence Base

- The EU AI Act provides a comprehensive risk-based regulatory model for AI governance
- Canada's Directive on Automated Decision-Making requires algorithmic impact assessments for government AI systems
- The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, while voluntary, provides a foundation for mandatory requirements

## Solution 6: Strengthen Enforcement and Accountability

### Problem Addressed

OHRP has approximately 40 staff members overseeing thousands of institutions. USDA-APHIS is similarly understaffed. Penalties for violations are rarely punitive.

### Proposal

- **Increase OHRP staffing and authority**: Expand OHRP to at least 150 staff with authority to conduct proactive audits (not merely complaint-driven investigations) and impose graduated financial penalties
- **Whistleblower protections**: Enact specific statutory protections for researchers, staff, and students who report research ethics violations, including protection from retaliation, anonymous reporting mechanisms, and financial incentives for reporting significant violations
- **Graduated penalty structure**: Establish civil monetary penalties for research ethics violations, ranging from warnings for minor procedural violations to significant fines (up to $1 million per violation) and debarment for serious harm to participants
- **Mandatory adverse event reporting**: Require real-time reporting of serious adverse events in research to OHRP and FDA, with centralized tracking and public reporting
- **Periodic audits**: Require unannounced on-site audits of at least 10% of registered research institutions annually

### Evidence Base

- OSHA enforcement data demonstrates that regulatory agencies with adequate staffing and penalty authority achieve better compliance than understaffed agencies relying on voluntary compliance
- The False Claims Act model (qui tam provisions) shows that financial incentives for reporting violations improve detection rates
- European data protection authorities' enforcement of GDPR demonstrates that meaningful financial penalties change institutional behavior

## Solution 7: Rebuild Trust Through Community Engagement

### Problem Addressed

Historical research abuses have created lasting trust deficits, particularly among Black, Indigenous, and Latino communities, contributing to clinical trial participation disparities.

### Proposal

- **Community Research Advisory Boards (CRABs)**: Require federally funded clinical trials to establish community advisory boards in their recruitment areas, with meaningful authority over study design, consent processes, and dissemination plans
- **Benefit-sharing requirements**: Require that communities contributing to research receive tangible benefits, which may include post-trial access to successful interventions, community health services, or direct investment in community infrastructure
- **Tribal research sovereignty**: Codify the requirement that research involving tribal communities receive tribal IRB or council approval in addition to institutional IRB review, and respect tribal data sovereignty
- **Research participant bill of rights**: Establish a statutory bill of rights for research participants, including rights to understand the research, decline participation without penalty, receive results, and access injury compensation
- **Reparative justice**: Establish a federal commission to document historical research abuses against marginalized communities and recommend remedies, building on the model of the 1994 Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments

### Evidence Base

- Community-based participatory research (CBPR) models demonstrate that community engagement improves both research quality and participant trust
- The Navajo Nation Human Research Review Board provides a model for tribal research sovereignty
- South Africa's National Health Research Ethics Council requires community benefit-sharing in health research

## Solution 8: Harmonize Federal Research Ethics Regulations

### Problem Addressed

FDA regulations and the Common Rule differ in substantive requirements, creating confusion for researchers conducting studies subject to both frameworks.

### Proposal

- **Regulatory convergence**: Direct FDA and OHRP to harmonize their respective regulations within three years, producing a single set of requirements for research that falls under both jurisdictions
- **Unified consent requirements**: Establish a single set of informed consent elements applicable across all federally regulated research
- **Common definitions**: Align definitions of key terms (human subjects, research, minimal risk) across all federal agencies
- **Joint enforcement**: Create a joint OHRP-FDA compliance unit for research subject to both frameworks
- **State preemption clarity**: Establish clear federal floor standards while preserving state authority to impose additional protections

### Evidence Base

- The 2018 Common Rule revision attempted but did not achieve harmonization; legislative mandate is needed
- The EU Clinical Trials Regulation demonstrates that a single unified framework is feasible
- Researchers and IRB professionals consistently identify regulatory inconsistency as a top barrier to efficient ethical review
