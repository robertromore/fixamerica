# Research Ethics: Roadmap

## Overview

Implementing the research ethics reforms identified in this analysis requires a phased approach that sequences reforms based on political feasibility, institutional readiness, and logical dependency. This roadmap presents a ten-year implementation strategy divided into three phases.

## Critical Path Dependencies

The following reforms must be sequenced carefully:

```text
Legislation/Executive Order
    |
    v
Tiered Framework Rulemaking --> FDA Harmonization
    |                               |

Private Sector Extension     Unified Consent Requirements
    |
    v
Full Implementation + Enforcement Expansion
```

```text
DURC Review Commission
    |
    v
Independent Biosecurity Review Board
    |
    v
Mandatory Pre-Research Review --> International Negotiations
    |                                    |
    v                                    v
Transparency Requirements        Multilateral Agreement
```

```text

## Resource Requirements

### Federal Funding

| Category | Annual Cost (Steady State) | One-Time Costs |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------|
| OHRP expansion (150 FTE) | $30 million | $5 million (hiring, facilities) |
| USDA-APHIS expansion (75 inspectors) | $25 million | $10 million (training, equipment) |
| Independent Biosecurity Review Board | $15 million | $3 million (establishment) |
| National Center for Alternative Methods | $50 million | $20 million (facilities, equipment) |
| AI Research Ethics Office | $10 million | $2 million (establishment) |
| Community engagement programs | $25 million | Minimal |
| Research injury compensation (pilot) | $50 million | $5 million (program design) |
| **Total** | **~$205 million/year** | **~$45 million** |

### Context

- Total federal R&D spending exceeds $200 billion annually
- The proposed research ethics investment represents approximately 0.1% of federal R&D spending
- Current IRB compliance costs at institutions are estimated at $600 million-$1 billion annually; reforms that reduce unnecessary compliance burden could offset new federal costs

---

## Political Strategy

### Coalition Building

| Reform | Coalition Partners | Sequence |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Whistleblower protections | Bipartisan (transparency advocates + safety hawks) | Early (builds trust) |
| DURC governance | Bipartisan (biosecurity hawks + public health) | Early (COVID-19 momentum) |
| FDA-Common Rule harmonization | Research community + industry | Early (widely supported) |
| IRB reform | Research community (burden reduction appeal) | Early-mid |
| AWA expansion | Animal welfare + scientific credibility advocates | Mid (requires groundwork) |
| Private sector extension | Consumer advocates + research ethics community | Mid-late (hardest fight) |
| AI research ethics | Growing bipartisan interest | Mid (timing dependent) |

### Key Messaging

- **For researchers**: "Smarter oversight, not more oversight--proportionate review that focuses resources on genuine risks"
- **For institutions**: "Reduced compliance burden for low-risk research, stronger protections where they matter most"
- **For the public**: "Your right to know how research affects you, regardless of who funds it"
- **For industry**: "Clear rules create level playing fields and reduce liability uncertainty"
- **For Congress**: "Bipartisan reforms that protect Americans and maintain U.S. research leadership"

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Research community opposes reforms as burdensome | High | High | Lead with burden-reduction measures; phase in new requirements |
| Technology industry lobbying defeats private sector extension | High | Very High | Build public support through scandal awareness; phase in gradually |
| Congressional attention shifts to other priorities | Moderate | High | Attach reforms to must-pass legislation (NDAA, appropriations) |
| International competitors decline DURC agreements | Moderate | Moderate | Proceed with unilateral improvements while negotiating |
| Budget constraints limit enforcement expansion | Moderate | Moderate | Emphasize penalty revenue; demonstrate cost savings from prevention |
| New research ethics scandal undermines reform process | Low | Variable | Have draft legislation ready to capitalize on windows of opportunity |
