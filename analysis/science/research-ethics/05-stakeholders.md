# Research Ethics: Stakeholders

## Overview

Research ethics governance involves a complex web of stakeholders with overlapping and sometimes conflicting interests. Understanding who holds power, who bears risk, and who benefits from the current system is essential for designing effective reforms.

## Research Participants and Affected Communities

### Clinical Trial Participants

- **Population**: Approximately 3.7 million Americans participate in clinical trials at any given time
- **Interests**: Safety, genuine informed consent, access to benefits of research, fair compensation, post-trial access to effective treatments
- **Power**: Low individually; moderate collectively through patient advocacy organizations
- **Key concerns**: Therapeutic misconception (conflating research with treatment), inadequate consent processes, unequal distribution of research risks along racial and socioeconomic lines

### Healthy Volunteers

- **Population**: Estimated 50,000-100,000 healthy volunteers participate in Phase I clinical trials annually
- **Interests**: Fair compensation, accurate risk disclosure, safety monitoring
- **Power**: Very low; disproportionately low-income and underinsured
- **Key concerns**: Serial participation across multiple trials for income, inadequate tracking of cumulative exposure, exclusion from workers' compensation and other protections

### Communities Historically Harmed by Research

- **Groups**: Black Americans, Native American and Alaska Native communities, Latinx populations, incarcerated persons, persons with disabilities, institutionalized persons
- **Interests**: Recognition of historical harms, community control over research participation, equitable benefit sharing, culturally appropriate consent processes
- **Power**: Growing, particularly as community-based participatory research models gain acceptance and tribal sovereignty over research is increasingly recognized
- **Key concerns**: Ongoing underrepresentation in research that could benefit these communities; extractive research models that take data and biological samples without returning benefits

### Technology Platform Users

- **Population**: Hundreds of millions of Americans whose online behavior is studied, often without their knowledge
- **Interests**: Privacy, meaningful consent, protection from manipulative experiments
- **Power**: Very low in practice; high in theoretical consumer power
- **Key concerns**: Lack of awareness that they are research subjects; no regulatory framework requiring ethics review for most tech company research

## Research Institutions

### Universities and Academic Medical Centers

- **Number**: Approximately 2,500 institutions with Federal Wide Assurances
- **Interests**: Research productivity, federal grant funding, institutional reputation, indirect cost recovery, faculty recruitment and retention
- **Power**: Very high; collectively they are the primary recipients of federal research funding and the primary employers of the research workforce
- **Key concerns**: Balancing research oversight rigor against competitiveness for funding and faculty; managing liability exposure; compliance costs estimated at $600 million-$1 billion annually for IRB operations alone

### Private Research Companies

- **Entities**: Pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology firms, contract research organizations (CROs), technology companies
- **Interests**: Research efficiency, regulatory pathway clarity, intellectual property protection, market access
- **Power**: Very high; pharmaceutical companies fund approximately 60% of clinical trials in the U.S.
- **Key concerns**: Speed of ethics review processes, international regulatory harmonization, liability for adverse events

### Federal Research Laboratories

- **Number**: 17 DOE national laboratories plus NIH intramural program, CDC, and other agency laboratories
- **Interests**: Mission-oriented research, biosafety and biosecurity, public trust
- **Power**: Moderate; subject to direct federal oversight but with significant operational autonomy
- **Key concerns**: Biosafety compliance, dual-use research governance, balancing openness with security

---

## Oversight Bodies

### Institutional Review Boards

- **Number**: Approximately 2,500 registered IRBs (including academic and commercial)
- **Members**: Typically 8-15 per board, including scientists, non-scientists, and community members
- **Interests**: Protecting research participants, regulatory compliance, institutional risk management
- **Power**: High within their institutional scope; can approve, require modifications, or disapprove research protocols
- **Key concerns**: Workload (many IRBs review hundreds of protocols annually), inconsistency across institutions, mission creep toward compliance rather than ethics, lack of expertise for emerging research types

### Commercial IRBs

- **Major entities**: Advarra (formerly WIRB-Copernicus Group and Chesapeake IRB), WCG IRB, IntegReview
- **Interests**: Client satisfaction, market share, regulatory compliance, efficiency
- **Power**: High; review approximately 70% of industry-sponsored research
- **Key concerns**: Financial conflicts of interest (paid by research sponsors), potential race-to-the-bottom in review standards, some evidence of faster approval times compared to academic IRBs

### IACUCs

- **Number**: Approximately 1,300 at registered research facilities
- **Interests**: Animal welfare, regulatory compliance, institutional reputation
- **Power**: Can approve, require modifications, or disapprove animal research protocols
- **Key concerns**: Dominated by institutional researchers with potential conflicts of interest, limited external oversight, variation in standards across institutions

## Government Agencies

### Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

- **Role**: Parent agency for OHRP, NIH, FDA, and CDC
- **Interests**: Public health advancement, research participant protection, regulatory coherence
- **Power**: Very high; sets Common Rule policy, controls largest share of federal research funding
- **Key divisions**:
    - **OHRP**: Oversees Common Rule compliance (~40 staff)
    - **NIH**: Largest funder of biomedical research ($48+ billion annually)
    - **FDA**: Regulates clinical trials for products
    - **CDC**: Conducts and funds public health research

### USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)

- **Role**: Enforces Animal Welfare Act for research animals
- **Interests**: Animal welfare, regulatory compliance
- **Power**: Moderate; limited by AWA exclusions and staffing constraints
- **Key concerns**: Fewer than 120 inspectors for all regulated entities (research facilities, breeders, exhibitors, dealers)

### Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)

- **Role**: Coordinates federal science policy, including DURC oversight
- **Interests**: Research advancement, biosecurity, science policy coherence
- **Power**: Advisory; limited enforcement capability
- **Key concerns**: Policy coordination across agencies, gain-of-function research governance

### National Science Foundation (NSF)

- **Role**: Funds basic research across all disciplines; requires ethical research conduct
- **Interests**: Research excellence, researcher training, Responsible Conduct of Research education
- **Power**: Moderate; significant through funding conditions
- **Key concerns**: Responsible Conduct of Research training requirements, research involving human subjects in social and behavioral sciences
