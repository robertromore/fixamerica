# Research Ethics: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to research ethics reform comes from multiple directions and takes different forms depending on the specific reform proposed. Unlike many policy areas where opposition is primarily partisan, research ethics reform faces resistance from a complex coalition of researchers, institutions, industries, and ideological groups whose interests align differently depending on the issue.

## Research Community Opposition

### Regulatory Burden Arguments

The most widespread and persistent source of opposition to expanded research ethics oversight comes from within the research community itself:

**Who**: Principal investigators, department chairs, research deans, university administrators, professional societies (FASEB, AAU, COGR)

**Arguments**:

- IRB review processes are already too slow, adding months to research timelines and reducing American competitiveness
- Expanding oversight to cover big data, AI, and technology research would overwhelm an already strained system
- Low-risk research (surveys, educational studies, secondary data analysis) receives disproportionate scrutiny that wastes researcher time without protecting anyone
- Compliance costs are substantial and unfunded; institutions spend an estimated $600 million-$1 billion annually on IRB operations
- The single IRB mandate has created bottlenecks at reviewing institutions without clearly improving protections

**Evidence and validity**: These concerns have significant empirical support. Studies published in *IRB: Ethics and Human Research* and *Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics* document that researchers spend substantial time on compliance activities with questionable protective value. The 2011 ANPRM specifically cited the need to "reduce burden, delay, and ambiguity." However, the logical conclusion--that oversight should be reduced--does not follow automatically. The problem may be misallocated oversight rather than excessive oversight.

**Underlying interests**: Research institutions receive indirect cost recovery (overhead) on federal grants, typically 50-65% of direct costs at major universities. Anything that slows research production or deters investigators from seeking federal funding threatens institutional revenue. The "regulatory burden" argument, while containing genuine concerns, is also deployed strategically to resist oversight that would constrain institutional autonomy.

### Scientific Freedom Arguments

**Who**: Researchers working on dual-use research, gain-of-function studies, controversial topics; scientific freedom advocates; some scientific societies

**Arguments**:

- Restricting gain-of-function research prevents scientists from understanding pandemic threats and developing countermeasures
- Government oversight of research methodology constitutes inappropriate interference with scientific inquiry
- Pre-publication review of dual-use research amounts to censorship
- Scientists, not bureaucrats, are best positioned to assess the risks and benefits of their own research
- The Asilomar model of scientific self-governance is superior to government regulation

**Evidence and validity**: The scientific freedom argument has genuine constitutional dimensions (First Amendment protection of inquiry) and pragmatic merit (scientists do possess specialized knowledge for risk assessment). However, the Asilomar model worked in a context where the number of researchers involved was small and the community was cohesive. As dual-use research has expanded to involve thousands of investigators across hundreds of institutions globally, self-governance has become less effective. The COVID-19 pandemic origin debate demonstrated that scientific self-governance alone is insufficient to maintain public trust.

**Underlying interests**: Researchers whose careers depend on specific research methodologies (e.g., gain-of-function virology) have material interests in preventing restrictions. Laboratory directors who control significant funding streams resist oversight that would constrain their discretion. The scientific freedom argument, while philosophically important, is sometimes invoked to protect career interests and institutional autonomy.

## Industry Opposition

### Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Industry

**Who**: Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), individual companies, contract research organizations

**Arguments**:

- Additional regulatory requirements would increase drug development costs (currently estimated at $1-2 billion per approved drug) and timelines
- FDA oversight is already comprehensive for clinical trials; additional layers of Common Rule-type review are duplicative
- International clinical trial regulations are already burdensome; further requirements would drive research offshore
- Post-market surveillance systems are adequate; expanding research ethics requirements to post-market studies would slow safety monitoring

**Evidence and validity**: Drug development costs are genuinely high, and regulatory timelines affect patient access to new treatments. However, the industry's history of ethical violations (selective publication, ghostwriting, off-label promotion research, exploitation of vulnerable populations in developing countries) demonstrates that self-regulation is insufficient. The industry argument against "duplication" often targets the oversight layer most independent from industry influence.

**Underlying interests**: Pharmaceutical companies are publicly traded entities with fiduciary duties to shareholders. Every additional regulatory requirement increases costs and timelines, directly affecting profitability. Industry opposition is primarily economic, though framed in terms of patient access and scientific progress.

### Technology Industry

**Who**: Meta (Facebook), Google/Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, tech industry associations, venture capital firms funding AI research companies

**Arguments**:

- Online A/B testing and algorithmic optimization are product development, not research, and should not be subject to research ethics regulations
- Terms of service agreements constitute adequate consent for platform-based data use
- Applying human subjects research frameworks to technology development would stifle innovation
- AI research ethics guidelines should remain voluntary to avoid prescriptive regulations that cannot keep pace with technological change
- Existing privacy regulations (where they exist) are sufficient

**Evidence and validity**: The boundary between product development and research is genuinely ambiguous in technology contexts. However, the Facebook emotional contagion study, Cambridge Analytica data harvesting, and numerous cases of algorithmic bias demonstrate that technology companies routinely conduct activities functionally equivalent to human subjects research without ethical oversight. The argument that terms of service constitute informed consent is particularly weak, given evidence that virtually no users read them.

**Underlying interests**: Technology companies' business models depend on collecting, analyzing, and experimenting with user data. Research ethics regulation would restrict core business activities, not merely ancillary functions. This existential financial interest drives aggressive opposition.

## Ideological and Political Opposition

### Limited Government and Anti-Regulation Perspectives

**Who**: Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute, libertarian-leaning members of Congress

**Arguments**:

- Federal research ethics regulations are unconstitutional overreach beyond enumerated powers
- The Common Rule should be repealed or significantly curtailed; voluntary industry standards are preferable
- Animal research regulations impose costs that reduce research productivity without corresponding benefits
- DURC oversight constitutes prior restraint on scientific speech
- Market mechanisms (institutional reputation, legal liability) provide adequate incentives for ethical research

**Evidence and validity**: Constitutional arguments have limited legal support given the Spending Clause power that underlies federal research conditions. The voluntary standards argument is contradicted by extensive historical evidence that self-regulation has repeatedly failed in research ethics. Market mechanisms have not prevented ethical violations at well-known institutions.

**Underlying interests**: This opposition is partly principled (consistent anti-regulation philosophy) and partly strategic (research institutions and pharmaceutical companies fund these organizations). The libertarian critique has intellectual coherence but ignores the power asymmetries inherent in research relationships.

### Animal Research Advocacy

**Who**: National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR), Foundation for Biomedical Research (FBR), Americans for Medical Progress, research universities

**Arguments**:

- Animal research is essential for biomedical advancement; lives saved by animal-tested medicines and vaccines number in the millions
- Current AWA and PHS Policy protections are adequate for the species they cover
- Extending AWA coverage to rats, mice, and birds would impose enormous administrative costs (~$350 million by USDA estimate) without significant welfare improvements at well-run institutions
- The 3Rs are already widely implemented through voluntary best practices
- Eliminating or severely restricting animal research would delay cures and harm public health

**Evidence and validity**: Animal research has contributed significantly to medical advances, including vaccines, surgical techniques, and drug development. The argument against extending AWA coverage to rats, mice, and birds is primarily economic and administrative rather than ethical. The claim that the 3Rs are adequately implemented voluntarily is contested by animal welfare audits showing substantial variation across institutions.

**Underlying interests**: Institutions that conduct animal research face direct financial and operational consequences from expanded regulation. Researchers whose work depends on animal models have career interests in maintaining the current framework. Industry sponsors prefer fewer restrictions on preclinical research.

## Specific Reform Opposition

### Opposition to Single IRB Mandate

**Who**: Smaller academic institutions, community-based organizations, some IRB professionals

**Arguments**:

- Centralizing review at large institutions removes local knowledge of community context
- Smaller institutions lose the capacity-building benefits of conducting their own reviews
- Liability remains at participating sites even when review is centralized
- Implementation has been uneven and technically challenging

### Opposition to Expanded DURC Oversight

**Who**: Virologists, microbiologists, gain-of-function researchers, some NIH leadership

**Arguments**:

- Overly broad definitions of DURC would capture routine research, creating massive false-positive burden
- International competitors (particularly China) do not impose equivalent restrictions, creating competitive disadvantage
- Pandemic preparedness requires gain-of-function research; restrictions would leave the U.S. vulnerable
- Existing P3CO framework is adequate with minor adjustments

### Opposition to AI Research Ethics Regulation

**Who**: Technology industry, AI researchers, venture capital, some academic computer scientists

**Arguments**:

- AI is evolving too rapidly for prescriptive regulation; rules will be obsolete before implementation
- Broad AI ethics mandates would disproportionately burden U.S. researchers while international competitors face fewer constraints
- Existing IRB frameworks are poorly suited to AI research; forcing AI into human subjects frameworks would be counterproductive
- Voluntary frameworks (NIST AI RMF, IEEE ethics standards) are more adaptable than regulation
