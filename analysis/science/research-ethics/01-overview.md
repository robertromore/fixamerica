# Research Ethics: Overview

## Executive Summary

Research ethics is the system of principles, regulations, and oversight mechanisms that govern how scientific studies involving human subjects, animals, hazardous materials, and dual-use technologies are designed, reviewed, and conducted. The United States pioneered modern research ethics regulation in response to devastating abuses--from the Tuskegee syphilis study to radiation experiments on unknowing patients--yet the resulting oversight infrastructure now faces challenges it was never designed to address: artificial intelligence-driven research, global gain-of-function experiments, decentralized clinical trials, and the explosion of human data collection through technology platforms.

The federal research ethics framework centers on the Common Rule (45 C.F.R. Part 46), which governs human subjects research funded by signatory federal agencies, and the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2131-2159), which regulates animal research. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) serve as the primary enforcement mechanisms at more than 2,500 research institutions. These structures were designed for a world of discrete, investigator-initiated studies conducted within university walls. They are increasingly mismatched with the scale, speed, and complexity of modern research.

The stakes of getting research ethics right extend far beyond the laboratory. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated both the extraordinary speed of modern biomedical research and the ethical tensions it generates: expedited vaccine trials required balancing urgency against thoroughness; gain-of-function research debate revealed deep disagreements about acceptable risk; and the uneven global distribution of vaccines raised fundamental questions about justice in research. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence systems trained on massive datasets challenge the very definition of "human subjects research," and dual-use research of concern--studies that could be weaponized--demands oversight frameworks that do not yet exist in mature form.

## Scope

### What This Subtopic Covers

- **Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)**: Structure, function, effectiveness, and reform of human subjects research oversight
- **Human subjects research protections**: The Common Rule, informed consent, vulnerable populations, and clinical trial ethics
- **Animal research regulations**: The Animal Welfare Act, IACUC system, the 3Rs framework (replacement, reduction, refinement), and welfare standards
- **Dual-use research of concern (DURC)**: Gain-of-function research, biosecurity review, and the balance between scientific freedom and safety
- **Ethical oversight mechanisms**: Research integrity offices, data safety monitoring boards, and whistleblower protections
- **AI ethics in research**: Machine learning research ethics, algorithmic bias, data privacy, and automated decision-making
- **Historical abuses and their legacy**: Tuskegee, Guatemala syphilis experiments, radiation studies, and their lasting impact on trust and policy

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Common Rule** | Federal policy (45 C.F.R. Part 46) governing human subjects research, adopted by 20 federal agencies |
| **IRB** | Institutional Review Board; committee that reviews human subjects research for ethical compliance |
| **IACUC** | Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee; committee overseeing animal research welfare |
| **Informed consent** | Process by which research participants voluntarily agree to participate after receiving adequate information |
| **DURC** | Dual-Use Research of Concern; research that could be misapplied to threaten public health or safety |
| **Gain-of-function (GOF)** | Research that enhances the transmissibility or virulence of pathogens |
| **The 3Rs** | Replacement, Reduction, Refinement--guiding principles for humane animal research |
| **Belmont Report** | 1979 foundational document establishing ethical principles for human subjects research |
| **Single IRB (sIRB)** | One IRB serving as the reviewing body for a multi-site study |

## Key Questions

1. **Are IRBs effectively protecting research participants?** Do current oversight structures catch ethical problems, or have they become compliance exercises that burden researchers without improving protections?

2. **How should the Common Rule evolve?** The 2018 revision was the first major update in decades. What gaps remain, particularly for big data, AI, and decentralized research?

3. **Is animal research oversight adequate?** The Animal Welfare Act excludes rats, mice, and birds--approximately 95% of research animals. What are the consequences?

4. **How should dual-use and gain-of-function research be governed?** What oversight framework balances scientific freedom against biosecurity risk?

5. **What does research ethics mean in the age of AI?** When algorithms make decisions affecting millions, what ethical frameworks should govern research involving artificial intelligence?

6. **How do historical abuses shape current trust?** The Tuskegee legacy continues to affect research participation among Black Americans. How can trust be rebuilt?
