## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine concern about government overreach combined with donor industry protection |
| Principle consistency | "Limited government" applied selectively; supports expansive biosecurity oversight but opposes research regulation of private industry |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on deregulation; shifts on biosecurity based on political context |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; willing to engage on biosecurity but reflexively opposes new regulatory agencies |

**Justification:** Conservatives bring genuine principled concerns about regulatory burden and government expansion to research ethics debates. However, opposition to extending oversight to privately funded research aligns closely with pharmaceutical and technology industry donor interests, and support for biosecurity oversight fluctuates based on whether the political environment frames it as national security (supportable) or environmental regulation (opposing).

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Regulatory burden advocacy*: AAU and COGR, which include members aligned with conservative governance principles, have consistently lobbied against Common Rule expansion. See: COGR comment letters on 2011 ANPRM and 2015 NPRM
- *Selective deregulation*: The 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255), supported by many conservatives, streamlined clinical trial requirements while also strengthening some oversight mechanisms, demonstrating willingness to engage
- *Biosecurity variability*: Conservative support for GOF oversight hearings (2021-2025) contrasts with earlier opposition to the 2014 moratorium, reflecting political context rather than consistent principle

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that regulatory fragmentation exists but disputes the characterization of private sector gap as a problem; sees current system as over-regulated rather than under-regulated |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agrees on regulatory complexity and institutional conflict of interest but disagrees that the solution is more government oversight; attributes problems to government regulation itself |

- Competitive Enterprise Institute. "The Precautionary Principle and Research Regulation" (2019): Frames research ethics regulation as innovation-stifling precautionism

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernize and extend Common Rule | 3/10 | Opposes extending federal regulation to private sector | Protecting industry autonomy and donor interests |
| Reform IRB structure | 6/10 | Supports streamlining but opposes external membership mandates | Reducing regulatory burden on universities |
| Close animal research gap | 3/10 | Opposes AWA expansion as costly and unnecessary | Research institution cost concerns |
| Comprehensive DURC governance | 6/10 | Supports stronger biosecurity oversight in principle | National security framing makes this acceptable |
| AI research ethics infrastructure | 2/10 | Opposes new regulatory frameworks for AI | Technology industry opposition; innovation concerns |
| Strengthen enforcement | 3/10 | Opposes expanded government enforcement authority | Anti-regulatory philosophy |
| Rebuild trust/community engagement | 5/10 | Supports voluntary community engagement; opposes mandates | Concerns about identity politics framing |
| Harmonize federal regulations | 7/10 | Supports reducing regulatory duplication | Genuine alignment with efficiency goals |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Ethics Modernization Act | 3/10 | Opposes as massive expansion of federal regulatory power | Industry protection; anti-regulation philosophy |
| Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act | 5/10 | Mixed; supports biosecurity oversight but opposes independent agency creation | National security interest vs. government expansion concern |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Voluntary industry standards with safe-harbor protections for compliant entities
- Strengthen existing Common Rule enforcement rather than expanding scope
- Replace mandatory IRB review with risk-based self-certification for most research
- Rely on market mechanisms (institutional reputation, legal liability) to incentivize ethical conduct

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (deregulation), Constitutionalist (limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on harmonization), Populist (on biosecurity)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to participant protections with occasional paternalism |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies protective framework across contexts; minor tensions with scientific community allies |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; positions have been consistent over decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; willing to compromise on implementation details |

**Justification:** Liberals have been the most consistent advocates for research ethics protections since the post-Tuskegee era. Support for expanded oversight, informed consent requirements, and community engagement reflects genuinely held values about protecting vulnerable populations. Minor inconsistencies arise when research community allies (predominantly liberal-leaning universities) resist regulatory burden, creating tension between pro-regulation and pro-science instincts.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Legislative consistency*: Democratic members have introduced or co-sponsored most research ethics reform legislation in recent Congresses
- *Common Rule revision support*: Liberals generally supported the 2018 Common Rule revisions, including expanded exemptions that balanced protection with efficiency
- *Clinical trial diversity advocacy*: Consistent support for the FDA Modernization Act 2.0 and diversity requirements in clinical trials

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement with analysis of gaps, particularly private sector oversight and trust deficits |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agrees with most identified root causes; may place less emphasis on regulatory fragmentation and more on enforcement weakness |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress. "Strengthening Research Ethics for the 21st Century" (2023): Aligns closely with this analysis
- Bioethics groups affiliated with liberal institutions (Hastings Center, Kennedy Institute) have consistently supported expanded protections

| Harmonize federal regulations | 7/10 | Supports as long as harmonization does not weaken protections | Floor, not ceiling concern |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Ethics Modernization Act | 8/10 | Strongly supports; may want stronger consent provisions | Wants to ensure product improvement safe harbor is narrow |
| Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act | 8/10 | Strongly supports independent Board | Transparency and accountability values |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Expand scope of Research Ethics Modernization Act to explicitly include all platform A/B testing without safe harbor
- Add research injury compensation fund (no-fault system for participants harmed by research)
- Require diversity action plans for all research, not just clinical trials

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Centrist
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on corporate accountability), Religious Right (on human dignity in research)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to structural reform and equity; positions follow from principles |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies power analysis framework; skeptical of industry self-regulation across all contexts |
| Goalpost stability | Highly stable; demands may escalate but principles do not shift |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low; will accept incremental progress while advocating for comprehensive reform |

**Justification:** Progressives approach research ethics through a consistent power analysis lens: who benefits, who bears risk, and how are power imbalances addressed. This framework produces stable, principled positions that are predictable across different research ethics issues. The progressive perspective is the most internally consistent of all perspectives analyzed here.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Community engagement advocacy*: Progressive organizations have led community-based participatory research movements since the 1990s
- *Corporate accountability*: Consistent demands for technology company regulation align with broader progressive agenda
- *Health equity*: Tuskegee legacy and clinical trial diversity are central progressive concerns, not strategic positioning

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement; would emphasize structural inequality and corporate power more heavily |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strong agreement with power asymmetry and institutional conflict of interest analysis |

| AI research ethics infrastructure | 10/10 | Strongest supporter; wants binding regulation, not voluntary frameworks | Algorithmic justice and data rights |
| Strengthen enforcement | 9/10 | Supports; wants higher penalties and stronger private right of action | Accountability for powerful institutions |
| Rebuild trust/community engagement | 10/10 | Highest priority; wants reparative justice component | Structural equity and historical accountability |
| Harmonize federal regulations | 6/10 | Supports if harmonization raises the floor rather than averaging standards | Concern about weakening protections |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Ethics Modernization Act | 8/10 | Supports; wants to strengthen private right of action and eliminate safe harbor | Does not go far enough on corporate accountability |
| Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act | 8/10 | Supports; wants stronger transparency provisions | Concerned about classified information exemption |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Establish a federal research injury compensation fund funded by industry fees
- Require community benefit agreements for all research in underserved communities
- Mandate that research institutions share intellectual property benefits with participant communities
- Create a federal research ombudsperson with independent investigative authority

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist, Liberal
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on corporate accountability), Religious Right (on human dignity)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Libertarian

---

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine philosophical commitment to individual liberty and minimal government |
| Principle consistency | Consistently anti-regulation; applies to both government and corporate behavior (unlike conservatives) |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; principled opposition to government expansion |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; engages on individual rights dimensions |

**Justification:** Libertarians bring genuine philosophical consistency to research ethics debates, opposing government regulation while emphasizing individual autonomy and informed consent. Unlike conservatives, libertarians apply anti-regulation principles to both government overreach and corporate abuse of individuals, creating potential common ground on consent and transparency even when disagreeing on regulatory mechanisms.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Consent emphasis*: Libertarian philosophy strongly supports genuine informed consent as the basis for legitimate research relationships
- *Right to try*: Libertarian support for Right to Try legislation reflects consistent individual autonomy principles
- *Anti-regulation consistency*: Cato Institute applies deregulation principles uniformly across health, technology, and security domains

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Agrees on regulatory inconsistency and consent failures but sees the problem as too much regulation, not too little |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Agrees on institutional conflict of interest and consent fiction; disagrees that more government oversight is the solution |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute. "The Case Against Federal Research Regulation" (various): Consistent anti-regulatory position
- Reason Foundation. Analysis of Right to Try legislation: Individual autonomy framework

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernize and extend Common Rule | 2/10 | Opposes federal regulation of private research | Individual liberty; voluntary association |
| Reform IRB structure | 4/10 | Supports reducing IRB burden; opposes new mandates | Anti-paternalism |
| Close animal research gap | 2/10 | Opposes expanded government regulation | Property rights; anti-regulation |
| Comprehensive DURC governance | 4/10 | Reluctantly supports limited biosecurity oversight | Acknowledges national security externality |
| AI research ethics infrastructure | 2/10 | Opposes government regulation of AI research | Innovation freedom; anti-regulation |
| Strengthen enforcement | 2/10 | Opposes expanded government enforcement power | Anti-government enforcement philosophy |
| Rebuild trust/community engagement | 5/10 | Supports voluntary engagement; opposes mandates | Voluntary association principle |
| Harmonize federal regulations | 5/10 | Supports reducing regulatory duplication but prefers elimination | Efficiency consistent with reducing government |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Ethics Modernization Act | 2/10 | Opposes as massive government expansion | Anti-regulation; individual liberty |
| Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act | 3/10 | Reluctantly acknowledges biosecurity rationale but opposes independent agency and criminal penalties | Minimal government; proportionality |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Replace government regulation with mandatory disclosure and tort liability (let courts and markets enforce ethics)
- Strengthen informed consent requirements but eliminate IRB gatekeeping
- Create industry self-regulatory organizations with voluntary accreditation
- Expand Right to Try framework to allow individuals to consent to experimental research with minimal government interference

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (deregulation), Constitutionalist (limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on consent rights and transparency), Liberal (on informed consent)
- **Unlikely partners:** Democratic Socialist

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine constitutional interpretation commitments |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies enumerated powers analysis; federalism concerns across contexts |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on constitutional questions |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; engages substantively on constitutional dimensions |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists bring principled analysis of federal authority to research ethics debates. Their focus on enumerated powers, federalism, and individual rights produces predictable positions that can be engaged substantively. Constitutional arguments against federal research regulation have limited legal support given established Commerce Clause and Spending Clause precedent, but they raise genuine structural questions about the appropriate level of government for research oversight.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Federalism advocacy*: Consistent position that states should be primary regulators of research within their borders
- *Spending Clause acceptance*: Most constitutionalists accept federal authority to impose conditions on federal funding, creating potential common ground
- *Due process concerns*: Genuine concerns about the fairness of administrative enforcement mechanisms

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees on regulatory fragmentation; frames it as federal overreach rather than insufficient federal authority |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agrees on institutional conflict of interest; disagrees that federal expansion is the remedy |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society. Research regulation panels and publications emphasizing state authority and enumerated powers
- Constitutional scholars arguing for state-based research ethics frameworks

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernize and extend Common Rule | 3/10 | Opposes federal extension to private sector; supports state authority | Enumerated powers; federalism |
| Reform IRB structure | 5/10 | Supports reform within existing federal authority | Spending Clause compliance acceptable |
| Close animal research gap | 4/10 | Questions federal authority; prefers state-level action | Commerce Clause limits |
| Comprehensive DURC governance | 6/10 | Accepts federal role in national security contexts | Defense and general welfare powers |
| AI research ethics infrastructure | 3/10 | Questions constitutional basis for federal AI regulation | Enumerated powers analysis |
| Strengthen enforcement | 3/10 | Opposes expanded administrative enforcement; supports judicial process | Due process; separation of powers |
| Rebuild trust/community engagement | 5/10 | Supports voluntary measures; opposes federal mandates | Federalism |
| Harmonize federal regulations | 6/10 | Supports within existing federal authority | Rationalization consistent with limited government |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Ethics Modernization Act | 3/10 | Questions Commerce Clause basis for private sector extension; opposes private right of action breadth | Federal authority limits |
| Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act | 5/10 | Accepts national security basis; concerns about independent agency structure | Appointments Clause; unitary executive |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Model state legislation approach: uniform state laws rather than federal regulation
- Limit federal authority to Spending Clause conditions on federal grants
- Strengthen judicial review of administrative enforcement actions
- Constitutional amendment if comprehensive federal authority is desired (rather than stretching Commerce Clause)

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (limited government), Libertarian (anti-federal-expansion)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on harmonization), Populist (on state authority)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine anti-elite sentiment combined with inconsistent policy application |
| Principle consistency | Anti-corporate stance on tech companies but not consistently applied to pharmaceutical industry or research institutions |
| Goalpost stability | Shifts based on political alignment; GOF oversight positions changed with COVID-19 politics |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; sometimes opposes reforms associated with opposing political faction |

**Justification:** Populists bring authentic anti-elite anger to research ethics debates, particularly regarding technology company experimentation on users and pharmaceutical industry exploitation. However, populist positions on research ethics have been inconsistent, driven partly by COVID-19 politicization. Anti-expert sentiment can undermine support for the scientific expertise needed for effective oversight. The framing of GOF oversight shifted from relatively low interest to high priority when it became linked to COVID-19 origin debates.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Tech skepticism*: Bipartisan populist support for technology company regulation has been consistent
- *GOF position shift*: Gain-of-function research oversight went from niche concern to populist rallying point during 2021-2023 pandemic politics
- *Anti-expert tensions*: Some populist rhetoric undermines the scientific expertise basis of the reforms proposed here

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees on corporate power and elitism in research; suspicious of expert-driven analysis |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agrees on power asymmetries and institutional capture; frames it as elite vs. common people rather than structural analysis |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan populist support for Congressional GOF hearings (2021-2025)
- Technology platform accountability rhetoric from both left-populist and right-populist figures

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernize and extend Common Rule | 5/10 | Supports regulating Big Tech but wary of expanding government bureaucracy | Anti-corporate but also anti-government |
| Reform IRB structure | 5/10 | Supports community representation; suspicious of expert-dominated panels | Anti-elitism |
| Close animal research gap | 4/10 | Mixed; animal welfare concerns vs. regulation skepticism | Issue does not align with core populist concerns |
| Comprehensive DURC governance | 8/10 | Strongly supports; key populist priority post-COVID | Anti-elite scientific establishment; biosecurity nationalism |
| AI research ethics infrastructure | 6/10 | Supports regulating Big Tech but wary of expert-driven frameworks | Anti-corporate sentiment |
| Strengthen enforcement | 6/10 | Supports holding powerful institutions accountable | Anti-corporate accountability |
| Rebuild trust/community engagement | 6/10 | Supports giving ordinary people voice in research governance | Anti-elitism; community empowerment |
| Harmonize federal regulations | 5/10 | Indifferent; not a populist priority | Low salience issue |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Ethics Modernization Act | 5/10 | Supports tech regulation provisions; wary of creating new bureaucracy | Tension between anti-corporate and anti-government instincts |
| Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act | 7/10 | Supports; frames as holding scientific elite accountable | GOF oversight is key populist priority |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Congressional oversight hearings and direct accountability rather than independent boards
- Ban gain-of-function research outright rather than creating a review framework
- Populist-friendly transparency requirements (all research results publicly accessible)
- Direct community vote or public comment requirement for high-risk research in local areas

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Varies by issue; left-populist aligns with Progressive, right-populist with Conservative
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on corporate accountability), Conservative (on biosecurity)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on regulation), Constitutionalist (on federal authority)

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine pragmatism and desire for workable solutions |
| Principle consistency | Consistently evidence-based; seeks compromise positions |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; anchored to practical outcomes |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low; compromise-oriented by definition |

**Justification:** Centrists bring pragmatic, evidence-based analysis to research ethics reform. They consistently seek workable compromises and support incremental improvements that can achieve bipartisan support. This makes them reliable partners for achievable reforms, though they may resist the comprehensive structural changes that more ideological perspectives advocate.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan Commission support*: Centrists supported the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues model
- *Incremental reform*: Centrist support for the 2018 Common Rule revision demonstrated willingness to engage on practical improvements
- *Evidence-based approach*: Centrist organizations consistently reference empirical evidence in research ethics policy positions

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agrees with most of the analysis; prefers less ideological framing |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agrees on structural issues; less emphasis on power dynamics |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center. Health and science policy publications
- National Academies consensus reports on research ethics (effectively centrist positions)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernize and extend Common Rule | 6/10 | Supports targeted extension; prefers phased approach | Practical implementation concerns |
| Reform IRB structure | 8/10 | Strongly supports evidence-based reform | Efficiency and effectiveness |
| Close animal research gap | 6/10 | Supports phased approach | Cost-benefit analysis |
| Comprehensive DURC governance | 7/10 | Supports independent oversight with appropriate scope | Balanced risk management |
| AI research ethics infrastructure | 6/10 | Supports proportionate regulation | Innovation-protection balance |
| Strengthen enforcement | 7/10 | Supports reasonable enforcement improvements | Accountability with proportionality |
| Rebuild trust/community engagement | 7/10 | Supports community engagement as evidence-based best practice | Practical effectiveness |
| Harmonize federal regulations | 8/10 | Strongly supports as common-sense reform | Efficiency and rationalization |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Ethics Modernization Act | 6/10 | Supports framework; wants narrower product improvement safe harbor and more gradual implementation | Practical feasibility |
| Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act | 7/10 | Supports; prefers advisory role transitioning to mandatory over time | Cautious about independent agency |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Pilot private sector extension in voluntary states before federal mandate
- Establish a National Academy study commission before comprehensive legislation
- Phase implementation over 5-7 years rather than 2-3
- Create incentive programs (certification, reduced liability) alongside mandates

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, moderate Conservative
- **Potential bridges:** All perspectives (centrists bridge by definition)
- **Unlikely partners:** None structurally; difficulty with extremes of any perspective

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine moral concerns about human dignity combined with selective application |
| Principle consistency | Strong on embryonic/fetal research and human dignity; inconsistent on other research ethics issues |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on core moral issues; variable on regulatory questions |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; tends to engage on moral dimensions but withdraw from technocratic debates |

**Justification:** The Religious Right brings genuine moral conviction to research ethics, particularly regarding the sanctity of human life and the dignity of research participants. These convictions produce consistent positions on embryonic research, fetal tissue research, and human experimentation. However, the Religious Right's engagement with broader research ethics issues (animal welfare, AI ethics, DURC governance) is inconsistent and tends to be driven by coalition politics rather than independently developed positions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Embryonic research opposition*: Consistent, principled opposition to embryonic stem cell research and fetal tissue research across political contexts
- *Human dignity framework*: Genuine theological basis for opposing exploitative research practices
- *Selective engagement*: Limited engagement with animal welfare, AI ethics, and other research ethics dimensions that do not directly implicate sanctity-of-life concerns

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees on trust deficits and consent failures; adds concern about moral dimensions not emphasized in analysis (embryonic research, human dignity) |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Partial agreement; attributes root causes to moral decline and secularism rather than structural factors |

**Source references:**

- Family Research Council. Bioethics publications emphasizing sanctity of life
- National Association of Evangelicals. Policy positions on human subjects research
- U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. *Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Modernize and extend Common Rule | 5/10 | Supports stronger consent; wants explicit embryonic research restrictions | Sanctity of life provisions |
| Reform IRB structure | 5/10 | Supports community representation (wants faith community voice) | Moral perspective representation on review boards |
| Close animal research gap | 4/10 | Mixed; stewardship ethic supports animal welfare but subordinate to human benefit | Creation care vs. human primacy |
| Comprehensive DURC governance | 6/10 | Supports; frames as moral responsibility for creation | Theological stewardship |
| AI research ethics infrastructure | 5/10 | Supports oversight of AI; concerned about dehumanization | Human dignity in algorithmic contexts |
| Strengthen enforcement | 5/10 | Supports enforcement of moral boundaries; wary of government overreach | Enforcement of moral vs. procedural standards |
| Rebuild trust/community engagement | 6/10 | Supports; emphasizes faith community inclusion | Religious voice in research governance |
| Harmonize federal regulations | 5/10 | Supports simplification; wants moral principles retained | Efficiency without moral compromise |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Ethics Modernization Act | 4/10 | Wants embryonic/fetal research restrictions added; otherwise mixed | Sanctity of life not addressed in bill |
| Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act | 6/10 | Supports; frames as moral stewardship of creation | Theological basis for biosecurity |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Add explicit prohibitions on embryonic stem cell research and fetal tissue research
- Require moral/ethical education (not just regulatory training) for researchers
- Include faith community representatives on all ethics review bodies
- Establish conscience protections for researchers who object to specific research on moral grounds

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on embryonic research restrictions, limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on human dignity in research), Progressive (on community engagement)
- **Unlikely partners:** Democratic Socialist (on economic analysis), Libertarian (on mandating moral standards)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to democratic control and public good; positions follow consistently from principles |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies public interest framework; opposes corporate control of research across all contexts |
| Goalpost stability | Highly stable; rooted in structural economic analysis |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low; advocates for systemic change through democratic processes |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists approach research ethics through a consistent lens of democratic control, public good, and resistance to corporate capture. This produces highly predictable positions: public oversight of research, opposition to private sector autonomy over human experimentation, strong enforcement, and equitable distribution of research benefits. Like progressives, democratic socialists are highly consistent negotiating partners because their positions derive from stable structural principles.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Public interest framework*: Consistent advocacy for publicly funded and publicly controlled research
- *Corporate accountability*: Uniform opposition to corporate self-regulation in research ethics
- *Health equity*: Consistent demand for equitable research participation and benefit distribution

### Common Ground Synthesis

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| DURC governance | Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist, Conservative | Libertarian, Constitutionalist | -- |
| IRB reform | Liberal, Progressive, Conservative, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist, Populist, Constitutionalist | Libertarian | -- |
| Harmonize regulations | Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist, Constitutionalist, Libertarian, Populist, Religious Right | -- | -- |
| Trust/community engagement | Liberal, Progressive, Conservative, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist, Libertarian | -- | -- |
| AI ethics infrastructure | Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Constitutionalist | Libertarian |
| Extend Common Rule | Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Constitutionalist | Libertarian |
| Strengthen enforcement | Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Constitutionalist | Libertarian |
| Close animal research gap | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Populist, Constitutionalist, Religious Right | Libertarian |

**Key insight:** DURC governance and IRB reform have the broadest cross-ideological support, driven by biosecurity concerns and universal frustration with regulatory inefficiency. Extending the Common Rule to the private sector and AI ethics regulation face the strongest ideological resistance from the right and libertarian perspectives. Regulatory harmonization achieves near-universal support as a common-sense efficiency measure.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Biosecurity-First Research Ethics Reform*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Progressive + Populist + Centrist + Religious Right + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Virtually all perspectives agree that dual-use research of concern requires stronger, more transparent oversight. This is the highest-consensus area in research ethics reform.

**Policy Description:**

Enact the Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act as a standalone bill, establishing an independent National Biosecurity Review Board with mandatory pre-research review authority. Pair with whistleblower protections for biosafety concerns. Defer the broader Research Ethics Modernization Act for subsequent legislative action.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | National security framing; does not expand regulation of private sector research generally |
| Liberal | Independent oversight with transparency; accountability for dangerous research |
| Progressive | Structural reform removing oversight from funding agencies |
| Populist | Holds scientific elite accountable; direct response to COVID-19 concerns |
| Centrist | Evidence-based, bipartisan solution to identified risk |
| Religious Right | Moral stewardship of creation; safety of communities |
| Democratic Socialist | Public accountability; transparency requirements |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Acceptance of new independent agency and enforcement authority |
| Liberal | Deferring comprehensive Common Rule reform |
| Progressive | Accepting phased approach rather than comprehensive bill |
| Populist | Accepting expert-led Board rather than direct congressional oversight |
| Libertarian | Accepting mandatory review (though likely to oppose regardless) |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives (Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High; biosecurity consensus is stable and not subject to partisan cycling
- **Implementation Path:** Introduce as standalone bill; attach to NDAA or public health reauthorization if standalone movement stalls

---

### Compromise 2: *Smart Oversight Reform Package*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Populist

**Core Agreement:** The IRB system is simultaneously over-burdensome for low-risk research and inadequate for high-risk emerging research. All perspectives agree on the need for rationalization.

**Policy Description:**

Package IRB structural reforms with regulatory harmonization:

- Reduce IRB burden for minimal-risk research through expanded self-certification
- Harmonize Common Rule and FDA regulations
- Create specialized review tracks for AI and digital research
- Increase community representation on IRBs
- Strengthen OHRP enforcement for high-risk violations

This package gives researchers what they want (less burden on low-risk work) in exchange for stronger oversight where it matters most.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Reduces regulatory burden; streamlines compliance |
| Liberal | Strengthens protections for high-risk research; improves community voice |
| Centrist | Evidence-based efficiency improvements |
| Constitutionalist | Works within existing federal authority (Spending Clause) |
| Populist | Gives ordinary people voice through community representation |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts strengthened enforcement for high-risk violations |
| Liberal | Accepts reduced oversight for low-risk research |
| Centrist | Accepts community representation mandates (slightly more prescriptive than preferred) |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts continued federal role (within existing authority) |
| Progressive | Accepts incremental reform without private sector extension |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (Conservative, Liberal, Centrist, Constitutionalist, Populist); with Progressive and Democratic Socialist as conditional supporters
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 core coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High; both research community and reform advocates benefit
- **Implementation Path:** Could be accomplished through HHS rulemaking for some elements; legislation needed for enforcement expansion

---

### Compromise 3: *Research Trust and Equity Initiative*

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Populist + Religious Right + Democratic Socialist + Centrist

**Core Agreement:** Historical research abuses created lasting trust deficits that harm both research participation and public health. Rebuilding trust requires concrete action beyond apology.

**Policy Description:**

- Establish a federal commission to document historical research abuses against marginalized communities
- Codify tribal research sovereignty requirements
- Require Community Advisory Boards for all Phase II and III clinical trials receiving federal funding
- Create a research participant bill of rights with statutory enforcement
- Establish clinical trial diversity enrollment targets linked to disease burden
- Fund community health research centers in historically underserved areas

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Health equity; historical accountability; diversity |
| Progressive | Reparative justice; community power; structural change |
| Populist | Empowers ordinary people against elite institutions |
| Religious Right | Human dignity; community voice; moral accountability |
| Democratic Socialist | Democratic control; public benefit; equity |
| Centrist | Evidence-based community engagement improves research quality |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Accepts focus on trust-building without comprehensive regulatory reform |
| Progressive | Accepts commission model rather than immediate reparations |
| Populist | Accepts expert-designed program rather than direct community control |
| Religious Right | Accepts secular framing of human dignity provisions |
| Conservative | If brought aboard: accepts federal spending on equity-focused programs |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives (Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist, Centrist)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Moderate-High; equity consensus is growing but vulnerable to political backlash
- **Implementation Path:** NIH can implement many elements administratively; legislation needed for commission and statutory bill of rights

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The biosecurity-first coalition (Compromise 1) offers the largest and most durable cross-ideological alliance. Gain-of-function research oversight generates genuine bipartisan agreement rooted in national security and public health concerns. This should be the legislative priority.

### Key Obstacles

- **Private sector extension**: The most important reform (extending protections to all research) faces the strongest opposition from the most powerful stakeholders (technology and pharmaceutical industries). This likely requires either a major scandal catalyst or a decade-long incremental strategy
- **Animal research coverage**: While morally compelling, the AWA rat/mouse/bird exclusion is entrenched by strong industry opposition and legislative inertia. Phased administrative action may be more feasible than legislative amendment
- **AI research ethics**: The pace of AI development and the power of the technology industry make comprehensive AI research ethics regulation the most difficult long-term objective

### Low Consistency Partners

Conservative, Populist, and Religious Right perspectives (rated 3/5) require careful management:

- **Conservative**: Engage through national security framing for biosecurity reforms; deregulation framing for IRB streamlining. Avoid triggering anti-regulation reflexes by leading with burden reduction
- **Populist**: Leverage anti-elite sentiment for corporate accountability provisions. Be cautious about expert-driven frameworks that may trigger anti-expert backlash
- **Religious Right**: Engage through human dignity framing. Accept that embryonic research provisions may need to be addressed separately to avoid derailing broader reforms

### Recommended Approach

1. **Immediate priority**: Biosecurity and DURC Governance Act (broadest coalition, highest urgency)
2. **Near-term**: Smart Oversight Reform Package (IRB reform + harmonization; delivers benefits to research community while strengthening protections)
3. **Medium-term**: Research Trust and Equity Initiative (builds on clinical trial diversity momentum; addressable through NIH administrative action plus targeted legislation)
4. **Long-term**: Research Ethics Modernization Act (private sector extension requires sustained advocacy, coalition building, and potentially a catalyzing event)
