# Research Ethics: Current State

## Overview

The American research ethics system operates through a layered structure of federal regulations, institutional review bodies, and professional norms. While this system has prevented the recurrence of the overt abuses that prompted its creation, it faces mounting pressure from technological change, globalization, and evolving conceptions of what constitutes ethical research. The current landscape reveals a system that is simultaneously over-regulated in some domains and dangerously under-regulated in others.

## Human Subjects Research Protections

### The Common Rule

The Common Rule (45 C.F.R. Part 46), revised in 2018 and fully implemented in 2019, provides the baseline regulatory framework for human subjects research conducted or funded by any of 20 signatory federal agencies. Key current features include:

- **Revised informed consent requirements**: Consent forms must begin with concise key information, organized to facilitate comprehension
- **Expanded exemptions**: Certain categories of minimal-risk research are exempt from full IRB review, including secondary research using identifiable private information under specified conditions
- **Single IRB mandate**: Cooperative, multi-site research funded by NIH must use a single IRB of record (effective January 2020)
- **Continuing review elimination**: Annual continuing review is no longer required for most minimal-risk studies approved through expedited review
- **Biospecimen provisions**: The final rule did not implement proposed changes to require consent for research use of de-identified biospecimens, deferring this issue

### IRB System Performance

The approximately 2,500 registered IRBs in the United States vary enormously in size, expertise, and effectiveness:

| IRB Characteristic | Current Status |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Average board size | 8-15 members |
| Meeting frequency | Monthly to biweekly at major institutions |
| Community member requirement | At least 1 per board |
| Non-scientist requirement | At least 1 per board |
| Commercial IRBs | ~6 major firms handling ~70% of industry-sponsored research |
| Academic IRB staff per 1,000 protocols | 2-5 FTE |
| Median time to initial approval | 30-60 days (full board); 14-21 days (expedited) |

**Key performance issues:**

- **Mission creep**: IRBs increasingly review risk management, regulatory compliance, and institutional liability rather than focusing on ethical protections for participants
- **Inconsistency**: The same protocol submitted to different IRBs may receive contradictory decisions, creating confusion and delay for multi-site studies
- **Consent form bloat**: Despite 2018 reforms requiring concise key information, average consent forms exceed 20 pages, driven by institutional legal counsel rather than participant comprehension
- **Exempt determination confusion**: The expanded exemption categories in the revised Common Rule have created uncertainty about what qualifies, leading some institutions to over-review
- **Unaffiliated researcher gaps**: The Common Rule applies to federally funded research at institutions with a Federal Wide Assurance; privately funded research at unaffiliated entities may have no oversight

### Subpart Protections for Vulnerable Populations

The Common Rule includes additional protections (Subparts B, C, and D) for pregnant women, prisoners, and children. Current status:

- **Subpart B (pregnant women, human fetuses, neonates)**: Remains largely unchanged since original promulgation; does not reflect current reproductive technology
- **Subpart C (prisoners)**: Defines "prisoner" narrowly; does not clearly cover individuals on probation, parole, or in immigration detention
- **Subpart D (children)**: Requires both parental permission and child assent; age of assent varies by institution (typically 7-12 years)
- **No specific subpart for**: Cognitively impaired adults, economically disadvantaged populations, educationally disadvantaged populations, tribal communities in research contexts, or undocumented immigrants

### FDA Regulations

The Food and Drug Administration maintains a separate but overlapping regulatory framework (21 C.F.R. Parts 50, 56) governing clinical trials of drugs, biologics, and medical devices:

- FDA regulations have not been harmonized with the 2018 Common Rule revisions
- FDA requires continuing review for all studies, unlike the revised Common Rule
- FDA mandates informed consent elements that differ slightly from Common Rule requirements
- FDA regulates research regardless of funding source, providing broader jurisdictional reach than the Common Rule

## Animal Research Oversight

### The Animal Welfare Act and IACUC System

The Animal Welfare Act (AWA), administered by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), establishes minimum care standards for certain animals used in research. The current system:

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Species covered by AWA | Dogs, cats, primates, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, marine mammals, and others |
| Species excluded from AWA | Purpose-bred mice, rats, and birds (~95% of research animals) |
| USDA inspection frequency | Annual (mandated); actual average ~18 months |
| IACUC-registered facilities | ~1,300 |
| Annual USDA-reported research animals | ~800,000 |
| Estimated total animals (including excluded species) | ~100 million |
| PHS Policy coverage | All vertebrate animals at PHS-funded institutions |

**Key issues:**

- **The rat-mouse-bird exclusion**: The AWA explicitly excludes purpose-bred rats, mice, and birds from its protections. These animals constitute the vast majority of research subjects. The PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (administered by OLAW) covers these species at federally funded institutions, but privately funded research on excluded species may lack oversight
- **IACUC composition**: Each IACUC must include at least one veterinarian, one scientist, one non-scientist, and one unaffiliated member. In practice, committees are dominated by researchers at the same institution, creating potential conflicts of interest
- **Inspection gaps**: USDA-APHIS inspection staffing has declined even as the number of registered facilities has grown. Average time between inspections exceeds the mandated annual cycle
- **3Rs implementation**: While the 3Rs framework is widely endorsed, systematic assessment of replacement, reduction, and refinement is inconsistent across institutions
- **Primate research**: Approximately 70,000 nonhuman primates are used in U.S. research annually. The NIH retired all government-owned chimpanzees from research in 2015, but research on other primate species continues and has intensified due to COVID-19 vaccine and treatment development

## Dual-Use Research of Concern

### Current Oversight Framework

The oversight of dual-use research of concern (DURC) and enhanced potential pandemic pathogen (ePPP) research operates through multiple policy layers:

- **2024 Updated Policy on DURC**: The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) updated its DURC policy in 2024, broadening the scope of research requiring institutional review and federal oversight
- **P3CO Framework**: The HHS framework for reviewing research proposals involving enhanced potential pandemic pathogens was suspended in 2017, reinstated in 2019, and revised in 2024
- **Institutional Review Entity (IRE)**: Institutions receiving federal funding for life sciences research must establish an IRE to identify and assess DURC
- **Federal oversight**: The DURC review board at HHS reviews proposals flagged by institutional entities for research involving the 15 categories of agents and toxins

### Gain-of-Function Research Debate

The gain-of-function research controversy has intensified since the COVID-19 pandemic:

| Issue | Current Status |
|-------|---------------|
| NIH-funded GOF research moratorium | Lifted in 2017; replaced by P3CO framework |
| Institutional compliance with DURC policies | Uneven; many institutions lack dedicated biosafety expertise |
| International coordination | Limited; no binding international agreement on GOF oversight |
| Transparency | Most DURC reviews are not publicly disclosed |
| Congressional oversight | Multiple hearings held (2021-2025); no comprehensive legislation enacted |
| Whistleblower protections for biosafety concerns | Weak; no specific statutory protection |

## AI Ethics in Research

### Emerging Regulatory Landscape

The use of artificial intelligence in research has outpaced the development of ethical oversight frameworks:

- **No comprehensive federal AI research ethics regulation**: The National AI Initiative Act of 2020 established coordination mechanisms but did not create binding ethical requirements for AI research
- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework**: Voluntary framework published in 2023; widely referenced but not legally binding
- **OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Requires federal agencies to implement AI governance, but applies to government use rather than research funding
- **IRB challenges**: Most IRBs lack the technical expertise to evaluate AI research protocols, particularly those involving large language models, generative AI, or algorithmic decision-making
- **Data ethics gaps**: Research using publicly available data (social media posts, online behavior) may not meet the regulatory definition of "human subjects research" under the Common Rule, even when it analyzes identifiable individuals

### Key AI Research Ethics Concerns

- **Algorithmic bias**: AI systems trained on biased datasets can perpetuate and amplify discrimination, yet few research institutions have systematic bias review processes
- **Informed consent for data**: Large-scale data collection through apps, platforms, and sensors challenges traditional informed consent models
- **Automated experimentation**: AI-driven A/B testing by technology companies affects millions of users without research ethics review
- **Deepfakes and synthetic data**: Research involving synthetic media raises novel consent and deception concerns
- **Autonomous research systems**: AI systems that independently design and conduct experiments create accountability gaps

## International Comparison

| Country/Region | Human Subjects Oversight | Animal Research | DURC Governance |
|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| United States | Common Rule + FDA; ~2,500 IRBs | AWA + PHS Policy; IACUC system | DURC Policy + P3CO framework |
| European Union | Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) 536/2014; national ethics committees | Directive 2010/63/EU; requires 3Rs | EU Regulation on dual-use export |
| United Kingdom | Health Research Authority; Research Ethics Committees | Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986; Home Office licensing | Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens |
| Canada | Tri-Council Policy Statement 2; Research Ethics Boards | Canadian Council on Animal Care | Public Health Agency of Canada oversight |
| Australia | National Statement on Ethical Conduct; HRECs | Australian Code for Care and Use of Animals | Department of Health biosecurity |

**Notable international differences:**

- The EU requires ethical review for all research involving identifiable data, not just federally funded research
- The UK uses a centralized licensing system for animal research, with individual project licenses and personal licenses for researchers
- Canada applies research ethics requirements to all research at institutions receiving federal funds, regardless of the specific study's funding source
- Several countries (Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany) have constitutional provisions addressing animal dignity or welfare

## Trust and Participation

### Impact of Historical Abuses

The legacy of unethical research continues to affect research participation and public trust:

- **Clinical trial participation disparities**: Black Americans constitute approximately 13.4% of the U.S. population but represent only 5-8% of clinical trial participants. While multiple factors contribute, survey data consistently identifies distrust rooted in the Tuskegee legacy as a significant barrier
- **Hispanic and Latino underrepresentation**: Similarly underrepresented at 7-12% of trial participants versus 18.7% of the population, with language barriers and immigration status concerns compounding distrust
- **Tribal communities**: Many tribal nations have established their own research review processes, requiring tribal approval in addition to institutional IRB review. The NIH Tribal Health Research Office was established in 2015
- **Community engagement**: NIH requires community engagement plans for community-based participatory research, but implementation varies significantly

### COVID-19 Impact on Research Ethics

The pandemic stress-tested the research ethics system in multiple ways:

- Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathways accelerated vaccine and therapeutic development but raised questions about the adequacy of safety monitoring
- Clinical trial diversity requirements were implemented for COVID-19 vaccine trials, resulting in more representative enrollment than typical trials
- The debate over challenge trials (deliberately infecting volunteers) highlighted tensions between individual autonomy and research ethics norms
- Post-market surveillance systems (VAERS, V-safe) generated vast safety data but also became vectors for misinformation
- Research ethics review timelines were compressed, with some IRBs providing approval within 24-48 hours for pandemic-related protocols
