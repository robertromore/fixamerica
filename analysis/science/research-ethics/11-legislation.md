# Research Ethics: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Research ethics reform requires legislative action at the federal level to extend protections beyond the current Common Rule framework, strengthen oversight of dual-use research, and establish accountability mechanisms that existing administrative authorities cannot provide. This document presents two primary federal bills, state model legislation, and a regulatory framework to implement the reforms identified in [Solutions](07-solutions.md).

---

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendment is required for the reforms proposed in this document. Congress possesses ample authority under the Commerce Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 3) to regulate research activities with interstate effects, and under the Spending Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, cl. 1) to impose conditions on federal research funding. The First Amendment protects scientific inquiry but does not preclude reasonable regulation of research methodology that poses risks to human subjects, animal welfare, or public safety.

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Research Ethics Modernization Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds the following:
    (1) The Common Rule (45 C.F.R. Part 46) applies only to
    research funded or conducted by signatory federal agencies,
    leaving significant categories of research on human subjects
    without ethical oversight.
    (2) Technology companies, private research firms, and other
    entities routinely conduct systematic investigations on
    human subjects without Institutional Review Board review or
    meaningful informed consent.
    (3) Artificial intelligence research involving large-scale
    data collection, algorithmic experimentation, and automated
    decision-making raises novel ethical concerns not addressed
    by existing regulations.
    (4) The Office for Human Research Protections lacks adequate
    staffing and enforcement authority to ensure compliance even
    within its current jurisdiction.
    (5) Persistent underrepresentation of racial and ethnic
    minorities in clinical research undermines both scientific
    validity and health equity.

(b) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this Act is to--
    (1) establish a comprehensive, risk-proportionate framework
    for the ethical oversight of all research involving human
    subjects conducted in or affecting persons in the United
    States;
    (2) strengthen the authority and capacity of the Office for
    Human Research Protections;
    (3) modernize informed consent requirements for the digital
    age;
    (4) protect whistleblowers who report research ethics
    violations; and
    (5) promote equitable participation in research.

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: The expanded definition of "human subject" and "research" is the key innovation, capturing algorithmic experimentation and AI training that currently falls outside the Common Rule. The definition of research includes large-scale A/B testing and AI system training, closing the technology industry gap
- **Section 4 (Tiered Framework)**: The four-tier structure allocates oversight proportionate to risk, addressing the research community's legitimate concern about over-regulation of low-risk studies while strengthening oversight of high-risk research
- **Section 5 (Ethics Committees)**: The 50% external membership requirement for Tier 3-4 review addresses institutional conflicts of interest. The Federal Ethics Review Panel provides access for entities without institutional infrastructure
- **Section 6 (Consent)**: Explicitly invalidates terms-of-service as consent and requires ongoing consent for longitudinal research
- **Section 7 (Enforcement)**: Creates graduated penalties with real financial consequences, including a private right of action that empowers participants to hold covered entities accountable
- **Section 8 (Whistleblower)**: Provides specific, robust protections for research ethics whistleblowers, filling a gap in current law
- **Section 12 (Effective Date)**: Phased implementation gives covered entities time to build compliance infrastructure

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Technology industry opposition | Product improvement safe harbor addresses legitimate concerns; phased implementation reduces disruption |
| Constitutional questions (Commerce Clause) | Research activities involve interstate commerce; precedent supports regulation |
| Compliance costs for small entities | Federal Ethics Review Panel and compliance grants reduce burden |
| Definition of "research" too broad | Safe harbor provision and Tier 1 registration limit overreach |
| First Amendment concerns | Regulates methodology, not inquiry; does not restrict publication |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Eliminate product improvement safe harbor; require Tier 3 review for all digital platform experiments
- **Fallback version**: Apply only to research at institutions receiving any federal funding (broader than current Common Rule but narrower than universal)
- **Compromise version**: Apply Tiers 1-2 universally; apply Tiers 3-4 only to federally connected research

### Bill 2: Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act

**Purpose**: Establish a permanent, independent oversight framework for dual-use research of concern and enhanced potential pandemic pathogen research, replacing the current patchwork of advisory policies with statutory authority.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research
Governance Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds the following:
    (1) Dual-use research of concern and enhanced potential
    pandemic pathogen research pose significant risks to public
    health and national security.
    (2) Current oversight of such research relies on executive
    branch policies that lack statutory authority, transparency,
    and enforcement mechanisms.
    (3) The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the critical
    importance of both advancing infectious disease research and
    ensuring rigorous safety and oversight of high-risk
    biological research.
    (4) Existing institutional review mechanisms for dual-use
    research are inconsistently implemented and lack
    independence from the institutions conducting the research.
    (5) The United States lacks a permanent, independent body
    with authority to review and approve high-risk biological
    research before it is conducted.

(b) PURPOSE.--The purpose of this Act is to--
    (1) establish an independent National Biosecurity Review
    Board with authority to review and approve dual-use research
    of concern and enhanced potential pandemic pathogen research;
    (2) create a transparent and accountable review process;

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4 (Board Structure)**: The independent agency model follows the precedent of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission--separating the oversight function from the funding agencies that promote research. The conflict-of-interest restriction (no active researchers) ensures independence
- **Section 5 (Scope)**: Expands beyond the current 15-agent list to include SARS-related coronaviruses and Nipah virus, reflecting lessons from COVID-19. The Board has authority to add additional agents through notice-and-comment rulemaking
- **Section 6 (Review Process)**: The 90-day review timeline balances thoroughness with responsiveness. The criteria require affirmative findings of merit, necessity, and safety before approval
- **Section 8 (Transparency)**: Addresses the current system's lack of public accountability by requiring disclosure of decisions with appropriate security protections
- **Section 9 (Enforcement)**: Criminal penalties for willful violations signal the seriousness of the threat, while civil penalties provide graduated response for less severe violations
- **Section 11 (International)**: Directs diplomatic engagement to prevent the creation of "biosafety havens" where researchers relocate to avoid oversight

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Research community opposition (scientific freedom) | Board includes scientists; criteria require consideration of scientific merit |
| 90-day review slows urgent pandemic research | Emergency provision could be added for declared public health emergencies |
| International competitors not bound | International coordination mandate; U.S. standards influence global norms |
| Independent agency costs | Modest budget relative to risks; self-funding through application fees possible |
| Constitutional challenge (executive power) | Congress has authority to create independent agencies; removal protections upheld in precedent |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Apply to all privately funded dual-use research, not just federally connected research; require prior restraint on publication of DURC results
- **Fallback version**: Establish Board within HHS rather than as independent agency; advisory authority only for first 5 years with transition to mandatory review
- **Emergency provision**: Add expedited 14-day review pathway for research directly responsive to declared public health emergencies

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Research Participant Protection Act

**Purpose**: Extend research ethics protections to privately funded research conducted within the state, filling gaps in federal coverage.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Research Participant
Protection Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.
(a) "Research" means a systematic investigation designed to
develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge about human
subjects, including clinical trials, behavioral studies,
surveys involving sensitive information, and algorithmic
experimentation on identifiable individuals.
(b) "Human subject" means a living individual about whom a
researcher obtains data through intervention, interaction, or
identifiable information collection.
(c) "Ethics committee" means a committee registered with the
state Department of Health meeting the requirements of
Section 4.

SECTION 3. APPLICABILITY.
This Act applies to all research involving human subjects
conducted within [State] that is not subject to federal
oversight under 45 C.F.R. Part 46 or 21 C.F.R. Parts 50
and 56.

SECTION 4. ETHICS REVIEW REQUIREMENT.
(a) No person or entity shall conduct research as defined in
this Act without prior review and approval by a registered
ethics committee.
(b) The [State] Department of Health shall establish
registration requirements for ethics committees and maintain
a public registry.
(c) The [State] Department of Health shall establish a State
Ethics Review Panel to serve entities without access to an
institutional ethics committee.

SECTION 5. INFORMED CONSENT.
(a) No person shall be enrolled as a human subject in research
without documented informed consent.
(b) Consent documents shall include plain-language explanation
of the research purpose, procedures, risks, benefits,
alternatives, and the right to withdraw.
(c) Click-through agreements and terms of service shall not
constitute informed consent under this Act.

SECTION 6. ENFORCEMENT.
(a) The [State] Attorney General shall enforce this Act.
(b) Violations are punishable by civil penalties of up to
$100,000 per violation.
(c) Any individual harmed by a violation may bring a civil
action for actual damages, punitive damages, and reasonable
attorney fees.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall take effect 18 months after enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This model legislation fills the private sector gap at the state level, applying to research not covered by federal oversight. States have police power authority to regulate activities within their borders, including research.

**Adaptations**: States with large technology sectors (California, Washington, New York, Massachusetts) may wish to expand the definition of research explicitly to include A/B testing and algorithmic experimentation. States with significant pharmaceutical industry presence may adjust the scope to avoid duplicating FDA oversight.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### OHRP Rulemaking

**Existing Authority**: 42 U.S.C. 289; authority to issue regulations for human subjects protections

**Draft Regulation**: OHRP should promulgate rules to:

1. Harmonize Common Rule definitions with FDA regulations (21 C.F.R. Parts 50, 56)
2. Establish specific IRB review criteria for AI and big data research
3. Define "broad consent" procedures with enhanced participant notification requirements
4. Establish community advisory board requirements for research in underserved communities

### USDA-APHIS Rulemaking

**Existing Authority**: 7 U.S.C. 2131-2159 (if Congress amends AWA to close exclusion)

**Draft Regulation**: Following AWA amendment to include rats, mice, and birds:

1. Phase in reporting requirements over 2 years
2. Establish species-specific care standards through notice-and-comment rulemaking
3. Require 3Rs justification in all IACUC protocol reviews
4. Increase inspection frequency to at least annual for all registered facilities

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Commerce Clause**: Extending research ethics protections to privately funded research is supportable under the Commerce Clause, as research activities involve interstate commerce (recruitment of subjects, purchase of materials, dissemination of results across state lines)
- **First Amendment**: The proposed legislation regulates research methodology and participant protections, not the content of scientific inquiry or publication. This is analogous to workplace safety regulations, which have been upheld despite their effects on economic activity
- **Spending Clause**: Federal funding conditions remain the strongest constitutional basis for research ethics requirements

### Preemption Questions

- The Research Ethics Modernization Act should establish a federal floor, not a ceiling, explicitly preserving state authority to impose additional protections
- State model legislation should include a provision deferring to federal oversight where it applies, to avoid duplication

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- OHRP proactive audit authority (expanding beyond complaint-driven investigations)
- Civil monetary penalties with graduated severity
- Private right of action for harmed research participants
- Criminal penalties for willful violations in biosecurity context
- Whistleblower protections with financial incentives

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The National Biosecurity Review Board should be reauthorized every 10 years
- The tiered framework should be reviewed by the National Academies every 5 years
- Agent and toxin lists should be reviewed annually by the Board

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Research Ethics Modernization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Product improvement safe harbor abuse | Companies could characterize research as product testing to avoid review | High |
| Offshore research migration | Companies could move research outside U.S. jurisdiction | High |
| Definition gaming | Entities could structure studies to avoid "generalizable knowledge" threshold | Medium |
| Small entity exemption exploitation | Large entities could fragment research across subsidiaries | Medium |
| Digital consent manipulation | Covered entities could design consent processes that technically comply but do not meaningfully inform | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not cover non-systematic data collection | Some harmful data practices may fall outside "research" definition | Definitional boundary problem |
| IRB expertise gap for AI research | Even reformed IRBs may lack technical capacity | Shortage of interdisciplinary expertise |
| Enforcement resource constraints | $100 million authorization may be insufficient | Federal budget pressures |
| International regulatory arbitrage | U.S.-only application creates competitive disadvantage | Sovereignty limits |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require the Secretary to issue guidance within 12 months on distinguishing product improvement from research, with specific examples and a rebuttable presumption that A/B tests involving more than 10,000 subjects constitute research
2. Apply the Act to research conducted by U.S.-based entities regardless of location, following the FCPA extraterritorial model
3. Establish annual review of the "generalizable knowledge" definition through advisory committee input
4. Require disclosure of corporate structure for small-entity exemption claims
5. Mandate usability testing of consent materials with representative participant populations

### Biosecurity and Dual-Use Research Governance Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Narrow agent list | Research on novel pathogens not yet listed could evade review | High |
| Institutional self-identification | Institutions may fail to identify covered research | High |
| International collaboration gaps | Research conducted jointly with foreign partners may escape U.S. review | Medium |
| 90-day review gaming | Submissions could be designed to exploit timing provisions | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address information hazards | Publication of dangerous findings not restricted | First Amendment constraints |
| Board appointment delays | Political dynamics may leave seats vacant | Standard appointments process |
| Private sector application limited | Bill primarily covers federally connected research | Political feasibility compromise |
| No mandatory lab safety standards | Physical safety requirements left to existing regulation | Jurisdictional complexity |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Authorize the Board to add agents through expedited notice-and-comment within 60 days when emerging threats are identified
2. Require annual institutional self-assessments with Board verification of a random sample of at least 20% of covered institutions
3. Apply review requirements to all research by U.S. persons or entities, regardless of collaboration partners or location
4. Establish pre-submission consultation process to prevent gaming of review timelines

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Regulatory fragmentation across agencies | Establish interagency coordination committee chaired by OSTP |
| Resource competition among oversight bodies | Dedicate separate appropriations for each oversight function |
| Political interference with Board appointments | Require Senate confirmation; stagger terms across administrations |
| Technology outpacing regulation | Require annual horizon-scanning report on emerging research ethics challenges |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- National Biosecurity Review Board: 10-year reauthorization with GAO review at year 7
- Tiered research ethics framework: National Academies review at year 5 with required congressional response
- Agent and toxin list: Annual Board review with public notice
- Enforcement penalty levels: Inflation adjustment every 3 years
- Overall legislative effectiveness: GAO report to Congress at years 3, 7, and 10 post-enactment
