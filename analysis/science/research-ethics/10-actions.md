## Overview

Research ethics reform requires action from citizens, researchers, institutions, and policymakers. This document outlines concrete steps that individuals and organizations can take to improve research ethics governance in the United States.

---

## For All Citizens

### Stay Informed

- **Understand your rights as a research participant**: If you participate in any clinical trial or research study, you have the right to full information about risks and benefits, the right to ask questions, and the right to withdraw at any time without penalty
- **Know when you are a research subject**: Technology platforms routinely conduct experiments on users. Check privacy settings and terms of service. Support organizations advocating for transparency in digital experimentation
- **Follow the debate**: The gain-of-function research debate, AI ethics discussions, and clinical trial diversity issues are covered by outlets including *STAT News* (<https://www.statnews.com/>), *Science* (<https://www.science.org/>), and *Nature* (<https://www.nature.com/>)

### Take Political Action

- **Contact your representatives**: Express support for research ethics reform legislation, including expanded oversight for privately funded research, whistleblower protections, and DURC governance
    - Senate HELP Committee members have primary jurisdiction over research ethics issues
    - House Energy and Commerce Committee members oversee FDA and NIH
    - Use the congressional switchboard: (202) 224-3121
- **Support ballot initiatives**: Where available, support state-level measures strengthening animal research protections or research participant rights
- **Testify at public hearings**: Federal agencies are required to accept public comments on proposed rules affecting research ethics. Comment on proposed Common Rule changes, DURC policies, and AI governance frameworks through <https://www.regulations.gov/>
- **Vote for science-literate candidates**: Support candidates who demonstrate understanding of research ethics issues and commitment to evidence-based oversight

### Engage with Research

- **Participate in clinical trials when appropriate**: Diverse participation strengthens research and benefits underrepresented communities. Search for trials at <https://clinicaltrials.gov/> or <https://www.researchmatch.org/>
- **Join community advisory boards**: Many federally funded research projects establish Community Advisory Boards (CABs) that welcome public participation
- **Report concerns**: If you experience or witness ethical violations in research, contact OHRP at (866) 447-4777 or <https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/compliance-and-reporting/index.html>

## For Researchers

### Improve Your Own Practice

- **Go beyond compliance**: Treat ethics review as a floor, not a ceiling. Engage substantively with the ethical dimensions of your research, not merely the regulatory requirements
- **Prioritize meaningful informed consent**: Invest time in developing consent materials that participants can actually understand. Use plain language, visual aids, and teach-back methods to verify comprehension
- **Implement the 3Rs proactively**: If your research involves animals, systematically evaluate alternatives before defaulting to animal models. Document your 3Rs analysis in grant applications and publications
- **Consider dual-use implications**: Even if your research does not meet the formal DURC threshold, consider whether your methods or findings could be misused. Consult your institutional biosafety committee proactively
- **Address AI ethics**: If your research involves AI systems, evaluate potential biases in training data, consider the impact of algorithmic decisions on affected populations, and document your ethical reasoning

### Advocate Within Your Institution

- **Serve on your IRB or IACUC**: These committees need engaged members who balance ethical rigor with practical understanding of research. Volunteer and participate actively
- **Report ethical concerns**: Use institutional reporting mechanisms to raise concerns about research practices you observe. If internal channels are inadequate, contact OHRP or the relevant federal agency
- **Mentor ethically**: Train students and junior researchers in ethical reasoning, not just regulatory compliance. Model ethical behavior in your own research
- **Advocate for diverse research participation**: Actively recruit underrepresented populations into your studies. Develop culturally appropriate consent processes and community engagement strategies
- **Push for institutional reform**: Advocate through faculty governance for IRB reforms, improved IACUC processes, and institutional policies that prioritize ethical conduct over administrative convenience

### Engage in Policy

- **Join professional society ethics committees**: Organizations like AAAS, FASEB, and disciplinary societies influence research ethics policy. Participate in their governance
- **Comment on proposed regulations**: Submit substantive comments during rulemaking processes. Researchers' expertise is critical for developing workable regulations
- **Testify before Congress**: Offer expert testimony on research ethics issues. Congressional staff actively seek researchers who can speak to the practical implications of proposed legislation
- **Publish on research ethics**: Contribute to the scholarly literature on research ethics reform. Peer-reviewed evidence strengthens the case for specific reforms

## For Research Institutions

### Strengthen Internal Oversight

- **Invest in IRB quality**: Provide adequate staffing, training, and resources for IRB operations. Measure IRB effectiveness by protection outcomes, not processing speed
- **Reduce conflicts of interest**: Increase external membership on IRBs and IACUCs. Consider using external reviewers for high-risk protocols involving senior investigators
- **Develop AI ethics capacity**: Establish institutional expertise in AI research ethics, either through dedicated staff or partnerships with bioethics centers
- **Implement robust whistleblower protections**: Go beyond minimum legal requirements. Establish anonymous reporting mechanisms, protect reporters from retaliation, and investigate reports promptly
- **Conduct self-audits**: Do not wait for OHRP or USDA inspections. Conduct regular internal audits of research ethics compliance and share results with institutional leadership

### Build Community Trust

- **Establish Community Advisory Boards**: Create standing community advisory structures, not just project-specific boards. Give community members genuine influence over institutional research priorities
- **Invest in community engagement**: Fund community engagement staff, community health workers, and culturally competent research coordinators
- **Address historical harms**: Acknowledge institutional involvement in historical research abuses. Support reparative justice initiatives
- **Share research benefits**: Develop benefit-sharing policies that return value to communities that participate in research, including post-trial access to successful interventions, health services, and investment in community infrastructure

### Lead on Emerging Issues

- **Develop institutional DURC policies**: Go beyond minimum federal requirements. Establish institutional policies that address dual-use potential in all research, not just the federally defined categories
- **Adopt comprehensive animal welfare standards**: Voluntarily extend AWA-equivalent protections to rats, mice, and birds. Seek AAALAC accreditation and comply with the *Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals*
- **Create AI ethics frameworks**: Develop institutional policies governing AI research that address algorithmic bias, training data ethics, and the impact of AI systems on human subjects
- **Support open science**: Adopt policies promoting data sharing, pre-registration, and transparency that advance both scientific integrity and ethical accountability

---

## For Professional Societies

- **Develop and enforce codes of conduct**: Establish clear ethical standards for members, with meaningful enforcement mechanisms including censure and expulsion for serious violations
- **Publish ethics guidance**: Issue field-specific guidance on emerging ethical issues, including AI, DURC, and digital research methods
- **Advocate for policy reform**: Use organizational influence to support research ethics legislation and regulation
- **Provide ethics education**: Offer continuing education in research ethics, beyond the minimum required by federal regulations
- **Recognize ethical leadership**: Create awards and recognition programs for researchers and institutions that demonstrate exceptional ethical commitment

---

## For Funders (Government and Private)

- **Condition funding on ethical conduct**: Require adherence to comprehensive ethical standards as a condition of funding, regardless of whether the funder is subject to the Common Rule
- **Fund ethics infrastructure**: Include budget lines for ethics review, community engagement, and participant protections in grant programs
- **Support ethics research**: Fund research on the effectiveness of oversight mechanisms, informed consent processes, and community engagement models
- **Require diversity in research participation**: Establish and enforce requirements for representative participant enrollment in funded research
- **Invest in alternatives**: Fund development and validation of non-animal research methods, computational models, and other alternatives
