# Research Ethics: History

## Overview

The history of research ethics in the United States is fundamentally a history of scandal followed by regulation. Nearly every major advance in research protections emerged in response to revelations of abuse--often years or decades after the harm occurred. Understanding this pattern is essential for anticipating and preventing future failures.

## Pre-Regulation Era (Before 1947)

### Early Human Experimentation

Before formal ethical frameworks existed, research on human subjects was governed primarily by individual investigator conscience and professional norms, which varied widely:

- **Walter Reed and yellow fever (1900-1901)**: Often cited as an early example of informed consent, Reed obtained written agreements from volunteers who understood they might contract a deadly disease. However, the consent process excluded vulnerable participants and the study's ethical merits are debated
- **Hideyo Noguchi and syphilis testing (1911-1912)**: Tested a diagnostic agent on hospital patients, including children, without consent. Briefly controversial but no regulatory consequences
- **San Quentin prison experiments (1913-1951)**: Decades of medical experiments on prisoners, including transplantation of testicular tissue, conducted with nominal consent under coercive conditions
- **Wartime research (1941-1945)**: The Committee on Medical Research coordinated massive research programs including malaria experiments on prisoners at Stateville Penitentiary, mustard gas experiments on soldiers, and high-altitude decompression studies

### The Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932-1972)

The U.S. Public Health Service Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male stands as the most consequential failure of research ethics in American history:

- **1932**: Study began in Macon County, Alabama, enrolling 399 Black men with syphilis and 201 without. Participants were told they were receiving treatment for "bad blood"
- **Deception**: Subjects were never informed they had syphilis, were actively prevented from receiving treatment (even after penicillin became the standard of care in the 1940s), and were offered incentives including free meals, burial stipends, and transportation
- **Duration**: The study continued for 40 years across multiple changes in PHS leadership, through the development of effective treatment, through the Nuremberg Code and Declaration of Helsinki, and through the establishment of the NIH Clinical Center
- **1966**: Peter Buxtun, a PHS venereal disease investigator, raised concerns internally. His complaints were reviewed by a PHS committee that voted to continue the study
- **1972**: Buxtun provided information to Associated Press reporter Jean Heller. Publication of the story on July 25, 1972, provoked immediate national outrage
- **1973**: A class-action lawsuit resulted in a $10 million settlement
- **1997**: President Clinton issued a formal presidential apology

**Legacy**: The Tuskegee study's impact extends far beyond its immediate victims. Research consistently demonstrates that knowledge of Tuskegee reduces willingness to participate in medical research among Black Americans. A 2016 study in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* found that the revelation of the Tuskegee study was associated with increases in medical mistrust and decreases in health care utilization among Black men that persisted for decades.

## The Nuremberg Code and Its Limited Impact (1947-1966)

### The Nuremberg Doctors' Trial

The 1946-1947 trial of Nazi physicians for human experimentation atrocities produced the Nuremberg Code, the first international document establishing principles for ethical human experimentation:

1. Voluntary consent is absolutely essential
2. The experiment should yield fruitful results for the good of society
3. The experiment should be based on prior animal experimentation
4. The experiment should avoid unnecessary physical and mental suffering
5. No experiment should be conducted where there is reason to believe death or disabling injury will occur
6. The degree of risk should never exceed humanitarian importance
7. Proper preparations should protect against even remote possibilities of injury
8. Only scientifically qualified persons should conduct experiments
9. The subject should be free to end the experiment at any point
10. The investigator must be prepared to terminate at any stage

### Paradox of Non-Application

Despite the Nuremberg Code's existence, American researchers largely viewed it as applicable only to the Nazi atrocities, not to their own work:

- **1950s-1960s radiation experiments**: The Atomic Energy Commission and Department of Defense sponsored studies in which patients were injected with plutonium, exposed to total body irradiation, or fed radioactive materials, often without informed consent. The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (1994) documented these abuses
- **Willowbrook hepatitis studies (1956-1970)**: Dr. Saul Krugman deliberately infected intellectually disabled children at the Willowbrook State School with hepatitis to study the disease's natural history. Parental consent was obtained, but admission to the overcrowded school was contingent on enrollment in the study
- **Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital (1963)**: Dr. Chester Southam injected live cancer cells into elderly patients without informing them the injections contained cancer cells. The study was approved by the hospital's medical department
- **Milgram obedience experiments (1961-1963)**: Stanley Milgram's deception-based obedience studies caused significant psychological distress to participants and helped catalyze discussions about deception in social science research

## Birth of the Modern Framework (1966-1981)

### Henry Beecher's "Ethics and Clinical Research" (1966)

Dr. Henry K. Beecher published a landmark article in the *New England Journal of Medicine* documenting 22 examples of unethical research published in leading medical journals. The article demonstrated that ethical violations were not isolated incidents but systemic features of the research enterprise.

### NIH and PHS Policy Development

- **1953**: NIH Clinical Center established the first formal review process for intramural research protocols
- **1966**: Surgeon General issued policy requiring institutional review of research funded by PHS grants (PPO 129, later revised as PHS Policy)
- **1971**: DHEW published the *Institutional Guide to DHEW Policy on Protection of Human Subjects*, establishing procedural requirements for review committees

### The National Research Act and the Belmont Report (1974-1979)

The public revelation of the Tuskegee study directly led to legislative action:

- **1974**: Congress passed the National Research Act (P.L. 93-348), which:
    - Created the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research
    - Required the establishment of Institutional Review Boards for federally funded research
    - Codified basic protections for human subjects

- **1979**: The National Commission published the *Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research*, establishing three foundational principles:
    - **Respect for Persons**: Individuals should be treated as autonomous agents; persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to additional protections
    - **Beneficence**: Researchers have obligations to do no harm and to maximize benefits while minimizing risks
    - **Justice**: The benefits and burdens of research should be distributed fairly

### The Common Rule (1981-1991)

- **1981**: DHHS codified human subjects protections in 45 C.F.R. Part 46
- **1991**: Fifteen federal agencies adopted the Common Rule as a uniform policy (the "Common Rule" designation), creating a baseline standard across the federal government
- **Subpart protections added**: Subpart B (pregnant women, 1975), Subpart C (prisoners, 1978), Subpart D (children, 1983)

## Animal Research Ethics Development

### Key Milestones

- **1876**: American Anti-Vivisection Society founded, the first organization in the United States to oppose animal experimentation
- **1966**: Animal Welfare Act (AWA) enacted (P.L. 89-544) following a *Life* magazine expose on stolen pets sold to research laboratories. Initial coverage limited to dogs, cats, primates, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits
- **1970**: AWA amended to expand coverage and require adequate veterinary care
- **1985**: Health Research Extension Act (P.L. 99-158) mandated that PHS-funded institutions establish IACUCs and comply with PHS Policy
- **1985**: Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals Act amended the AWA to require exercise for dogs, environmental enrichment for primates, and establishment of IACUCs
- **2002**: Farm Security and Rural Investment Act explicitly excluded purpose-bred rats, mice, and birds from AWA coverage, codifying a regulatory exclusion that had existed in practice
- **2013**: NIH announced retirement of most government-owned chimpanzees from research
- **2015**: NIH designated all remaining NIH-owned chimpanzees as permanently ineligible for research, transferring them to the Federal Sanctuary System

### The 3Rs Framework

The 3Rs--Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement--were articulated by William Russell and Rex Burch in *The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique* (1959):

- **Replacement**: Substituting non-animal methods where possible
- **Reduction**: Minimizing the number of animals used
- **Refinement**: Minimizing suffering and improving welfare

While the 3Rs have been widely adopted as guiding principles, their implementation has been uneven. The U.S. lags behind the European Union, which incorporated the 3Rs into binding legislation through Directive 2010/63/EU.

## The Common Rule Revision (2011-2019)

The first comprehensive revision of the Common Rule since its adoption took nearly a decade:

- **2011**: Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) issued, proposing significant changes including mandatory consent for biospecimen research
- **2015**: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published
- **2017**: Final Rule published, with most provisions delayed until 2018
- **2018**: Implementation date delayed to January 2019
- **2019**: Revised Common Rule fully effective

### What Changed

| Feature | Old Rule | Revised Rule |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Consent form structure | No specific format required | Must begin with concise key information |
| Exempt categories | 6 categories | 8 categories with revised criteria |
| Continuing review | Required for all approved research | Eliminated for most expedited-review studies |
