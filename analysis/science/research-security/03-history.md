# Research Security: History

## Overview

The tension between open science and national security is as old as the atomic bomb. Since World War II, the United States has oscillated between periods of restrictive security controls and expansive openness, each swing driven by shifts in the geopolitical landscape, domestic politics, and the evolving nature of scientific research. Understanding this history is essential because the current research security debate recapitulates patterns -- including ethnic profiling -- that have recurred for decades.

## Timeline

### The Manhattan Project and Postwar Framework (1940s-1950s)

The Manhattan Project established the template: scientific research could produce weapons of unprecedented power, and secrecy was essential to maintaining strategic advantage. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 created the first comprehensive framework for classifying scientific information, restricting the publication and sharing of nuclear research.

Key developments:

- **1945**: Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrate the military significance of basic research
- **1946**: Atomic Energy Act establishes classification system for nuclear information; creates Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data categories
- **1947**: National Security Act creates the CIA and establishes the classification system that would later expand to cover emerging technologies
- **1950**: Klaus Fuchs arrested for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union; confirms fears that open scientific exchange enables espionage
- **1950**: NSF established with an explicit mission to support basic research; tension between openness and security built into its founding
- **1953**: J. Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance revoked, partly for advocating international scientific cooperation; demonstrates the cost of security suspicion on scientific careers
- **1954**: Atomic Energy Act amendments expand classification framework

The early Cold War established a precedent that persists today: the tension between scientists who view openness as essential to progress and security officials who view it as a vulnerability.

### Cold War Controls and the Soviet Threat (1960s-1980s)

During the Cold War, research security focused primarily on the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact nations.

- **1962**: Arms Control and Disarmament Act creates framework for scientific exchanges with adversaries under controlled conditions
- **1969**: Mansfield Amendment restricts DOD research funding to projects with clear military applications, pushing some sensitive research out of universities and into classified settings
- **1977**: Bucy Report warns that technology transfer to the Soviet Union threatens U.S. security; calls for expanded export controls
- **1981**: Executive Order 12356 expands classification authority; DOD attempts to impose pre-publication review on unclassified university research
- **1982**: Peter Galison case study documents 8 billion classified pages in the U.S. government -- more classified material than exists in the Library of Congress

### NSDD-189 and the Fundamental Research Exclusion (1985)

National Security Decision Directive 189 (NSDD-189), signed by President Reagan in September 1985, represented a landmark compromise:

*"It is the policy of this Administration that, to the maximum extent possible, the products of fundamental research remain unrestricted. It is also the policy of this Administration that, where the national security requires control, the mechanism for control of information generated during federally-funded fundamental research in science, technology, and engineering at colleges, universities, and laboratories is classification."*

This established two critical principles:

1. **Fundamental research results should be unrestricted** unless formally classified
2. **Classification, not ad hoc restrictions**, is the appropriate control mechanism

NSDD-189 has been reaffirmed by every subsequent administration but faces increasing pressure from those who argue it was designed for a different era.

### Post-Cold War Opening (1990s)

The end of the Cold War produced a dramatic expansion of international scientific collaboration:

- **1990s**: Large-scale U.S.-Russia scientific cooperation programs redirect former Soviet weapons scientists toward civilian research
- **1992**: Chinese Student Protection Act provides permanent residency to Chinese students who had been in the U.S. during Tiananmen Square; many become productive researchers
- **1993**: National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act facilitates industry-lab partnerships
- **1996**: Economic Espionage Act creates federal criminal penalties for trade secret theft, including foreign economic espionage
- **1998**: International Space Station begins operations, institutionalizing scientific collaboration across geopolitical lines

### The Wen Ho Lee Case (1999-2000)

The prosecution of Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwanese American scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, foreshadowed many dynamics of the China Initiative two decades later.

- **1999**: Lee arrested on 59 counts related to downloading classified nuclear weapon simulation files
- **2000**: 58 of 59 charges dropped; Lee pleaded guilty to one count of improper handling of restricted data
- **2000**: Federal judge Robert Parker apologized to Lee from the bench, stating: "I sincerely apologize to you, Dr. Lee, for the unfair manner in which you were held in custody by the executive branch"
- **Legacy**: The case raised profound questions about racial profiling in research security enforcement -- questions that would return with the China Initiative

### Post-9/11 Tightening (2001-2010)

The September 11 attacks prompted broad security tightening that affected research:

- **2001**: USA PATRIOT Act expands surveillance authority; universities report increased FBI inquiries about foreign researchers
- **2002**: Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act creates SEVIS system for tracking international students and exchange visitors
- **2003**: Interagency Panel on Advanced Science and Security (IPASS) visa review delays create months-long waits for researchers from certain countries
- **2004**: National Academies report *Science and Security in a Post 9/11 World* warns against excessive restrictions that damage research capacity
- **2007**: Deemed export rule enforcement tightens; universities seek clarification on applicability to fundamental research
- **2010**: Export Control Reform Initiative launched to modernize Cold War-era export control system

### The Rise of China Concerns (2010-2018)

As China's research investment surged, so did concerns about systematic exploitation of U.S. research:

- **2011**: Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive publishes *Foreign Spies Stealing US Economic Secrets in Cyberspace*, identifying China as the primary threat
- **2014**: FBI Economic Espionage Unit begins outreach to universities about Chinese talent recruitment programs
- **2015**: Xiaoxing Xi (Temple University) arrested for sharing technology with China; charges dropped when the device in question was misidentified
- **2016**: NSF begins requiring disclosure of all sources of current and pending research support
- **2017**: FBI Director Christopher Wray describes the China threat as a "whole-of-society" problem, a characterization criticized for implying all Chinese nationals are suspect
- **2018**: NIH Director Francis Collins sends letter to 10,000+ grantee institutions warning of foreign government threats to research integrity

### The China Initiative Era (2018-2022)

Attorney General Jeff Sessions launched the China Initiative on November 1, 2018, with five stated goals:

1. Identify priority trade secret theft cases
2. Develop an enforcement strategy for non-traditional intelligence collectors (including researchers, students, and joint ventures)
3. Educate colleges and universities about threats
4. Apply FARA to unregistered agents
5. Protect critical infrastructure from supply chain threats

The initiative evolved to include prosecution of researchers for failure to disclose Chinese affiliations on grant applications:

- **2019**: DOE bans staff from participating in foreign talent recruitment programs; Charles Lieber (Harvard) later arrested for concealing Wuhan University of Technology ties
- **2020**: Multiple researchers arrested or charged; Hu Anming (UT-Knoxville) ultimately acquitted
- **2020**: Presidential Proclamation 10043 suspends entry of Chinese graduate students and researchers associated with Military-Civil Fusion entities
- **2021**: Charles Lieber convicted of false statements and tax offenses related to undisclosed payments from Wuhan University of Technology
- **2021**: Gang Chen (MIT) arrested for failing to disclose Chinese affiliations; charges dropped January 2022
- **2021**: NSPM-33 signed, establishing standardized disclosure framework
- **2022**: Andrew Lelling's analysis shows that of 77 China Initiative defendants charged between 2018 and 2022, approximately one-third faced charges unrelated to economic espionage or technology theft -- primarily grant fraud and false statements
- **2022 (February)**: DOJ formally ends the China Initiative, replacing it with the Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats

### Post-China Initiative Recalibration (2022-Present)

Since the initiative's termination, policy has shifted toward:

- **2022**: OSTP publishes NSPM-33 implementation guidance emphasizing standardized disclosure, digital persistent identifiers, and risk-based approaches
- **2023**: CHIPS and Science Act implementation expands semiconductor export controls, creating new tensions with fundamental research
- **2023**: National Academies publish *Protecting U.S. Technological Advantage* recommending calibrated, risk-based approaches
- **2024**: Agencies finalize updated disclosure forms and compliance requirements
- **2024**: Presidential Proclamation 10043 remains in effect despite calls for revision
- **2025**: Growing bipartisan concern about the balance between security and competitiveness; multiple legislative proposals introduced
- **2025-2026**: Continued debate over appropriate scope of emerging technology controls and their impact on fundamental research

## Historical Patterns

### Recurring Cycles

The history reveals a consistent pattern:

1. **Threat identified**: A foreign adversary is perceived to be exploiting U.S. research openness
2. **Security tightening**: New controls, investigations, and restrictions are imposed
3. **Overreach**: Enforcement sweeps up innocent researchers, often along ethnic lines
4. **Backlash**: Scientific community and civil liberties groups push back
5. **Recalibration**: Policies are adjusted, but baseline restrictions ratchet higher
6. **New threat emerges**: The cycle begins again with accumulated restrictions

### Ethnic Profiling Pattern

Each era has produced ethnic profiling concerns:

| Era | Targeted Group | Emblematic Case |
|-----|---------------|-----------------|
| Cold War (1950s) | Eastern Europeans, Jews suspected of Communist sympathies | Oppenheimer security revocation |
| Late Cold War (1980s) | Soviet-bloc scientists | Broad restrictions on scientific exchanges |
| 1990s-2000s | Chinese Americans | Wen Ho Lee |
| 2010s-2020s | Chinese and Chinese American researchers | Xiaoxing Xi, Gang Chen, Hu Anming |

### The Ratchet Effect

Each security tightening leaves residual restrictions that accumulate over time:

- NSDD-189 fundamental research exclusion gradually narrowed through CUI expansion, deemed export enforcement, and emerging technology controls
- Each new disclosure requirement adds to the compliance burden without replacing previous requirements
- Investigative and enforcement infrastructure, once built, seeks continued justification
- Institutional risk aversion means universities impose restrictions beyond what federal policy requires

## Lessons from History

1. **Broad-brush approaches produce injustice**: Every era that targeted researchers by ethnicity produced wrongful accusations, damaged careers, and ultimately undermined the security goals
2. **Openness is a competitive advantage**: The countries that have maintained more open research systems have generally outperformed those that prioritized secrecy
3. **Classification is the appropriate tool for truly sensitive research**: NSDD-189's principle remains sound -- if research is too sensitive to share, classify it; otherwise, let it be open
4. **Compliance burden matters**: Excessive paperwork and reporting requirements drive talent away as effectively as overt discrimination
5. **Trust, once broken, takes years to rebuild**: The chilling effects of the China Initiative will persist long after the policy changes
