# Research Security: Roadmap

## Overview

Implementing research security reform requires sequencing actions across executive, legislative, and institutional tracks. Some reforms can be achieved through executive action alone; others require legislation. Some can begin immediately; others depend on prior steps. This roadmap organizes the proposed solutions into a phased implementation plan that builds momentum while managing political constraints.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Immediate Executive Actions (0-6 Months)

These reforms require no legislation and can be implemented through executive orders, agency guidance, or administrative action.

| Action | Lead Agency | Mechanism | Dependencies |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Issue behavior-based investigation guidelines | DOJ/FBI | Attorney General memorandum | None |
| Publish standardized definitions for key terms (foreign talent recruitment program, conflict of commitment, etc.) | OSTP | Interagency guidance update | None |
| Require demographic reporting on research security investigations | DOJ | Attorney General order | None |
| Establish interagency working group on research security reform | OSTP/NSC | Presidential memorandum | None |
| Begin review of Presidential Proclamation 10043 | State/DHS/NSC | Interagency policy review | None |
| Launch pilot of unified disclosure form | NSF/NIH | Agency coordination agreement | Standardized definitions |

**Milestones**:

- Month 1: Attorney General issues behavior-based investigation memorandum
- Month 2: OSTP publishes updated term definitions
- Month 3: Interagency working group established; begins PP 10043 review
- Month 4: Demographic reporting framework developed
- Month 6: Unified disclosure form pilot begins at 20 institutions

### Phase 2: Legislative Foundation (6-18 Months)

These reforms require congressional action but have strong bipartisan potential.

| Action | Vehicle | Key Provisions | Political Prospects |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Research Security Due Process Act | Standalone bill | Pre-investigation review, notice and cure, administrative hearing, wrongful investigation remedy | Moderate-high (bipartisan civil liberties appeal) |
| Institutional Compliance Support | CHIPS and Science Act reauthorization or standalone appropriation | Compliance grants, model programs, safe harbor, small institution consortia | High (university lobby support) |
| Research Security Ombudsperson | Standalone bill or appropriations rider | Office establishment, staffing, authorities | Moderate (low cost, low controversy) |
| Balanced Research Security Act | Standalone comprehensive bill | Risk-tiered disclosure, standardized forms, behavior-based standards, allied coordination framework | Moderate (comprehensive approach may attract or repel depending on framing) |

**Legislative strategy**:

- Begin with highest-consensus items (institutional compliance support, ombudsperson)
- Use CHIPS and Science Act reauthorization as a vehicle for multiple provisions
- Build bipartisan coalitions by combining security-strengthening measures with civil rights protections
- Engage university lobby (AAU, APLU, ACE) and scientific societies (AAAS, APS) as key advocates
- Frame reforms as improving security effectiveness, not weakening enforcement

**Milestones**:

- Month 6-8: Bills introduced in both chambers
- Month 9-12: Committee hearings and markup
- Month 12-18: Floor votes and conference

### Phase 3: Institutional Implementation (12-36 Months)

These actions depend on prior executive or legislative steps and require sustained institutional effort.

| Action | Responsible Parties | Prerequisites | Timeline |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| Deploy unified disclosure system | NSF/OSTP with agency partners | Standardized definitions, pilot results | 18-24 months |
| Distribute compliance grants | NSF | Appropriations | 12-18 months |
| Stand up Research Security Ombudsperson office | OSTP or independent agency | Authorizing legislation | 12-18 months |
| Implement risk-tiered disclosure at all agencies | All federal funding agencies | Tier designations finalized, forms developed | 18-30 months |
| Reform PP 10043 (replace with individual screening) | State/DHS | Policy review completion, screening protocol development | 12-18 months |
| Deploy model institutional compliance programs | Universities with federal support | Compliance grants, model program development | 18-36 months |

**Milestones**:

- Month 12: First compliance grants distributed
- Month 18: Unified disclosure system deployed; Ombudsperson operational
- Month 24: Risk-tiered disclosure fully implemented
- Month 30: Individual screening replaces PP 10043
- Month 36: Model compliance programs operational at 100+ institutions

### Phase 4: International Coordination (18-60 Months)

These actions require diplomatic engagement and multilateral negotiation.

| Action | Forum | Participants | Timeline |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Five Eyes research security working group | Five Eyes Intelligence Partnership | US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand | 18-24 months |
| Harmonized disclosure standards | Bilateral negotiations | Five Eyes + EU, Japan, South Korea | 24-36 months |
| Mutual recognition framework | Multilateral agreement | Allied nations | 30-48 months |
| Shared debarment database | Five Eyes + partners | Allied nations with data protection agreements | 36-48 months |
| Streamlined researcher visa processing | Bilateral agreements | Allied nations | 36-60 months |

**Milestones**:

- Month 24: Five Eyes working group operational
- Month 36: First harmonized disclosure standards adopted
- Month 48: Mutual recognition framework piloted
- Month 60: Comprehensive allied research security framework operational

## Critical Path

The following elements are on the critical path -- delays in any of these will delay the overall reform timeline:

1. **Attorney General behavior-based investigation memorandum** (Phase 1): Sets the enforcement framework that all other reforms build on
2. **Standardized definitions** (Phase 1): Required before unified disclosure or risk tiering can proceed
3. **Appropriations for institutional compliance** (Phase 2): Without funding, institutional implementation cannot proceed
4. **Risk tier designations** (Phase 2-3): Determines which research areas face enhanced vs. standard requirements
5. **Allied-nation agreement on harmonized standards** (Phase 4): Prevents forum-shopping and enables mutual recognition

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Major espionage case undermines reform momentum | Moderate | High | Pre-position messaging that calibrated approaches catch genuine threats more effectively |
| Political shift toward China hawkishness | Moderate | High | Build bipartisan coalition early; frame reforms as security-enhancing |
| Agency resistance to standardization | High | Moderate | Use OMB and OSTP authority to compel coordination; build on existing NSPM-33 framework |
| University compliance fatigue | Moderate | Moderate | Front-load compliance support funding; design minimal-burden systems |
| Allied-nation negotiation delays | High | Low-Moderate | Proceed with domestic reforms independently; international coordination is additive |
| Insufficient appropriations | Moderate | Moderate | Start with administrative actions that require no new funding; build the case for appropriations through pilot results |
| Researcher skepticism (reforms seen as inadequate) | Moderate | Low | Engage scientific societies in design; demonstrate early wins |

## Contingency Plans

### If Congress Does Not Act

Many reforms can proceed through executive action alone:

- Behavior-based investigation standards (AG memorandum)
- Standardized definitions and unified disclosure (interagency agreement)
- PP 10043 reform (presidential proclamation)
- International coordination (diplomatic channels)
- Limited compliance support (reprogramming within agency budgets)

**What cannot be done without legislation**: Formal due process protections, mandatory safe harbors, Ombudsperson with statutory authority, significant compliance funding

### If Political Climate Shifts Toward Hawkishness

- Prioritize reforms that strengthen security effectiveness (risk tiering, allied coordination) over those that limit enforcement
- Emphasize that calibrated approaches catch more genuine threats than blanket surveillance
- Use security-first framing for all proposals
- Delay more politically vulnerable reforms (PP 10043 revision, explicit anti-profiling rules) while advancing technical improvements

### If a Major Security Breach Occurs

- Issue preemptive messaging emphasizing that risk-based systems are designed to focus resources on genuine threats
- Analyze whether the breach would have been prevented by current or proposed system
- Resist pressure to abandon calibrated approaches in favor of blanket restrictions
- Use the breach as evidence for better-targeted enforcement, not broader enforcement
