# Research Security: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Research security legislation must navigate the tension between protecting sensitive research from foreign exploitation and preserving the open scientific ecosystem that sustains American innovation. The legislative approach taken here centers on two complementary bills: one establishing due process protections for researchers facing security enforcement, and one creating a comprehensive federal framework for risk-based research security compliance. Together, these bills address both the overreach that has damaged the research community and the genuine security gaps that adversaries exploit.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Research Security Due Process Act

**Purpose**: Establish formal procedural protections for researchers facing investigation, prosecution, or administrative action related to research security, preventing the pattern of wrongful career destruction documented during the China Initiative.

**Draft Text**:

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Research Security Due Process Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Department of Justice's China Initiative (2018-2022)
    produced multiple wrongful prosecutions of researchers,
    including cases where charges were dropped after it was
    determined that disclosure forms did not require the
    information alleged as omitted.
(2) Researchers investigated for research security violations
    suffer severe career consequences, including loss of
    funding, termination of employment, and deportation, even
    when investigations do not result in charges or convictions.
(3) Research security enforcement has disproportionately
    targeted researchers of Chinese origin and ethnicity,
    creating a climate of fear that has driven talented
    scientists out of the United States.
(4) The absence of formal due process protections in
    administrative research security enforcement has permitted
    career-ending consequences without adequate procedural
    safeguards.
(5) Protecting researchers from wrongful investigation and
    enforcement enhances national security by preserving the
    United States' ability to attract and retain the world's
    best scientific talent.

        good faith before determining whether to proceed with
        administrative action.
(b) GOOD FAITH CURE.--If a covered researcher submits corrected
    or supplemental disclosures within the 60-day period that
    substantially remedy the identified deficiency, the agency
    shall not initiate administrative action based on the
    original deficiency unless there is evidence that the
    original omission was intentional.
(c) RECORD PRESERVATION.--All notices issued under subsection
    (a) and responses received under subsection (b) shall be
    preserved and made available to the covered researcher and,
    upon request, to the Research Security Ombudsperson
    established under section 9.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Sections 1-3**: Establish findings based on documented China Initiative failures and define key terms. "Covered researcher" is defined broadly to protect the full range of federally funded researchers.
- **Section 4**: Creates a pre-investigation review panel that ensures a check on law enforcement discretion before investigations are opened on thin evidence. The exception for classified intelligence and imminent threats preserves law enforcement's ability to act quickly on genuine espionage.
- **Section 5**: Addresses the common pattern where researchers failed to disclose because forms were ambiguous, by requiring notice and an opportunity to correct before enforcement. This would have prevented several China Initiative cases.
- **Section 6**: Establishes administrative hearing rights comparable to those in other enforcement contexts. Interim suspension authority is preserved for genuine emergencies.
- **Section 7**: Codifies behavior-based investigation standards, prohibiting investigation triggers based solely on ethnicity while specifying the behavioral indicators that justify investigation.
- **Section 8**: Protects the visa status of investigated researchers, preventing the use of immigration consequences as a coercive tool.
- **Section 9**: Creates an independent ombudsperson with the authority to investigate complaints, review patterns, and report to Congress.
- **Section 10**: Provides a remedy for researchers whose careers were damaged by wrongful investigation.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Law enforcement argues pre-investigation review will impede operations | Exception for classified intelligence and imminent threats preserves operational flexibility; review panel has 30-day timeline |
| Critics argue behavior-based standards will prevent legitimate investigations | Standards require behavioral evidence, not perfection; the required bases in section 7(b) are broad |
| Immigration protections may conflict with executive authority | Provisions are limited to research security context and do not broadly restrict immigration enforcement |
| Cost of ombudsperson office and hearing system | Total annual cost of ~$25 million is minimal compared to the cost of lost talent and failed prosecutions |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Extend pre-investigation review to all research security investigations, not just grant disclosure cases
- **Fallback version**: Limit to administrative hearing rights and ombudsperson, without pre-investigation review
- **Technical addition**: Include whistleblower protections for researchers who report genuine security concerns

### Bill 2: Balanced Research Security Act

**Purpose**: Establish a comprehensive federal framework for risk-based research security, standardizing disclosure requirements, providing institutional compliance support, and coordinating allied-nation approaches while protecting open science principles.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Balanced Research Security Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds the following:
    (1) The United States maintains its global scientific
        leadership in substantial part through openness to
        international collaboration and the recruitment of the
        world's best talent regardless of national origin.
    (2) Foreign governments, particularly the People's Republic
        of China, have systematically exploited the open nature
        of the United States research enterprise to acquire
        intellectual property, recruit talent, and gain strategic
        advantage.
    (3) Existing research security policies are fragmented
        across Federal agencies, inconsistently implemented, and
        inadequately funded, creating confusion for researchers
        and institutions while failing to address genuine
        threats effectively.
    (4) The fundamental research exclusion established by
        National Security Decision Directive 189 remains sound
        policy and should be preserved.
    (5) Research security measures must be proportionate to
        actual risk and must not discriminate on the basis of
        race, ethnicity, or national origin.
(b) PURPOSE.--The purposes of this Act are--
    (1) to establish a unified, risk-based Federal framework for
        research security;
    (2) to standardize disclosure requirements across Federal
        funding agencies;
    (3) to provide Federal support for institutional compliance
        programs;
    (4) to preserve the fundamental research exclusion while
        addressing genuine security risks;
    (5) to coordinate research security efforts with allied
        nations; and
    (6) to protect against discrimination in research security
        enforcement.

    outside the classification system, and the justification
    for such restrictions.

SEC. 9. ALLIED-NATION RESEARCH SECURITY COORDINATION.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.--The Secretary of State, in coordination
    with the Director and the Director of National Intelligence,
    is authorized to negotiate and enter into agreements with
    allied nations for the purpose of coordinating research
    security efforts, including--
    (1) sharing of threat information and intelligence related
        to foreign exploitation of research;

    shall report to Congress on the status of allied-nation
    research security coordination, including agreements
    reached, challenges encountered, and recommendations for
    further action.

SEC. 10. ANTI-DISCRIMINATION REQUIREMENTS.

(a) PROHIBITION.--No Federal agency, law enforcement agency, or
    covered institution shall, in implementing this Act or any
    other research security requirement, discriminate against
    any researcher on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national
    origin.
(b) MONITORING.--The Director shall establish a monitoring
    program to assess whether research security measures are
    being applied in a discriminatory manner, including--

```

**Explanation**:

- **Sections 1-3**: Frame the legislation as serving both security and openness, with detailed definitions that clarify scope. The definition of "foreign government talent recruitment program" is carefully drafted to capture genuinely problematic programs while excluding routine international collaboration.
- **Section 4**: Creates the unified disclosure system that researchers and institutions have long requested. The tier structure calibrates requirements to risk level. The pre-population feature and help desk reduce researcher burden.
- **Section 5**: Establishes a transparent process for designating which research areas face enhanced scrutiny, with public comment and regular review to prevent both under-inclusion and over-inclusion.
- **Section 6**: Requires institutional compliance programs while providing model programs and consortium options for smaller institutions.
- **Section 7**: Provides the federal funding that universities have sought for compliance infrastructure. The safe harbor provision incentivizes good-faith institutional compliance.
- **Section 8**: Codifies the fundamental research exclusion from NSDD-189 as statutory law, protecting it from erosion through administrative action.
- **Section 9**: Authorizes the international coordination framework necessary to address threats that cross borders.
- **Section 10**: Builds anti-discrimination monitoring directly into the research security framework.
- **Section 11**: Requires a formal review of PP 10043, potentially leading to replacement with individual risk assessment.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Agencies resist uniform disclosure | Mandatory adoption with OMB enforcement authority |
| Critical technology designations are politically contested | Public comment and biennial review provide accountability |
| $300 million/year for compliance grants is difficult to appropriate | Represents 0.15% of federal R&D spending; cost of inaction (talent loss) is higher |
| Fundamental research exclusion codification limits executive flexibility | Preserves classification as an alternative; does not prevent restrictions on non-fundamental research |
| PP 10043 review may be politically contentious | Framed as review and recommendation, not automatic revocation |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Mandate revocation of PP 10043 rather than review; extend safe harbor to individual researchers
- **Fallback version**: Proceed with unified disclosure and compliance grants without PP 10043 review or fundamental research codification
- **Technical addition**: Include an annual "research security burden report" quantifying the time and cost imposed on researchers by compliance requirements

## Regulatory Framework

### OSTP Research Security Implementation

**Existing Authority**: OSTP coordinates science and technology policy across the executive branch under 42 U.S.C. sections 6611-6624 and NSPM-33.

**Draft Regulation**: OSTP should issue updated implementation guidance that:

- Adopts the three-tier disclosure framework
- Publishes standardized definitions of key terms
- Establishes timelines for agency adoption of unified disclosure forms
- Creates model institutional compliance programs
- Sets metrics for measuring research security program effectiveness

**Explanation**: Much of the framework proposed in the Balanced Research Security Act can be advanced through OSTP guidance even without legislation, though statutory authority would make implementation more durable.

### Commerce Department Export Control Updates

**Existing Authority**: Bureau of Industry and Security administers the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) under the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. sections 4801-4861).

**Recommended Action**: BIS should issue a rule clarifying that the fundamental research exclusion in EAR section 734.8 applies fully to all basic research conducted at universities and federal laboratories that has not been specifically classified or restricted by contractual agreement.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **First Amendment**: Research security restrictions on publication implicate academic freedom and free speech. The fundamental research exclusion codification strengthens First Amendment protections by requiring classification as the mechanism for restricting publication.
- **Equal Protection**: Behavior-based investigation standards and anti-discrimination monitoring address Fourteenth Amendment concerns about ethnic profiling in enforcement.
- **Due Process**: The administrative hearing requirements satisfy Fifth Amendment due process requirements for government action affecting property interests (research funding) and liberty interests (reputation, employment).
- **Executive Power**: The PP 10043 review provision is legislative oversight of executive immigration authority, which is constitutionally permissible.

### Preemption Questions

- The Unified Federal Disclosure System preempts state-level disclosure requirements for federally funded research, preventing a patchwork of state obligations.
- The fundamental research exclusion codification preempts agency-level restrictions that fall short of formal classification.
- Institutional compliance requirements do not preempt state employment or civil rights law.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- Unified disclosure violations enforced through administrative consequences (funding suspension, debarment) with due process protections
- Anti-discrimination violations enforced through OSTP corrective action process and DOJ Civil Rights Division referral
- Institutional compliance failures enforced through funding conditions
- Criminal enforcement for genuine espionage and trade secret theft remains under existing statutes (Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. section 1001)

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Research Security Due Process Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Pre-investigation review bypass | Classified intelligence exception could be invoked broadly to circumvent review panel | High |
| Notice and cure gaming | Researchers could submit minimal corrections repeatedly to delay enforcement | Medium |
| Ombudsperson capture | Political appointment could result in an ombudsperson aligned with enforcement rather than oversight | Medium |
| Wrongful investigation remedy limits | Reimbursement limited to legal fees; does not cover lost research opportunities or emotional harm | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address state-level enforcement | Researchers investigated by state authorities lack federal protections | Federal legislation cannot bind state enforcement |
| Ombudsperson has advisory power only | Cannot compel changes in enforcement practice | Structural limitation to preserve separation of powers |
| No retroactive relief | Past China Initiative targets cannot benefit | Constitutional limitations on retroactive legislation |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require quarterly reporting on classified intelligence exception use to prevent abuse
2. Limit notice-and-cure to one cycle per disclosure issue per researcher
3. Require bipartisan consultation for ombudsperson appointment; establish fixed term with removal only for cause
4. Expand wrongful investigation remedy to include career restoration assistance and counseling
5. Encourage states to adopt parallel protections through model state legislation

### Balanced Research Security Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Critical technology overdesignation | Political pressure could expand critical technology areas to cover most research | High |
| Safe harbor exploitation | Institutions could maintain paper compliance while failing in practice | Medium |
| Allied-nation exemption gaming | Foreign intelligence could use allied-nation researchers as cutouts | Medium |
| Tier classification avoidance | Researchers could structure work to avoid Tier 2/3 classification | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| PP 10043 review but no mandate to act | Review could conclude without policy change | Political compromise necessary for passage |
| Compliance grant funding subject to appropriations | Congress may not fund at authorized levels | Standard appropriations process limitation |
| Does not address private sector research security | Industry research faces similar but distinct threats | Scope limited to federally funded research |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require that critical technology designations include a sunset provision requiring reaffirmation every 4 years
2. Mandate substantive compliance audits (not just paper review) as condition for safe harbor
3. Require allied-nation researchers in sensitive areas to undergo the same disclosure requirements as all other researchers
4. Establish mandatory minimum appropriations for compliance grants through authorizing committee action
5. Direct OSTP to develop voluntary guidelines for private sector research security

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Interagency coordination failure | Designate OSTP as lead with OMB budget authority to compel cooperation |
| Researcher awareness gap | Fund a national awareness campaign through NSF and professional societies |
| University compliance capacity variance | Small institution consortia and graduated implementation timelines |
| Political interference with designations | Public comment requirements and judicial review of arbitrary designations |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Critical technology area designations reviewed every 2 years with public comment
- Entire legislative framework reviewed by GAO every 5 years with report to Congress
- Authorization of appropriations expires after 5 years, requiring reauthorization
- Ombudsperson term is 5 years with Senate confirmation for reappointment
