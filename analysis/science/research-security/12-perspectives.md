# Research Security: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes research security policy through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints. Research security is an unusually cross-cutting issue where traditional left-right alignments break down -- hawks and doves exist on both sides, and the tension between security and openness does not map neatly onto partisan categories.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *States concern about protecting IP and national security, but some conservative positions appear driven more by anti-China politics than calibrated security analysis* |
| Principle consistency | *Limited government principles conflict with expanding federal surveillance of researchers; national security hawkishness overrides this inconsistency* |
| Goalpost stability | *Goalposts have shifted -- initial China Initiative framing focused on espionage, but support continued even after cases shifted to minor disclosure failures* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Tends to view research security as zero-sum: any loosening of enforcement is seen as a win for China* |

**Justification:** Conservatives are genuinely committed to national security and protecting American IP, but their positions on research security are complicated by the tension between limited-government principles and expansive security enforcement. The anti-China political dynamic introduces inconsistency, as positions sometimes shift to oppose whatever the administration proposes rather than applying consistent principles.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Republican members of Congress supported the China Initiative through its most problematic prosecutions, then criticized its termination without acknowledging failed cases*
- *Heritage Foundation and Hudson Institute publications consistently advocate stronger enforcement without addressing overreach evidence*
- *Some conservative voices (Cato Institute, libertarian-leaning Republicans) have criticized profiling, showing internal diversity*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Agree that foreign threats are real and significant; disagree that enforcement has been excessive or discriminatory* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Agree on asymmetric exploitation and dual-use challenges; reject racial profiling analysis as overstated; minimize political incentive analysis* |

**Source references:**

- *Heritage Foundation, "Securing America's Research Enterprise," 2023 -- emphasizes threat severity*
- *Senate Republican Policy Committee briefings on China technology competition, 2022-2025*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Risk-Tiered Disclosure* | 6/10 | *Support tiering if it strengthens scrutiny in critical areas* | *Concern that tiering could weaken overall security posture* |
| *Standardized Federal Disclosure* | 7/10 | *Support standardization for efficiency* | *Want standards set high, not at lowest common denominator* |
| *Due Process Act* | 3/10 | *Oppose constraints on law enforcement discretion* | *Fear it would hamper genuine security investigations* |
| *Behavior-Based Standards* | 4/10 | *Skeptical of prohibiting country-of-origin considerations* | *Believe country of origin is a legitimate risk factor* |
| *Institutional Compliance Support* | 7/10 | *Support if tied to accountability* | *Oppose pure subsidies without performance requirements* |
| *PP 10043 Reform* | 2/10 | *Oppose weakening the proclamation* | *View it as essential to countering military-civil fusion* |
| *Allied Coordination* | 8/10 | *Strongly support alliance-based security* | *Want allies to match U.S. enforcement levels* |
| *Research Security Ombudsperson* | 3/10 | *View as unnecessary bureaucracy that will undermine enforcement* | *Concern about civil-rights-oriented oversight of security operations* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Security Due Process Act* | 3/10 | *Opposes constraints on investigation and prosecution* | *Fear it creates procedural obstacles that adversaries will exploit* |
| *Balanced Research Security Act* | 5/10 | *Supports some elements (unified disclosure, compliance grants) but opposes others (PP 10043 review, anti-discrimination monitoring)* | *Wants security provisions without civil rights overlay* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Strengthen enforcement authority, not weaken it: expand FBI campus presence, increase penalties for disclosure failures
- Mandatory screening of all researchers from countries of concern, not just behavioral triggers
- Extend export controls to more research areas, particularly AI and quantum computing
- Increase funding for counterintelligence operations targeting academic espionage
- Maintain and potentially expand PP 10043

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Populist (economic nationalism, anti-China), Religious Right (deference to authority)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (agree on institutional compliance and standardization), Libertarian (agree on limiting government overreach in some contexts)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (fundamental disagreements on profiling and enforcement), Democratic Socialist (oppose security state expansion)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuine concern about both civil rights and security, though emphasis shifts depending on political context* |
| Principle consistency | *Civil rights and equality principles consistently applied; national security positions sometimes defer to party leadership* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions have been relatively stable: supported China Initiative termination, advocate disclosure reform with anti-discrimination protections* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Generally seeks both/and solutions rather than zero-sum framing* |

**Justification:** Liberals have been relatively consistent in advocating for balanced approaches that address both security threats and civil rights concerns. The Biden administration's NSPM-33 and China Initiative termination reflected mainstream liberal positions. Some inconsistency arises from the desire to appear tough on China competition while also protecting civil liberties.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Democratic senators led calls for China Initiative review while simultaneously supporting CHIPS Act security provisions*
- *Biden OSTP guidance consistently framed as balancing security and openness*
- *Liberal think tanks (CAP, Brookings) have produced nuanced analyses acknowledging both threats and overreach*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | *Substantially agree with the analysis of both threats and overreach; may emphasize chilling effects more than threat severity* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | *Agree on most root causes; particularly strong agreement on racial profiling dynamics and political incentive misalignment* |

**Source references:**

- *Center for American Progress, "Research Security Without Racial Profiling," 2022*
- *Brookings Institution analysis of NSPM-33 implementation, 2023*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Risk-Tiered Disclosure* | 8/10 | *Strong support for risk-proportionate approach* | *Want to ensure tiers don't become tools for discrimination* |
| *Standardized Federal Disclosure* | 9/10 | *Strong support; reduces burden and confusion* | *Want clear, accessible forms that don't trap researchers* |
| *Due Process Act* | 8/10 | *Strong support for procedural protections* | *Want protections strong enough to prevent repeat of China Initiative overreach* |
| *Behavior-Based Standards* | 9/10 | *Strong support for eliminating profiling* | *Want enforceable standards with consequences for violations* |
| *Institutional Compliance Support* | 8/10 | *Support federal funding for compliance* | *Want funding to be equitable across institution types* |
| *PP 10043 Reform* | 8/10 | *Support replacing blanket ban with individual screening* | *Want reform to be part of broader immigration reform* |
| *Allied Coordination* | 7/10 | *Support multilateral approach* | *Want to ensure allied coordination doesn't become a new vehicle for discrimination* |
| *Research Security Ombudsperson* | 9/10 | *Strong support for independent oversight* | *Want ombudsperson with real authority, not just advisory role* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Security Due Process Act* | 8/10 | *Strongly supports due process protections and ombudsperson* | *May want stronger remedies for wrongful investigation* |
| *Balanced Research Security Act* | 8/10 | *Supports comprehensive framework; appreciates anti-discrimination provisions* | *May want PP 10043 revocation rather than review* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Strengthen anti-discrimination monitoring with enforcement teeth
- Expand wrongful investigation remedies to include compensatory damages
- Create a formal apology and restoration process for China Initiative targets
- Mandate diversity and inclusion training for FBI agents conducting research security investigations
- Link compliance funding to institutional diversity commitments

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (civil rights focus), Centrist (pragmatic balance), Democratic Socialist (opposition to security overreach)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (agree on civil liberties), Conservative (agree on institutional compliance framework)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (disagree on immigration and international openness)

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuinely motivated by anti-racism and opposition to security state expansion; these are core principles consistently applied* |
| Principle consistency | *Principles of racial justice and anti-imperialism consistently applied to research security; less consistent on whether the security threat itself is real* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable positions: oppose profiling, support researcher protections, skeptical of security framing* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Tends to view security measures as inherently threatening to civil liberties rather than seeking integration* |

**Justification:** Progressives bring a consistent anti-profiling, anti-surveillance lens to research security. This produces principled positions on civil rights but sometimes leads to understating genuine security threats. The consistency of the racial justice framework makes them predictable coalition partners on civil rights provisions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Congressional Progressive Caucus members were among the first to call for China Initiative termination*
- *Progressive organizations (AAJC, Brennan Center) produced early and consistent critiques of enforcement overreach*
- *Some progressive voices have been reluctant to acknowledge the legitimacy of any China-focused security concern*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | *Strong agreement on overreach and chilling effects; may understate the genuine security threat* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | *Strong agreement on racial profiling dynamics, political incentives, and law enforcement institutional dynamics* |

**Source references:**

- *Brennan Center for Justice, "National Security Overreach in Academic Settings," 2022*
- *Asian Americans Advancing Justice, "Research Without Suspicion" campaign, 2023*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Risk-Tiered Disclosure* | 6/10 | *Cautious support if lowest tier is truly minimal* | *Concern that any tiering system could be weaponized against researchers of color* |
| *Standardized Federal Disclosure* | 7/10 | *Support if it reduces overall burden* | *Skeptical of any surveillance infrastructure expansion* |
| *Due Process Act* | 9/10 | *Strong support; may want even stronger protections* | *Want protections to be enforceable, not aspirational* |
| *Behavior-Based Standards* | 10/10 | *Strongest possible support for anti-profiling measures* | *Want explicit prohibition with criminal penalties for violations* |
| *Institutional Compliance Support* | 5/10 | *Cautious; concerned about creating surveillance infrastructure* | *Want funding tied to anti-discrimination requirements* |
| *PP 10043 Reform* | 10/10 | *Demand immediate revocation, not review* | *View the proclamation as fundamentally discriminatory* |
| *Allied Coordination* | 5/10 | *Skeptical of security alliance expansion* | *Concerned about creating a global surveillance network targeting researchers* |
| *Research Security Ombudsperson* | 8/10 | *Support independent oversight* | *Want ombudsperson to prioritize civil rights over security cooperation* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Security Due Process Act* | 8/10 | *Strong support for due process and anti-profiling provisions; may want stronger remedies* | *Concerned that exceptions (classified intelligence, imminent threat) could swallow the rule* |
| *Balanced Research Security Act* | 6/10 | *Support anti-discrimination and fundamental research provisions; skeptical of institutional compliance expansion* | *View the security framework as potentially creating new surveillance tools* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Immediate revocation of PP 10043 without review period
- Reparations or formal restitution program for China Initiative targets
- Moratorium on all research security investigations pending comprehensive reform
- Community oversight boards for FBI campus engagement programs
- Defund counterintelligence programs that target academic institutions

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (civil rights), Democratic Socialist (anti-security-state), Civil rights organizations
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (agree on civil liberties and limiting government surveillance)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (fundamental disagreement on enforcement), Populist (opposite views on immigration and China)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuinely motivated by individual liberty and limited government; these principles apply consistently regardless of which party is in power* |
| Principle consistency | *Remarkably consistent: oppose government surveillance and overreach in research security just as in other domains* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable principles-based positions that do not shift with political winds* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Frame the issue as government vs. individual liberty rather than partisan terms* |

**Justification:** Libertarians apply their principles of limited government and individual liberty consistently to research security, opposing both government surveillance of researchers and government restrictions on international collaboration. They are among the most predictable partners because their positions derive from stable principles rather than political calculations.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Cato Institute has consistently criticized both the China Initiative and expanded disclosure requirements as government overreach*
- *Reason magazine has covered research security overreach extensively from a civil liberties perspective*
- *Libertarian positions on research security mirror their positions on surveillance, immigration, and trade*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Agree that government overreach is the primary problem; skeptical of the threat narrative as justification for expanded government power* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | *Strong agreement on law enforcement institutional dynamics, political incentive misalignment, and inadequate due process; less concerned about asymmetric exploitation as a problem requiring government solution* |

**Source references:**

- *Cato Institute, "The China Initiative and the Abuse of Federal Power," 2022*
- *Reason Foundation analysis of export control expansion impacts on research, 2023*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Risk-Tiered Disclosure* | 4/10 | *Skeptical of any government-mandated disclosure system* | *Prefer voluntary compliance and market-based IP protection* |
| *Standardized Federal Disclosure* | 3/10 | *Oppose expanding government data collection from individuals* | *Any unified system is a surveillance tool* |
| *Due Process Act* | 9/10 | *Strong support for constraining government enforcement power* | *Would prefer even stronger limits on investigation authority* |
| *Behavior-Based Standards* | 8/10 | *Support limits on investigation triggers* | *Would prefer to constrain all government investigation, not just research security* |
| *Institutional Compliance Support* | 2/10 | *Oppose federal funding for compliance infrastructure* | *View as creating government-funded surveillance apparatus within universities* |
| *PP 10043 Reform* | 10/10 | *Demand revocation; government should not restrict immigration based on group identity* | *Fundamentally oppose immigration restrictions* |
| *Allied Coordination* | 3/10 | *Skeptical of international security coordination* | *View as expanding government surveillance across borders* |
| *Research Security Ombudsperson* | 6/10 | *Cautiously support oversight of enforcement* | *Prefer eliminating the enforcement authority rather than overseeing it* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Security Due Process Act* | 7/10 | *Support due process provisions and investigation constraints; oppose creating new bureaucracy (ombudsperson)* | *Prefer smaller government, not better-overseen government* |
| *Balanced Research Security Act* | 3/10 | *Oppose comprehensive federal framework as government overreach; support fundamental research exclusion codification* | *View the overall framework as expanding government power over research* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Dramatically reduce government research security enforcement; rely on institutional self-governance
- Eliminate export controls on fundamental research entirely
- Open immigration for all researchers regardless of national origin
- Abolish PP 10043 and reduce visa restrictions broadly
- Let universities manage their own security through market incentives (reputation, IP protection)

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (civil liberties), Liberal (due process)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (agree on some aspects of limited government; disagree on security enforcement)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (opposite views on immigration and trade), Democratic Socialist (disagree on government role in funding and oversight)

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuinely motivated by constitutional text and structural analysis; positions follow logically from constitutional principles* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistent application of enumerated powers, due process, and equal protection principles to research security* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable positions rooted in constitutional text rather than political dynamics* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Seeks to balance competing constitutional interests (national security vs. individual rights) through structural mechanisms* |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists approach research security through the lens of enumerated powers, due process, and equal protection. This produces nuanced positions that support security measures grounded in congressional authorization while opposing executive overreach and enforcement that violates constitutional protections. Their text-based approach makes them relatively predictable.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Federalist Society scholars have published analyses questioning the constitutional basis for some China Initiative prosecutions*
- *Constitutional law scholars from both left and right have questioned PP 10043's legal foundation*
- *Due process concerns about administrative enforcement align with broader constitutionalist positions*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Agree that constitutional protections have been inadequately applied; focus on structural and procedural issues rather than policy substance* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | *Agree on inadequate due process and executive overreach; less engaged with racial profiling analysis; focus on structural causes rather than political dynamics* |

**Source references:**

- *Federalist Society review of research security enforcement constitutional issues, 2022*
- *Heritage Foundation constitutional analysis of executive authority in research security, 2023*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Risk-Tiered Disclosure* | 5/10 | *Acceptable if grounded in clear statutory authority* | *Must respect federalism and not impose unfunded mandates on state institutions* |
| *Standardized Federal Disclosure* | 5/10 | *Support if within enumerated powers; Spending Clause provides adequate authority* | *Concerned about federal overreach into state university governance* |
| *Due Process Act* | 8/10 | *Strong support for codifying due process protections* | *Want protections rooted in Fifth Amendment analysis* |
| *Behavior-Based Standards* | 7/10 | *Support as consistent with Fourth Amendment reasonable search standards* | *Want clear statutory basis rather than executive policy* |
| *Institutional Compliance Support* | 5/10 | *Acceptable through Spending Clause* | *Oppose unfunded mandates; support conditional spending* |
| *PP 10043 Reform* | 6/10 | *Support congressional review of executive immigration actions* | *Recognize broad executive immigration authority but support legislative guardrails* |
| *Allied Coordination* | 6/10 | *Support if achieved through treaties subject to Senate ratification* | *Oppose executive agreements that bypass Senate treaty power* |
| *Research Security Ombudsperson* | 5/10 | *Acceptable if properly authorized by Congress* | *Concerned about independence from political influence; want Appointments Clause compliance* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Security Due Process Act* | 7/10 | *Support due process codification; appreciate constitutional grounding* | *Want to ensure the Review Panel and Ombudsperson comply with Appointments Clause* |
| *Balanced Research Security Act* | 6/10 | *Support statutory framework over executive policy; appreciate fundamental research exclusion codification* | *Concerned about delegation of authority to OSTP for critical technology designations* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Require all research security enforcement to be grounded in explicit statutory authority, not executive orders
- Subject PP 10043 to formal congressional review under the Congressional Review Act
- Require Senate confirmation for Research Security Ombudsperson (already in proposed bill)
- Establish judicial review of critical technology area designations
- Ensure allied-nation agreements go through treaty process

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (constitutional limits), Conservative (some overlap on structural issues)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (agree on due process), Centrist (agree on rule-of-law framework)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (less concerned with constitutional structure), Democratic Socialist (different view of federal power)

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *States concern about protecting American workers and taxpayers, but positions often driven by anti-China and anti-immigration sentiment rather than calibrated policy analysis* |
| Principle consistency | *Economic nationalism principles applied inconsistently: support restricting foreign researchers but also support research that benefits American industry* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions shift based on political dynamics; initially focused on espionage, later expanded to oppose any international research collaboration* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Strongly zero-sum: any benefit to foreign researchers or nations is seen as a loss for Americans* |

**Justification:** Populist positions on research security are among the least consistent because they are driven by multiple, sometimes conflicting impulses: anti-elite suspicion of universities, anti-China nationalism, pro-worker economic anxiety, and anti-immigration sentiment. These impulses can point in different directions depending on the specific issue.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Populist politicians supported the China Initiative but showed little interest in due process concerns or researcher welfare*
- *Economic nationalism drives support for export controls but also opposition to federal spending on university compliance*
- *Anti-elite sentiment leads to distrust of both university administrators and federal bureaucrats*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | *Agree that China is stealing research; disagree that enforcement has been excessive; dismiss chilling effects as elite whining* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | *Agree on asymmetric exploitation; reject racial profiling analysis; attribute problems to university naivete and elite globalism* |

**Source references:**

- *Various populist media outlets framing research security as China "stealing from American taxpayers"*
- *Congressional populist caucus statements on China competition, 2022-2025*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Risk-Tiered Disclosure* | 4/10 | *All research involving foreign nationals should face enhanced scrutiny* | *Tiering seen as creating loopholes* |
| *Standardized Federal Disclosure* | 5/10 | *Support if it catches more violations* | *Want maximum transparency from researchers* |
| *Due Process Act* | 2/10 | *Oppose "coddling" researchers who take foreign money* | *View due process protections as obstacles to enforcement* |
| *Behavior-Based Standards* | 2/10 | *Country of origin should be a valid investigation factor* | *View anti-profiling measures as political correctness* |
| *Institutional Compliance Support* | 3/10 | *Oppose giving more taxpayer money to wealthy universities* | *Anti-elite distrust of university administrators* |
| *PP 10043 Reform* | 1/10 | *Maintain and expand restrictions on Chinese students* | *Broader anti-immigration stance* |
| *Allied Coordination* | 4/10 | *Skeptical of multilateral agreements generally* | *Prefer unilateral American action* |
| *Research Security Ombudsperson* | 2/10 | *View as bureaucratic obstacle to protecting American interests* | *Distrust oversight mechanisms that might limit enforcement* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Security Due Process Act* | 2/10 | *Opposes as weakening enforcement against foreign threats* | *Views due process protections for researchers as elitist* |
| *Balanced Research Security Act* | 3/10 | *Supports some compliance measures but opposes PP 10043 review and anti-discrimination provisions* | *Wants maximum enforcement without civil rights constraints* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Ban all foreign government-funded researchers from accessing federally funded research
- Expand PP 10043 to cover additional countries
- Require all federally funded research to be conducted by U.S. citizens
- Impose tariffs on countries that engage in research theft
- Defund universities that maintain partnerships with Chinese institutions

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (anti-China), Religious Right (deference to authority)
- **Potential bridges:** Democratic Socialist (agree on anti-elite sentiment; disagree on most specifics)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal (fundamental disagreements on immigration and civil rights), Libertarian (opposite views on government restriction), Progressive (opposite views on profiling and openness)

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuinely motivated by pragmatic problem-solving and evidence-based policy* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently applies cost-benefit analysis and seeks bipartisan solutions* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions are stable around the center; adjust based on evidence rather than political dynamics* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Actively seeks positive-sum solutions that address security while preserving openness* |

**Justification:** Centrists are natural allies for balanced research security reform because their analytical framework -- weighing costs against benefits, seeking workable compromise, using evidence to guide policy -- aligns closely with the risk-based approach proposed in this analysis. Their main limitation is that centrism is politically underrepresented, making their support necessary but insufficient for legislative success.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center research on research security consistently advocates balanced approaches*
- *Centrist senators (e.g., Senate Science Committee members from both parties) have cosponsored disclosure standardization legislation*
- *University administrators and research administrators tend toward centrist positions on research security*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement with the factual analysis of both threats and overreach* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | *Agree with most root causes; may place less emphasis on racial profiling as a structural factor and more on institutional dysfunction* |

**Source references:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center, "Research Security in the Innovation Economy," 2023*
- *National Academies reports, which reflect broadly centrist expert consensus*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Risk-Tiered Disclosure* | 9/10 | *Strong support; this is exactly the kind of calibrated approach centrists favor* | *Want tiering based on evidence, not politics* |
| *Standardized Federal Disclosure* | 9/10 | *Strong support for reducing confusion and burden* | *Want implementation to be practical and well-funded* |
| *Due Process Act* | 7/10 | *Support proportionate protections; may want to limit scope to avoid hampering enforcement* | *Seek balance between researcher protection and enforcement flexibility* |
| *Behavior-Based Standards* | 7/10 | *Support in principle; want enforcement to have some flexibility* | *Concerned that overly rigid standards could hamper legitimate investigations* |
| *Institutional Compliance Support* | 9/10 | *Strong support; unfunded mandates don't work* | *Want accountability measures alongside funding* |
| *PP 10043 Reform* | 7/10 | *Support individual screening over blanket bans* | *Want to maintain the ability to restrict specific individuals based on evidence* |
| *Allied Coordination* | 9/10 | *Strong support for multilateral approach* | *Want to leverage existing alliance structures* |
| *Research Security Ombudsperson* | 7/10 | *Support oversight mechanism* | *Want it to be genuinely independent and balanced between security and rights* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Security Due Process Act* | 7/10 | *Supports core due process provisions; may want to narrow pre-investigation review to prevent overreach* | *Want balance between researcher protection and enforcement authority* |
| *Balanced Research Security Act* | 8/10 | *Strong support for comprehensive framework; appreciates tiered approach and institutional support* | *Want PP 10043 review to be genuinely open-ended, not predetermined* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Pilot program approach: test reforms at a subset of institutions before national rollout
- Independent commission (like the 9/11 Commission) to assess research security threats and overreach comprehensively
- Performance-based compliance: measure outcomes (threats detected, false positives, compliance costs) rather than process
- Graduated enforcement: warning, suspension, debarment as escalating consequences with due process at each stage

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (pragmatic reform), Constitutionalist (rule-of-law framework)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (agree on institutional compliance and allied coordination), Libertarian (agree on due process)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (resistant to nuanced approaches), Democratic Socialist (different analytical framework)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *States concern about national security and protecting American values; underlying motivations include deference to authority and concerns about atheistic Communist influence* |
| Principle consistency | *Religious liberty principles not directly applicable to research security; positions borrow from conservative security framework* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions follow conservative leadership on security issues; not independently developed* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Tends to frame in good-vs-evil terms: American science as a moral enterprise threatened by immoral foreign actors* |

**Justification:** Research security is not a primary concern for the Religious Right, and their positions largely mirror the conservative security establishment. When they engage independently, it is often through the lens of morality (research integrity as a moral obligation) or civilizational competition (defending Western scientific tradition against authoritarian exploitation). This secondary engagement makes them somewhat predictable but not deeply invested.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Religious Right media coverage of research security tends to follow conservative security framing*
- *Some unique engagement through concern about gain-of-function research and bioethics*
- *Support for restrictions on research collaboration with nations that persecute religious minorities*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Generally agree with threat narrative; less engaged with overreach analysis; may add concerns about research ethics* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Agree on foreign exploitation; attribute problems to moral failings (greed, naivete) rather than structural causes* |

**Source references:**

- *Family Research Council statements on China competition, 2022-2025*
- *Religious freedom organizations' concerns about collaboration with nations persecuting Christians*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Risk-Tiered Disclosure* | 5/10 | *Acceptable if it strengthens accountability* | *Want moral accountability, not just legal compliance* |
| *Standardized Federal Disclosure* | 6/10 | *Support transparency as a moral good* | *Want disclosure to include research ethics dimensions* |
| *Due Process Act* | 4/10 | *Cautious; support due process in principle but defer to law enforcement on security* | *Concerned about constraining security agencies* |
| *Behavior-Based Standards* | 4/10 | *Skeptical of limiting investigation tools* | *Defer to law enforcement judgment on appropriate investigation triggers* |
| *Institutional Compliance Support* | 5/10 | *Neutral; not a priority issue* | *Concerned about funding secular universities that oppose religious values* |
| *PP 10043 Reform* | 3/10 | *Oppose weakening restrictions on collaboration with authoritarian regimes* | *Frame China as a persecutor of religious minorities whose government should be restricted* |
| *Allied Coordination* | 7/10 | *Support collaboration with nations that share democratic and religious freedom values* | *Want allied coordination to exclude nations that persecute religious communities* |
| *Research Security Ombudsperson* | 4/10 | *Neutral to skeptical; not a priority* | *Concerned about creating another bureaucracy* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Security Due Process Act* | 4/10 | *Cautiously skeptical; support due process but defer to security priorities* | *Concerned about weakening enforcement against atheistic authoritarian regimes* |
| *Balanced Research Security Act* | 5/10 | *Support some elements; oppose PP 10043 review* | *Want research security framed as protecting American moral and scientific heritage* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Restrict research collaboration with nations that persecute religious minorities
- Include research ethics and bioethics dimensions in disclosure requirements
- Support faith-based universities' exemption from compliance requirements that conflict with religious mission
- Frame research integrity as a moral obligation, not just a legal one

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (security alignment), Populist (anti-China sentiment)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (shared support for institutional accountability)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (fundamental disagreements on secularism and authority), Democratic Socialist (different worldview), Libertarian (different views on government authority)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuinely motivated by opposition to security state expansion, protection of workers (including research workers), and skepticism of national security framing* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistent application of worker protection and anti-imperialism principles to research security* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable positions rooted in democratic socialist principles; not reactive to party leadership* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Frames the issue as workers (researchers) vs. institutions (government, universities, defense industry) rather than U.S. vs. China* |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists bring a worker-centered lens to research security that prioritizes researcher welfare over institutional or national security interests. This produces consistent positions on due process, anti-profiling, and workplace protections. Their skepticism of the national security framing is principled but sometimes leads to understating genuine threats.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Democratic socialist publications (Jacobin, Current Affairs) have covered research security primarily through the lens of worker exploitation and racial profiling*
- *DSA-aligned academics have been vocal in opposing security enforcement as a tool of oppression*
- *Consistent support for international solidarity among researchers across national boundaries*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Strong agreement on overreach and discrimination; skeptical of threat narrative as cover for expanding security state* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | *Strong agreement on political incentives, law enforcement dynamics, and institutional failures; add class analysis of who benefits from security enforcement* |

**Source references:**

- *Jacobin coverage of China Initiative as security state overreach, 2021-2023*
- *Academic union (UAW, GEO) statements on researcher protections, 2022-2025*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Risk-Tiered Disclosure* | 5/10 | *Cautious; any surveillance infrastructure can be turned against workers* | *Prefer minimal disclosure with strong worker protections* |
| *Standardized Federal Disclosure* | 5/10 | *Acceptable if it reduces burden on individual researchers* | *Oppose any system that makes researchers agents of the security state* |
| *Due Process Act* | 9/10 | *Strong support; researchers are workers who deserve protections* | *Want protections extended to all workers, not just federally funded researchers* |
| *Behavior-Based Standards* | 9/10 | *Strong support for anti-profiling measures* | *Want standards to apply to all law enforcement, not just research security* |
| *Institutional Compliance Support* | 4/10 | *Skeptical of funding university administrations to surveil their own employees* | *Want any compliance funding to include worker representation in oversight* |
| *PP 10043 Reform* | 10/10 | *Demand immediate revocation; oppose all nationality-based immigration restrictions* | *View PP 10043 as racist and imperialist* |
| *Allied Coordination* | 3/10 | *Oppose expansion of international security coordination* | *View "allied coordination" as extending the security state globally* |
| *Research Security Ombudsperson* | 7/10 | *Support oversight of enforcement* | *Want ombudsperson to be accountable to researchers, not government* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Research Security Due Process Act* | 8/10 | *Strong support for due process and anti-profiling; would strengthen remedies* | *Want protections to apply to all researchers, not just federally funded* |
| *Balanced Research Security Act* | 4/10 | *Support anti-discrimination and fundamental research provisions; oppose expanded compliance infrastructure* | *View the overall framework as legitimizing security state expansion into academia* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Democratize research security governance: give researchers and their unions a vote on security policies
- Fund research security through defense budget reductions, not new appropriations
- Replace institutional compliance with researcher-controlled oversight committees
- Revoke PP 10043 immediately and provide immigration pathway for affected students
- Establish public ownership of federally funded research results to reduce IP theft incentives
- International researcher solidarity networks as an alternative to government security coordination

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (anti-profiling, anti-security state), Liberal (civil rights)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (agree on limiting government surveillance; disagree on public funding)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (opposite views on security state and enforcement), Populist (different views on immigration and international solidarity), Religious Right (different worldview)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| *Due Process Protections* | *Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist* | *Religious Right* | *Conservative, Populist* |
| *Behavior-Based Standards* | *Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist* | *Conservative, Religious Right* | *Populist* |
| *Standardized Disclosure* | *Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Religious Right* | *Constitutionalist, Populist, Democratic Socialist* | *Libertarian* |
| *Institutional Compliance* | *Conservative, Liberal, Centrist* | *Progressive, Constitutionalist, Religious Right* | *Libertarian, Populist, Democratic Socialist* |
| *PP 10043 Reform* | *Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Democratic Socialist* | *Constitutionalist* | *Conservative, Populist, Religious Right* |
| *Allied Coordination* | *Conservative, Liberal, Centrist, Religious Right* | *Progressive, Constitutionalist* | *Libertarian, Populist, Democratic Socialist* |

**Key insight:** Due process protections and behavior-based standards have the broadest coalition support (6/9 perspectives at 5+), making them the most viable entry point for reform. Standardized disclosure and allied coordination command strong but different coalitions. PP 10043 reform is deeply polarizing and should be pursued separately from the core reform package.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Security Through Fairness*

**Bridges:** *Liberal + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Libertarian + Progressive*

**Core Agreement:** *Effective research security requires fair, consistent, and transparent enforcement that commands the trust of the research community. Overreach undermines security by driving talent away.*

**Policy Description:**

Combine the due process protections from the Research Security Due Process Act with the standardized disclosure and institutional compliance provisions from the Balanced Research Security Act, while excluding the more polarizing provisions (PP 10043 review, comprehensive anti-discrimination monitoring). The package would include:

- Pre-investigation review for grant disclosure cases
- Notice and opportunity to cure for disclosure deficiencies
- Administrative hearing rights before debarment
- Behavior-based investigation standards
- Unified federal disclosure system
- Research Security Ombudsperson
- Institutional compliance grants

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | *Due process protections and behavior-based standards address discrimination concerns* |
| Centrist | *Risk-based framework with institutional support creates workable, evidence-based policy* |
| Constitutionalist | *Statutory codification of due process and investigation standards provides constitutional grounding* |
| Libertarian | *Constrains government enforcement power and establishes procedural protections* |
| Progressive | *Behavior-based standards and ombudsperson address profiling; due process protects researchers* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | *PP 10043 reform not included; anti-discrimination monitoring less comprehensive* |
| Centrist | *Institutional compliance may be more expensive than preferred* |
| Constitutionalist | *Accepts expanded federal role in research governance* |
| Libertarian | *Accepts continued federal disclosure requirements and compliance infrastructure* |
| Progressive | *Does not address PP 10043; compliance grants fund institutional surveillance capacity* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *High. The coalition is composed entirely of perspectives rated 4+ for consistency, meaning positions are unlikely to shift after agreement. The absence of low-consistency partners reduces the risk of coalition collapse.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Legislation through Senate Science Committee and House Science Committee, with bipartisan cosponsorship. University lobby (AAU, APLU) provides advocacy support. Can be attached to CHIPS Act reauthorization or standalone.*

---

### Compromise 2: *Compliance Without Coercion*

**Bridges:** *Conservative + Centrist + Liberal + Religious Right*

**Core Agreement:** *Federal research security requires standardized institutional compliance programs with adequate federal funding and accountability measures. Both security and administrative efficiency are improved by consistent standards.*

**Policy Description:**

Focus narrowly on the least controversial elements: standardized disclosure, institutional compliance programs with federal funding, and allied-nation coordination. Exclude due process reforms, anti-profiling provisions, and PP 10043 review. The package would include:

- Unified federal disclosure system with risk-tiered requirements
- Institutional compliance grants ($300 million/year)
- Model compliance programs developed by OSTP
- Safe harbor for institutions with conforming programs
- Allied-nation research security coordination framework
- Fundamental research exclusion codification

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | *Strengthens institutional accountability; allied coordination addresses threats multilaterally* |
| Centrist | *Comprehensive, evidence-based framework with practical funding* |
| Liberal | *Reduces researcher burden through standardization; preserves fundamental research exclusion* |
| Religious Right | *Supports institutional accountability and allied-nation values-based coordination* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | *Accepts federal spending on university compliance; does not expand enforcement authority* |
| Centrist | *Does not include due process reforms or anti-profiling measures* |
| Liberal | *Due process and anti-discrimination provisions deferred; PP 10043 not addressed* |
| Religious Right | *Accepts federal oversight of research institutions* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 2/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *Moderate. The inclusion of Conservative (3/5 consistency) and Religious Right (3/5 consistency) introduces some instability. However, the narrow scope and concrete deliverables (funding, standardization) reduce grounds for defection.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Appropriations process for compliance grants; standalone legislation for unified disclosure. University lobby and defense industry provide bipartisan support. Most likely to pass in current political environment.*

---

### Compromise 3: *Researcher Protection Coalition*

**Bridges:** *Progressive + Liberal + Libertarian + Democratic Socialist + Constitutionalist*

**Core Agreement:** *Individual researchers are the most vulnerable actors in research security enforcement and deserve robust protections against government overreach, regardless of broader policy disagreements.*

**Policy Description:**

Focus exclusively on researcher protection measures: due process, anti-profiling, wrongful investigation remedy, visa protection, and PP 10043 reform. Do not include institutional compliance, standardized disclosure, or allied coordination. The package would include:

- Research Security Due Process Act in full
- PP 10043 revocation and replacement with individual screening
- Expanded wrongful investigation remedies
- Immigration protections for investigated researchers
- Behavior-based investigation standards with enforcement penalties

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Progressive | *Strong anti-profiling measures; PP 10043 revocation; worker protection framework* |
| Liberal | *Comprehensive due process; addresses China Initiative legacy; immigration protections* |
| Libertarian | *Maximum constraints on government enforcement power; immigration liberalization* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Researcher protection as worker protection; anti-security-state framework* |
| Constitutionalist | *Constitutional due process codified; limits on executive power* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Progressive | *Does not defund enforcement entirely or establish moratorium on investigations* |
| Liberal | *Does not include institutional compliance funding or allied coordination* |
| Libertarian | *Accepts continued government enforcement authority (constrained but not eliminated)* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Does not democratize research governance or redirect defense funding* |
| Constitutionalist | *Accepts some constraints on executive immigration authority* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *High consistency across all coalition members. However, this coalition lacks the Conservative and Centrist support typically needed for legislation to pass. Viable primarily as advocacy pressure or as provisions added to larger bills.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Difficult as standalone legislation without bipartisan support. Most effective as amendments to must-pass legislation (NDAA, appropriations) or as executive action (PP 10043 reform). Judicial challenges to enforcement overreach can also advance these goals.*

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

**Compromise 1 (Security Through Fairness)** represents the most viable path because it commands a five-perspective coalition composed entirely of highly consistent partners. The combination of due process protections (appealing to liberals, progressives, libertarians, and constitutionalists) with standardized compliance (appealing to centrists and moderately to conservatives) creates a package with both principled and practical appeal.

The critical swing perspectives are **Centrist** and **Constitutionalist**, whose support enables bipartisan framing and constitutional credibility. Engaging these perspectives requires maintaining the risk-based, evidence-driven approach and ensuring that reforms are framed as improving security effectiveness rather than weakening enforcement.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Conservative opposition to due process provisions**: Conservatives view constraints on investigation and prosecution as weakening security. Overcoming this requires demonstrating that the China Initiative's failed prosecutions wasted resources and that pre-investigation review would focus enforcement on genuine threats.

2. **Populist opposition to any reform perceived as "soft on China"**: Populist perspectives are unlikely coalition partners and may actively oppose reform. The strategy should be to neutralize rather than persuade them, by ensuring that reforms cannot be credibly characterized as weakening enforcement against genuine espionage.

3. **PP 10043 polarization**: Including PP 10043 reform in any legislative package risks losing conservative and populist support without gaining votes that are not already committed. The strategic recommendation is to pursue PP 10043 reform through executive action rather than legislation.

### Low Consistency Partners

**Populist (2/5)** and **Conservative (3/5)** perspectives are the least consistent on this issue and the most likely to defect from any coalition. For the Populist perspective, the driving force is anti-China sentiment rather than calibrated policy analysis, making their positions reactive and unpredictable. For the Conservative perspective, the tension between limited-government principles and national-security hawkishness creates internal inconsistency.

**Strategy for low-consistency partners:**

- Do not rely on their support for core provisions
- Design reforms so that their opposition does not prevent passage
- Include provisions they can claim credit for (standardized disclosure, allied coordination) to reduce active opposition
- Engage conservative think tanks (Cato, AEI) that may be more consistent than conservative politicians

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with Compromise 1** as the primary legislative strategy, building a five-perspective coalition around due process and standardized compliance
2. **Pursue Compromise 2** as a fallback if Compromise 1 cannot secure enough conservative support, accepting a narrower package focused on compliance standardization and funding
3. **Advance Compromise 3** through non-legislative channels (executive action, judicial challenges, advocacy pressure) to protect individual researchers
4. **Pursue PP 10043 reform** through executive action rather than legislation to avoid poisoning broader reform efforts
5. **Build the evidence base** continuously: quantify chilling effects, track enforcement demographics, and document the competitive cost of overreach to strengthen the case for reform over time
