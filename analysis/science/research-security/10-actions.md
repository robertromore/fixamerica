# Research Security: Actions

## Overview

Research security reform requires action from multiple actors -- federal policymakers, institutional leaders, individual researchers, and engaged citizens. This document outlines concrete steps each group can take to advance the balanced approach described in [Solutions](07-solutions.md). Actions are organized by actor and prioritized by impact and feasibility.

## For Individual Researchers

### Immediate Actions

1. **Understand your disclosure obligations**: Read your funding agency's current disclosure requirements carefully. If anything is unclear, contact your institution's sponsored programs office *before* submitting proposals.

2. **Disclose proactively and completely**: When in doubt, disclose. Over-disclosure protects you far more than under-disclosure. Document your disclosures with timestamps and copies.

3. **Maintain records of international activities**: Keep a running log of international collaborations, travel, funding, and affiliations. Update it at least annually. This protects you if questions arise later.

4. **Know your rights**: If contacted by the FBI or any law enforcement agency, you have the right to consult an attorney before answering questions. Your institution may provide legal counsel. Exercise this right.

5. **Report concerns about profiling**: If you or colleagues experience investigation or scrutiny that appears based on ethnicity rather than behavior, report it to your institution's civil rights office and to relevant advocacy organizations (AAJC, Committee of 100, APA Justice).

### Advocacy Actions

1. **Engage with professional societies**: Join and support scientific societies that advocate for balanced research security policy (APS, AAAS, IEEE, etc.). Attend policy sessions at professional conferences.

2. **Provide testimony and input**: Respond to federal requests for comment on research security policy. Agencies are required to consider public input during rulemaking.

3. **Share your experience**: If you have experienced the chilling effects of security enforcement, consider sharing your story (appropriately and with legal guidance) with journalists, congressional offices, and advocacy organizations.

4. **Mentor international colleagues**: If you are a senior researcher, actively mentor and support international colleagues navigating the security landscape. Your institutional knowledge and social capital can make a significant difference.

5. **Support due process protections**: Advocate within your institution and professional community for formal due process protections for accused researchers.

## For University Administrators and Leaders

### Institutional Capacity

1. **Invest in compliance infrastructure**: Establish or strengthen a research security office with dedicated staff, clear authority, and adequate resources. Do not simply add compliance duties to existing offices without additional capacity.

2. **Develop institutional compliance programs**: Create clear policies and procedures for foreign engagement, disclosure, and risk management. Adopt model programs published by AAU, APLU, or COGR as starting points.

3. **Provide researcher support**: Offer accessible training on disclosure requirements, legal consultation for faculty facing questions, and a confidential channel for reporting concerns.

4. **Conduct risk assessments**: Systematically assess which research areas and partnerships carry elevated security risk, and target enhanced compliance efforts accordingly rather than applying uniform restrictions.

5. **Protect faculty under investigation**: Establish policies that prevent premature employment actions against faculty who are under investigation but not charged or convicted. Provide legal representation and ensure accused faculty retain their positions and benefits pending resolution.

### Advocacy Actions

1. **Lobby for federal compliance funding**: Work through AAU, APLU, ACE, and COGR to advocate for dedicated federal funding for institutional research security infrastructure.

2. **Push for standardized disclosure**: Advocate through institutional channels for uniform federal disclosure requirements that replace the current patchwork.

3. **Oppose unfunded mandates**: Resist federal security requirements that do not come with implementation funding or clear guidance.

4. **Support anti-profiling measures**: Publicly commit to opposing ethnicity-based investigation triggers and support faculty who raise concerns about discriminatory enforcement.

5. **Engage with allied institutions internationally**: Participate in international university networks developing shared research security approaches.

## For Federal Agency Leaders

### Policy Implementation

1. **Complete NSPM-33 implementation**: Finalize standardized disclosure forms, definitions, and compliance expectations across all funding agencies.

2. **Adopt risk-tiered approaches**: Implement tiered disclosure requirements calibrated to research sensitivity rather than applying uniform requirements across all funded research.

3. **Fund institutional compliance**: Allocate dedicated funds (separate from research grants) for institutional research security infrastructure.

4. **Establish clear consequences graduated by severity**: Develop a range of administrative consequences that distinguishes between inadvertent disclosure errors and deliberate fraud.

5. **Coordinate with sister agencies**: Participate actively in interagency working groups to ensure consistent standards and avoid contradictory requirements.

### Enforcement Reform

1. **Adopt behavior-based investigation standards**: Issue guidance that prohibits opening investigations based solely on ethnicity, national origin, or country of academic training.

2. **Create pre-investigation review panels**: Require expert review before opening investigations of researchers based on grant disclosure issues.

3. **Report enforcement demographics**: Publish annual data on research security investigations by race, ethnicity, national origin, research field, and outcome.

4. **Support due process protections**: Implement administrative hearing requirements before career-altering actions like debarment.

5. **Engage the scientific community**: Establish advisory committees that include active researchers (not just administrators) to inform security policy development.

## For Members of Congress

### Legislative Priorities

1. **Pass the Research Security Due Process Act**: Establish formal procedural protections for researchers facing investigation or administrative action.

2. **Fund institutional compliance programs**: Appropriate dedicated funds for university research security infrastructure through NSF or standalone legislation.

3. **Establish a Research Security Ombudsperson**: Create an independent office to receive complaints, review enforcement patterns, and advise Congress.

4. **Mandate demographic reporting**: Require DOJ and FBI to report annually on research security investigation demographics and outcomes.

5. **Review Presidential Proclamation 10043**: Hold hearings on the proclamation's impact and consider legislation mandating individual risk assessment as a replacement for blanket bans.

### Oversight Actions

1. **Hold hearings on enforcement patterns**: Examine whether research security enforcement exhibits patterns of ethnic profiling.

2. **Request GAO studies**: Commission GAO analysis of NSPM-33 implementation progress, compliance costs, and chilling effects.

3. **Engage with allied parliaments**: Coordinate with counterparts in allied nations on shared research security challenges.

4. **Protect the fundamental research exclusion**: Resist proposals to extend export controls to fundamental research results, which would be unenforceable and counterproductive.

5. **Monitor agency coordination**: Ensure that interagency efforts to standardize disclosure are progressing and that agencies are not creating new inconsistencies.

## For Concerned Citizens

### Learn and Engage

1. **Understand the issue**: Read this analysis and the resources listed in [Resources](09-resources.md). Understand that research security involves genuine threats *and* genuine overreach, and that simplistic positions on either side are inadequate.

2. **Contact your representatives**: Write to your members of Congress expressing support for balanced research security reform. Emphasize that both security and openness serve American interests.

3. **Support affected communities**: If anti-Asian discrimination in your community is linked to research security rhetoric, speak up. Support organizations like AAJC and APA Justice.

4. **Engage with local universities**: If your community hosts a research university, engage with its public forums on research security and international collaboration.

5. **Vote for nuance**: Support candidates who demonstrate understanding of the complexity of research security rather than those who offer simplistic "tough" or "soft" positions.

### Stay Informed

1. **Follow quality reporting**: Subscribe to *Science*, *Nature*, *Inside Higher Ed*, and the reporting of journalists covering this beat.

2. **Attend public events**: National Academies, AAAS, and other organizations hold public events on research security that are often available online.

3. **Share balanced information**: When discussing research security on social media or in conversation, emphasize the full picture rather than amplifying only the threat narrative or only the discrimination narrative.
