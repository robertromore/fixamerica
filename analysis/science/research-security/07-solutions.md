# Research Security: Solutions

## Overview

Effective research security policy must simultaneously accomplish three objectives: protect genuinely sensitive research from foreign exploitation, preserve the open scientific ecosystem that sustains American innovation, and prevent discriminatory enforcement that drives talent away. The solutions proposed here are organized around a risk-based framework that calibrates security measures to actual threat levels rather than applying blanket restrictions across all research.

## Solution Framework

### Guiding Principles

1. **Risk proportionality**: Security measures should be proportional to the sensitivity of the research and the credibility of the threat
2. **Behavior-based enforcement**: Investigations should be triggered by suspicious behavior, not by ethnicity, national origin, or country of academic training
3. **Institutional responsibility**: Compliance burdens should fall primarily on institutions, not individual researchers
4. **Due process**: Researchers facing investigation deserve procedural protections proportionate to the consequences they face
5. **Transparency**: Security policies should be public, clear, and consistently applied
6. **International coordination**: The U.S. should work with allied nations to develop shared frameworks rather than acting unilaterally

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Risk-Tiered Disclosure Framework

**Problem addressed**: Current disclosure requirements are inconsistent across agencies, ambiguously worded, and applied uniformly regardless of research sensitivity.

**Proposal**: Establish a three-tier disclosure system based on research sensitivity:

| Tier | Research Type | Disclosure Requirements | Review Level |
|------|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Tier 1 (Standard) | Basic research with no obvious dual-use application (pure mathematics, theoretical physics, social science) | Standard COI/COC disclosure on existing forms | Institutional review only |
| Tier 2 (Enhanced) | Research in designated sensitive technology areas (AI, quantum, biotech, advanced materials) | Full disclosure of all foreign funding, affiliations, commitments, and travel; annual update | Agency review with institutional verification |
| Tier 3 (Controlled) | Research with direct national security applications or involving controlled technologies | Tier 2 requirements plus pre-approval for foreign collaborations and pre-publication review | Agency and interagency review |

**Implementation**:

- OSTP designates which research areas fall into each tier, based on interagency assessment updated every two years
- Agencies adopt uniform disclosure forms for each tier
- Institutions receive federal support to build compliance capacity
- Individual researchers receive clear guidance on which tier applies to their work

**Evidence**: The National Academies' 2022 and 2024 reports recommend risk-based approaches. Allied nations (UK, Australia, Canada) have adopted similar tiered systems with early positive results.

### Solution 2: Standardized Federal Disclosure System

**Problem addressed**: Researchers must navigate different disclosure requirements from different agencies, often on different forms with different definitions.

**Proposal**: Create a single, interagency disclosure platform with the following features:

- **Unified form**: One disclosure form accepted by all federal agencies
- **Digital persistent identifiers**: ORCID required for all federally funded researchers, linked to disclosure records
- **Pre-populated data**: System pulls from existing databases (NIH Reporter, NSF Award Search, PubMed) to reduce researcher burden
- **Clear definitions**: Standardized definitions of "foreign component," "foreign talent recruitment program," "conflict of interest," and "conflict of commitment"
- **Audit trail**: Timestamped submission records protect researchers who disclose in good faith
- **Annual update cycle**: Annual update requirement replaces ad hoc disclosure triggers

**Implementation**:

- Build on existing NSF and NIH digital infrastructure
- Pilot with voluntary adoption, then mandate after one year
- Provide training and technical assistance to institutions
- Establish a help desk for researchers with questions about disclosure obligations

**Evidence**: GAO reports have consistently identified interagency inconsistency as a major compliance challenge. The NSPM-33 implementation guidance calls for standardization but has not achieved it.

### Solution 3: Research Security Due Process Act

**Problem addressed**: Researchers facing investigation or administrative action lack adequate procedural protections, and careers can be destroyed before any finding of wrongdoing.

**Proposal**: Establish formal due process requirements for research security enforcement:

- **Pre-investigation review**: Before opening a formal investigation of a researcher based on grant disclosure issues, DOJ must obtain concurrence from a designated review panel that includes both security and scientific expertise
- **Notice and opportunity to cure**: Researchers identified as having disclosure deficiencies must be given notice and a 60-day opportunity to correct before any enforcement action
- **Administrative hearing**: Before funding debarment, researchers are entitled to a hearing before an independent adjudicator with right to counsel
- **Immigration protection**: Visa status of researchers under investigation may not be altered until investigation concludes, absent evidence of imminent flight risk
- **Wrongful investigation remedy**: Researchers cleared after investigation may seek reimbursement of legal costs and restoration of professional standing
- **Sealed proceedings**: Investigations that do not result in charges or findings are sealed from public disclosure

**Implementation**:

- Requires legislation (see [Legislation](11-legislation.md))
- Funded through DOJ and agency budgets
- Independent adjudicators appointed through merit selection
- Annual reporting on investigation outcomes by race, ethnicity, and national origin

**Evidence**: The pattern of failed China Initiative prosecutions (Gang Chen, Hu Anming, Xiaoxing Xi) demonstrates the need for pre-investigation gatekeeping. Comparable due process protections exist in other administrative enforcement contexts (securities, environmental, labor).

### Solution 4: Behavior-Based Investigation Standards

**Problem addressed**: Research security investigations have relied heavily on demographic proxies (ethnicity, country of origin, institutional affiliation) rather than behavioral indicators of genuine security risk.

**Proposal**: Establish formal investigation trigger standards that require behavioral evidence:

**Appropriate investigation triggers**:

- Documented failure to disclose funding sources after receiving clear notice of requirements
- Evidence of undisclosed financial relationships with foreign government entities
- Unauthorized transfer of controlled or classified information
- Evidence of shadow laboratory operation
- Credible intelligence about active recruitment by a foreign intelligence service
- Repeated travel to sensitive foreign institutions without disclosure
- Significant unexplained financial transactions

**Prohibited investigation triggers (absent behavioral evidence)**:

- Ethnicity or national origin alone
- Country of academic training alone
- Attendance at conferences in countries of concern
- Routine collaboration with foreign researchers
- Publication with foreign co-authors
- Membership in professional organizations with international membership
- Family members residing in countries of concern

**Implementation**:

- DOJ and FBI adopt formal investigation guidelines incorporating these standards
- Training programs for agents and prosecutors on appropriate triggers
- Internal review of investigation openings for compliance with standards
- Annual public reporting on investigation demographics with analysis of patterns

**Evidence**: The DOJ's own post-China Initiative review acknowledged that some investigations were opened on insufficient factual bases. The FBI's own Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide already distinguishes between appropriate and inappropriate predication; this solution extends those principles to research security.

### Solution 5: Institutional Compliance Support Program

**Problem addressed**: Federal policy increasingly relies on universities to serve as the primary compliance mechanism, but provides inadequate funding, guidance, and support for this role.

**Proposal**: Establish a federal research security compliance assistance program:

- **Compliance grants**: Dedicated federal funding (separate from research grants) for institutional research security infrastructure
- **Staffing support**: Federal funding for research security officers at institutions receiving more than $50 million in annual federal research funding
- **Model compliance programs**: OSTP develops model policies, training programs, and review procedures that institutions can adapt
- **Safe harbor**: Institutions that implement approved compliance programs receive a legal safe harbor against liability for individual researcher misconduct
- **Small institution consortium**: Federal support for shared compliance services among smaller institutions that cannot individually support dedicated programs
- **Regular assessment**: Biennial federal assessment of institutional compliance programs with constructive feedback rather than punitive inspection

**Implementation**:

- Authorized through the CHIPS and Science Act or successor legislation
- Administered jointly by NSF and OSTP
- Funding at $200-300 million annually (roughly 0.1% of federal R&D spending)
- Phased implementation beginning with the largest research institutions

**Evidence**: Universities have consistently identified unfunded mandates as a barrier to effective compliance. The DOE laboratory system's compliance infrastructure, which is federally funded, provides a model for institutional support.

### Solution 6: Presidential Proclamation 10043 Reform

**Problem addressed**: PP 10043 bars Chinese students and researchers associated with institutions implementing China's military-civil fusion strategy. The proclamation is overbroad because most major Chinese universities have some MCF connection, and it does not assess individual risk.

**Proposal**: Replace the blanket ban with individual risk assessment:

- Revoke PP 10043
- Implement enhanced individual screening for visa applicants from designated institutions, based on specific risk factors (field of study, prior military service, government employment, specific program affiliations)
- Create an interagency review panel for borderline cases
- Establish an appeal mechanism for denied applicants
- Maintain the ability to deny visas to specific individuals based on credible intelligence

**Implementation**:

- Executive action (presidential proclamation or executive order)
- Interagency screening protocol developed by State Department, DHS, and intelligence community
- Processing time targets to prevent indefinite delays
- Annual public reporting on screening outcomes by institution and field

**Evidence**: Multiple National Academies reports have recommended individual risk assessment over blanket bans. Allied nations have implemented individual screening approaches without catastrophic security failures.

### Solution 7: Allied-Nation Research Security Coordination

**Problem addressed**: Research security threats are global, but U.S. policy is developed and implemented largely unilaterally, creating gaps and inconsistencies.

**Proposal**: Establish a multilateral research security framework among allied nations:

- **Shared threat assessment**: Regular intelligence sharing on research security threats among Five Eyes and allied partners
- **Harmonized standards**: Common disclosure requirements and compliance standards to prevent forum-shopping
- **Mutual recognition**: Allied-nation researchers treated as lower-risk for screening purposes
- **Joint enforcement**: Coordinated investigation and prosecution of cross-border research security violations
- **Researcher mobility**: Streamlined visa processing for researchers moving between allied nations
- **Information sharing**: Database of debarred or sanctioned researchers shared among allied governments

**Implementation**:

- Build on existing Five Eyes intelligence-sharing infrastructure
- Negotiate bilateral and multilateral agreements through diplomatic channels
- Pilot with Five Eyes nations, then expand to broader allied group
- Establish a permanent allied research security working group

**Evidence**: Australia's University Foreign Interference Taskforce, the UK's Research Collaboration Advice Team, and Canada's research security framework provide models for allied approaches.

### Solution 8: Research Security Ombudsperson

**Problem addressed**: Researchers who face investigation or who wish to report concerns lack a neutral, expert advocate within the federal system.

**Proposal**: Establish a federal Research Security Ombudsperson office with the following functions:

- Receive and investigate complaints from researchers about unfair treatment in security enforcement
- Provide confidential advice to researchers uncertain about disclosure obligations
- Review investigation patterns for evidence of profiling or disproportionate impact
- Mediate disputes between researchers, institutions, and agencies
- Publish annual reports on research security enforcement patterns and recommendations
- Serve as a resource for congressional oversight

**Implementation**:

- Established within OSTP or as an independent office
- Led by a presidential appointee with fixed term and removal protections
- Staffed with both security-cleared and scientific expertise
- Budget of $10-15 million annually
- Subpoena authority for investigation of complaints

**Evidence**: Inspector General offices, congressional ombudspersons, and the intelligence community's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board provide structural models.
