# Research Security: Stakeholders

## Overview

Research security policy sits at the intersection of national security, scientific enterprise, immigration, and civil rights. The stakeholder landscape is complex, with groups that hold strong but sometimes contradictory interests. Some stakeholders are directly affected by policy decisions; others wield disproportionate influence over those decisions. Understanding their positions, motivations, and power is essential to crafting workable reform.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Researchers and Faculty

**Who they are**: Approximately 300,000 federally funded principal investigators and their research teams at more than 2,500 institutions. Includes U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and foreign nationals on work or student visas.

**How they are affected**:

- Bear the primary compliance burden for disclosure requirements
- Face career-ending consequences if investigated, even without conviction
- Must navigate ambiguous rules about what collaborations are permissible
- International researchers face visa uncertainty and heightened scrutiny
- Asian and Asian American researchers face disproportionate investigation risk

**What they want**:

- Clear, consistent, and reasonable disclosure requirements
- Due process protections against wrongful investigation
- Freedom to pursue legitimate international collaboration
- Protection from ethnic profiling
- Institutional support rather than risk transfer from employers

**Power assessment**: Individually weak; collectively influential through professional societies and unions, but often slow to mobilize politically.

### International Students and Postdoctoral Researchers

**Who they are**: Approximately 400,000 international students in U.S. STEM graduate programs and roughly 60,000 postdoctoral researchers on temporary visas.

**How they are affected**:

- Subject to visa screening delays that can prevent timely enrollment or employment
- Presidential Proclamation 10043 bars certain Chinese students from U.S. entry
- May face surveillance or pressure from home governments while in the U.S.
- Career options constrained by visa status and security clearance ineligibility
- Caught between home-country obligations and U.S. disclosure requirements

**What they want**:

- Predictable visa processing and clear eligibility criteria
- Protection from both home-country coercion and U.S. overreach
- Pathways to permanent residency for those who wish to stay
- Fair treatment regardless of national origin

**Power assessment**: Very limited. Non-citizens cannot vote and have few institutional advocates. Dependent on university and employer support.

### Research Universities

**Who they are**: The approximately 130 AAU member universities and other major research institutions that receive the majority of federal research funding.

**How they are affected**:

- Must build and maintain compliance infrastructure (security officers, training programs, review processes)
- Face institutional liability for researchers' disclosure failures
- Risk losing federal funding if found non-compliant
- International student tuition revenue threatened by enrollment declines
- Competitive position affected by ability to recruit top international talent

**What they want**:

- Clear federal standards that are consistent across agencies
- Federal funding to support compliance infrastructure
- Institutional safe harbors when good-faith compliance efforts fall short
- Continued ability to recruit international students and faculty
- Protection from liability for individual researcher misconduct

**Power assessment**: Significant. AAU, APLU, and ACE are well-organized lobbying organizations with access to congressional leadership. University presidents and government relations offices actively shape legislation.

### Federal Funding Agencies (NSF, NIH, DOE, DOD)

**Who they are**: The agencies that fund, manage, and oversee the federal research portfolio.

**How they are affected**:

- Must implement NSPM-33 disclosure requirements within their grant-making processes
- Bear responsibility for balancing security with research mission
- Face congressional oversight pressure to demonstrate both vigilance and fairness
- Must coordinate with each other and with law enforcement

**What they want**:

- Consistent interagency standards to reduce confusion
- Adequate resources for compliance monitoring
- Clear authority to impose administrative consequences without relying on criminal prosecution
- Preservation of their research mission and international engagement

**Power assessment**: Substantial. Control funding decisions that affect every research institution. However, subject to political appointee direction and congressional pressure.

### Law Enforcement (FBI, DOJ)

**Who they are**: Federal Bureau of Investigation counterintelligence and economic espionage units; Department of Justice prosecutors at the national security and criminal divisions.

**How they are affected**:

- Tasked with investigating and prosecuting research-related espionage and fraud
- Reputational damage from failed prosecutions (China Initiative acquittals and dismissals)
- Resource allocation decisions shaped by perceived threat levels
- Must balance national security mandate with civil liberties obligations

**What they want**:

- Robust enforcement authority and tools
- Cooperation from universities in identifying suspicious activity
- Clearer standards for what constitutes criminal versus administrative violations
- Political support for enforcement priorities

**Power assessment**: Very high. Control investigation and prosecution decisions that can destroy individual careers and shape institutional behavior. Operate with significant discretion and limited external oversight in national security contexts.

### Intelligence Community

**Who they are**: CIA, NSA, DIA, ODNI, and agency-specific counterintelligence offices.

**How they are affected**:

- Produce classified threat assessments that inform policy and enforcement decisions
- Monitor foreign intelligence service targeting of U.S. research institutions
- Operate foreign collection programs that sometimes involve academic cover

**What they want**:

- Broader information sharing with universities and law enforcement
- Expanded counterintelligence authority within research environments
- Technology control regimes that limit adversary access to critical capabilities

**Power assessment**: High but indirect. Shape policy through classified briefings and threat assessments that other stakeholders cannot challenge or verify. Limited direct enforcement authority outside classified programs.

## Secondary Stakeholders

### Congressional Committees

**Who they are**: Senate and House committees with jurisdiction over science, intelligence, judiciary, and appropriations -- particularly the Senate Commerce Committee, House Science Committee, Senate and House Intelligence Committees, and Senate and House Judiciary Committees.

**How they are affected**:

- Shape legislation governing research security, export controls, and immigration
- Conduct oversight of agency implementation
- Respond to constituent and industry concerns

**What they want**:

- Demonstration of effective threat response
- Protection of U.S. competitiveness
- Avoidance of politically damaging failures (missed threats or wrongful prosecutions)
- Credit for bipartisan achievement on a rare area of bipartisan agreement

**Power assessment**: Very high. Control legislative framework and agency budgets.

### Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Communities

**Who they are**: Approximately 24 million Americans of Asian descent, including the 5.4 million Chinese Americans who are most directly affected by China-focused security enforcement.

**How they are affected**:

- Disproportionate investigation and prosecution rates
- Climate of suspicion affecting professional and social life
- Rise in anti-Asian hate incidents correlated with China threat rhetoric
- Career chilling effects extending beyond those directly investigated

**What they want**:

- End to ethnic profiling in research security enforcement
- Due process protections for accused researchers
- Disaggregation of "China threat" narratives from anti-Chinese sentiment
- Accountability for discriminatory enforcement

**Power assessment**: Growing. Organizations like the Committee of 100, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and others have become more politically active. However, the community is diverse and not unified on all policy questions.

### Private Sector and Industry

**Who they are**: Technology companies, defense contractors, pharmaceutical firms, and other industries that employ researchers and depend on university-industry partnerships.

**How they are affected**:

- Face their own trade secret theft risks from foreign competitors

## Power Dynamics

### Who Has the Most Influence

1. **Congressional committees**: Control legislation and funding
2. **FBI/DOJ**: Control enforcement decisions
3. **Federal funding agencies**: Control research dollars
4. **University lobby (AAU/APLU)**: Significant access and influence
5. **Intelligence community**: Shape threat perceptions through classified briefings

### Who Is Most Affected

1. **Chinese and Asian American researchers**: Disproportionate investigation and career risk
2. **International students and postdocs**: Most vulnerable, least powerful
3. **Individual PIs**: Bear compliance burden and investigation risk
4. **Small institution researchers**: Least institutional support for compliance
5. **Early-career researchers**: Career damage from investigation is most consequential

### The Power-Impact Gap

The stakeholders with the most power over research security policy (Congress, law enforcement, intelligence community) are the least directly affected by its consequences. The stakeholders most directly affected (individual researchers, international students, AAPI communities) have the least power. This structural imbalance helps explain why policy has oscillated between neglect and overreach rather than settling on calibrated, proportionate approaches.
