# Open Science: Roadmap

## Overview

The transition to comprehensive open science in the United States requires coordinated action across legislative, executive, institutional, and community levels. This roadmap outlines a phased implementation strategy spanning approximately ten years, building on existing momentum from the Nelson memo, Plan S, and growing institutional commitment.

## Phase 1: Foundation (2025-2027)

### Publisher Transition

| Action | Timeline | Expected Outcome |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Majority of publisher revenue from OA (not subscriptions) | 2028-2030 | Market transformation |
| Society journals transition to sustainable OA models | 2027-2030 | Revenue-neutral transition |
| APC cost caps implemented by major funders | 2027 | APC inflation controlled |
| Diamond OA journals grow to 15% of output | 2030 | Diversified publishing ecosystem |

### Key Milestones for Phase 2

- Federal legislation enacted and funded
- Publication OA compliance above 95% across all agencies
- Data sharing compliance above 70% across all agencies
- At least 100 institutions reformed tenure criteria to include open science
- National data repository operational with over 1 million datasets

## Phase 3: Maturation (2030-2035)

### Goals

| Goal | Target | Metric |
|------|--------|--------|
| Universal OA for federally funded publications | 99%+ compliance | Deposit rate in federal repositories |
| FAIR data as standard practice | 80%+ compliance | Automated FAIR assessment scores |
| Open source research software recognized | Standard in evaluations | Institutional policy audits |
| Diamond OA as mainstream model | 25% of articles | DOAJ statistics |
| Global alignment | U.S. + EU + UK + major funders aligned | Policy comparison |
| Reproducibility improvement | Measurable increase | Replication study success rates |

### Long-Term Infrastructure

- Fully interoperable national and international repository networks
- AI-assisted FAIR compliance and metadata generation
- Automated reproducibility checking for computational research
- Comprehensive digital preservation for the scholarly record
- Open science integrated into all levels of research training

### Market Evolution

By 2035, the expected publishing landscape:

| Model | Market Share (Current) | Market Share (Target 2035) |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Subscription/paywalled | ~50% | ~10% (legacy content) |
| Gold OA (APC-funded) | ~30% | ~30% |
| Diamond OA | ~5% | ~25% |
| Green OA (repository deposit) | ~15% | ~35% (with overlay review) |

## Risk Analysis

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Change of administration reverses Nelson memo | Medium | High | Legislative codification |
| Publisher legal challenges | Medium | Medium | Strong legal foundation in spending clause authority |
| Agency implementation delays | High | Medium | OSTP coordination and congressional oversight |
| APC inflation under gold OA model | High | High | Diamond OA investment and APC caps |
| Predatory journal proliferation | Medium | Medium | Quality standards and registry requirements |
| Data privacy conflicts | Medium | Medium | Clear exemption processes for sensitive data |
| Researcher resistance | Medium | Low | Incentive reform and training |
| International misalignment | Low | Medium | Coordination with Plan S and global partners |

### Contingency Plans

**If legislation stalls**: Continue executive-branch implementation through Nelson memo authority, while building broader coalition for legislative action.

**If publisher legal challenge succeeds**: Redesign mandates to rely on contractual conditions (grant terms) rather than regulatory authority, following the NIH model.

**If APC inflation outpaces controls**: Accelerate diamond OA investment and shift green OA with overlay review as the primary model.

**If institutional reform lags**: Use federal grant conditions to incentivize open science practices, creating external pressure for institutional change.

## Success Metrics

### Short-Term (2025-2027)

- Percentage of federally funded publications available immediately upon publication
- Number of federal agencies with operational public access repositories
- Number of institutions adopting DORA principles
- Congressional progress on open science legislation

### Medium-Term (2027-2030)

- Data sharing compliance rates across federal agencies
- FAIR compliance scores for deposited datasets
- Percentage of articles in diamond OA journals
- Number of institutions with reformed tenure criteria
- Federal investment in open science infrastructure

### Long-Term (2030-2035)

- Overall open access rates for U.S. research output
- Replication success rates (as measure of reproducibility improvement)
- International alignment metrics
- Total system costs compared to current spending
- Public access utilization rates

## Comparison with International Timelines

| Country/Region | OA Mandate | Data Mandate | Implementation Status |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| United States | 2025 (Nelson memo deadline) | 2023 (NIH), expanding | Phase 1 |
| European Union | 2021 (Horizon Europe) | 2021 | Phase 2 |
| United Kingdom | 2022 (UKRI policy) | 2022 | Phase 2 |
| China | Expanding since 2022 | Developing | Phase 1 |
| Canada | Tri-Agency policy under review | Developing | Pre-Phase 1 |
| Australia | ARC policy under review | Developing | Pre-Phase 1 |

The United States is behind Europe in implementation but has the potential to leapfrog through the Nelson memo's comprehensive scope and the scale of federal research investment.
