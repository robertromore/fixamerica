# Open Science: Solutions

## Overview

Achieving comprehensive open science requires coordinated interventions across publishing, data, software, and incentive systems. No single reform is sufficient. The solutions below address the root causes identified in [Root Causes](04-root-causes.md) and are designed to work as a mutually reinforcing package.

## Solution 1: Codify and Strengthen Federal Open Access Mandates

### Description

Enact federal legislation requiring immediate open access to all publications and data resulting from federally funded research, codifying and extending the 2022 Nelson memo so it cannot be reversed by future administrations.

### Key Components

- **Immediate open access**: No embargo period for peer-reviewed publications from federally funded research
- **Author copyright retention**: Researchers retain copyright and grant the public a nonexclusive license under CC-BY terms
- **Data sharing**: Underlying data must be deposited in approved repositories at the time of publication
- **Software sharing**: Code essential to reproducing results must be publicly available
- **Metadata standards**: All publications and data must include machine-readable metadata and persistent identifiers
- **Enforcement**: Grant non-compliance triggers funding holds on future awards

### Addresses Root Causes

| Root Cause | How This Solution Addresses It |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Publisher monopoly | Reduces publishers' exclusive control over publicly funded content |
| Weak enforcement | Creates statutory enforcement mechanism with funding consequences |
| Copyright framework | Mandates author copyright retention |
| Lack of enforcement | Establishes clear penalties |

### Evidence

- NIH Public Access Policy achieved ~90% compliance after tying compliance to grant renewals
- Plan S implementation in Europe has accelerated OA transition without measurable harm to research output
- The Nelson memo's deadline has already prompted agency planning and publisher accommodation

### Challenges

- Congressional opposition fueled by publisher lobbying
- Implementation burden on agencies with limited administrative capacity
- Concerns about imposing uniform requirements across diverse disciplines
- Potential First Amendment and copyright challenges (though most legal scholars consider mandates defensible)

## Solution 2: Invest in Public Open Access Infrastructure

### Description

Fund a national open access infrastructure to support publication, data, and software repositories, reducing dependence on commercial publishers and ensuring long-term preservation.

### Key Components

- **Expand PubMed Central**: Extend to cover all federally funded research, not just biomedical
- **Create a National Research Data Repository**: Centralized, FAIR-compliant infrastructure for research data across disciplines
- **Fund preprint servers**: Provide federal funding for arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and disciplinary preprint servers as public goods
- **Support diamond OA journals**: Fund journals that charge neither authors nor readers
- **Develop interoperability standards**: Ensure repositories communicate through standard APIs and metadata
- **Preservation**: Fund long-term digital preservation through LOCKSS, CLOCKSS, and similar programs

### Estimated Costs

| Component | Annual Cost (Est.) | Current Spending |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Expanded PubMed Central | $50 million | ~$30 million |
| National Data Repository | $100 million | Fragmented across agencies |
| Preprint server support | $20 million | ~$5 million (foundations) |
| Diamond OA journal fund | $50 million | Minimal |
| Interoperability development | $30 million | Minimal |
| Digital preservation | $20 million | ~$10 million |
| **Total** | **~$270 million** | **~$45 million** |

**Context**: $270 million represents approximately 0.16% of the $171 billion federal R&D budget -- a modest investment to ensure public access to the results of that spending.

### Addresses Root Causes

| Root Cause | How This Solution Addresses It |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Inadequate infrastructure | Directly builds needed systems |
| Publisher monopoly | Creates viable alternatives to publisher platforms |
| Collective action failure | Provides coordination through federal investment |

## Solution 3: Reform Academic Incentive Structures

### Description

Change the criteria used for hiring, tenure, promotion, and funding decisions to value open science practices, reducing the dependence on journal prestige as a proxy for research quality.

### Key Components

- **Adopt DORA principles**: Federal agencies and universities should commit to the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment, evaluating research on its merits rather than journal metrics
- **Recognize open science contributions**: Data sharing, code development, peer review, and preprint posting should count as scholarly contributions in tenure and promotion reviews
- **Narrative CVs**: Replace publication lists with narrative assessments of research impact, following the model adopted by the Royal Society and other organizations
- **Require open science plans**: Grant applications should include and be evaluated on open science plans (data management, code sharing, preprint policies)
- **Fund open science**: Include line items in grants for APCs, data curation, and software development

### Addresses Root Causes

| Root Cause | How This Solution Addresses It |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Academic incentive misalignment | Directly reforms evaluation criteria |
| Prestige economy | Reduces dependence on journal brand as quality proxy |
| Status quo bias | Creates positive incentives for new practices |

### Evidence

- The Netherlands and UK have begun requiring narrative CVs in grant applications, with positive early results
- Universities that have adopted DORA (over 2,600 organizations) report no negative effects on research quality
- NIH has experimented with blinding grant reviews to applicant identity, improving equity without reducing quality

### Challenges

- Requires coordinated adoption across thousands of institutions
- Senior faculty may resist changes to criteria they succeeded under
- Narrative evaluation is more labor-intensive than metric-based assessment
- Risk of creating new forms of gaming and manipulation

## Solution 4: Transition to Diamond Open Access

### Description

Shift academic publishing from subscription-based and APC-based models to diamond/platinum OA, where journals are free to both authors and readers, funded by institutional and government support.

### Key Components

- **Federal funding for diamond OA journals**: Create a competitive grant program for journals that commit to no-APC open access
- **Institutional publishing cooperatives**: Universities collectively fund and operate journals, leveraging existing editorial expertise
- **Society journal transition support**: Provide transitional funding for scientific societies to move journals from subscription to diamond OA
- **Overlay journals**: Support the development of journals that provide peer review "overlays" on preprints, minimizing production costs
- **Cooperative infrastructure**: Fund platforms like Open Journal Systems (OJS) that reduce the cost of journal operations

### Estimated Cost for National Diamond OA Transition

- Approximately 100,000 articles per year result from federally funded U.S. research
- At an estimated $500-$1,000 per article for diamond OA operations (editorial, hosting, preservation), total cost: $50-$100 million per year
- This compares favorably to the approximately $7 billion currently spent on U.S. academic library serial subscriptions

### Addresses Root Causes

| Root Cause | How This Solution Addresses It |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Publisher business model | Creates a sustainable alternative model |
| Equity concerns (APCs) | Eliminates author-facing charges |
| Collective action failure | Provides coordinated institutional response |

### Evidence

- Latin American SciELO and Redalyc networks have operated diamond OA successfully for over two decades
- *eLife* transitioned to no-APC model in 2023, funded by foundations and institutional support
- The Open Library of Humanities operates diamond OA journals in the humanities, funded by international consortium

## Solution 5: Strengthen Data Sharing and FAIR Compliance

### Description

Build the infrastructure, standards, and incentives needed for comprehensive FAIR-compliant data sharing across all federally funded research.

### Key Components

- **Mandatory data deposit**: Require deposit of research data in approved repositories at the time of publication, with exceptions only for legitimate privacy or national security concerns
- **FAIR compliance verification**: Develop automated tools to assess FAIR compliance and integrate them into repository deposit workflows
- **Data citation standards**: Adopt and enforce the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles, ensuring that data creators receive credit
- **Domain-specific standards**: Fund the development of discipline-specific data formats and metadata standards through community-driven processes
- **Training**: Fund data management training for researchers, particularly graduate students and postdocs
- **Data stewardship positions**: Fund dedicated data stewardship roles at research institutions

### Addresses Root Causes

| Root Cause | How This Solution Addresses It |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Inadequate infrastructure | Builds data management capacity |
| Academic incentive misalignment | Creates credit for data sharing |
| Disciplinary variation | Allows field-specific approaches within common framework |

## Solution 6: Support Open Source Research Software

### Description

Recognize, fund, and sustain open source software as critical research infrastructure.

### Key Components

- **Software sustainability fund**: Create a federal program (modeled on NSF's Cyberinfrastructure program) dedicated to maintaining and developing open source research software
- **Software citation requirements**: Require citation of software used in research, following FORCE11 Software Citation Principles
- **Software as a scholarly output**: Recognize software development as equivalent to publication in tenure and promotion decisions
- **Code sharing mandates**: Require code sharing for all computationally dependent research funded by federal agencies
- **Software review**: Support venues like the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) that provide peer review of research software

### Estimated Costs

| Component | Annual Cost (Est.) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Software sustainability fund | $100 million |
| Software citation infrastructure | $10 million |
| Software review venues | $5 million |
| Training programs | $15 million |
| **Total** | **~$130 million** |

### Evidence

- The UK's Software Sustainability Institute has demonstrated that modest investment in research software can have outsized impact
- NumPy, SciPy, and other critical research tools have survived on volunteer labor for decades, but this model is fragile and inequitable
- The 2023 collapse of critical infrastructure tools (demonstrated repeatedly in both open source and research contexts) underscores the risk of unfunded dependencies

## Solution 7: Promote Preprints and Registered Reports

### Description

Encourage the use of preprints as the primary mode of scientific communication and registered reports as a quality assurance mechanism.

### Key Components

- **Accept preprints for grant applications**: Following NIH's lead, all federal agencies should accept preprints as evidence of research output in grant applications
- **Fund preprint screening**: Support services that screen preprints for quality and potential risks (particularly in health sciences)
- **Registered report incentives**: Provide grant supplements for researchers who use the registered report format
- **Overlay review development**: Fund the development of community review platforms that provide open peer review of preprints
- **Preprint-journal integration**: Support technical infrastructure linking preprints to subsequent peer-reviewed versions

### Addresses Root Causes

| Root Cause | How This Solution Addresses It |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Publisher monopoly | Reduces dependence on journals as gatekeepers |
| Prestige economy | Creates alternative, merit-based evaluation pathways |
| Slow dissemination | Enables immediate sharing of results |
