# Open Science: Root Causes

## Why Publicly Funded Research Remains Behind Paywalls

The persistence of restricted access to publicly funded research is not accidental. It results from interlocking economic, institutional, and cultural structures that create powerful incentives against openness. Understanding these root causes is essential to designing effective solutions.

## Structural Root Causes

### 1. The Publisher Business Model as Natural Monopoly

**The Problem**: Each journal article is a unique product with no substitute. A researcher who needs to read a specific paper in *The Lancet* cannot substitute a paper from *JAMA* or *Nature*. This gives publishers monopoly pricing power over every article they control.

**How It Sustains the System**:

- Publishers accumulate portfolios of thousands of journals, each containing irreplaceable content
- Libraries cannot selectively cancel low-value journals because they are bundled with essential ones (the "Big Deal")
- Price negotiations are asymmetric: the publisher controls a monopoly product, while the university faces unacceptable consequences from losing access
- Unlike other markets, there is no price competition -- researchers choose where to publish based on prestige, not cost, and institutions must subscribe to whatever journals their researchers need

**Why It Persists**: Copyright transfer agreements give publishers permanent ownership of the scholarly record. Once a researcher signs copyright over to a publisher, the work becomes the publisher's asset indefinitely.

### 2. Academic Incentive Misalignment

**The Problem**: Researchers are evaluated, hired, promoted, and funded based on where they publish, not whether their work is accessible. The incentive structure rewards publishing in high-prestige, often paywalled journals.

**How It Sustains the System**:

- **Tenure and promotion**: Committees weight publications by journal impact factor, which correlates with selectivity, not openness
- **Grant funding**: Reviewers assess track records by journal prestige
- **Career advancement**: Publications in *Nature*, *Science*, and *Cell* carry disproportionate career value regardless of open access status
- **Quantity metrics**: The "publish or perish" culture incentivizes volume over accessibility, reproducibility, or data sharing
- **Data sharing disincentive**: Researchers who share data risk being "scooped" by competitors who can publish faster using shared datasets

**Why It Persists**: Changing tenure and promotion criteria requires coordinated action across thousands of autonomous institutions. Individual institutions that unilaterally value open access risk disadvantaging their faculty in competition with institutions using traditional metrics.

### 3. Collective Action Failure Among Universities

**The Problem**: Universities collectively pay billions for journal access and would benefit from a transition to open access, but individual institutions face high costs for acting alone.

**How It Sustains the System**:

- An individual university that cancels a subscription bundle loses access to content; the publisher loses a fraction of revenue
- Consortium negotiations improve bargaining power but have not achieved fundamental change
- Free-rider incentives: if one university negotiates open access, others benefit without contributing
- Administrative structures separate library budgets (which pay subscriptions) from research budgets (which fund research), obscuring the total cost

**Why It Persists**: University governance structures make coordinated action difficult. Library directors, provosts, faculty senates, and research officers have different priorities. National-level coordination exists (SPARC, Coalition of Open Access Policy Institutions) but lacks binding authority.

### 4. The "Prestige Economy" of Academic Publishing

**The Problem**: Journal prestige functions as a form of currency in academia, and the scarcity created by selective, paywalled journals is what gives that currency its value.

**How It Sustains the System**:

- High rejection rates signal selectivity and prestige
- Journal impact factors, despite their well-documented flaws, serve as convenient shorthand for quality
- The "brand value" of elite journals attracts the best submissions, creating a self-reinforcing cycle
- Open access journals, despite publishing rigorous research, carry less prestige in many fields
- DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment, 2012) called for ending reliance on journal metrics, but adoption has been slow

**Why It Persists**: Prestige is a coordination mechanism. Abandoning it requires replacing it with something equally legible and convenient. Alternatives (h-index, altmetrics, narrative evaluations) each have significant limitations.

### 5. Inadequate Infrastructure for Open Science

**The Problem**: The infrastructure needed for comprehensive open science -- repositories, persistent identifiers, metadata standards, interoperability protocols -- remains underfunded and fragmented.

**How It Sustains the System**:

- Federal repositories (PubMed Central, DOE PAGES) exist but vary in capability and coverage
- Institutional repositories are often poorly maintained and sparsely populated
- Data repositories lack standardization, making FAIR compliance difficult
- Research software receives almost no dedicated funding for maintenance
- Persistent identifier systems (DOIs, ORCIDs) are not universally adopted

**Why It Persists**: Infrastructure investment produces public goods that benefit all researchers but are difficult to fund through individual grants. Federal agencies have invested in some repositories but have not created a comprehensive, interoperable infrastructure.

### 6. Copyright and Intellectual Property Framework

**The Problem**: The default copyright framework gives publishers, not researchers, control over the scholarly record. Standard publication agreements require authors to transfer copyright to publishers.

**How It Sustains the System**:

- Copyright transfer is typically a condition of publication in high-prestige journals
- Once copyright is transferred, authors cannot legally share their own work without publisher permission
- Publisher lobbying has successfully framed open access mandates as threats to intellectual property rights
- The Copyright Act does not contain specific provisions for publicly funded research outputs
- "Fair use" defenses for sharing articles are legally uncertain

**Why It Persists**: Copyright law serves legitimate purposes in creative industries. Publishers have leveraged this framework for academic content despite the fundamentally different economics of scholarly communication (where authors are not compensated and seek maximum distribution).

### 7. Lack of Enforcement Mechanisms

**The Problem**: Even where open access mandates exist, enforcement is weak. Researchers who fail to comply with deposit requirements face minimal consequences.

**How It Sustains the System**:

- NIH ties compliance to grant renewals but rarely denies funding for non-compliance alone
- No federal agency has established meaningful penalties for violating open access or data sharing requirements
- Publisher agreements that restrict green OA often contradict federal mandates, and researchers face conflicting obligations
- Data sharing requirements are particularly poorly enforced; many "shared" datasets are inaccessible, incomplete, or undocumented
- Compliance monitoring is resource-intensive and under-resourced

**Why It Persists**: Enforcement requires dedicated staff, clear standards, and political will. Agencies that fund research are reluctant to penalize the researchers they support. Publisher agreements create legal ambiguity about researcher obligations.

## Cultural and Cognitive Root Causes

### 8. Disciplinary Variation in Norms

Different academic fields have very different relationships with open science:

| Field | OA Culture | Data Sharing Culture | Key Barrier |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| Physics/Mathematics | Strong (arXiv dominant) | Variable | Mostly solved for publications |
| Biomedical sciences | Growing (PubMed Central) | Improving (genomics leads) | APC costs, clinical data privacy |
| Social sciences | Weak | Weak | Methods not standardized for sharing |
| Humanities | Very weak | Minimal | Monograph-based; different economics |
| Engineering | Mixed | Weak | Industry partnerships, IP concerns |
| Computer science | Strong (arXiv, conference proceedings) | Variable | Software sharing undervalued |

This variation makes universal policies difficult. A mandate designed for biomedical research may be inappropriate for humanities scholarship.

### 9. Information Asymmetry

**The Problem**: Key decision-makers lack information needed to make optimal choices:

- **University administrators** often do not know the total institutional cost of journal access across all budget lines
- **Researchers** often do not know the cost of their journal subscriptions or alternatives
- **Policymakers** often do not understand the academic publishing market well enough to design effective interventions
- **The public** is largely unaware that they are paying twice -- through taxes for research and through institutional costs for access
- **Tenure committees** often do not know whether candidates' publications are openly accessible

### 10. Status Quo Bias and Risk Aversion

**The Problem**: The current system is deeply familiar to all participants. Changing it requires accepting uncertainty and short-term costs for long-term benefits.

- Senior faculty who built careers under the current system are reluctant to change evaluation criteria
- Libraries have invested in subscription management infrastructure
- Publishers have built profitable businesses around the current model
- Funders worry that mandates could disrupt research productivity
- Early-career researchers, who might benefit most from open science, have the least power to change the system

## Root Cause Interaction Map

The root causes interact to create a self-reinforcing system:

1. **Publisher monopoly** (Cause 1) enables **high prices** that drain library budgets
2. **Academic incentives** (Cause 2) drive researchers to **prestigious paywalled journals**
3. **Collective action failure** (Cause 3) prevents universities from **negotiating effectively**
4. **Prestige economy** (Cause 4) sustains **demand for exclusive journals**
5. **Weak infrastructure** (Cause 5) makes **open alternatives less convenient**
6. **Copyright framework** (Cause 6) gives publishers **legal control** over content
7. **Weak enforcement** (Cause 7) means mandates **lack teeth**
8. These factors combine with **disciplinary variation** (Cause 8), **information gaps** (Cause 9), and **status quo bias** (Cause 10) to perpetuate the system

Breaking this cycle requires interventions at multiple points simultaneously -- mandates alone are insufficient without infrastructure, incentive reform, and enforcement.
