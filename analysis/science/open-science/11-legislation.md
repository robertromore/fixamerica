# Open Science: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Open science legislation must address three interrelated challenges: (1) ensuring public access to publications resulting from federally funded research, (2) mandating data sharing and FAIR compliance, and (3) building the infrastructure needed to sustain open science practices. The 2022 Nelson memo established comprehensive policy through executive action, but legislation is necessary to make these requirements permanent, fund implementation, and establish enforcement mechanisms that survive changes in administration. This document provides two federal bills with full draft text, along with state model legislation and regulatory framework.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act

**Purpose**: Codify the 2022 OSTP Nelson memo into statute, requiring immediate open access to all peer-reviewed publications resulting from federally funded research, with author copyright retention and robust enforcement mechanisms.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Public Access to Publicly Funded
Research Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Federal Government invests approximately $170,000,000,000
    annually in research and development through Federal agencies.
(2) The results of federally funded research, including peer-
    reviewed publications, are produced using taxpayer funds and
    should be freely available to the public that funded them.
(3) Restricted access to federally funded research impedes
    scientific progress, limits clinical applications, hampers
    education, and undermines public trust in science.
(4) Commercial publishers receive manuscripts and peer review
    services from federally funded researchers without compensation,
    yet charge the public for access to the resulting publications.
(5) The Office of Science and Technology Policy memorandum of
    August 25, 2022, established a policy of immediate open access,
    but this policy lacks statutory permanence.
(6) International partners, including the European Union and the
    United Kingdom, have implemented similar requirements, and
    United States alignment strengthens global research
    collaboration.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(a) COVERED AGENCY.--The term "covered agency" means any Federal
    agency that funds extramural research.

    scholarly publication that is based upon research funded in
    whole or in part by a covered agency.
(c) DESIGNATED REPOSITORY.--The term "designated repository" means
    a publicly accessible digital repository approved by the
    Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy for the
    deposit of covered works, including agency-operated repositories
    and interoperable institutional repositories meeting standards
    established under section 5.
(d) AUTHOR.--The term "author" means the individual or individuals
    who wrote a covered work while receiving Federal research
    funding.
(e) METADATA STANDARDS.--The term "metadata standards" means
    machine-readable descriptive information associated with a

    date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3** defines key terms broadly to cover all federally funded research, not just research from agencies above a spending threshold
- **Section 4(a)-(b)** codifies immediate open access with no embargo, matching the Nelson memo
- **Section 4(c)** addresses the copyright problem by mandating author retention of rights sufficient for open access, making conflicting publisher contracts unenforceable on this point
- **Section 5** creates infrastructure standards while allowing flexibility in repository implementation
- **Section 6** establishes meaningful enforcement through funding holds, with a cure period to avoid punishing good-faith errors
- **Section 7** protects against the "pay-to-comply" problem by ensuring green OA is always a valid compliance path and capping allowable APCs
- **Section 8** provides dedicated funding for implementation

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| First Amendment concerns | Government conditioning its own spending, not regulating private speech |
| Copyright preemption | Spending Clause authority; parallel to Bayh-Dole for patents |
| Publisher lobbying | Strong public interest argument; bipartisan appeal of taxpayer value |
| Implementation capacity | Phased timeline with dedicated appropriations |
| Disciplinary variation | Green OA pathway accommodates all fields |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Require deposit of the published version (not just accepted manuscript) and prohibit copyright transfer for federally funded works
- **Fallback version**: Apply only to agencies above $100 million in annual R&D spending, with expansion after initial implementation
- **Compromise version**: Allow a 6-month embargo for humanities and social sciences where monograph economics differ

### Bill 2: Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act

**Purpose**: Establish comprehensive data sharing requirements for federally funded research, codify FAIR principles, and create infrastructure for research data management and preservation.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Research Data Sharing and
Transparency Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Scientific progress depends on the ability to verify, build
    upon, and reuse research data.
(2) A significant portion of scientific data produced with Federal
    funding is lost, inaccessible, or insufficiently documented
    for reuse.
(3) The inability to access underlying research data contributes
    to the reproducibility crisis in science, with studies
    indicating that a majority of researchers have been unable to
    reproduce published findings.
(4) International standards known as the FAIR principles--
    Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable--provide a
    framework for research data management.
(5) The National Institutes of Health Data Management and Sharing
    Policy, effective January 25, 2023, established data sharing
    requirements for NIH-funded research, but similar requirements
    are not uniform across Federal agencies.
(6) Investment in data infrastructure and standards will accelerate
    scientific discovery, improve research integrity, and maximize
    the return on Federal research investments.

    limited to experimental data, observational data, computational
    results, survey responses, and associated metadata and
    documentation.
(c) DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN.--The term "data management plan" means a
    document describing how research data will be managed,
    preserved, and shared during and after a research project.
(d) FAIR PRINCIPLES.--The term "FAIR principles" means the
    principles that data should be Findable, Accessible,
    Interoperable, and Reusable, as described in the publication
    "The FAIR Guiding Principles for Scientific Data Management
    and Stewardship" (Wilkinson et al., Scientific Data, 2016).
(e) APPROVED REPOSITORY.--The term "approved repository" means a
    data repository that meets the standards established under
    section 5 of this Act.
(f) RESEARCH SOFTWARE.--The term "research software" means software
    code that is essential to the production, processing, or
    analysis of research data or to the reproduction of research
    findings.

(c) Software sharing requirements under section 4(c) shall apply
    to all research publications resulting from grants awarded
    more than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3** defines terms inclusively, covering all types of research data and all federal funding agencies
- **Section 4(a)** requires data management plans as part of grant applications, following the NIH model and extending it to all agencies
- **Section 4(b)-(c)** mandates data and software deposit at the time of publication, ensuring that underlying evidence is available for verification
- **Section 4(d)** provides carefully scoped exceptions for privacy, national security, IP, and other legitimate concerns, while requiring documentation of exceptions
- **Section 5** creates infrastructure through a federated National Research Data Infrastructure, avoiding a single monolithic system
- **Section 6** establishes dedicated funding for open source research software sustainability
- **Section 7** provides enforcement with a generous cure period, recognizing that data management is more complex than publication deposit
- **Section 8** addresses incentive misalignment by directing federal agencies to value data and software contributions in grant review

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Disciplinary variation in data types | Community-driven standards development; flexible framework |
| Privacy concerns (health data, human subjects) | Explicit exceptions with documentation requirements |
| Implementation complexity | Phased timeline (1-2 years) with dedicated appropriations |
| Researcher burden | Allowable grant costs for data management; data stewardship support |
| Bayh-Dole tensions | Explicit exception for technology transfer IP |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Require data deposit at the time of collection (not just publication), with embargo until publication
- **Fallback version**: Apply data deposit requirements only to agencies above $1 billion in annual R&D spending initially
- **Compromise version**: Allow 1-year data embargo for early-career researchers to enable first-use publication

## State Model Legislation

### Model Open Science in State Universities Act

**Purpose**: Require state-funded universities to adopt open access policies for research funded by state grants and to invest in open science infrastructure.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Open Science in State
Universities Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Covered institution" means any public institution of higher
    education in this state.
(b) "State-funded research" means research funded in whole or in
    part by appropriations from this state or grants from state
    agencies.

SECTION 3. OPEN ACCESS POLICY.

(a) Each covered institution shall adopt an open access policy
    requiring faculty to deposit peer-reviewed publications in an
    institutional or disciplinary repository.
(b) Each covered institution shall maintain an institutional
    repository meeting standards established by the state higher
    education coordinating board.
(c) Covered institutions may fund article processing charges for
    open access publication from state research funds.

SECTION 4. RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT.

(a) Each covered institution shall require data management plans
    for state-funded research projects.
(b) Each covered institution shall provide data management training
    and support services to faculty and graduate students.

SECTION 5. RESEARCH ASSESSMENT.

(a) Covered institutions shall not use journal impact factors as
    the primary criterion for tenure, promotion, or hiring
    decisions.
(b) Covered institutions shall recognize data sharing, software
    development, and open science practices as legitimate scholarly
    contributions in evaluation processes.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], with compliance required
within 2 years of the effective date.
```

**Explanation**: This model legislation allows states to advance open science through their direct authority over public universities, complementing federal mandates. It is particularly valuable because state-funded research is not covered by federal open access mandates.

**Adaptations**: States may adjust scope (all public institutions vs. research universities only), timeline, and specificity of requirements based on institutional capacity.

## Regulatory Framework

### OSTP Implementation Guidance

**Existing Authority**: The OSTP has authority to coordinate science policy across federal agencies under the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. sections 6611-6671).

**Draft Regulation**: OSTP should issue binding guidance requiring:

- Uniform metadata standards across all agency repositories
- Minimum interoperability requirements for designated repositories
- APC cap methodology (e.g., based on publishing cost analysis, not market pricing)
- Annual compliance reporting templates
- Model grant terms incorporating open access and data sharing requirements

### FTC and DOJ Scrutiny of Publisher Practices

**Existing Authority**: Federal Trade Commission Act, Section 5 (unfair methods of competition); Sherman Antitrust Act, Sections 1-2.

**Recommended Action**: The FTC and DOJ Antitrust Division should investigate:

- Publisher bundling practices ("Big Deals") for potential tying arrangements
- APC price coordination among publishers
- Publisher acquisition of open science infrastructure (e.g., Elsevier's purchase of bepress)
- Non-compete and non-disclosure clauses in subscription agreements

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: Federal open access mandates are most securely grounded in Congress's Spending Clause authority (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1). The government may attach conditions to the use of federal funds, provided the conditions are related to the purpose of the spending, clearly stated, and not coercive. Open access conditions on research grants satisfy all three requirements.

**First Amendment**: Open access mandates do not restrict speech; they require additional distribution of publicly funded works. The government has broad authority to set conditions on the use of its own funds. *Rust v. Sullivan*, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), established that the government may make viewpoint-based decisions in funding programs.

**Copyright**: Section 105 of the Copyright Act excludes works of the United States Government from copyright. Federally funded research by non-government employees is not covered by this exclusion, but the government may contractually require copyright retention and open licensing as a condition of funding.

### Preemption Questions

- Federal open access mandates would preempt conflicting state laws restricting access to research
- State model legislation complements rather than conflicts with federal mandates by covering state-funded research
- Publisher contracts requiring copyright transfer may conflict with federal mandates; federal law prevails under the Supremacy Clause

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- Primary enforcement through grant compliance (funding holds)
- Secondary enforcement through annual reporting to Congress
- No criminal penalties or private right of action proposed (reduces opposition)
- OSTP coordination ensures consistency across agencies

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Five-year authorization with reauthorization required
- Annual compliance reporting to Congress
- GAO review of implementation effectiveness at year 3 and year 5
- APC cap methodology reviewed annually

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Minimum contribution threshold | Researchers funded "in part" may argue minimal federal contribution does not trigger the mandate | High |
| Publisher workarounds | Publishers may create new restrictive licensing agreements that comply technically but limit practical access | Medium |
| Repository quality | Deposited manuscripts may lack formatting, supplementary materials, or final corrections | Medium |
| Delayed publication | Publishers may delay formal "publication" date to delay the open access trigger | High |
| Institutional non-compliance | Universities may lack capacity to monitor individual researcher compliance | Medium |
| APC inflation | With green OA as backup, publishers may increase APCs to capture more revenue from gold OA | Medium |
| Waiver abuse | "Good cause" waivers in enforcement provisions may be applied too broadly | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not cover privately funded research | Significant portion of research remains behind paywalls | Constitutional limits on spending clause authority |
| Does not address monograph publishing | Humanities and some social sciences rely on book-length works | Different economics; one-size-fits-all approach inappropriate |
| Does not regulate APCs directly | Gold OA costs may continue to rise | Antitrust, not spending authority, is better tool for price regulation |
| Does not cover state-funded research | State university research without federal funding excluded | Federalism limits; addressed by state model legislation |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Define "funded in part" to mean any research supported by federal funds exceeding $1,000 or 10% of total project cost, whichever is lower
2. Specify that the license granted under Section 4(c) includes text and data mining rights and prohibits publisher restrictions on reuse
3. Require deposit of the accepted manuscript in its final peer-reviewed form with all substantive content; supplementary materials must be deposited or linked
4. Define "date of publication" to include date of online availability, not just formal print publication
5. Require covered agencies to develop institutional compliance monitoring tools and provide implementation support
6. Direct OSTP to establish and annually review APC caps
7. Require agencies to report waiver statistics annually and justify patterns of waiver grants

### Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Broad exception claims | Researchers may over-claim privacy or IP exceptions to avoid sharing data | High |
| Inadequate documentation | "Deposited" data may be poorly documented, technically FAIR but practically unusable | High |
| Software version control | Shared software may lack version history or dependency documentation needed for reproduction | Medium |
| Repository fragmentation | Proliferation of repositories may undermine discoverability despite federated infrastructure | Medium |
| Discipline-specific delays | Community-driven standards development may take years, delaying compliance | Medium |
| Data quality not addressed | Mandate covers sharing but not quality or completeness of shared data | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 180-day cure period may be too generous | Delays enforcement and reduces compliance incentives | Political compromise for passage |
| Does not address negative results | Unpublished data from failed experiments remains hidden | Publication bias; beyond scope of data sharing mandate |
| Training infrastructure underfunded | Researchers need more support than authorized funding provides | Budget constraints |
| Does not address long-term data curation costs | 5-year authorization may not cover decades of preservation | Uncertainty about long-term costs |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require peer review of exception claims for projects above $500,000 in federal funding
2. Establish minimum documentation standards for data deposits, including data dictionaries, variable definitions, and provenance records
3. Require software deposits to include dependency manifests, build instructions, and containerized computing environments where feasible
4. Mandate use of common persistent identifiers and metadata schemas across all approved repositories
5. Provide interim discipline-specific standards based on existing best practices while community processes develop comprehensive standards
6. Incorporate data quality metrics into FAIR compliance assessment tools

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Administrative burden on researchers | Automate deposit processes; integrate with existing manuscript submission systems |
| Cost shifting to researchers | Ensure all compliance costs are allowable grant expenditures |
| International coordination gaps | Align standards with European Open Science Cloud and Plan S requirements |
| Publisher market power | Complement access mandates with antitrust enforcement |
| Predatory journal exploitation | Require DOAJ registration or equivalent quality certification for APC-eligible journals |
| Cultural resistance in some disciplines | Phased implementation with discipline-specific flexibility |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Both bills include 5-year authorization periods requiring congressional reauthorization
- Annual compliance reporting creates accountability
- GAO review at years 3 and 5 provides independent assessment
- OSTP APC cap review occurs annually to prevent market distortion
- Standards review occurs every 3 years to incorporate technological advances
