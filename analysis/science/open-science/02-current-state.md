# Open Science: Current State

## The Academic Publishing Landscape

### Market Structure

The academic publishing industry generates approximately $19 billion in annual revenue, dominated by five commercial publishers that control over 50% of all published research:

| Publisher | Market Share (Approx.) | Annual Revenue (STM) | Profit Margin |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Elsevier (RELX) | ~16% of articles | ~$3.7 billion | ~37% |
| Springer Nature | ~13% | ~$1.9 billion | ~25% |
| Wiley | ~9% | ~$1.2 billion | ~28% |
| Taylor & Francis (Informa) | ~7% | ~$900 million | ~35% |
| SAGE | ~3% | ~$500 million | ~20% |

These profit margins exceed those of most major technology companies. The business model is uniquely advantageous: publishers receive content (manuscripts) for free, quality control (peer review) for free, and often editorial labor at minimal cost, then sell the product back to the institutions that produced it.

### Subscription Costs

- Average institutional subscription bundle: $10,000-$40,000 per year per publisher
- Individual article access: $30-$50 per article
- Total U.S. academic library spending on serials: approximately $7.2 billion annually
- Serial costs have increased at roughly 5-7% per year, consistently outpacing inflation
- Harvard University, with a $53 billion endowment, declared subscription costs "unsustainable" in 2012

### Federal Research Spending and Access

The U.S. federal government invested approximately $171 billion in R&D in FY2023 across major agencies:

| Agency | FY2023 R&D (Approx.) | Open Access Status |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| NIH | ~$48 billion | Mandate since 2008; compliance ~90% |
| DOD | ~$40 billion | Developing implementation plan |
| DOE | ~$22 billion | Developing implementation plan |
| NSF | ~$9 billion | Public Access Plan updated 2023 |
| NASA | ~$8 billion | Public access repository (PubSpace) |
| USDA | ~$3 billion | Developing implementation plan |

Despite generating the world's largest body of publicly funded research, a significant portion remains behind paywalls for months to years after publication.

### The Nelson Memo (2022)

On August 25, 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issued a memorandum titled "Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research." Key provisions:

- **Elimination of embargo**: The 12-month embargo period that previously allowed publishers to restrict access was removed. All peer-reviewed publications from federally funded research must be made freely available upon publication by December 31, 2025.
- **Data sharing**: Scientific data underlying publications must be shared at the time of publication.
- **Metadata standards**: All publications must include machine-readable metadata and persistent identifiers.
- **Equitable access**: Agencies must ensure that open access policies do not create financial barriers for researchers (e.g., through unaffordable APCs).

### Agency Implementation Status

As of early 2025, agencies have submitted updated public access plans but implementation varies:

| Agency | Plan Submitted | Repository | APC Policy | Compliance Mechanism |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| NIH | Yes | PubMed Central | No direct funding for APCs | Grant compliance requirement |
| NSF | Yes | NSF Public Access Repository | Under development | Grant compliance requirement |
| DOE | Yes | OSTI/PAGES | Under development | Grant compliance requirement |
| DOD | In progress | DTIC | Under development | Under development |
| NASA | Yes | PubSpace | Under development | Grant compliance requirement |
| USDA | In progress | PubAg | Under development | Under development |

## Open Access Landscape

### Open Access by the Numbers

- Approximately 50% of newly published research articles are now available as open access (up from ~30% in 2018)
- Of OA articles, roughly 30% are gold OA, 15% are green OA, and 5% are diamond/platinum OA
- The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) lists over 20,000 journals
- PubMed Central contains over 9 million full-text articles
- arXiv hosts over 2.4 million preprints across physics, mathematics, computer science, and related fields
- bioRxiv and medRxiv together host over 300,000 preprints in biological and medical sciences

### Article Processing Charges

The gold OA model shifts costs from readers to authors/funders. APC costs have risen significantly:

| Journal/Publisher | Typical APC |
|-------------------|-------------|
| *Nature* | $11,390 |
| *Cell* | $9,900 |
| *Science* (open access option) | $9,000 |
| Elsevier hybrid journals | $3,000-$5,000 |
| PLOS ONE | $1,931 |
| eLife | Eliminated APCs (diamond model) |
| MDPI journals | $1,600-$2,800 |

Average APCs have increased approximately 5% annually. The shift from subscription to APC revenue has not reduced total publisher revenue; in many cases, it has increased it.

### Predatory Publishing

The pay-to-publish model has spawned a parallel industry of predatory journals that charge APCs but provide minimal or no peer review:

- Estimated 15,000+ predatory journals globally
- Approximately $75 million in annual APC revenue to predatory publishers
- Researchers in developing countries and early-career researchers are disproportionately targeted
- Beall's List (now maintained informally) tracks suspected predatory publishers

## Data Sharing and FAIR Principles

### Current Data Sharing Requirements

| Funder/Agency | Data Sharing Policy | Effective Date |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| NIH | Data Management and Sharing Policy | January 2023 |
| NSF | Requirement for Data Management Plan | 2011, updated 2023 |
| DOE | Public Access Plan for data | 2014, updated 2023 |
| European Commission (Horizon Europe) | FAIR data mandate | 2021 |
| Wellcome Trust | Open access for data | 2017 |

### FAIR Principles Adoption

The FAIR principles, published in 2016, have become the international standard for research data management:

- **Findable**: Data must have persistent identifiers and rich metadata
- **Accessible**: Data must be retrievable via standardized protocols
- **Interoperable**: Data must use formal, shared vocabularies and standards
- **Reusable**: Data must have clear licensing, provenance, and documentation

Compliance with FAIR principles remains uneven. A 2023 assessment found that fewer than 15% of published datasets fully meet all four FAIR criteria.

### Research Data Repositories

| Repository | Discipline | Records |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| GenBank | Genomics | ~250 million sequences |
| Protein Data Bank | Structural biology | ~210,000 structures |
| Zenodo | General | ~3 million records |
| Dryad | General | ~60,000 datasets |
| Figshare | General | ~8 million items |
| ICPSR | Social science | ~16,000 studies |
| Dataverse | Social science | ~130,000 datasets |

## Preprint Servers

### Growth and Adoption

Preprint servers have grown dramatically, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic:

| Server | Launch Year | Preprints (Cumulative) | Growth Trend |
|--------|------------|----------------------|-------------|
| arXiv | 1991 | ~2.4 million | Steady, ~200K/year |
| bioRxiv | 2013 | ~250,000 | Accelerating |
| medRxiv | 2019 | ~60,000 | Rapid growth |
| SSRN | 1994 | ~1.1 million | Steady |
| EarthArXiv | 2017 | ~8,000 | Growing |
| EdArXiv | 2019 | ~3,000 | Early stage |

During the COVID-19 pandemic, preprints played a critical role: over 30% of early COVID-19 research was first shared as preprints, accelerating the scientific response by months.

### Preprint-Journal Integration

Many journals now accept or encourage preprint posting:

- Over 70% of journals indexed by SHERPA/RoMEO allow preprint posting
- Some journals (*eLife*, *PLOS*) accept direct submission from preprint servers
- The "publish, then review" model is gaining traction, where preprints serve as the primary record and journals provide overlay review

## Open Source Software in Research

### The Software Problem

An estimated 90% of published research relies on software, yet:

- Most research software is not shared or archived
- Software citations remain inconsistent and undervalued
- The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) and similar venues have improved recognition but remain niche
- Software sustainability is a critical challenge -- key research tools often depend on unfunded volunteer maintenance

### Key Open Source Research Software

| Software | Domain | Users |
|----------|--------|-------|
| R | Statistical computing | ~2 million |
| Python (SciPy/NumPy) | Scientific computing | ~10 million |
| Jupyter | Interactive computing | ~10 million |
| Galaxy | Bioinformatics | ~400,000 |
| GROMACS | Molecular dynamics | ~50,000 |
| ROOT | High-energy physics | ~20,000 |

## Reproducibility and Open Science

### The Replication Challenge

The "replication crisis" intersects directly with open science:

- A 2016 *Nature* survey found that 70% of researchers had tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments
- Only 20-40% of published studies in psychology have been successfully replicated in large-scale replication projects
- Access to data, code, and detailed methods is essential for replication attempts
- Journals with open data requirements show higher replication rates

### Registered Reports

A growing number of journals accept "registered reports" -- peer review of methodology before data collection:

- Over 300 journals accept registered reports
- Studies using this format show less publication bias and more null results (indicating reduced selective reporting)

## International Context

### Plan S

Launched in 2018 by cOAlition S (a consortium of European funding agencies):

- Requires immediate open access for all publicly funded research
- Prohibits publication in hybrid journals (unless under transformative agreements)
- Requires retention of copyright by authors
- Implementation began January 2021
- Covers research funded by agencies in 27 countries

### Global Developments

| Country/Region | Open Access Policy | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| European Union | Horizon Europe OA mandate | Active since 2021 |
| United Kingdom | UKRI open access policy | Active since 2022 |
| China | Mandate for funded research | Expanding since 2022 |
| India | One Nation One Subscription plan | Under development |
| Latin America | SciELO, Redalyc (diamond OA) | Established, growing |
| Africa | AfricArXiv, AAS Open Research | Emerging |

Latin America represents a notably different model: the SciELO and Redalyc networks have maintained diamond open access journals for decades, demonstrating that neither authors nor readers need to pay for academic publishing.

## Key Challenges

### The "Big Deal" Lock-In

Universities remain locked into multi-year, multi-million-dollar subscription bundles:

- Cancellation risks losing access to decades of archived content
- Bundling makes it difficult to assess the value of individual journals
- Negotiation asymmetry: publishers have monopoly power over each journal's content
- The University of California system's 2019-2021 boycott of Elsevier demonstrated both the difficulty and possibility of institutional resistance

### Equity Concerns

- High APCs create a "pay-to-publish" barrier for researchers at underfunded institutions
- Researchers in the Global South face both access barriers (subscriptions) and publishing barriers (APCs)
- Diamond OA remains underfunded and underrecognized
- APC waivers are available but stigmatizing and inconsistently applied

### Compliance and Enforcement

- NIH public access compliance is approximately 90%, but enforcement of data sharing policies is weaker
- No federal agency has established meaningful penalties for non-compliance with open access mandates
- Publisher embargo violations and "green OA" restrictions remain common
