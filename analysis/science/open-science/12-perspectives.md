# Open Science: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes open science -- including open access publishing mandates, data sharing requirements, and publicly funded research transparency -- through nine distinct political perspectives. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints. Open science is notable for generating unusual cross-ideological alignments: taxpayer value arguments resonate with fiscal conservatives, transparency appeals to libertarians and populists, and equity concerns motivate progressives and democratic socialists.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Stated concern about government overreach often masks alignment with publisher donors; genuine fiscal responsibility concerns about taxpayer value are sometimes subordinated to industry relationships* |
| Principle consistency | *Fiscal conservatism (taxpayers should not pay twice) conflicts with deference to private business models; inconsistent application of free market principles when publishers are monopolists* |
| Goalpost stability | *Goals shift: some conservatives genuinely support taxpayer access; others oppose any new government mandates regardless of cost savings* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Moderate; willing to negotiate on implementation details but may oppose mandates on ideological grounds* |

**Justification:** Conservatives are split on open science. Fiscal conservatives recognize the taxpayer value argument, while anti-regulation conservatives resist any new mandates. Publisher campaign contributions complicate the picture. The 3/5 score reflects genuine internal tension, not bad faith.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Rep. Mike Doyle (R-PA) co-sponsored early OA legislation; bipartisan support existed before partisan polarization intensified*
- *Heritage Foundation has occasionally supported government efficiency measures that align with open access rationale*
- *Some Republican committee members opposed the Nelson memo as executive overreach while supporting the underlying goal in principle*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Agree that taxpayers fund research and should have access; skeptical of framing publishers as villains; question whether the problem requires government intervention* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Reject "market failure" framing; view publisher pricing as market outcome; partially agree that copyright framework needs updating but resist systemic critique* |

**Source references:**

- *American Enterprise Institute occasional papers on research policy*
- *R Street Institute support for government transparency and efficiency*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify federal OA mandates | 4/10 | *Prefer voluntary compliance over mandates* | *Concern about expanding government authority; some sensitivity to publisher lobbying* |
| Public infrastructure investment | 5/10 | *Support efficient use of existing systems; cautious about new spending* | *Fiscal restraint genuine but also limits competitors to private publishers* |
| Incentive reform | 6/10 | *Support reforming inefficient academic practices* | *Comfortable with changing university culture; less comfortable with federal directives* |
| Diamond OA | 3/10 | *Skeptical of government-funded publishing* | *View this as socialization of publishing industry* |
| Data sharing mandates | 5/10 | *Support transparency in principle; worry about regulatory burden* | *Genuine concern about compliance costs for small research groups* |
| Open source software | 5/10 | *Neutral to supportive; not a priority* | *No strong objection but no enthusiasm for federal software funding* |
| Preprints | 7/10 | *Support voluntary rapid communication* | *Like the voluntary, market-driven nature of preprints* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act | 4/10 | *Prefer executive implementation over legislation; concerned about scope* | *Publisher donor relationships; general resistance to new mandates* |
| Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act | 4/10 | *Support transparency but concerned about regulatory burden and cost* | *$300 million annual appropriation viewed as excessive* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would more readily support:

- Strengthening existing agency public access plans without new legislation
- Tax incentives for publishers who voluntarily adopt OA models
- Reducing regulatory burden on researchers by simplifying compliance requirements
- Market-based approaches: let competition drive down access costs

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on transparency), Populist (on anti-monopoly), Centrist (on pragmatic reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on taxpayer value), Constitutionalist (on limited federal role)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive and Democratic Socialist (on infrastructure spending and government role)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Strong alignment between stated support for public access and underlying values of equality and government responsibility* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistent application of public goods principles to research access; occasionally slow to act due to other legislative priorities* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable support for OA mandates; consistent on equity dimensions* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Low; generally willing to negotiate implementation details while maintaining core commitments* |

**Justification:** Liberals have been the most consistent legislative champions of open access, from the original NIH mandate through the Nelson memo. Minor deductions for occasionally prioritizing other issues and for some ambivalence about disrupting scientific societies that serve as allied institutions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Sen. Cornyn (R-TX) and Sen. Lieberman (I-CT) co-sponsored FASTR (Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act) with broad bipartisan support*
- *Obama administration issued the 2013 Holdren memo; Biden administration issued the 2022 Nelson memo*
- *Democratic members of House Science Committee have consistently supported OA legislation*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement with the analysis of paywall barriers, inequities in access, and the need for reform* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | *Agree with market failure analysis and publisher monopoly framing; may place less emphasis on academic incentive structures* |

**Source references:**

- *Center for American Progress reports on research access*
- *Congressional Democratic caucus statements on the Nelson memo*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify federal OA mandates | 9/10 | *Strong support for legislation making Nelson memo permanent* | *Want to ensure equity provisions are robust* |
| Public infrastructure investment | 8/10 | *Support federal investment in repositories and standards* | *Want infrastructure to be publicly controlled, not privatized* |
| Incentive reform | 7/10 | *Support reforming evaluation criteria* | *Cautious about disrupting institutions that may resist change* |
| Diamond OA | 8/10 | *Support public funding of no-cost journals* | *Want to ensure quality standards are maintained* |
| Data sharing mandates | 8/10 | *Strong support with appropriate privacy protections* | *Emphasis on privacy exceptions for human subjects research* |
| Open source software | 7/10 | *Support public investment in research tools* | *Less engaged on technical details* |
| Preprints | 7/10 | *Support with quality screening* | *Concern about misinformation risk without peer review* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act | 9/10 | *Strong support; would champion in committee* | *May seek stronger equity provisions and higher APC caps* |
| Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act | 8/10 | *Support comprehensive data sharing* | *Want robust privacy protections and adequate funding* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would strengthen the proposed legislation by:

- Expanding equity provisions to include dedicated support for under-resourced institutions
- Adding antitrust provisions targeting publisher market concentration
- Including earmarks for minority-serving institution repository support
- Strengthening enforcement mechanisms

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Centrist
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on taxpayer value), Populist (on anti-monopoly)
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right (low engagement with this issue)

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Perfect alignment: progressives view open science as part of broader agenda to democratize knowledge and challenge corporate power* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently apply anti-monopoly, public goods, and equity principles to research access* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable and ambitious; consistently push for the strongest possible reforms* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Very low; willing to build coalitions but unwilling to compromise on core equity principles* |

**Justification:** Progressives are the most ideologically committed supporters of open science. Their framing -- that publicly funded knowledge belongs to the public, that publisher monopolies extract rents from public goods, and that access barriers perpetuate inequality -- is highly consistent with their broader political philosophy.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have spoken against publisher monopoly profits*
- *Progressive think tanks (Roosevelt Institute, People's Policy Project) have published on knowledge commons and public goods*
- *Strong alignment with SPARC advocacy positions*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | *Full agreement with analysis of publisher monopoly, paywall harms, and systemic inequities* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | *Strong agreement with structural analysis; would add emphasis on capitalism and commodification of knowledge* |

**Source references:**

- *Roosevelt Institute reports on knowledge commons*
- *People's Policy Project advocacy for public goods*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify federal OA mandates | 10/10 | *Essential; make permanent and strengthen* | *Want strongest possible enforcement* |
| Public infrastructure investment | 10/10 | *Major public investment needed* | *Want to ensure infrastructure is publicly owned and governed* |
| Incentive reform | 9/10 | *Fundamental restructuring of academic evaluation* | *Want to address broader labor issues in academia simultaneously* |
| Diamond OA | 10/10 | *Preferred model; eliminate all financial barriers* | *View APC-based OA as merely shifting the paywall* |
| Data sharing mandates | 9/10 | *Strong support with equity focus* | *Want Global South access and participation built into design* |
| Open source software | 9/10 | *Public funding for public tools* | *Want worker protections for research software developers* |
| Preprints | 8/10 | *Support with quality assurance* | *Some concern about speed-over-rigor in competitive environments* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act | 8/10 | *Good start but should be stronger* | *Want prohibition on copyright transfer, not just retention of rights; want antitrust provisions* |
| Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act | 8/10 | *Support with stronger equity provisions* | *Want dedicated funding for Global South partnerships and MSI support* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would push beyond the proposed legislation to:

- Prohibit copyright transfer for any publicly funded research
- Break up publisher oligopoly through antitrust action
- Create a fully public, government-operated publishing platform
- Mandate diamond OA as the default model (not just an option)
- Provide reparative funding for Global South researchers harmed by paywall barriers

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist, Liberal
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-monopoly), Centrist (on evidence-based reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on scope of government intervention), Libertarian (on mandates)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuine principled tension between opposing government mandates and supporting transparency/anti-monopoly; no hidden agenda* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently apply liberty principles: oppose mandates but also oppose monopolies propped up by government (copyright) and funded by government* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable; positions follow logically from principles even when they produce nuanced results* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Low; willing to support reforms that expand freedom even if they involve some government action* |

**Justification:** Libertarians have a genuinely complex position on open science. They oppose government mandates in general but recognize that the current system is itself a product of government intervention (copyright law, federal funding). The most principled libertarian position supports open access as a condition of government spending while opposing mandates on privately funded research.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Cato Institute has published on copyright reform and the costs of intellectual property overreach*
- *Reason Foundation supports government transparency and efficient use of tax dollars*
- *Libertarian academics have been among the strongest proponents of preprints and voluntary OA*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | *Agree that paywalls for publicly funded research are problematic; view the problem as government-created (through copyright and funding) rather than market-created* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | *Agree that copyright framework and government policy distort the market; disagree with "market failure" framing -- see it as government failure* |

**Source references:**

- *Cato Institute publications on intellectual property reform*
- *Reason Foundation reports on government transparency*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify federal OA mandates | 6/10 | *Accept as condition on government spending, not general market regulation* | *Oppose mandates on privately funded research; want narrowly scoped authority* |
| Public infrastructure investment | 4/10 | *Prefer private and nonprofit infrastructure over government systems* | *Concern about government control of information distribution* |
| Incentive reform | 7/10 | *Strongly support; universities should set their own criteria* | *Want reform driven by institutions, not government directives* |
| Diamond OA | 3/10 | *Skeptical of government-funded publishing* | *Prefer market-driven solutions; concern about government editorial influence* |
| Data sharing mandates | 5/10 | *Support for government-funded research; oppose for private* | *Privacy concerns; want narrow scope* |
| Open source software | 6/10 | *Support voluntary open source; oppose mandates* | *Like the voluntary, community-driven nature of open source* |
| Preprints | 9/10 | *Strongly support voluntary rapid communication* | *Best example of market-driven solution to access problem* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act | 5/10 | *Support the principle; concerned about scope and enforcement overreach* | *Want narrower definition of "covered work"; oppose funding holds as coercive* |
| Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act | 4/10 | *$300 million appropriation is excessive; compliance burden too high* | *Want smaller government footprint; prefer voluntary data sharing with incentives* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would prefer:

- Copyright reform: Reduce copyright terms for academic works; expand fair use
- Contractual approach: Include OA provisions in individual grant agreements rather than legislation
- Eliminate government barriers: Remove copyright protections that give publishers monopoly power
- Voluntary initiatives: Support preprint adoption, institutional repository development without mandates
- Tax deductions for OA publishing costs rather than government-funded programs

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on limiting government scope), Populist (on anti-monopoly)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on copyright reform), Centrist (on pragmatic reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Democratic Socialist (on government role), Progressive (on infrastructure spending)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuine concern about constitutional authority and federalism; positions follow from principles rather than expedience* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently apply enumerated powers analysis; Spending Clause authority for federal research conditions is well-established* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable; focused on whether authority exists rather than policy merits* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Low; willing to support policies if constitutional basis is sound* |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists have a narrow but principled focus. They generally accept that the federal government may attach conditions to its own spending under the Spending Clause, which provides adequate constitutional basis for OA mandates on federally funded research. Their main concerns relate to scope (not extending to state-funded or private research) and executive authority (preferring legislation over executive memoranda).

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Federalist Society analyses have generally accepted Spending Clause authority for grant conditions*
- *Constitutionalist scholars have supported *South Dakota v. Dole* framework for conditional spending*
- *Concern about Nelson memo as potential executive overreach has been principled, not obstructive*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Partially agree with factual assessment; focus on constitutional dimensions rather than policy analysis* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *View root causes through constitutional lens: the problem is that executive action (Nelson memo) lacks statutory basis, not that publishers are monopolists* |

**Source references:**

- *Federalist Society panels on administrative law and executive authority*
- *Constitutional scholarship on Spending Clause conditions*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify federal OA mandates | 7/10 | *Strongly prefer legislation over executive memos; Spending Clause provides clear authority* | *Want explicit constitutional basis in legislative findings* |
| Public infrastructure investment | 5/10 | *Accept if within enumerated powers and properly appropriated* | *Want narrow scope; oppose unfunded mandates on states* |
| Incentive reform | 4/10 | *Federal government should not direct university employment decisions* | *Tenth Amendment concerns about federal interference in higher education* |
| Diamond OA | 4/10 | *Question constitutional basis for federal government operating journals* | *Prefer private sector and state solutions* |
| Data sharing mandates | 6/10 | *Accept as condition on federal grants; oppose applying to non-federal research* | *Want explicit Spending Clause basis and clear scope limitations* |
| Open source software | 5/10 | *Acceptable if narrowly authorized and properly appropriated* | *Standard appropriations concerns* |
| Preprints | 6/10 | *No constitutional objection; voluntary practices need no federal action* | *Prefer private initiative over government promotion* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act | 6/10 | *Prefer this legislative approach over executive memo; want narrower scope* | *Concerned about Section 4(c)(3) (voiding publisher contracts) -- potential Contracts Clause issue* |
| Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act | 5/10 | *Acceptable under Spending Clause; concerned about OSTP authority* | *Want Congress, not OSTP, to set standards; skeptical of delegated authority* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would modify the proposed legislation to:

- Remove provisions delegating standard-setting authority to OSTP (have Congress set frameworks)
- Narrow scope to clearly federally funded research only
- Add explicit Spending Clause findings to legislative text
- Remove Section 4(c)(3) (voiding publisher contracts) or add stronger legal justification
- Preserve state authority over state-funded research

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Libertarian (on limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on legislative approach over executive action), Liberal (on statutory codification)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive and Democratic Socialist (on scope of federal authority)

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuine anti-elite sentiment aligns with opposing publisher monopolies; however, populist engagement with science policy is episodic and influenced by culture war dynamics* |
| Principle consistency | *Anti-monopoly principles consistently support challenging publisher oligopoly; however, anti-expert sentiment sometimes undermines support for research investment* |
| Goalpost stability | *Moderate; positions can shift based on political dynamics and perceived elite alignment* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Moderate; framing matters -- "taxpayers vs. corporations" wins support, "government spending on science" may not* |

**Justification:** Populists have strong potential alignment with open science through the anti-monopoly and taxpayer value frames. However, broader populist skepticism of academic expertise and scientific institutions creates tension. The framing of the issue matters enormously for populist engagement.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan populist support for antitrust action against Big Tech extends logically to Big Publishing*
- *Populist skepticism of "the establishment" can cut both ways: against publishers and against scientists*
- *Rural populist concern about access to agricultural research aligns with OA goals*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | *Strongly agree that corporations are profiting from taxpayer-funded work; agree that ordinary people lack access to research they paid for* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | *Agree on publisher monopoly and corporate greed; less engaged with academic incentive structures and infrastructure analysis* |

**Source references:**

- *Bipartisan populist anti-monopoly rhetoric from both Trump-aligned and Sanders-aligned politicians*
- *Rural advocacy groups' calls for access to agricultural and environmental research*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify federal OA mandates | 7/10 | *Support making corporations give back what taxpayers paid for* | *Frame as anti-corporate, not pro-government* |
| Public infrastructure investment | 5/10 | *Mixed; support anti-monopoly but skeptical of government programs* | *Want visible, tangible benefits to ordinary people* |
| Incentive reform | 4/10 | *Less engaged; academic tenure is elite concern* | *View academic incentives as insider problem* |
| Diamond OA | 5/10 | *Support free access; uncertain about government-run journals* | *Want simple, visible results* |
| Data sharing mandates | 6/10 | *Support transparency; "what are they hiding?"* | *Transparency framing resonates; regulatory burden framing does not* |
| Open source software | 4/10 | *Low engagement; technical issue* | *Not a priority* |
| Preprints | 5/10 | *Mixed; support access but distrust unreviewed claims* | *COVID preprint controversies reduced trust* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act | 6/10 | *Support the "taxpayers shouldn't pay twice" message* | *Concerned about government bureaucracy in implementation* |
| Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act | 5/10 | *Support transparency; skeptical of $300M price tag* | *Want to see direct benefits to working people, not just researchers* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would emphasize:

- Direct public access portals (simple, user-friendly, not academic)
- Antitrust enforcement against publisher monopolies as primary strategy
- Penalties for publishers profiting from taxpayer-funded work
- Requirements that research results be communicated in plain language
- Focus on research areas directly affecting working families (healthcare, agriculture, environment)

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on anti-monopoly), Conservative (on taxpayer value)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on access equity), Libertarian (on anti-monopoly)
- **Unlikely partners:** Constitutionalist (focus too narrow), Religious Right (low engagement)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Genuine commitment to evidence-based, pragmatic policy; no hidden agenda on open science* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently apply cost-benefit analysis and incremental reform principles* |
| Goalpost stability | *Very stable; support has grown as evidence of OA benefits has accumulated* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Very low; actively seek compromises and bipartisan solutions* |

**Justification:** Centrists are natural champions of open science because the evidence base is strong, the cost-benefit analysis is favorable, and the issue has genuine bipartisan appeal. The Nelson memo was itself a centrist policy achievement -- evidence-based, pragmatic, and building on existing structures.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center has supported evidence-based policymaking that requires open data*
- *Nelson memo was issued by a Democratic administration building on bipartisan foundation*
- *Research funding has historically received bipartisan congressional support*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | *Strong agreement with evidence-based analysis of the access problem and publishing economics* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | *Agree with most causal analysis; may place more weight on practical barriers than systemic critique* |

**Source references:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center reports on research policy*
- *Evidence-based policymaking movement publications*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify federal OA mandates | 8/10 | *Support legislative codification as pragmatic and necessary* | *Want reasonable implementation timeline and adequate funding* |
| Public infrastructure investment | 8/10 | *Support efficient, well-designed investment* | *Want cost-effectiveness analysis and performance metrics* |
| Incentive reform | 7/10 | *Support evidence-based reform of evaluation criteria* | *Prefer gradual adoption over mandates* |
| Diamond OA | 6/10 | *Support as one option among several* | *Want cost comparison with other models before committing* |
| Data sharing mandates | 8/10 | *Strong support for transparency and reproducibility* | *Want practical, achievable compliance requirements* |
| Open source software | 7/10 | *Support as good governance and efficiency measure* | *Want demonstrated return on investment* |
| Preprints | 7/10 | *Support with appropriate quality assurance* | *Want clear distinction between preprints and peer-reviewed articles* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act | 8/10 | *Good framework; would support with minor amendments* | *May want longer implementation timeline for some agencies* |
| Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act | 7/10 | *Support with adequate appropriations* | *Want performance metrics and GAO oversight* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would refine rather than replace the proposed legislation:

- Add explicit performance metrics and reporting requirements
- Include cost-effectiveness review at year 3
- Phase implementation more gradually for smaller agencies
- Build in stakeholder consultation requirements
- Add sunset provisions with reauthorization

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Conservative (on pragmatic reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on transparency), Constitutionalist (on legislative approach), Populist (on anti-monopoly)
- **Unlikely partners:** None -- centrists can work with all perspectives on this issue

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Limited engagement with open science as a policy area; positions largely follow conservative coalition rather than independent analysis* |
| Principle consistency | *Religious liberty and moral values principles do not directly implicate open science; positions are derivative* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable but passive; unlikely to shift unless issue intersects with culture war topics* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Low on this specific issue; no active opposition* |

**Justification:** The Religious Right has minimal direct engagement with open science policy. Their positions generally follow the conservative coalition on fiscal and regulatory matters. The main potential intersection is research ethics (stem cell research, reproductive health), where some Religious Right groups might oppose data sharing for research they find morally objectionable, but this is a narrow concern.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Focus on the Family and similar organizations have not taken positions on open access*
- *Religious Right political engagement focuses on social issues, not research policy*
- *Some faith-based organizations support scientific transparency as part of broader accountability*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Minimal engagement; no strong agreement or disagreement with factual analysis* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Follow conservative coalition; some sympathy for market-based analysis of publisher role* |

**Source references:**

- *Limited direct sources; positions inferred from conservative coalition alignment*
- *National Association of Evangelicals statements on stewardship, which could support taxpayer value arguments*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act | 4/10 | *Follow conservative coalition; no independent analysis* | *Deference to allied perspectives on government mandates* |
| Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act | 4/10 | *Cautious about scope; potential concern about morally contested research* | *May seek exception for data from research they find objectionable* |

#### Alternative Proposals

The Religious Right would primarily defer to conservative coalition positions. They might specifically advocate for:

- Conscience protections for researchers who object to participating in data sharing for morally contested research
- Ensuring open access does not facilitate morally problematic research applications
- Faith-based institution protections in any open science mandates

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on limited government), Constitutionalist (on federal scope)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-elite framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Liberal (on science policy generally)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Perfect alignment: open science embodies core democratic socialist principles of public goods, democratic control, and opposition to corporate rent-seeking* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently apply public ownership, worker rights, and anti-commodification principles to research access* |
| Goalpost stability | *Very stable; consistently advocate for the strongest possible public ownership model* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Very low; willing to build coalitions while maintaining principled commitments* |

**Justification:** Democratic socialists view open science as a paradigmatic case for their broader worldview: publicly funded knowledge should be a public good, not a source of private profit. Their positions are internally consistent, principled, and predictable. They are the strongest advocates for diamond OA and public infrastructure.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Sen. Bernie Sanders has spoken against pharmaceutical company practices and corporate extraction from public research*
- *Jacobin magazine and similar publications have featured articles on knowledge commons and publisher monopolies*
- *Democratic Socialists of America platform supports public ownership of essential services and infrastructure*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | *Full agreement with analysis of publisher profits, public funding, and access inequities* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | *Strong agreement; would further emphasize capitalism and commodification as root causes* |

**Source references:**

- *Jacobin, Current Affairs articles on knowledge commons*
- *DSA platform on public goods and democratic control*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Codify federal OA mandates | 9/10 | *Essential but insufficient alone* | *Want mandates combined with structural reform of publishing industry* |
| Public infrastructure investment | 10/10 | *Major investment in public infrastructure is core priority* | *Want public ownership and governance, not public-private partnerships* |
| Incentive reform | 9/10 | *Fundamental restructuring needed* | *Want to address broader labor issues: adjunctification, precarity, worker rights in academia* |
| Diamond OA | 10/10 | *The right model: knowledge as a public good, not a commodity* | *Opposed to APC-based models that maintain financial barriers* |
| Data sharing mandates | 9/10 | *Strong support; data is a public resource* | *Want to ensure corporations cannot privatize publicly funded data* |
| Open source software | 9/10 | *Public funding for public tools; fair labor for developers* | *Want research software developers treated as skilled workers with fair compensation, not volunteers* |
| Preprints | 8/10 | *Support as step toward de-commodification of knowledge* | *Want quality assurance through public peer review, not corporate gatekeeping* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act | 8/10 | *Good foundation; should go further* | *Want to prohibit all copyright transfer for publicly funded work; add antitrust provisions* |
| Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act | 8/10 | *Support; want stronger public ownership provisions* | *Want to prevent corporate capture of publicly funded data and infrastructure* |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic socialists would push beyond the proposed legislation to:

- Create a publicly owned, federally operated publishing platform as an alternative to commercial publishers
- Prohibit APCs entirely for publicly funded research (mandate diamond OA)
- Nationalize or regulate academic publishing as a public utility
- Fund research software development as public employment, not grants
- Establish international solidarity programs for Global South research access
- Address academic labor conditions (adjunct pay, postdoc precarity) as part of open science reform

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Liberal
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-corporate framing), Centrist (on evidence-based investment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on government role), Libertarian (on mandates and public ownership), Religious Right (on broader agenda)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Codify OA mandates | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Religious Right | None (opposition is soft) |
| Public infrastructure | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right | None |
| Incentive reform | Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Democratic Socialist, Religious Right | Constitutionalist, Populist | None |
| Diamond OA | Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Religious Right | None (opposition is preference, not structural) |
| Data sharing mandates | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Religious Right | None |
| Preprints | All 9 perspectives score 5+ | None | None |

**Key insight:** Preprints have the broadest cross-ideological support. Codifying OA mandates and data sharing have strong supermajority support (7/9 perspectives). Diamond OA and public infrastructure have majority support but face soft opposition from fiscally conservative perspectives. No reform faces *structural* opposition -- all opposition is a matter of degree, not fundamental principle, making this a highly promising area for bipartisan legislation.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Taxpayer Research Access Act*

**Bridges:** *Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist + Constitutionalist*

**Core Agreement:** *Taxpayers who fund research should not pay twice for access. Legislative codification is preferable to executive memoranda.*

**Policy Description:**

A streamlined version of the Public Access to Publicly Funded Research Act that focuses on the core taxpayer access argument while minimizing provisions that trigger opposition:

- Codify immediate open access for all federally funded research with statutory permanence
- Mandate green OA deposit (accepted manuscripts) as the default compliance pathway, eliminating the need to address APCs
- Author copyright retention sufficient for deposit and public access
- Phased implementation: large agencies (NIH, NSF, DOE) in year 1, all agencies by year 3
- Performance metrics and GAO review at year 3
- Modest appropriation ($75 million/year) for repository infrastructure

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | *Fiscal responsibility: ends double payment; limited new spending; no mandate on private research* |
| Liberal | *Public access achieved; equity preserved through green OA (no APC barrier)* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based, pragmatic, phased implementation with performance metrics* |
| Populist | *Clear anti-corporate message: taxpayers stop paying twice* |
| Constitutionalist | *Statutory codification with clear Spending Clause basis; replaces executive overreach* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | *Accept new legislation rather than voluntary compliance* |
| Liberal | *Accept smaller appropriation and phased implementation* |
| Progressive | *Accept green OA rather than gold/diamond; accept gradual approach* |
| Populist | *Accept technical legislative approach rather than populist antitrust framing* |
| Constitutionalist | *Accept federal action on research access* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives (all except Religious Right [passive] and Democratic Socialist [want more])
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *High. Taxpayer value argument is resilient across political cycles. Green OA pathway avoids publisher revenue disruption, reducing lobbying opposition.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Bipartisan bill in Senate Commerce or HELP Committee; attach to appropriations if standalone bill stalls.*

---

### Compromise 2: *Research Transparency and Reproducibility Act*

**Bridges:** *Liberal + Centrist + Progressive + Libertarian + Conservative*

**Core Agreement:** *Scientific research funded by the public should be transparent and reproducible. Data sharing and open methods serve both accountability and scientific quality.*

**Policy Description:**

A focused version of the Federal Research Data Sharing and Transparency Act emphasizing transparency and reproducibility rather than comprehensive data infrastructure:

- Require data management plans for all federal grants (extending NIH model to all agencies)
- Mandate deposit of data underlying publications in approved repositories
- Require code sharing for computational research
- Fund FAIR compliance tools and training ($50 million/year)
- Incentivize (but do not mandate) open science practices in grant review
- Accept preprints in all federal grant applications

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | *Transparency and accountability; reproducibility improves research quality* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based policy requires reproducible evidence; practical and achievable* |
| Progressive | *Step toward comprehensive open science; data as public good* |
| Libertarian | *Transparency and accountability for government spending; voluntary incentives* |
| Conservative | *Efficient use of taxpayer funds; reducing waste from irreproducible research* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | *Accept incentives rather than mandates for some provisions* |
| Progressive | *Accept incremental approach; defer comprehensive infrastructure* |
| Libertarian | *Accept data management plan requirements as condition of grants* |
| Conservative | *Accept $50 million annual appropriation* |
| Centrist | *Accept that some provisions use mandates rather than incentives only* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *High. Reproducibility and transparency arguments are politically resilient. Modest cost reduces fiscal opposition.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Bipartisan bill building on existing NIH policy. Strong scientific community support. Could be included in next NSF or NIH reauthorization.*

---

### Compromise 3: *Preprint and Rapid Communication Support Act*

**Bridges:** *Libertarian + Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Progressive + Populist*

**Core Agreement:** *Preprints represent a market-driven, voluntary innovation that accelerates science and reduces dependence on publisher monopolies. Federal support for preprint infrastructure is a modest, high-return investment.*

**Policy Description:**

A narrowly scoped bill providing federal support for preprint servers and rapid scientific communication:

- Federal funding ($20 million/year) for preprint server operations (arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, disciplinary servers) as public research infrastructure
- All federal agencies accept preprints in grant applications
- Fund development of preprint screening and quality assurance tools
- Support overlay journal development (peer review of preprints without traditional journal infrastructure)
- No new mandates on researchers or publishers

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Libertarian | *Voluntary, market-driven innovation; reduces monopoly power without mandates* |
| Conservative | *Modest cost; supports competition; no new regulations* |
| Liberal | *Expands access; supports quality assurance; equity through free posting* |
| Centrist | *Pragmatic, evidence-based, low-cost, high-return investment* |
| Progressive | *Step toward de-commodification; public infrastructure* |
| Populist | *Free access to research; anti-monopoly effect* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Libertarian | *Accept federal funding for infrastructure (prefer private)* |
| Conservative | *Accept new federal spending, albeit modest* |
| Progressive | *Accept voluntary approach; no mandates* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Accept market-based framing; much less than full public publishing platform* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 8/9 perspectives (all except Religious Right, who are neutral)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 6/8 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *Very high. Preprints are popular with researchers, low-cost, voluntary, and politically uncontroversial. COVID demonstrated their value.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Could pass as standalone bill or amendment to NSF/NIH authorization. Minimal lobbying opposition. Strong scientific community support.*

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The broadest viable coalition for open science legislation includes Liberals, Centrists, Progressives, and selectively Conservatives, Libertarians, and Populists. The "taxpayer value" frame is the most effective bridge to right-of-center perspectives. The preprint support compromise achieves near-universal support and should be pursued as low-hanging fruit while building toward more comprehensive legislation.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Publisher lobbying**: The most significant obstacle is not ideological opposition but industry lobbying. Publishers spend significantly on campaign contributions and employ former congressional staff. Overcoming this requires strong public awareness campaigns emphasizing the "pay twice" message.

2. **Legislative bandwidth**: Open science competes for congressional attention with higher-profile issues. Attaching provisions to must-pass bills (appropriations, agency reauthorizations) may be more practical than standalone legislation.

3. **Implementation capacity**: Even with bipartisan support, federal agencies have limited capacity to implement new mandates. Adequate appropriations are essential.

### Low Consistency Partners

Conservative, Populist, and Religious Right perspectives score 3/5 on consistency, but for different reasons:

- **Conservative**: Internal tension between fiscal responsibility (supports OA) and anti-regulation instincts (opposes mandates). Address by emphasizing taxpayer value and green OA pathway.
- **Populist**: Episodic engagement; positions influenced by framing. Address by consistently using anti-corporate, taxpayer-first messaging.
- **Religious Right**: Passive rather than inconsistent; low engagement. No specific strategy needed beyond not alienating them.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Immediate**: Pursue Compromise 3 (Preprint Support Act) as quick win with near-universal support
2. **Near-term**: Pursue Compromise 1 (Taxpayer Research Access Act) codifying the Nelson memo with bipartisan framing
3. **Medium-term**: Pursue Compromise 2 (Research Transparency and Reproducibility Act) building on established data sharing precedents
4. **Long-term**: Build toward comprehensive open science infrastructure investment, including diamond OA support, as the political environment allows

This sequenced approach builds momentum, demonstrates success, and gradually shifts the Overton window toward full open science.
