# Open Science: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to open science comes primarily from commercial publishers whose business models depend on restricted access, but also from scientific societies dependent on publishing revenue, some researchers who benefit from the current prestige system, and ideological opponents of government mandates. Understanding opposition arguments -- and their weaknesses -- is essential for advancing reform.

## Primary Opposition: Commercial Publishers

### Elsevier (RELX Group)

**Revenue at Stake**: Approximately $3.7 billion annually in scientific, technical, and medical publishing

**Arguments Against Open Access Mandates**:

- Publishers add significant value through editorial management, peer review coordination, copyediting, typesetting, and digital distribution
- Immediate OA mandates undermine the subscription model that funds these services
- APCs are a fair and sustainable alternative to subscriptions
- The 12-month embargo was a reasonable compromise that allowed publishers to recoup investment

**Lobbying Activities**:

- Supported the Research Works Act (H.R. 3699, 2011), which would have prohibited federal OA mandates
- Funded industry groups including the Association of American Publishers (AAP) and the International Association of STM Publishers
- Lobbied against the Nelson memo through industry coalitions
- Employed former congressional staffers and OSTP officials
- Campaign contributions to members of relevant congressional committees

**Counterarguments**:

- Publishers receive content (manuscripts) and quality control (peer review) for free from researchers funded by public money
- The editorial "value add" claimed by publishers has been estimated at $200-$400 per article, far below typical subscription or APC costs
- Profit margins of 25-37% are inconsistent with claims of providing essential services at cost
- The cost of digital distribution has decreased dramatically while subscription prices have increased

### Springer Nature

**Revenue at Stake**: Approximately $1.9 billion annually

**Specific Concerns**:

- *Nature* brand represents enormous value; immediate OA could reduce brand exclusivity
- Launched *Nature* gold OA option at $11,390 per article, one of the highest APCs in academic publishing
- Argues that high-quality editorial services justify premium pricing
- Invested heavily in transformative agreements as preferred transition model

### Wiley

**Revenue at Stake**: Approximately $1.2 billion annually in research publishing

**Specific Concerns**:

- Acquired Hindawi (OA publisher) for $298 million in 2021, betting on APC-based OA future
- Subsequently discovered significant integrity issues in Hindawi journals, raising questions about quality control in high-volume OA publishing
- Argues that publisher-managed quality control is essential and costly

### Industry Associations

**Association of American Publishers (AAP)**:

- Primary lobbying arm for publisher opposition to federal mandates
- Argued that the Nelson memo exceeded OSTP's authority
- Framed OA mandates as government overreach that threatens intellectual property rights
- Claimed mandates would destroy jobs in the publishing industry
- Lobbied Congress members to oppose legislation codifying OA mandates

**International Association of STM Publishers**:

- Represents over 150 publishers globally
- Advocates for "voluntary" transition to OA rather than mandates
- Promotes transformative agreements as the preferred model
- Opposes green OA policies that allow authors to share accepted manuscripts

## Secondary Opposition: Scientific Societies

### The Revenue Dependency Problem

Many scientific societies derive 30-60% of their revenue from journal publishing:

| Society | Estimated Publishing Revenue Share | Key Concern |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| American Chemical Society | ~55% | Journal revenue funds education, advocacy programs |
| American Medical Association | ~40% | *JAMA* revenue supports public health initiatives |
| IEEE | ~35% | Publishing revenue funds standards development |
| American Psychological Association | ~45% | Journal revenue funds professional development |
| Royal Society of Chemistry | ~70% | Heavy dependence on publishing revenue |

**Their Argument**: Mandated OA would devastate society revenues, forcing cuts to conferences, educational programs, professional development, and advocacy activities that benefit science and the public.

**Counterarguments**:

- Society publishing operations could transition to diamond OA funded by membership dues, institutional contributions, or grant-funded APCs
- Some societies (American Physical Society, for example) have successfully adapted to preprint culture without revenue collapse
- The argument that restricting public access is necessary to fund society activities is a form of cross-subsidy that should be transparent and evaluated on its merits
- Federal agencies could include funding for society transitions in their OA implementation plans

## Tertiary Opposition: Ideological and Institutional

### Free Market Opponents

**Argument**: Government mandates on how research is published represent inappropriate interference in private markets. Publishers have property rights to the works they produce, and the government should not dictate business models.

**Proponents**: Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, some Republican members of Congress

**Counterarguments**:

- The government is not mandating how private research is published -- it is setting conditions on the use of public funds
- Taxpayer-funded research creates a legitimate public interest in public access
- The academic publishing market is not a free market; it is characterized by monopoly pricing, bundled products, and captive customers
- The Bayh-Dole Act (1980) already established the principle that government can attach conditions to publicly funded research outputs

### Copyright Absolutists

**Argument**: Open access mandates violate publishers' copyright and intellectual property rights. Authors who voluntarily transfer copyright should not have their agreements overridden by government policy.

**Counterarguments**:

- Copyright transfer is rarely "voluntary" in a meaningful sense; it is a condition of publication in most journals
- The government can require conditions on publicly funded work without violating copyright (parallel to Bayh-Dole for patents)
- Author-retained copyright with publisher licensing is the norm in many other industries
- The public interest in accessing publicly funded research outweighs publisher claims to exclusive control

### Quality Concerns

**Argument**: Open access, particularly through preprint servers and low-APC journals, threatens the quality of scientific communication by bypassing or weakening peer review.

**Proponents**: Some senior researchers, editors of prestigious journals

**Specific Claims**:

- Predatory journals exploit the OA model to publish unreviewed or poorly reviewed work
- Preprints can spread misinformation (cited frequently during COVID-19)
- High-APC journals maintain quality; low-cost or free alternatives cannot

**Counterarguments**:

- The quality of peer review is independent of the business model; paywalled journals also publish flawed research
- The replication crisis demonstrates that traditional peer review is far from a reliable quality filter
- Preprint servers increasingly incorporate screening and community review
- Diamond OA journals in Latin America (SciELO) and Europe (Open Library of Humanities) demonstrate that quality does not require APCs
- Predatory journals are a problem of the APC model specifically, not of open access generally

## Opposition Arguments and Responses

### "Publishers Add Value"

| Claimed Value | Reality | Cost |
|---------------|---------|------|
| Peer review coordination | Unpaid labor by academics | Publisher cost: ~$100/article |
| Copyediting and typesetting | Increasingly automated or outsourced | Publisher cost: ~$100-$200/article |
| Digital hosting and distribution | Commodity technology | Publisher cost: ~$50/article |
| Brand and prestige | Real but artificially scarce | No marginal cost |
| Discoverability (indexing, metadata) | Increasingly provided by Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar | Minimal cost |
| Archiving and preservation | Often done by libraries (LOCKSS, CLOCKSS) | Externalized cost |

Total estimated cost of publisher value-add per article: $200-$400. Average revenue per article: $3,000-$5,000. The gap represents the "prestige premium" -- payment for the journal's brand, not for services rendered.

### "The Transition Will Be Chaotic"

**Publisher Argument**: Rapid transition to OA will disrupt the publishing ecosystem, causing journal closures, job losses, and gaps in the scientific record.

**Response**:

- Gradual transition has been ongoing for two decades with minimal disruption
- The Nelson memo provides a multi-year implementation timeline
- Transformative agreements provide a managed transition path
- Publisher profits provide substantial buffer for adaptation
- The disruption argument has been made repeatedly since 2001 and has not materialized

### "Researchers Want the Current System"

**Publisher Argument**: Researchers choose to publish in subscription journals because they value the services provided.

**Response**:

- Researchers "choose" subscription journals because the incentive structure rewards it, not because they prefer restricted access
- Surveys consistently show that researchers support open access in principle but feel constrained by career incentives
- When mandates are implemented (NIH, for example), compliance is high, suggesting latent demand for OA
- The "choice" framing ignores the structural factors that drive publishing decisions

## Opposition Strategy Analysis

### Publisher Strategies

1. **Delay**: Advocate for lengthy implementation timelines and voluntary approaches
2. **Co-opt**: Promote publisher-friendly OA models (high-APC gold OA) that preserve revenue
3. **Lobby**: Campaign contributions, industry associations, revolving door between publishers and government
4. **Litigate**: Threaten legal challenges to OA mandates on copyright or administrative law grounds
5. **Acquire**: Buy OA infrastructure (repositories, preprint servers, OA publishers) to control the transition
6. **Rebrand**: Market subscription services as "value-added" products distinct from basic access

### How to Counter

- **Coalition building**: Unite researchers, universities, librarians, and public interest groups
- **Congressional codification**: Legislate OA requirements so they survive changes in administration
- **Infrastructure investment**: Build public alternatives to publisher-controlled platforms
- **Incentive reform**: Change tenure and promotion criteria to value openness
- **Public awareness**: Educate taxpayers about the double-payment problem
- **International coordination**: Align U.S. policy with Plan S and other international mandates
- **Antitrust scrutiny**: Address publisher monopoly power through competition policy

## Assessing Opposition Strength

| Opposition Group | Financial Resources | Political Influence | Public Sympathy | Trend |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|----|
| Commercial publishers | Very high | High (lobbying) | Low | Weakening |
| Scientific societies | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Shifting toward OA |
| Free market ideologues | Moderate | Moderate | Low for this issue | Stable |
| Copyright absolutists | Low | Low | Low | Weakening |
| Quality concern advocates | Low | Moderate (credibility) | Moderate | Addressable |

The overall trajectory favors open science. Publisher opposition remains the most significant barrier, but their leverage is declining as alternative infrastructure matures and political consensus builds around public access.
