# Open Science: Actions

## Overview

Every stakeholder in the research ecosystem can take concrete steps to advance open science. This document provides specific, actionable items organized by audience.

## For Researchers

### Immediate Actions

- **Post preprints**: Share manuscripts on arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, or a disciplinary preprint server before or simultaneously with journal submission
- **Retain your copyright**: Negotiate with publishers to retain copyright or use an author addendum (SPARC Author Addendum available at <https://sparcopen.org/our-work/author-rights/>)
- **Choose open access journals**: When possible, publish in fully open access journals rather than subscription or hybrid journals
- **Share data**: Deposit research data in an appropriate repository (Zenodo, Dryad, Figshare, or a disciplinary repository) at the time of publication
- **Share code**: Make analysis scripts and research software available on GitHub, GitLab, or a similar platform under an open license
- **Use persistent identifiers**: Register for an ORCID and use DOIs for datasets and software
- **Comply with mandates**: Ensure compliance with your funder's open access and data sharing requirements

### Career-Building Actions

- **Sign DORA**: Add your name to the Declaration on Research Assessment (<https://sfdora.org>)
- **Serve as an open access advocate in your department**: Volunteer for committee positions where publishing and evaluation policies are set
- **Cite open resources**: When choosing among citations, prefer open access publications and cite datasets and software explicitly
- **Mentor open science practices**: Teach graduate students and postdocs about preprints, data management, and open licensing
- **Use registered reports**: Consider the registered report format for confirmatory research to reduce publication bias

### Advocacy Actions

- **Write to your professional society**: Urge your scientific society to transition its journals to open access
- **Contact your representatives**: Support federal legislation codifying open access mandates (see [Legislation](11-legislation.md))
- **Participate in Open Access Week**: Use the annual event (third week of October) to promote open science at your institution
- **Blog and tweet about open science**: Public communication normalizes open practices

## For University Faculty and Department Chairs

### Policy Actions

- **Propose an institutional OA policy**: Harvard, MIT, and the University of California have adopted policies requiring faculty to deposit publications in institutional repositories; advocate for similar policies at your institution
- **Reform tenure and promotion criteria**: Push for evaluation of research quality, impact, and openness rather than journal prestige
- **Include open science in graduate training**: Ensure PhD programs include training in data management, reproducible research, and open access publishing
- **Allocate OA funds**: Advocate for departmental or institutional funds to cover article processing charges

### Cultural Change

- **Value diverse outputs**: Recognize datasets, software, preprints, and policy briefs as legitimate scholarly contributions
- **Discuss open science at faculty meetings**: Normalize the conversation about changing publishing norms
- **Lead by example**: Senior faculty who publish openly and share data reduce risk for junior colleagues

## For University Administrators and Librarians

### Strategic Actions

- **Negotiate transformative agreements**: Work with library consortia to convert subscription payments into open access publishing agreements
- **Invest in repository infrastructure**: Ensure your institutional repository is well-maintained, discoverable, and easy for researchers to use
- **Track total publishing costs**: Calculate the combined institutional spending on subscriptions, APCs, and repository operations to inform strategic decisions
- **Join SPARC**: Participate in collective advocacy through the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition
- **Adopt DORA institutionally**: Commit your institution to research assessment reform

### Budget Actions

- **Redirect subscription savings**: As journals convert to OA, reinvest savings in open science infrastructure, data stewardship positions, and researcher support
- **Create OA publishing funds**: Establish institutional funds to cover APCs, prioritizing researchers without grant funding
- **Fund data stewards**: Hire dedicated staff to support research data management and FAIR compliance

### Infrastructure Actions

- **Maintain a robust institutional repository**: Ensure your IR integrates with federal repositories and supports all output types (publications, data, software, preprints)
- **Provide Unpaywall and open access discovery tools**: Ensure your community can find legal open access versions of articles
- **Offer data management support**: Provide consultations and tools for researchers preparing data management plans

## For Students

### Immediate Actions

- **Use open access tools**: Install the Unpaywall browser extension (<https://unpaywall.org>) to find free versions of paywalled articles
- **Request open access copies**: Use the Open Access Button (<https://openaccessbutton.org>) to request copies directly from authors
- **Choose open textbooks**: When available, prefer open educational resources over expensive textbooks
- **Learn data management**: Take advantage of institutional training in data management and reproducible research

### Advocacy Actions

- **Join the Right to Research Coalition**: Connect with student-led OA advocacy (<https://righttoresearch.org>)
- **Petition your university**: Advocate for institutional OA policies and OA publishing funds
- **Contact elected officials**: Student voices can be powerful advocates for public access to research
- **Write op-eds**: Campus newspapers and local media amplify awareness of paywall barriers

## For Policymakers and Congressional Staff

### Legislative Actions

- **Co-sponsor open access legislation**: Support bills that codify the Nelson memo and fund open science infrastructure (see [Legislation](11-legislation.md))
- **Fund federal repositories**: Appropriate sufficient resources for PubMed Central, NSF PAR, DOE PAGES, and similar infrastructure
- **Require agency compliance reporting**: Mandate that federal agencies report annually on open access compliance rates
- **Hold oversight hearings**: Examine the academic publishing market, including publisher profit margins, APC inflation, and bundling practices

### Executive Actions

- **Protect the Nelson memo**: Ensure that future administrations cannot easily reverse open access requirements
- **Fund OSTP coordination**: Ensure OSTP has sufficient staff to coordinate open science implementation across agencies
- **Include open science in appropriations language**: Direct agencies to implement and enforce open access and data sharing policies

## For Scientific Societies

### Transition Actions

- **Develop an OA transition plan**: Assess publishing revenue, identify alternative funding sources, and create a timeline for converting journals to OA
- **Explore diamond OA**: Consider models where journals are funded by membership dues, institutional contributions, or grants rather than subscriptions or APCs
- **Adopt open licensing**: Use CC-BY or similar licenses for society publications
- **Support preprints**: Develop society policies explicitly permitting or encouraging preprint posting

### Advocacy Actions

- **Endorse open access mandates**: Publicly support the Nelson memo and federal legislation
- **Sign DORA**: Commit to research assessment reform at the society level
- **Provide member education**: Help members understand and comply with open access requirements

## For Journalists and Science Communicators

### Practical Actions

- **Use Unpaywall and preprint servers**: Access open versions of research rather than relying only on press releases
- **Report on the access problem**: Stories about paywall barriers, publisher profits, and public access resonate with general audiences
- **Link to open access versions**: When covering research, include links to freely accessible copies when available
- **Investigate publisher practices**: Report on APC inflation, bundling practices, and the economics of academic publishing

## For the General Public

### Immediate Actions

- **Contact your representatives**: Express support for public access to publicly funded research. Emphasize that taxpayers should not pay twice for research results
- **Use open access resources**: PubMed Central (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/>) provides free access to millions of biomedical articles
- **Support open science organizations**: Donate to or volunteer with SPARC, Creative Commons, the Center for Open Science, or similar organizations
- **Share open access articles**: When you find freely available research relevant to public debates, share it widely

### Awareness Actions

- **Learn about the issue**: Read Peter Suber's *Open Access* (freely available at <https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/open-access>) for a comprehensive introduction
- **Follow Open Access Week**: The annual event (third week of October) features public events and resources
- **Ask questions**: When media report on research findings, ask whether the underlying study is freely available
