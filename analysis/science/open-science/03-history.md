# Open Science: History

## The Origins of Scientific Communication

### The Journal System (1665-1945)

- **1665**: The *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society* and the French *Journal des savants* became the first scientific journals, establishing the model of peer-reviewed publication that persists today
- **17th-19th centuries**: Scientific societies (Royal Society, American Association for the Advancement of Science) published journals as a service to members, not as profit centers
- **1869**: *Nature* founded by Alexander Macmillan as a weekly journal of science, initially operating at a loss for decades
- **1880**: *Science* founded with financial backing from Thomas Edison, later becoming the journal of AAAS
- **Early 20th century**: University presses and scientific societies controlled the majority of journal publishing, operating on modest budgets with subsidized labor

### The Commercial Publishing Revolution (1945-1990)

- **1946**: Robert Maxwell founded Pergamon Press, pioneering the commercial scientific publishing model by recognizing that scientists would provide content and peer review for free while institutions would pay for access
- **1951**: Elsevier began acquiring scientific journals, building what would become the largest portfolio in academic publishing
- **1960s-1970s**: The "serials crisis" began as commercial publishers raised subscription prices far above inflation, exploiting the inelastic demand of research libraries
- **1974**: The price of scientific journals began consistently outpacing the Consumer Price Index, a trend that would continue for five decades
- **1986**: The Association of Research Libraries reported that serial expenditures had increased 400% in fifteen years while the number of titles purchased declined

### The Digital Revolution (1990-2005)

- **1991**: Paul Ginsparg created arXiv at Los Alamos National Laboratory (later moved to Cornell), establishing the first major preprint server. Physicists and mathematicians quickly adopted it as the primary venue for sharing research
- **1994**: Stevan Harnad published "Subversive Proposal," arguing that scholars should self-archive all publications in free online repositories
- **1997**: The National Library of Medicine launched PubMed, providing free access to biomedical literature abstracts (though not full text)
- **2000**: Harold Varmus and Patrick Brown co-founded the Public Library of Science (PLOS) petition, signed by 34,000 scientists, demanding that publishers make research freely available within six months of publication
- **2001**: The Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) formally defined open access and established two strategies: self-archiving (green OA) and open access journals (gold OA)
- **2002**: The Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities further codified the open access movement
- **2003**: PLOS launched *PLOS Biology* as a gold open access journal, funded by article processing charges, proving that high-impact OA journals were viable
- **2003**: Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing refined the BOAI definition
- **2003**: Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge signed by major European research organizations

## Federal Open Access Mandates

### The NIH Public Access Policy (2004-2008)

- **2004**: NIH proposed a voluntary public access policy requesting that NIH-funded researchers deposit accepted manuscripts in PubMed Central (PMC) within 12 months of publication
- **2005**: Voluntary policy implemented; compliance was below 5%
- **2007**: Congress mandated the policy through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 (Division G, Title II, Section 218)
- **2008**: NIH Public Access Policy took effect on April 7, 2008, requiring deposit in PMC within 12 months. This was the first U.S. federal open access mandate
- **2012**: Compliance reached approximately 75% after NIH tied compliance to grant renewals
- **2023**: Compliance stands at approximately 90%, with over 6 million articles deposited in PMC

### The OSTP Holdren Memo (2013)

- **February 22, 2013**: OSTP Director John Holdren issued a memorandum directing all federal agencies with over $100 million in annual R&D expenditures to develop public access plans
- Required plans for both publications and scientific data
- Allowed a 12-month post-publication embargo
- Required agencies to submit plans within six months
- Covered 19 federal agencies
- Implementation varied widely: some agencies created robust repositories, others took years to develop minimal plans

### The OSTP Nelson Memo (2022)

- **August 25, 2022**: OSTP Director Alondra Nelson issued "Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research"
- **Key changes from 2013 memo**:
    - Eliminated the 12-month embargo period entirely
    - Required immediate free access upon publication
    - Extended coverage to all federal agencies funding research (not just those above $100 million threshold)
    - Required publicly accessible data underlying publications
    - Required machine-readable metadata
    - Emphasized equitable access, noting that open access policies should not shift costs to researchers in ways that create new inequities
- **Implementation deadline**: December 31, 2025
- **Political significance**: Issued without requiring congressional action, using executive authority over federal agency operations

## The International Open Access Movement

### Early International Efforts (2000-2015)

- **2004**: UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee recommended that all UK-funded research be made openly accessible
- **2006**: Wellcome Trust became one of the first major funders to mandate open access for all funded research
- **2008**: European Research Council recommended open access for all funded research
- **2012**: The UK Finch Report recommended a transition to gold OA, influencing UK Research Council policies
- **2012**: European Commission recommended that all EU member states develop open access policies
- **2014**: The Gates Foundation mandated immediate open access for all funded research, with no embargo

### Plan S (2018-Present)

- **September 4, 2018**: cOAlition S, a group of national research funding organizations and charitable foundations, announced Plan S
- **Core principles**:
    - Immediate open access to all publications from publicly funded research
    - Authors retain copyright under CC-BY license
    - No publication in hybrid journals unless under a time-limited transformative agreement
    - APCs covered by funders or institutions, not individual researchers
    - Caps on acceptable APCs
- **January 2021**: Plan S implementation began
- **Participating funders**: Organizations in 27 countries, including major European funders (UKRI, ANR, DFG, NWO) and the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust
- **Impact**: Forced publishers to accelerate transformative agreements and expand OA options

### Latin American and Global South Models

- **1997**: SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) launched in Brazil, creating a network of diamond OA journals across Latin America
- **2003**: Redalyc established in Mexico as an open access portal for Latin American, Caribbean, and Spanish journals
- **2015**: AmeliCA launched to strengthen community-driven, non-commercial open access in Latin America
- Latin American models demonstrate that open science can operate without author-facing charges, funded by universities, governments, and regional cooperation
- These models serve as proof of concept for diamond OA globally

## Data Sharing and Reproducibility

### Early Data Sharing Mandates

- **1996**: The Bermuda Principles established during the Human Genome Project required immediate release of DNA sequence data, setting a precedent for open data in genomics
- **2000**: Fort Lauderdale Principles extended rapid data release to other large-scale biological projects
- **2003**: NIH Data Sharing Policy required data sharing plans for grants over $500,000
- **2007**: OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding recommended open data practices internationally

### FAIR Principles

- **2014-2016**: The FAIR principles were developed by a working group at the Lorentz Center workshop "Jointly Designing a Data FAIRPORT"
- **2016**: Published in *Scientific Data* by Wilkinson et al., the FAIR principles rapidly became the international standard for research data management
- **2019**: European Commission adopted FAIR as the basis for its Open Science Cloud
- **2023**: NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy took effect January 25, 2023, requiring data management plans for all NIH-funded research (not just grants over $500,000)

### The Reproducibility Crisis

- **2005**: John Ioannidis published "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False," launching widespread concern about reproducibility
- **2011**: Bayer reported that it could reproduce only 25% of published preclinical studies
- **2012**: Amgen reported reproducing only 6 of 53 "landmark" cancer biology studies
- **2015**: Open Science Collaboration published a large-scale replication of 100 psychology experiments; only 36% produced statistically significant results consistent with original findings
- **2016**: *Nature* survey of 1,576 researchers found that 70% had tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments
- **2019**: Center for Open Science launched the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, finding that effect sizes in replications were, on average, 85% smaller than originally reported

## Preprint Server Evolution

- **1991**: arXiv launched, initially covering high-energy physics
- **2003**: arXiv moved from Los Alamos to Cornell University Library
- **2013**: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory launched bioRxiv for biological sciences
- **2019**: medRxiv launched for health sciences, jointly operated by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, BMJ, and Yale
- **2020**: COVID-19 pandemic dramatically accelerated preprint adoption; preprints accounted for 30-40% of early COVID-19 research output
- **2020**: The WHO established a preprint screening service for COVID-19 research
- **2021**: arXiv transitioned from Cornell stewardship to an independent nonprofit
- **2024**: NIH began accepting preprints in grant applications, marking formal institutional recognition

## Publisher Responses

### The Hybrid Model (2004-Present)

- Publishers offered "hybrid" journals where individual articles could be made OA for an APC, while the journal remained subscription-based
- Criticized as "double-dipping" because publishers collected both subscription revenue and APCs
- Hybrid APCs typically $3,000-$5,000 per article
- Plan S placed strict limits on publication in hybrid journals

### Transformative Agreements (2015-Present)

- **2015**: The concept of "transformative agreements" (also called "read and publish" or "publish and read" deals) emerged as a transition mechanism
- Institutions pay a single fee covering both subscription access and OA publishing for their authors
- **2019**: University of California system cancelled its Elsevier subscription in protest of unsustainable costs; reached a transformative agreement in 2021
- **2020-2024**: Over 700 transformative agreements signed globally, covering an estimated 30% of global research output
- Critics argue these agreements merely shift costs rather than reducing them

### Publisher Consolidation

- **2015**: Springer merged with Nature Publishing Group to form Springer Nature
- **2017**: Elsevier acquired bepress, a repository platform, raising concerns about publisher control of open access infrastructure
- **2019**: Wiley acquired Hindawi, a major OA publisher, for $298 million
- Publisher consolidation has increased market power and reduced competitive pressure

## Resistance and Controversy

### Publisher Lobbying

- **2007-2012**: The Research Works Act (H.R. 3699, 2011) would have prohibited federal OA mandates; withdrawn after public backlash
- **2012**: Elsevier supported SOPA/PIPA legislation and withdrew after mass boycott threat (The Cost of Knowledge petition, 20,000+ signatories)
- Publishers have consistently lobbied against OA mandates through the Association of American Publishers (AAP) and the International Association of STM Publishers
- Publisher-funded "Copyright Alliance" and "Access to Research" campaigns framed OA mandates as threats to intellectual property

### Sci-Hub and Shadow Libraries

- **2011**: Alexandra Elbakyan founded Sci-Hub, providing free access to over 85 million paywalled articles
- Sci-Hub usage data revealed that paywalled articles are accessed millions of times daily, even at universities with institutional subscriptions
- Multiple court rulings have ordered Sci-Hub blocked, but enforcement has been limited
- Sci-Hub's existence highlights the fundamental tension between copyright-based publishing and the public interest in research access
