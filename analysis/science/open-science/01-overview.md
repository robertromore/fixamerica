# Open Science: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States spends approximately $170 billion annually on research and development through federal agencies, yet much of the resulting knowledge remains locked behind publisher paywalls costing $10,000-$40,000 per institutional subscription. Taxpayers fund the research, researchers conduct it for free, peer reviewers evaluate it without compensation, and then commercial publishers charge the public to read the results. This system represents one of the most significant market failures in the knowledge economy.

Open science -- the movement to make publicly funded research freely available, including publications, data, code, and methodologies -- has gained substantial momentum. The 2022 OSTP Nelson memo requiring immediate open access to federally funded research by 2026 marked a watershed moment, eliminating the 12-month embargo that previously allowed publishers to profit from publicly funded work. Combined with the European Plan S initiative, preprint server adoption, and the FAIR data principles, the infrastructure for open science exists. The primary barriers are now institutional inertia, publisher business models, and misaligned academic incentive structures.

Open science is not merely about free access. It encompasses reproducibility requirements, data sharing mandates, open-source research software, and transparent methodologies -- all essential to maintaining public trust in science and accelerating the pace of discovery.

## Scope

### What This Subtopic Covers

- **Open access publishing**: Mandates, models (gold, green, diamond), and the transition from subscription-based to open access journals
- **Data sharing**: Federal data sharing policies, FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), and repository infrastructure
- **Reproducibility**: Requirements for code sharing, methodology transparency, and replication studies
- **Paywall barriers**: The economics of academic publishing, publisher consolidation, and effects on researchers and the public
- **Preprint servers**: arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and their role in accelerating scientific communication
- **Open-source research software**: Tools, sustainability, and recognition for software contributions
- **Federal open access mandates**: NIH Public Access Policy (2008), OSTP memos (2013, 2022), and agency implementation

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Open access (OA)** | Free, unrestricted online access to research publications |
| **Gold OA** | Author or funder pays article processing charge (APC); article immediately free to read |
| **Green OA** | Author deposits accepted manuscript in an open repository after publication |
| **Diamond/Platinum OA** | Journal is free to both authors and readers, funded by institutions or grants |
| **Preprint** | Research manuscript shared publicly before formal peer review |
| **FAIR principles** | Data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable |
| **Article processing charge (APC)** | Fee paid to publishers for gold OA, typically $2,000-$11,000 |
| **Embargo period** | Delay before a paywalled article can be made freely available |
| **Nelson memo** | August 2022 OSTP memorandum requiring immediate open access to federally funded research |
| **Plan S** | European initiative requiring immediate open access for publicly funded research |
| **Transformative agreement** | Contract transitioning institutional subscriptions to open access publishing |

## Key Questions

1. **Why does publicly funded research remain behind paywalls?** What economic and institutional structures sustain this system?

2. **How effective are current open access mandates?** What has the NIH Public Access Policy achieved, and will the Nelson memo succeed?

3. **What are the consequences of restricted access?** How do paywalls affect researchers, clinicians, policymakers, educators, journalists, and the public?

4. **What is the right model for open access?** How do gold, green, and diamond OA compare in cost, sustainability, and equity?

5. **How should data sharing and reproducibility requirements be structured?** What infrastructure and incentives are needed?

6. **What role do preprint servers play?** How do they complement or challenge traditional peer review?

## Why This Matters

The stakes of open science extend well beyond academic convenience:

| Restricted Science Produces | Open Science Could Produce |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Duplicated research efforts | Faster discovery through shared knowledge |
| Limited access in developing nations | Global research equity |
| Clinicians without latest evidence | Better patient outcomes |
| Unreproducible findings | Transparent, verifiable science |
| Public distrust of hidden research | Trust through transparency |
| Publisher monopoly profits | Resources redirected to research |
| Slow knowledge dissemination | Rapid scientific communication |

**Public investment demands public access.** When taxpayers fund research, the results belong to the public -- not to commercial publishers who add minimal value while extracting billions in profit.
