# Open Science: Stakeholders

## Overview

The open science ecosystem involves a complex web of stakeholders with divergent interests. Understanding who benefits from the current system, who is harmed, and who holds power to change it is essential for designing effective reform strategies.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Researchers

**Role**: Producers and consumers of scientific knowledge

**Impact of Current System**:

- Must publish in prestigious journals to advance careers, regardless of access model
- Often cannot access literature outside their own institutional subscriptions
- Provide content and peer review to publishers without compensation
- Face increasing pressure to share data and code without corresponding recognition
- Early-career researchers are most vulnerable to both paywall barriers and APC costs

**Interest in Open Science**:

| Subgroup | Interest Level | Key Concern |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Early-career researchers | High | APCs unaffordable without grants; need visibility |
| Tenured faculty | Mixed | Supportive in principle but resistant to changing evaluation criteria |
| Clinical researchers | High | Patients and clinicians need access to latest evidence |
| Computational researchers | High | Already share code and preprints |
| Humanities scholars | Low to mixed | Monograph-based; different economics |
| Researchers at R1 universities | Mixed | Have access; less urgency |
| Researchers at under-resourced institutions | Very high | Limited subscriptions create significant barriers |

**Power to Change**: Moderate individually, high collectively. Researchers control the supply of manuscripts and peer review but face coordination problems.

### Universities and Research Institutions

**Role**: Employ researchers, fund libraries, negotiate with publishers

**Impact of Current System**:

- Spend billions annually on journal subscriptions that consume growing shares of library budgets
- Face tradeoffs between journal access and other library services (monographs, archives, digital resources)
- Bear administrative costs of compliance with federal mandates
- Must manage institutional repositories often with minimal staff

**Interest in Open Science**:

- Financially motivated to reduce subscription costs
- Institutionally cautious about disrupting faculty publishing norms
- Increasingly investing in open access infrastructure (repositories, OA publishing funds)
- Some have adopted open access policies (Harvard, MIT, UC system)

**Power to Change**: High. Universities collectively are the primary customers of the publishing industry. Coordinated action could fundamentally alter the market. The University of California's Elsevier boycott (2019-2021) demonstrated this potential.

### Federal Funding Agencies

**Role**: Fund research and set conditions for grant recipients

**Key Agencies**:

| Agency | Research Budget | OA Engagement |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| NIH | ~$48 billion | Most mature OA mandate; PubMed Central |
| NSF | ~$9 billion | Updated public access plan |
| DOE | ~$22 billion | OSTI repository; developing OA plan |
| DOD | ~$40 billion | Developing implementation |
| NASA | ~$8 billion | PubSpace repository |
| USDA | ~$3 billion | Developing implementation |

**Interest in Open Science**: Strong policy commitment (Nelson memo). Agencies benefit from increased visibility and impact of funded research. However, they face implementation challenges and resistance from publishers and some research communities.

**Power to Change**: Very high. Federal agencies can mandate open access as a condition of funding. The NIH model demonstrated that mandates, when enforced, achieve high compliance.

### Commercial Publishers

**Role**: Process, publish, and distribute scholarly research

**Major Players**:

| Publisher | Journals | Key Brands | OA Strategy |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Elsevier | ~2,700 | *The Lancet*, *Cell* | Transformative agreements, hybrid OA |
| Springer Nature | ~3,000 | *Nature*, *Scientific American* | Transformative agreements, *Nature* OA option |
| Wiley | ~1,700 | Multiple disciplinary leaders | Transformative agreements, acquired Hindawi |
| Taylor & Francis | ~2,700 | Broad disciplinary coverage | Transformative agreements |
| SAGE | ~1,100 | Social sciences focus | Developing OA options |

**Interest in Open Science**: Publishers seek to maintain revenue and market position during the transition. They support OA models that preserve or increase revenue (high-APC gold OA, transformative agreements) and resist models that reduce revenue (green OA mandates, diamond OA).

**Power to Change**: Very high but declining. Publishers control existing journal brands, archives, and infrastructure. However, their leverage diminishes as preprint servers, institutional repositories, and open infrastructure grow.

### Scientific Societies and Professional Associations

**Role**: Many societies publish journals as a revenue source and service to members

**Examples**:

| Society | Key Journals | OA Stance |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| American Chemical Society | *JACS*, *ACS Nano* | Cautious; revenue-dependent |
| American Physical Society | *Physical Review* | Supportive; arXiv culture |
| American Medical Association | *JAMA* | Developing OA options |
| IEEE | *IEEE Transactions* | Hybrid model |
| AAAS | *Science* | Selective OA option |

**Interest in Open Science**: Conflicted. Societies support open access in principle but depend on publishing revenue to fund other activities (conferences, education, advocacy). A rapid transition to OA threatens their financial models.

**Power to Change**: Moderate. Societies control prestigious journals but face competition from commercial publishers and OA alternatives.

### Librarians and Library Organizations

**Role**: Manage institutional access, negotiate with publishers, advocate for open access

**Key Organizations**:

- SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition)
- Association of Research Libraries (ARL)
- International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA)
- Coalition for Networked Information (CNI)

**Interest in Open Science**: Strongest and most consistent advocates for open access. Librarians directly experience the financial unsustainability of subscription costs and lead institutional OA initiatives.

**Power to Change**: Moderate. Librarians lack direct authority over research policy but influence purchasing decisions, negotiate with publishers, and build repository infrastructure.

## Secondary Stakeholders

### The General Public and Taxpayers

**Role**: Fund research through taxes; benefit from research outcomes

**Impact of Current System**:

- Cannot access research they funded without paying $30-$50 per article
- Clinicians at community hospitals often lack subscriptions available at academic medical centers
- Patients cannot read studies about their own conditions
- Journalists cannot verify scientific claims behind paywalls
- Small business owners and entrepreneurs cannot access research relevant to innovation

**Interest in Open Science**: Very high, though largely unaware of the issue. Public opinion polls consistently show strong support for free access to publicly funded research when the issue is explained.

**Power to Change**: Low directly, high through political representatives. Public awareness campaigns could build political pressure for legislative action.

### Students and Educators

**Role**: Use scientific literature for learning and teaching

**Impact of Current System**:

- Students at well-funded universities have broad access; those at community colleges and smaller institutions do not
- Textbook and journal costs add to the financial burden of education
- K-12 science educators have almost no institutional access to current research
- Graduate students in underfunded programs face significant access barriers

**Interest in Open Science**: High. Open educational resources and open access publications directly reduce costs and improve educational quality.

### Clinicians and Healthcare Providers

**Role**: Apply research findings to patient care

**Impact of Current System**:

- Physicians at academic medical centers typically have access; those in private practice, rural hospitals, and community health centers often do not
- Evidence-based medicine requires access to the latest research
- Delayed access to research findings can directly affect patient outcomes
- The COVID-19 pandemic starkly illustrated this: open access to COVID research accelerated treatment development, while restricted access to other disease research continued

**Interest in Open Science**: Very high for clinical research access. Less engaged with broader open science infrastructure issues.

### Technology Companies and Startups

**Role**: Use research findings for innovation and product development

**Impact of Current System**:

- Large companies (Google, Microsoft, pharmaceutical firms) can afford institutional subscriptions
- Startups and small companies often cannot, creating an innovation barrier
- AI and machine learning companies increasingly need text and data mining access to large corpora of scientific literature
- Publishers have been restrictive about text and data mining rights

**Interest in Open Science**: High, particularly for text and data mining access and open data.

### Global South Researchers and Institutions

**Role**: Contribute to and need access to global scientific knowledge

**Impact of Current System**:

- Institutions in low-income countries cannot afford subscription bundles
- Research Collaboration for Academic Publishing in Africa (RCAPA) and similar programs provide limited access
- APC-based gold OA creates new barriers: paying $3,000-$11,000 per article is prohibitive for researchers whose annual salary may be comparable
- APC waivers exist but are stigmatizing and inconsistently applied
- Research from the Global South is underrepresented in prestigious journals

**Interest in Open Science**: Very high, but with strong preference for diamond OA over APC-based models.

## Stakeholder Power Analysis

| Stakeholder | Interest in Open Science | Power to Effect Change | Current Engagement |
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Researchers (collective) | High | High (supply control) | Fragmented |
| Universities | High (financial) | High (purchasing power) | Increasing |
| Federal agencies | High (mandate authority) | Very high | Active (Nelson memo) |
| Commercial publishers | Low (threatens revenue) | High (market control) | Defensive |
| Scientific societies | Mixed | Moderate | Cautious |
| Librarians | Very high | Moderate | Very active |
| General public | High (if informed) | Low (indirect) | Low awareness |
| Students/Educators | High | Low | Growing |
| Clinicians | High (for clinical access) | Low | Issue-specific |
| Tech companies | Moderate to high | Moderate | Selective |
| Global South | Very high | Low | Active regionally |

## Key Dynamics

### Alliance Patterns

- **Pro-open science coalition**: Librarians + researchers at under-resourced institutions + public interest advocates + federal agencies + Global South
- **Status quo coalition**: Commercial publishers + some scientific societies + senior faculty benefiting from prestige economy
- **Swing stakeholders**: Research-intensive universities (want lower costs but cautious about disruption) + scientific societies (principled support but revenue concerns) + tech companies (want access but also generate IP)

### The Publisher-University Codependency

Universities and publishers exist in a codependent relationship: universities need journal content for research and teaching, while publishers need university subscriptions for revenue and university researchers for content and peer review. Breaking this codependency requires simultaneous development of alternative infrastructure and alternative incentive structures.

### The Researcher Collective Action Problem

Individual researchers face a prisoner's dilemma: each would benefit from universal open access, but each is individually incentivized to publish in prestigious paywalled journals to advance their career. Solving this requires changing the incentive structure at the institutional and funder level, not relying on individual researcher choices.
