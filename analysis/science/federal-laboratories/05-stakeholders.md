# Federal Laboratories: Stakeholders

## Overview

The federal laboratory system involves a complex web of stakeholders with overlapping and sometimes conflicting interests. Understanding these relationships is essential for designing reforms that can build sufficient political support while serving the public interest.

---

## Primary Stakeholders

### Laboratory Scientists and Engineers

**Who they are:** The approximately 100,000+ scientists, engineers, and technical staff employed across federal laboratories.

**Interests:**

- Scientific freedom to pursue important research questions
- Competitive compensation and career advancement opportunities
- Access to state-of-the-art facilities and equipment
- Job stability and benefits security
- Recognition through publications, awards, and professional standing
- Meaningful contribution to national missions

**Power:** Moderate. Lab scientists are respected experts whose advocacy carries weight with policymakers, but they lack organized political power. Professional societies (APS, ACS, IEEE, AAAS) provide some collective voice.

**Impact of current system:** Scientists at GOCO labs generally have better compensation but face instability during contract transitions. Scientists at GOGO labs have greater job security but lower pay and more bureaucratic constraints. Both groups report excessive time spent on compliance and reporting rather than research.

---

### M&O Contractors

**Who they are:** The corporations, universities, and consortia that manage DOE's 16 GOCO national laboratories.

**Major operators:**

| Contractor | Labs Managed | Annual Fees (approx.) |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Battelle Memorial Institute | ORNL, PNNL, INL, BNL (as consortium partner) | $100M+ total |
| University of California | LBNL (sole); partner in LANL, LLNL consortia | $50M+ |
| Triad National Security (Battelle, UT, TAMU) | LANL | $40-60M |
| National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia (Honeywell) | SNL | $30-50M |
| University of Chicago | ANL (via UChicago Argonne) | $20-30M |
| Stanford University | SLAC | $15-25M |

**Interests:**

- Maintaining and renewing management contracts (worth $25-100M annually in fees)
- Expanding lab budgets and missions (which increase fee bases)
- Minimizing accountability for performance failures
- Access to lab capabilities for corporate R&D (for corporate operators)
- Prestige and research access (for university operators)

**Power:** High. Contractors have deep relationships with DOE officials, congressional delegations, and lab communities. They employ lobbyists and engage in political activity. Contract transitions involve such high costs and disruption that DOE is reluctant to change operators.

**Impact of current system:** The M&O model provides contractors with stable, low-risk revenue streams. Fee structures that penalize negative events more than they reward positive ones encourage risk avoidance and compliance-heavy management.

### Department of Energy Leadership and Staff

**Who they are:** The Secretary of Energy, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, program office directors, and the approximately 14,000 DOE federal employees.

**Key offices:**

- **Office of Science**: Oversees 10 national laboratories; manages basic research and user facilities
- **NNSA**: Semi-autonomous agency overseeing the three weapons laboratories and nuclear security
- **Applied energy offices** (EERE, NE, FE): Fund applied research at labs
- **Environmental Management**: Manages cleanup of legacy nuclear sites
- **Site offices**: Provide direct oversight of lab contractors

**Interests:**

- Maintaining DOE's portfolio of world-class research capabilities
- Demonstrating effective stewardship of taxpayer investment
- Responding to presidential and congressional priorities
- Avoiding scandals, safety incidents, and cost overruns
- Preserving organizational authority and budget share

**Power:** High within the executive branch. DOE shapes lab budgets, research priorities, contract terms, and regulatory requirements. However, DOE's authority is constrained by congressional appropriations and by the political dynamics of lab-state delegations.

---

### Congress

**Who they are:** Members and committees with jurisdiction over federal laboratory policy.

**Key committees:**

| Committee | Jurisdiction |
|-----------|-------------|
| Senate Energy and Natural Resources | DOE authorization |
| Senate Appropriations - Energy and Water | DOE funding |
| Senate Armed Services | NNSA, defense labs |
| Senate Commerce, Science, Transportation | NIST, NSF, overall science policy |
| House Energy and Commerce | DOE authorization (shared) |
| House Science, Space, and Technology | DOE Office of Science, NIST |
| House Appropriations - Energy and Water | DOE funding |
| House Armed Services | NNSA, defense labs |

**Interests:**

- Protecting laboratories in their districts and states
- Directing lab resources toward constituents' economic interests
- Demonstrating oversight of federal spending
- Advancing policy priorities (energy, defense, competitiveness)
- Claiming credit for scientific achievements and new facility construction

**Power:** Dominant. Congress controls appropriations, authorizes programs, and conducts oversight. Lab-state delegations -- particularly from New Mexico, California, Tennessee, Illinois, Idaho, and Washington -- form bipartisan coalitions that shape lab policy.

---

### The White House (OSTP, OMB)

**Who they are:** The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), National Science and Technology Council, and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).

**Interests:**

- Aligning lab research with presidential priorities
- Controlling federal spending
- Maintaining scientific competitiveness
- Managing national security research portfolio

**Power:** Significant but episodic. Presidents can reshape lab priorities through budget proposals and executive orders, but sustained attention to laboratory policy is rare. OMB has persistent influence through budget scoring rules and management circulars.

---

## Secondary Stakeholders

### Universities

**Who they are:** The approximately 200 research universities that both collaborate with and compete against federal laboratories.

**Interests:**

- Access to lab user facilities (synchrotrons, neutron sources, supercomputers)
- Collaborative research partnerships
- Graduate student and postdoc placement at labs
- Maintaining university share of federal R&D funding
- Ensuring labs complement rather than compete with university research

**Power:** Moderate to high. University associations (AAU, APLU) lobby effectively on science policy. University faculty serve on advisory committees that shape lab direction. University partners in M&O consortia have direct influence on lab management.

**Tension:** Universities simultaneously collaborate with labs (through user facilities, joint appointments, and partnerships) and compete with them for federal research funding. Some university leaders have argued that DOE lab budgets crowd out extramural (university) funding.

---

### Private Industry

**Who they are:** Companies that partner with labs through CRADAs, license lab technologies, use lab facilities, or compete with labs for federal contracts.

**Key industry segments:**

- **Defense contractors** (Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman): Major partners with weapons labs
- **Energy companies** (utilities, oil and gas, renewables): Partners on energy research
- **Technology companies** (Intel, IBM, NVIDIA, Google): Collaborate on computing, materials, quantum
- **Startups**: Seek to commercialize lab technologies
- **Small and medium enterprises**: Use lab facilities and technical assistance

**Interests:**

- Access to lab expertise, facilities, and discoveries
- Favorable intellectual property terms in partnerships
- Quick, unbureaucratic engagement processes
- Labs as a source of pre-competitive research that reduces private R&D costs

**Power:** Significant. Industry lobbying shapes lab policy, particularly around technology transfer and IP rules. Large defense contractors have particularly strong influence over NNSA lab priorities.

---

### Lab Host Communities

**Who they are:** The cities, counties, and regions where federal laboratories are located.

**Key communities:**

| Community | Laboratory | Estimated Economic Impact |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Los Alamos / Santa Fe, NM | LANL | $3+ billion annually |
| Albuquerque, NM | SNL | $3.5+ billion annually |
| Oak Ridge / Knoxville, TN | ORNL | $2+ billion annually |
| Livermore / Bay Area, CA | LLNL | $2+ billion annually |
| Richland / Tri-Cities, WA | PNNL | $1.5+ billion annually |
| Idaho Falls, ID | INL | $1.5+ billion annually |
| Batavia / Chicago suburbs, IL | ANL, Fermilab | $1.5+ billion annually |

**Interests:**

- Economic stability and growth from lab employment and procurement
- Infrastructure investment (roads, housing, schools) to support lab workforce
- Community identity tied to scientific excellence
- Environmental safety (particularly at sites with nuclear legacy)

**Power:** Moderate. Communities mobilize through elected officials, chambers of commerce, and local advocacy organizations. Their influence is channeled primarily through congressional delegations.

---

### Laboratory Workers (Non-Scientific)

**Who they are:** The technicians, administrative staff, security forces, maintenance workers, and support personnel who comprise approximately 40-50% of the lab workforce.

**Interests:**

- Job security, particularly during contract transitions
- Fair compensation and benefits
- Workplace safety
- Union representation (where applicable)

**Power:** Limited individually but potentially significant through unions and collective action. Guard and craft unions at some labs have organized and negotiated contracts. Contract transitions create acute anxiety for non-scientific workers who may face benefit reductions or job losses.

---

### The Public

**Who they are:** Taxpayers who fund the federal laboratory system and who are the ultimate intended beneficiaries of federal research.

**Interests:**

- Return on investment in federal R&D
- National security and economic competitiveness
- Environmental safety at lab sites
- Access to the benefits of publicly funded research

**Power:** Diffuse and generally low on lab-specific issues. The public rarely engages directly in laboratory policy. However, high-profile events (fusion ignition, COVID vaccine development, security breaches) can generate public attention.

## Key Power Dynamics

### The Iron Triangle

Federal laboratory policy is shaped by an iron triangle:

1. **Congressional committees** (particularly Appropriations and Armed Services) that control funding
2. **DOE and agency officials** that manage programs
3. **M&O contractors and lab communities** that benefit from spending

This triangle produces predictable outcomes: stable or growing budgets, resistance to consolidation, preference for new construction over maintenance, and incremental rather than fundamental reform.

### The Missing Voice

Notably absent from laboratory policy debates is an organized constituency representing the public interest in maximizing scientific return on investment. While scientific societies and think tanks occasionally weigh in, there is no permanent, well-funded advocacy organization focused on federal laboratory reform.

### The Weapons Lab Exception

The three NNSA weapons laboratories (LANL, LLNL, SNL) operate in a distinct political environment where national security classification limits public scrutiny and creates additional stakeholder dynamics involving the intelligence community, the Department of Defense, and international treaty verification organizations.
