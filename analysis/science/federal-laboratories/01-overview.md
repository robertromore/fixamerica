# Federal Laboratories: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States operates a vast network of federal laboratories that form the backbone of the nation's research enterprise. The 17 Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories alone employ over 70,000 scientists and engineers and operate some of the most sophisticated research facilities on Earth, from particle accelerators to supercomputers to nuclear reactors. Beyond DOE, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Intramural Research Program, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and dozens of other agencies operate research facilities that collectively represent approximately $75 billion in annual federal investment.

These laboratories have produced transformative advances -- from nuclear energy and the internet to COVID-19 vaccines and climate models. Yet the system faces serious structural challenges: aging infrastructure requiring over $40 billion in deferred maintenance, bureaucratic management models that slow innovation, inadequate technology transfer mechanisms that leave taxpayer-funded discoveries uncommercialized, workforce recruitment difficulties as the private sector competes for talent, and a governance structure that often prioritizes institutional preservation over scientific impact.

Federal laboratories operate under two primary management models. Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) labs like Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore are managed by private entities under contract, while Government-Owned, Government-Operated (GOGO) labs like NIST and NIH intramural facilities are staffed directly by federal employees. Each model has distinct advantages and pathologies, and the choice between them shapes everything from salary scales to intellectual property rights.

Reforming the federal laboratory system is essential for maintaining American scientific leadership, accelerating the transition from discovery to deployment, and ensuring that taxpayer investment in research delivers maximum public benefit.

## Scope

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **GOCO** | Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated -- a lab owned by the federal government but managed by a private contractor or university consortium |
| **GOGO** | Government-Owned, Government-Operated -- a lab owned and staffed directly by a federal agency |
| **M&O contract** | Management and Operating contract -- the mechanism by which DOE engages private entities to run GOCO labs |
| **FFRDC** | Federally Funded Research and Development Center -- a designation under FAR 35.017 for labs that have special relationships with their sponsoring agencies |
| **CRADA** | Cooperative Research and Development Agreement -- a mechanism for labs to collaborate with private firms |
| **User facility** | A major scientific instrument or facility (e.g., synchrotron, supercomputer) made available to external researchers |
| **Technology transfer** | The process of moving discoveries from the lab to commercial or public application |
| **Stevenson-Wydler Act** | 1980 law (15 U.S.C. 3710) establishing technology transfer as a mission of federal labs |
| **Work for Others (WFO)** | Agreements under which federal labs perform research for non-federal sponsors |
| **LDRD** | Laboratory Directed Research and Development -- discretionary research funds allocated to lab directors |

## Key Questions

1. **Are federal laboratories structured to maximize scientific impact?** Do current management models -- GOCO versus GOGO -- align incentives for breakthrough research, or do they prioritize risk avoidance and compliance?

2. **Is taxpayer investment in federal labs being efficiently translated into public benefit?** What fraction of lab discoveries reaches commercial application, and how does this compare to peer institutions?

3. **Can the federal laboratory system attract and retain world-class talent?** How do compensation, bureaucratic constraints, and security requirements affect the labs' ability to compete with universities and the private sector?

4. **Is the physical infrastructure of federal laboratories adequate for 21st-century science?** What is the scale of deferred maintenance, and how does facility age affect research capacity?

5. **How should the relationship between federal labs and universities be structured?** Are labs complementary to or competitive with university research, and how can collaboration be improved?

6. **Does technology transfer from federal laboratories serve the public interest?** Are current mechanisms (CRADAs, licensing, startups) sufficient, and who benefits from publicly funded research?

## Why This Matters

Federal laboratories are unique national assets. They can undertake research that is too large, too long-term, too risky, or too strategically sensitive for the private sector or universities. They operate one-of-a-kind scientific facilities -- particle accelerators, nuclear reactors, wind tunnels, supercomputers -- that no single institution could afford.

| Challenge | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Aging infrastructure | Facilities built in the 1950s-1970s cannot support modern research |
| Bureaucratic management | World-class scientists spend excessive time on compliance rather than research |
| Weak technology transfer | Taxpayer-funded discoveries remain uncommercialized |
| Workforce pipeline gaps | Labs struggle to recruit top early-career talent |
| Misaligned incentives | M&O contract structures reward risk avoidance, not scientific ambition |
| Unclear mission priorities | Labs accumulate missions without shedding obsolete ones |

Getting this right is a matter of national competitiveness. China has dramatically expanded its national laboratory system, investing heavily in new facilities while many American labs rely on infrastructure from the Eisenhower and Kennedy eras. If the U.S. cannot modernize its federal laboratory enterprise, it risks losing scientific leadership in fields from quantum computing to clean energy to biodefense.
