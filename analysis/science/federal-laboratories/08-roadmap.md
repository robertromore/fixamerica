# Federal Laboratories: Roadmap

## Overview

Implementing federal laboratory reform requires a multi-phase approach that builds political support through early wins, establishes structural foundations for larger reforms, and sustains momentum over multiple congressional and presidential cycles. This roadmap sequences reforms to maximize feasibility while building toward transformative change.

#### 2.3 M&O Contract Transition Implementation

**Timeline:** Years 3-4

- Issue new M&O contract solicitation guidance incorporating outcome-based fee structures
- Implement new contracts as current contracts reach competition or renewal dates
- Establish transition support teams to minimize disruption during contract changes

**Who leads:** DOE Office of Acquisition Management, NNSA

**Key milestones:**

| Year | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2 | New M&O contract guidance issued |
| 3 | First contracts under new model competed |
| 4 | Initial performance data from new contracts |
| 5 | Assessment and adjustment of new model |

## Phase 3: Infrastructure Investment and Mission Review (Years 4-8)

### Objective

Begin large-scale infrastructure modernization and conduct the first comprehensive mission review.

### Actions

#### 3.1 Infrastructure Fund Deployment

**Timeline:** Years 4-15

- Prioritize investments based on National Laboratories Board recommendations
- Phase 1 (Years 4-6): Address critical safety and functionality deficiencies
- Phase 2 (Years 6-10): Modernize general-purpose laboratory buildings and support infrastructure
- Phase 3 (Years 8-15): Construct next-generation scientific user facilities

**Investment priorities:**

| Priority | Estimated Cost | Timeline |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Critical safety remediation | $5 billion | Years 4-6 |
| General-purpose lab modernization | $15 billion | Years 6-12 |
| Next-generation user facilities | $15 billion | Years 8-15 |
| Sustainable infrastructure upgrades | $5 billion | Years 6-15 |

#### 3.2 National Laboratory Mission Review Commission

## Risk Management

### Key Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Political opposition blocks governance legislation | High | High | Build bipartisan coalition; frame as competitiveness issue; secure scientific society endorsements |
| Infrastructure fund appropriated but underfunded | Medium | High | Use mandatory spending authority; link to specific project milestones |
| M&O contractors resist contract reform | High | Medium | Phase in changes at contract renewal points; grandfather existing provisions during transition |
| Mission review politicized | High | High | Use independent commission model; binding up-or-down congressional vote on full package |
| Economic disruption to lab communities from mission changes | Medium | Medium | Provide generous transition assistance; invest in alternative economic development |
| Reform momentum lost across administration changes | High | Medium | Embed reforms in statute rather than executive orders; build bipartisan legislative coalition |

### Contingency Plans

- **If governance legislation stalls**: Implement maximum reforms through executive action and DOE directives (limited but meaningful)
- **If infrastructure funding is insufficient**: Prioritize safety-critical needs and user facility upgrades; seek supplemental appropriations
- **If mission review is blocked**: Conduct voluntary mission reviews at lab level with National Laboratories Board guidance
- **If workforce legislation fails**: Use existing special hiring authorities more aggressively; expand fellowship programs through appropriations
