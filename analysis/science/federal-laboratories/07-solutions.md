# Federal Laboratories: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming the federal laboratory system requires addressing interconnected structural problems simultaneously. Piecemeal fixes have repeatedly failed because the system's pathologies reinforce each other. The solutions proposed here are organized from most to least transformative, with each building on the others.

---

## Solution 1: Governance Restructuring

### The Reform

Create a unified governance framework for DOE national laboratories that clarifies authority, reduces fragmentation, and aligns accountability with outcomes.

### Specific Proposals

#### 1A: Establish an Independent National Laboratories Board

Create an independent board, modeled on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the Smithsonian Board of Regents, with authority to:

- Set strategic priorities for the national laboratory system
- Evaluate lab performance using scientific impact metrics rather than compliance metrics
- Recommend mission assignments and reallocations across labs
- Oversee M&O contract competition and evaluation
- Approve major capital investments

**Board composition:** 7-9 members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, including active scientists, former lab directors, industry leaders, and public members. Board members would serve staggered terms of 6 years to insulate from political cycles.

#### 1B: Consolidate DOE Oversight

Reduce the number of DOE entities with oversight authority over any single lab:

- Merge DOE site offices into regional oversight centers
- Eliminate duplicative reporting requirements across program offices
- Establish a single point of contact between each lab and DOE
- Replace prescriptive DOE orders with performance-based standards

#### 1C: Clarify Lab Director Authority

Strengthen the authority of lab directors relative to both DOE program offices and M&O contractor parent organizations:

- Grant lab directors authority over internal resource allocation (within programmatic constraints)
- Require DOE to provide multi-year program plans rather than annual directive changes
- Limit M&O contractor parent organizations' ability to override lab director decisions on scientific matters

### Evidence

- The German Helmholtz Association manages 18 research centers through a unified governance structure with clear authority lines and has consistently ranked among the world's top research organizations
- The National Academies' 2020 report *A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic and Southern Ocean Research* recommended similar governance reforms for Antarctic research infrastructure
- DOE's own Secretary of Energy Advisory Board has repeatedly recommended reducing oversight fragmentation

### Estimated Impact

- Reduce lab overhead from 30-40% to 20-25% of operating budgets
- Accelerate decision-making on new programs and facility investments
- Improve lab director ability to pursue bold scientific directions

## Solution 2: M&O Contract Reform

### The Reform

Redesign M&O contract structures to incentivize scientific impact, technology transfer, and workforce development rather than risk avoidance.

### Specific Proposals

#### 2A: Outcome-Based Fee Structures

Replace the current fee model (which penalizes negative events) with one that rewards positive outcomes:

| Current Model | Proposed Model |
|---------------|---------------|
| Fee reduced for safety incidents | Base fee for adequate safety performance |
| Fee reduced for security breaches | Bonus fee for scientific breakthroughs |
| Minimal incentive for technology transfer | Significant fee tied to commercial impact |
| No workforce development metrics | Fee component for diversity and pipeline development |

#### 2B: Longer Contract Terms with Performance Milestones

- Extend base contract terms from 5 years to 10 years to encourage long-term investment
- Include 5-year performance reviews with contract extension or termination decisions
- Require transition plans and cost estimates as part of all M&O contracts to reduce transition disruption

#### 2C: University Partnership Requirements

For labs where university engagement is critical to the scientific mission:

- Require meaningful university involvement in lab governance (not just corporate partners using university names for prestige)
- Mandate joint appointment programs, graduate student access, and faculty engagement
- Tie a portion of fees to university partnership metrics

#### 2D: Streamlined CRADA and Licensing Processes

- Reduce average CRADA negotiation time from 6-18 months to 90 days
- Pre-approve standard CRADA templates for common partnership types
- Allow lab directors to approve CRADAs below a dollar threshold without DOE review
- Create standardized licensing terms for lab IP

### Evidence

- The UK's Research Councils (now UKRI) reformed their research institute management contracts in the 2010s with outcome-based metrics and saw improved commercial outputs
- Stanford University's Office of Technology Licensing generates more licensing revenue from a $2 billion research budget than the entire DOE lab system generates from $26 billion
- A 2019 DOE Inspector General report found that CRADA processing times averaged over a year, deterring industry partnerships

### Estimated Impact

- Increase technology transfer revenue by 3-5x over 10 years
- Reduce contract transition disruption and costs
- Better align contractor incentives with lab scientific missions

## Solution 3: Infrastructure Modernization

### The Reform

Implement a comprehensive, funded infrastructure modernization program to address the $40+ billion deferred maintenance backlog and build next-generation research facilities.

### Specific Proposals

#### 3A: National Laboratory Infrastructure Fund

Create a dedicated, mandatory-spending infrastructure fund (similar to the Highway Trust Fund) to provide predictable, long-term facility investment:

- Fund level: $3-5 billion annually for 15-20 years
- Sources: Dedicated authorization separate from annual appropriations
- Governance: Investment decisions by the National Laboratories Board (Solution 1A) based on scientific priority, not congressional politics

#### 3B: Facility Condition Benchmarking

- Require all federal labs to conduct and publish annual facility condition assessments
- Set target facility condition index (FCI) scores for all labs
- Link lab funding partially to progress toward FCI targets
- Prioritize facilities that directly support scientific user facilities

#### 3C: Next-Generation User Facilities

Invest in the next generation of scientific user facilities to maintain U.S. leadership:

- Next-generation light sources and upgrades to existing synchrotrons
- Second-generation exascale computing and quantum computing testbeds
- Advanced nuclear research reactors to replace aging facilities
- New materials characterization and manufacturing research facilities

#### 3D: Sustainable Infrastructure

Require all new lab construction and major renovations to meet high-performance sustainability standards:

- Net-zero energy buildings where feasible
- Resilient design for climate adaptation
- Modular construction to enable future reconfiguration

### Evidence

- China invested over $10 billion in new national laboratory infrastructure between 2015 and 2025
- The European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden represents a $1.8 billion investment in a next-generation neutron facility -- the kind of investment the U.S. has not made in neutron science for decades
- DOE's own analyses show that facility condition directly correlates with research productivity and talent recruitment

### Estimated Impact

- Eliminate deferred maintenance backlog within 15-20 years
- Maintain U.S. leadership in key scientific capabilities
- Improve lab attractiveness for world-class talent recruitment

## Solution 4: Workforce Modernization

### The Reform

Overhaul workforce policies at both GOCO and GOGO laboratories to attract, retain, and develop world-class scientific talent.

### Specific Proposals

#### 4A: Competitive Compensation for GOGO Labs

- Create a new pay system for federal laboratory scientists, modeled on the Federal Reserve Board's compensation authority, that is outside the GS system
- Allow lab directors at GOGO labs to set salaries based on market rates with annual OPM review
- Expand Title 42 hiring authority (currently used at NIH) to other GOGO labs

#### 4B: Accelerated Security Clearance Processing

- Establish a dedicated clearance processing pipeline for national laboratory recruits
- Set a 90-day target for interim clearance decisions (currently 6-12 months)
- Allow provisional access to unclassified but controlled lab areas while clearances are processed
- Invest in continuous vetting technology to replace periodic reinvestigations

#### 4C: National Laboratory Fellowship Program

Create a prestigious, well-compensated postdoctoral fellowship program across all national labs:

- 500 fellowships per year, competitively awarded
- Compensation at $100,000+ (competitive with industry postdocs)
- Three-year terms with mentorship and professional development
- Prioritize diversity and recruitment from underrepresented institutions
- Include a pathway to permanent lab positions for top performers

#### 4D: Dual-Career Support

Address the geographic challenge of lab recruitment:

- Fund spousal hiring programs that provide career placement assistance and bridge funding
- Invest in remote work infrastructure to enable geographically flexible positions
- Partner with local universities and companies to create employment networks for lab employee partners

#### 4E: Visiting Scientist Programs

Expand mechanisms for university faculty and industry researchers to spend time at labs:

- Sabbatical hosting programs with streamlined onboarding
- Joint appointment frameworks with simplified administrative processes
- Industry sabbatical programs that bring private-sector researchers to labs and vice versa

### Evidence

- The Federal Reserve's independent compensation authority has allowed it to recruit and retain top economic and financial talent despite being a government entity
- Germany's Max Planck Society offers internationally competitive salaries and has consistently attracted top scientists from around the world
- A 2021 National Academies study on the DOE workforce found that compensation gaps and hiring delays were the primary barriers to talent recruitment

### Estimated Impact

- Reduce average time-to-hire from 6 months to 8-12 weeks
- Close compensation gaps with private sector by 50-75% for senior researchers
- Increase diversity in lab scientific workforce by 30-50% within a decade

## Solution 5: Technology Transfer Acceleration

### The Reform

Transform federal laboratories from passive IP generators into active drivers of commercial innovation.

### Specific Proposals

#### 5A: Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Programs

- Embed entrepreneurs-in-residence at every major lab
- Create lab-affiliated incubators and accelerators in partnership with regional innovation ecosystems
- Fund proof-of-concept programs that bridge the gap between lab discovery and commercial viability
- Model on the DOE Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP), expanding it from a pilot to a permanent program at all labs

#### 5B: Simplified IP Framework

- Create a standard, streamlined license for lab IP with pre-negotiated terms for common use cases
- Allow small companies and startups to license lab IP at reduced rates or with deferred payment
- Establish a "use it or lose it" provision: if licensed IP is not commercialized within 5 years, the license reverts to the lab
- Create an online marketplace for lab IP searchable by technology area

#### 5C: Regional Innovation Partnerships

- Fund partnerships between labs and regional economic development organizations
- Create lab innovation districts in surrounding communities with co-working spaces, meeting facilities, and business support services
- Establish a Lab-to-Market Fund that co-invests with private capital in startups commercializing lab technology

#### 5D: Scientist Incentives for Commercialization

- Allow lab scientists to retain a meaningful share (15-25%) of licensing revenue from their inventions
- Permit lab scientists to take entrepreneurial leave to launch startups without forfeiting their lab positions
- Include commercialization impact in scientist performance evaluations and promotion criteria

### Evidence

- MIT generates approximately $70 million annually in licensing revenue from a research base one-tenth the size of the DOE lab system
- The Fraunhofer Institutes in Germany generate over 70% of their revenue from industry contracts, demonstrating that mission-driven research and commercial engagement are compatible
- DOE's Lab-Embedded Entrepreneurship Program has produced dozens of startups from its pilot phase, demonstrating demand for lab-based entrepreneurship

### Estimated Impact

- Triple the number of startups launched from lab technologies within 10 years
- Increase licensing revenue from $60-80 million to $300-500 million annually
- Create 10,000+ jobs in lab-technology companies

## Solution 6: Mission Review and Alignment

### The Reform

Conduct a comprehensive review of laboratory missions to eliminate duplication, shed obsolete missions, and align lab capabilities with 21st-century national needs.

### Specific Proposals

#### 6A: National Laboratory Mission Review Commission

Establish an independent commission (analogous to BRAC for military bases) to:

- Evaluate each lab's missions against current national needs
- Identify mission duplication across labs
- Recommend mission realignment, consolidation, or expansion
- Provide transition assistance to affected communities and workers

#### 6B: Sunset Reviews

Require periodic (every 10 years) reauthorization of each lab's major mission areas:

- Independent scientific review panels assess each mission area
- Labs must demonstrate continued relevance and productivity
- Missions that fail review are phased out over 3-5 years with workforce transition support

#### 6C: Emerging Mission Investment

Proactively invest in labs' capabilities in areas of emerging national need:

- Quantum information science
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Advanced manufacturing and materials
- Climate science and clean energy deployment
- Biodefense and pandemic preparedness
- Microelectronics and semiconductor research

### Evidence

- The BRAC process successfully closed or realigned over 350 military installations despite intense political opposition
- The Galvin Commission (1995) recommended mission reviews but was blocked by political opposition; the underlying analysis remains relevant
- Other countries (Germany, UK, France) conduct periodic reviews of their national research institutions and adjust missions accordingly

### Estimated Impact

- Free up 10-15% of lab budgets currently supporting legacy missions
- Focus lab capabilities on areas of greatest national need
- Reduce inter-lab duplication
