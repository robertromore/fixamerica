# Federal Laboratories: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Reform of the federal laboratory system requires legislative action to restructure governance, modernize workforce authorities, accelerate technology transfer, and fund infrastructure renewal. This document provides draft text for two major federal bills and a state model act, along with regulatory framework proposals and analysis of legal considerations. No constitutional amendments are needed, as Congress already possesses broad authority over federal property and spending under Article I and Article IV of the Constitution.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: National Laboratory Governance and Infrastructure Act

**Purpose**: Restructure the governance of DOE national laboratories to reduce fragmentation, establish outcome-based M&O contract incentives, create a dedicated infrastructure fund, and authorize a mission review commission.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "National Laboratory Governance and
Infrastructure Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The 17 Department of Energy national laboratories represent
    an investment of over $26,000,000,000 annually in federal
    research and development and employ more than 70,000 scientists,
    engineers, and support staff.
(2) The governance structure of the national laboratories suffers
    from fragmentation, with multiple overlapping oversight entities
    that increase costs, slow decision-making, and diffuse
    accountability.
(3) Management and Operating contract fee structures incentivize
    risk avoidance rather than scientific impact and commercial
    innovation.
(4) The national laboratories face a deferred maintenance backlog
    exceeding $10,000,000,000, threatening the safety, capability,
    and international competitiveness of these facilities.
(5) International competitors, particularly the People's Republic
    of China, are investing heavily in modern research
    infrastructure while many United States laboratory facilities
    date to the mid-twentieth century.
(6) A comprehensive approach to governance reform, contract
    modernization, and infrastructure investment is necessary to
    maintain the United States' global leadership in science and
    technology.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4 (National Laboratories Board)**: Creates an independent governance body with staggered 6-year terms to insulate from political cycles. The conflict-of-interest provision (no recent M&O contractor employees) prevents regulatory capture. The Board's authority is advisory and evaluative rather than operational, preserving the Secretary's executive authority while providing independent strategic direction.

- **Section 5 (Oversight Consolidation)**: Addresses governance fragmentation by consolidating site offices, eliminating duplicative reporting, and establishing single points of accountability. The safety/security limitation clause addresses national security concerns.

- **Section 6 (M&O Contract Reform)**: Shifts fee structures from penalizing negative events toward rewarding positive outcomes. The 50% threshold for outcome-based fees is a compromise -- reformers would prefer higher, contractors would prefer lower. Longer contract terms (10 years) reduce transition disruption while midpoint reviews maintain accountability.

- **Section 7 (Infrastructure Fund)**: Creates a dedicated funding stream of $4 billion per year for 20 years ($80 billion total), sufficient to address the deferred maintenance backlog and invest in next-generation facilities. The 30% maintenance floor prevents the common practice of directing all infrastructure money toward new construction while existing buildings deteriorate.

- **Section 8 (Mission Review Commission)**: Models the BRAC process, with an independent commission making recommendations that Congress votes on as a package to prevent cherry-picking. The 2-year timeline gives the commission adequate time for thorough evaluation.

- **Section 9 (Technology Transfer)**: Addresses the most common complaints from industry partners about lab bureaucracy. The $1 million threshold for lab director approval authority covers the vast majority of CRADAs while maintaining oversight for large agreements.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Lab-state delegations oppose mission review | BRAC-style up-or-down vote; economic transition assistance |
| M&O contractors resist fee reform | Phase in at contract renewal; grandfather existing provisions |
| OMB opposes $4B/year infrastructure fund | Frame as deficit-neutral through long-term savings; tie to competitiveness |
| National security concerns about Board oversight of weapons labs | Board evaluates unclassified metrics; NNSA retains operational authority for classified matters |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Give the Board binding authority over M&O contract decisions (not just advisory)
- **Fallback version**: Create a DOE-internal advisory board (no Senate confirmation) if independent board legislation stalls
- **Compromise version**: Exempt NNSA weapons labs from mission review commission while applying all other provisions

    to be appropriated $100,000,000 for each fiscal year for
    the National Laboratory Fellows Program under section 5.
(c) Security Clearance Acceleration.--There is authorized to
    be appropriated $30,000,000 for each fiscal year for the
    dedicated clearance processing pipeline under section 6.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

(a) Sections 4 through 8 shall take effect 1 year after the
    date of enactment.
(b) Section 6 shall take effect 180 days after the date of
    enactment.
(c) Section 9 shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4 (Federal Laboratory Personnel System)**: Creates an entirely new pay and hiring authority for research positions at all federal laboratories, not just DOE. This is modeled on authorities that the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and other financial regulators have used successfully to recruit top talent outside the GS system. The cap at Executive Schedule Level I (with exceptions up to the Vice President's salary) provides flexibility while maintaining public accountability. The 60-business-day hiring timeline is aggressive but achievable -- the Department of Defense has demonstrated similar timelines under direct hire authority.

- **Section 5 (National Laboratory Fellows Program)**: Creates a prestigious, well-funded postdoctoral program to rebuild the talent pipeline. The 30% set-aside for non-top-50 institutions broadens the recruitment base and supports diversity. Noncompetitive conversion to permanent positions creates a clear pathway from fellowship to career.

- **Section 6 (Security Clearance Acceleration)**: Addresses one of the most frequently cited barriers to lab recruitment. The 90-day interim clearance target is ambitious but has been demonstrated in pilot programs. Provisional access to unclassified areas allows new hires to begin productive work immediately.

- **Section 7 (Dual-Career Support)**: Addresses the geographic recruitment challenge. Bridge funding for spousal employment is a high-impact, relatively low-cost intervention.

- **Section 8 (Diversity and Inclusion)**: Requires strategic planning and accountability without imposing quotas. The institutional climate assessment provision addresses cultural barriers that are often more significant than formal policies.

- **Section 9 (Visiting Scientist and Entrepreneurial Leave)**: Breaks down the walls between labs and external organizations. Entrepreneurial leave with return rights is a key incentive for scientists to engage in commercialization.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| OPM opposes separate pay system | Model on existing precedents (Fed, FDIC, SEC); include OPM consultation role |
| Federal employee unions oppose bypassing GS system | Grandfathering protections; retain federal benefits; focus on new hires |
| Cost concerns ($100M+ for fellowships) | Frame as investment in competitiveness; compare to cost of losing talent |
| Security establishment resists clearance timeline mandates | Set targets rather than hard deadlines for initial implementation |
| Congressional concern about lab employee salaries exceeding elected officials' pay | Cap provisions; limited exceptions; transparency requirements |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Include mandatory reclassification of all existing GOGO lab scientists into the new system within 3 years
- **Fallback version**: Apply new pay authority only to new hires, allowing gradual transition
- **Pilot version**: Implement at 3-5 laboratories initially, with full rollout contingent on evaluation results

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Laboratory Partnership Act

**Purpose**: Enable state governments to partner with federal laboratories to accelerate technology transfer and economic development in lab-hosting states.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Laboratory Partnership Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:
(a) Federal laboratories located in [State] are major economic
    engines and sources of technological innovation.
(b) Strengthening partnerships between state institutions and
    federal laboratories will accelerate economic development
    and job creation.
(c) State investment in laboratory-adjacent infrastructure and
    programs will complement federal investments and maximize
    public benefit.

SECTION 3. STATE LABORATORY PARTNERSHIP OFFICE.

(a) There is established within the [Department of Commerce /
    Economic Development Agency] a State Laboratory Partnership
    Office.
(b) The Office shall--
    (1) coordinate state economic development activities with
        federal laboratory technology transfer programs;
    (2) provide business development assistance to startups
        and small businesses seeking to commercialize
        laboratory technology;
    (3) administer the Laboratory Innovation Fund under
        Section 4; and
    (4) report annually to the Legislature on partnership
        activities and economic outcomes.

SECTION 4. LABORATORY INNOVATION FUND.

(a) There is established a Laboratory Innovation Fund within
    the state treasury.
(b) The Fund shall provide--
    (1) matching grants for Cooperative Research and
        Development Agreements between state businesses and
        federal laboratories, in an amount not to exceed
        $250,000 per agreement;
    (2) seed funding for startup companies commercializing
        federal laboratory technology, in an amount not to
        exceed $100,000 per company;
    (3) infrastructure grants for laboratory innovation
        districts, including co-working spaces, business
        incubators, and maker spaces; and
    (4) workforce development grants for programs that train
        workers in laboratory-related technologies.
(c) Appropriation.--There is appropriated from the general
    fund $[amount] for each fiscal year for the Fund.

SECTION 5. TAX INCENTIVES.

(a) A business that enters into a Cooperative Research and
    Development Agreement with a federal laboratory located
    in [State] shall be eligible for a tax credit equal to
    25 percent of its expenditures under the agreement, not
    to exceed $500,000 per taxable year.
(b) A startup company that licenses technology from a federal
    laboratory located in [State] shall be exempt from state
    corporate income tax for its first 5 taxable years.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

**Explanation**: This model act provides a template for states hosting federal laboratories to invest in technology transfer infrastructure. The matching grants and tax incentives reduce private-sector transaction costs for lab partnerships, addressing one of the key barriers identified in the root causes analysis.

**Adaptations**: States with multiple federal laboratories (New Mexico, California, Tennessee, Idaho, Washington) would benefit most. States without federal labs could adapt the model for partnerships with labs in other states or with federal lab user facilities.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### DOE M&O Contract Evaluation Criteria

**Existing Authority**: 48 CFR Part 970 (DOE Acquisition Regulation); 48 CFR 917.6 (M&O Contracts)

**Proposed Regulation**: Revise DOE Order 350.1 (Contractor Human Resource Management Programs) and related acquisition guidance to:

- Require outcome-based metrics constitute at least 50% of fee determination
- Include technology transfer metrics (CRADAs, licenses, startups, licensing revenue) as evaluated performance areas
- Include workforce diversity and development metrics
- Establish 90-day CRADA processing targets as a performance standard
- Require annual facility condition reporting

**Explanation**: These regulatory changes can be implemented by the Secretary of Energy without legislation, providing an immediate path to M&O contract improvement while legislative reforms are pursued.

### OPM Direct Hire Authority for Federal Laboratories

**Existing Authority**: 5 U.S.C. 3304; 5 CFR 337.201-206

**Proposed Regulation**: OPM issues government-wide direct hire authority for scientific and engineering positions at federal research laboratories, covering all occupational series in the 0400 (biological sciences), 0800 (engineering), 1300 (physical sciences), and 1500 (mathematics/statistics) groups.

**Explanation**: Direct hire authority eliminates the competitive examination requirement, allowing labs to hire qualified scientists directly. This authority already exists for certain positions and shortage categories but should be expanded and made permanent for all federal labs.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

Federal laboratory reform legislation rests on solid constitutional ground. Congress has broad authority under Article I, Section 8 (spending power, commerce power, necessary and proper clause) and Article IV, Section 3 (power to manage federal property) to structure federal research institutions. The creation of independent boards and commissions within the executive branch is well-established under *Humphrey's Executor v. United States*, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), and subsequent case law.

The BRAC-style mission review commission raises potential nondelegation concerns, but the Supreme Court has upheld similar structures when Congress retains final approval authority. The up-or-down vote mechanism for commission recommendations has been sustained in the BRAC context.

### Preemption Questions

Federal laboratory reform legislation would not generally preempt state law, as it primarily governs federal employees, property, and contracts. The state model legislation operates in complementary fashion, using state taxing and spending authority to support federal lab partnerships. No federal-state conflicts are anticipated.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Board recommendations**: Advisory to the Secretary; enforcement through annual reporting to Congress and public transparency
- **M&O contract provisions**: Enforceable through contract terms; fee reductions for noncompliance
- **Infrastructure Fund**: Standard federal appropriations accountability (IG audits, GAO oversight, congressional reporting)
- **Mission Review Commission**: Congressional vote on recommendations; implementation by DOE
- **Workforce provisions**: OPM oversight of new personnel system; agency IG audits; annual diversity reporting

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The National Laboratories Board should be reauthorized every 10 years
- The Federal Laboratory Personnel System should be reviewed by GAO 5 years after implementation
- The National Laboratory Infrastructure Fund authorization runs 20 years (FY 2027-2046) with reauthorization required thereafter
- The Mission Review Commission dissolves after submitting its report and Congress votes on recommendations

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### National Laboratory Governance and Infrastructure Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Board capture | Board members could be appointed from industry or contractor backgrounds despite the 3-year cooling-off period | Medium |
| Infrastructure Fund diversion | Funds could be directed to politically favored labs regardless of scientific merit through congressional pressure on the Board | High |
| Mission review evasion | Labs could repackage legacy missions under new names to avoid commission scrutiny | Medium |
| Oversight consolidation rollback | Future administrations could recreate eliminated oversight entities through reorganization | Medium |
| Fee structure gaming | Contractors could optimize for measurable metrics while neglecting harder-to-quantify scientific impact | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Board is advisory, not binding | Secretary can ignore Board recommendations | Political compromise needed to pass legislation |
| Infrastructure Fund requires annual appropriations | Funding may fall short of authorized levels | Congressional budget dynamics |
| Mission review applies only to DOE labs | NIH, NIST, and other agency labs escape scrutiny | Jurisdictional complexity |
| No provision for lab closure | Commission can recommend realignment but not closure | Political resistance |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Strengthen Board authority in reauthorization: after 10-year track record, convert advisory recommendations to binding decisions requiring Secretary compliance or formal written justification for deviation
2. Seek mandatory spending classification for the Infrastructure Fund in future budget negotiations
3. Extend mission review authority to all federal laboratories through separate legislation or executive order
4. Include lab closure authority with economic transition assistance in future reauthorization
5. Require independent validation of contractor-reported performance metrics by the Board

### Federal Laboratory Workforce Modernization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Pay compression avoidance | Agencies may set maximum pay bands conservatively, undermining competitiveness | Medium |
| Diversity set-aside circumvention | The 30% fellowship set-aside could be met by recruiting from non-top-50 but still elite institutions, missing truly underrepresented populations | Medium |
| Clearance timeline exceptions | Security agencies could create exceptions to the 90-day interim clearance target that swallow the rule | High |
| Entrepreneurial leave abuse | Scientists could use entrepreneurial leave to take private-sector positions without genuine commercialization intent | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address GOCO lab workforce directly | 70,000+ GOCO employees not covered by new personnel system | GOCO employees are contractor employees, not federal |
| No provision for international researchers at weapons labs | Citizenship requirements remain unchanged | National security constraints |
| Performance removal provisions may be insufficient | Two-year timeline for removal still slower than private sector | Federal employment law framework |
| No mandatory funding for pay increases | Agencies must absorb costs within existing budgets unless appropriations increase | Budget constraints |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require M&O contracts (under the Governance Act) to provide equivalent compensation flexibility for GOCO lab employees
2. Explore classified-unclassified organizational separation within weapons labs to allow international researchers in unclassified divisions
3. Pilot expedited performance management processes at volunteer labs before system-wide implementation
4. Tie pay authority to specific appropriations requests in agency budget justifications

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Coordination between two acts | Designate OSTP as coordination lead; require joint implementation plan within 180 days of enactment |
| Resistance from existing bureaucracies | Include IG oversight of implementation milestones; annual congressional reporting |
| Measurement of "scientific impact" | Charge the National Laboratories Board with developing validated impact metrics within 2 years |
| Risk of creating new bureaucracy | Include provision that Board and personnel system staff cannot exceed specified FTE caps |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Year 3**: GAO review of implementation progress for both acts
- **Year 5**: Full evaluation of Federal Laboratory Personnel System by National Academy of Public Administration
- **Year 10**: Reauthorization decision point for Board, with option to strengthen or modify authority
- **Year 20**: Infrastructure Fund authorization expires; reauthorization debate based on facility condition data
