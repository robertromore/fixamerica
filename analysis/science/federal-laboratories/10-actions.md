# Federal Laboratories: Actions

## What Citizens Can Do

Federal laboratory reform may seem like an inside-the-Beltway concern, but citizens -- particularly those in scientific communities, lab-hosting regions, and technology-dependent industries -- have meaningful opportunities to influence policy.

## Individual Actions

### Learn About Your Local Federal Lab

- **Visit a lab**: Most federal laboratories offer public tours, open houses, and community events. DOE national labs host "Science Day" or "Community Day" events annually. NIST offers tours of its Gaithersburg and Boulder campuses. NIH offers tours of its Bethesda campus and Clinical Center.
- **Follow lab news**: Subscribe to newsletters from your nearest federal laboratory and from DOE, NIH, and NIST.
- **Understand the economic impact**: Learn how federal labs contribute to your regional economy through employment, procurement, and technology transfer.

### Engage Your Elected Officials

- **Contact your representatives**: Communicate to your senators and representative that federal laboratory investment matters to you. Focus on specific issues:
    - Infrastructure modernization to maintain scientific competitiveness
    - Workforce reforms to attract top talent
    - Technology transfer improvements to grow the economy
    - Adequate and stable lab funding
- **Attend town halls**: Raise federal science funding and lab policy during constituent meetings, particularly with members who serve on relevant committees (Energy, Armed Services, Appropriations, Science)
- **Comment on legislation**: When lab-related bills are introduced, submit comments supporting evidence-based reform

### Support Science Advocacy Organizations

Join or donate to organizations that advocate for federal research investment and laboratory reform:

- **AAAS** (American Association for the Advancement of Science) -- broad science advocacy
- **Research!America** -- advocacy for health and science research funding
- **APS** (American Physical Society) -- physics community advocacy
- **ACS** (American Chemical Society) -- chemistry community advocacy
- **STEM advocacy coalitions** -- organizations like the Task Force on American Innovation and the Science Coalition

### Use Lab Resources

Federal laboratories are public assets. Take advantage of what they offer:

- **User facilities**: If you are a researcher, apply for beam time at DOE light sources, neutron sources, or computing facilities. These are available to all qualified researchers, including those at small colleges and companies
- **Small business programs**: If you are a small business owner, explore lab technical assistance programs, CRADAs, and licensing opportunities through the Federal Laboratory Consortium (<https://www.federallabs.org>)
- **Educational programs**: Enroll children in lab-sponsored STEM programs, summer camps, and internship opportunities

## Professional and Community Actions

### For Scientists and Engineers

- **Serve on advisory committees**: DOE, NIH, NIST, and other agencies maintain advisory committees that shape lab priorities. Apply for membership or nominate qualified colleagues.
- **Participate in peer review**: Serve as a reviewer for lab research proposals, user facility allocation committees, or M&O contract evaluation panels.
- **Collaborate with labs**: Initiate partnerships through CRADAs, user facility proposals, or Work for Others agreements. Even if processes are slow, participation creates data points that support reform.
- **Publish and present**: Write opinion pieces, give talks, and engage in public discussions about the value and challenges of federal laboratories.
- **Advocate within professional societies**: Push scientific societies to take stronger positions on lab governance reform, infrastructure investment, and workforce issues.

### For Lab Employees

- **Participate in lab governance**: Engage in contractor-led employee forums, advisory panels, and planning processes.
- **Document inefficiencies**: When bureaucratic processes impede research, document the specific costs (time, money, missed opportunities) and share with lab management and DOE.
- **Mentor and recruit**: Actively mentor early-career scientists, particularly from underrepresented groups. Help recruit top talent to your lab through professional networks.
- **Engage in technology transfer**: Work with your lab's technology transfer office to identify commercial applications of your research. Explore entrepreneurial leave and startup support programs where available.
- **Support reform constructively**: Engage with reform proposals rather than reflexively opposing change. Offer practical suggestions for how reforms could be implemented effectively.

### For Lab-Hosting Communities

- **Engage with lab leadership**: Attend community liaison meetings and public forums hosted by your local laboratory.
- **Diversify the local economy**: Support economic development strategies that complement the lab but reduce dependency on a single employer. Encourage lab-adjacent businesses, entrepreneurship, and regional innovation ecosystems.
- **Support housing and infrastructure**: Advocate for local investments in housing, transportation, schools, and amenities that make lab communities attractive to researchers and their families.
- **Welcome lab workers**: Create a community culture that values scientific work and makes lab employees and their families feel integrated.

### For University Faculty and Administrators

- **Pursue joint appointments**: Establish or expand joint appointment programs with federal laboratories. These benefit both institutions by sharing talent and creating research synergies.
- **Send students to labs**: Encourage graduate students and postdocs to pursue lab internships, fellowships, and collaborative research opportunities.
- **Advocate for complementarity**: Push for lab-university relationships that are genuinely complementary rather than competitive. Support policies that increase the total federal research investment rather than redistributing between labs and universities.
- **Partner on technology transfer**: Collaborate with labs on commercialization of jointly developed technologies, leveraging university entrepreneurship ecosystems.

### For Industry

- **Partner with labs**: Engage federal laboratories through CRADAs, licensing agreements, or Work for Others contracts. Even if processes are cumbersome, engagement creates business value and demonstrates demand for reform.
- **Provide feedback**: Document barriers to partnership and communicate them to lab technology transfer offices, DOE, and congressional offices. Specific examples of bureaucratic obstacles are powerful reform arguments.
- **Support lab-adjacent innovation**: Invest in startups and businesses near federal laboratories that can commercialize lab technology.
- **Hire from labs**: Recruit lab-trained scientists and engineers. The quality of lab training is a competitive advantage that industry should actively seek.

## Political Actions

### Support Lab Reform Candidates

- Look for candidates who understand science policy and support evidence-based laboratory reform
- Ask candidates about their positions on federal R&D investment, lab modernization, and technology transfer
- Support candidates from both parties who demonstrate commitment to lab issues -- this is historically a bipartisan area

### Advocate for Specific Legislation

When laboratory reform legislation is introduced (see [Legislation](11-legislation.md)), take specific actions:

| Action | How | When |
|--------|-----|------|
| Contact representatives | Call, email, or write to your senators and representative | When bills are introduced and when committee votes are scheduled |
| Testify or submit comments | Offer to testify at hearings or submit written comments for the record | During committee consideration |
| Organize letters | Coordinate sign-on letters from professional societies, businesses, or community organizations | Before key votes |
| Engage media | Write op-eds, letters to the editor, or social media posts explaining why lab reform matters | Throughout the legislative process |

### Participate in Federal Advisory Processes

- **DOE budget process**: Comment on DOE budget priorities during public comment periods
- **FACA committees**: Apply for positions on Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) committees related to labs
- **National Academies studies**: Participate in National Academies committee studies on lab-related topics
- **OMB circulars**: Comment on OMB management and regulatory policies that affect labs
