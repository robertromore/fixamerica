# International Cooperation: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

International scientific cooperation sits at the intersection of several politically charged domains: immigration, China policy, federal spending, and national security. The debate is not simply "for" or "against" international collaboration but reflects deeper disagreements about the role of the United States in the world, the value of openness versus security, and who benefits from taxpayer-funded research. This analysis evaluates two proposed bills -- the International Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act and the Science Diplomacy and Researcher Mobility Act -- through nine political perspectives.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | National security, fiscal discipline, competitiveness | Strong on China, support targeted collaboration, demand accountability |
| Liberal | International cooperation, scientific openness, diversity | Alliances as force multiplier, pro-immigration, expand collaboration |
| Progressive | Anti-militarism, equity, global justice | Skeptical of securitization, strongly pro-immigration, oppose racial profiling |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, free movement, minimal government | Open borders for talent, oppose government control of research |
| Constitutionalist | Separation of powers, enumerated authority, transparency | Congressional oversight of international commitments, skeptical of executive discretion |
| Populist | "America First," economic nationalism, anti-elite | Skeptical of foreign scientists, question mega-project costs, protect American workers |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, evidence-based policy, bipartisan solutions | Balanced approach, support both security and openness |
| Religious Right | Moral clarity, support for allies, anti-communist | Support collaboration with democratic allies, oppose engagement with atheist regimes |
| Democratic Socialist | International solidarity, public goods, anti-imperialism | Support global science cooperation, oppose securitization, favor public over private research |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent focus on national security and competitiveness with China; support for scientific collaboration is genuine but conditioned on security safeguards. |
| Principle consistency | Generally consistent: favor strong science investment as part of national power, but insist on protecting technologies from adversaries. |
| Goalpost stability | Mostly stable; the 2% GDP target for defense spending finds a parallel in calls for increased R&D. Burden-sharing expectations are consistent. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; tend to view U.S.-China science relations as zero-sum but recognize positive-sum dynamics with allies. |

**Justification:** Conservatives are genuine supporters of American scientific preeminence and understand that international collaboration contributes to it. However, their strong emphasis on the China threat leads them to prioritize security measures even when those measures impose costs on legitimate collaboration. The key tension is between their internationalist wing (which supports robust engagement with allies) and their nationalist wing (which is skeptical of any international entanglement).

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Heritage Foundation reports supporting increased R&D spending as a component of national defense.
- Congressional Republican support for the CHIPS and Science Act, demonstrating bipartisan agreement on science competitiveness.
- Consistent calls for stronger research security measures from Senate Commerce Committee Republicans.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree that U.S. scientific leadership is under threat and that China poses a challenge, but emphasize security risks more than the analysis does. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agree on funding instability and institutional fragmentation but disagree that securitization is a root cause; view it as a necessary response to real threats. |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation, "Protecting American Science from Foreign Threats" (2023).
- American Enterprise Institute, "U.S.-China Technology Competition" series (2024).

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent opposition to government control over research and movement of people. |
| Principle consistency | Reliably applies free market and individual liberty principles to science policy. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; consistently oppose government restrictions on scientific exchange and immigration. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low; view free exchange of ideas and people as inherently positive-sum. |

**Justification:** Libertarians are the most consistently pro-openness perspective on both immigration and research freedom. They oppose government restrictions on scientific collaboration as infringements on individual liberty and academic freedom. However, they are also skeptical of government-funded mega-science projects, preferring private-sector research.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute publications on immigration reform and the economic benefits of high-skill immigration.
- Reason Foundation advocacy for reducing government barriers to scientific collaboration.
- Consistent libertarian opposition to government surveillance and security state expansion.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree that government restrictions are the primary problem but disagree with the premise that more government funding is the solution. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree on securitization and immigration dysfunction; disagree that declining public investment is a root cause (prefer private funding). |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute, "Immigration Research and Policy Brief" series (2024).
- Reason Foundation, "Freeing Science from Government Control" (2023).

#### Solution Evaluations

| International Science Fund | 2/10 | Oppose; government should not fund research | Anti-statism |
| Science diplomacy expansion | 3/10 | Skeptical of government diplomacy; prefer private exchanges | Limited government |
| PP 10043 reform | 10/10 | Want full repeal; government has no right to restrict movement based on nationality | Individual liberty |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act | 4/10 | Oppose the Fund and Council; support the security reform and anti-profiling provisions | Government spending |
| Science Diplomacy and Mobility Act | 6/10 | Support visa and immigration reforms; oppose State Department expansion | Government growth |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Eliminate all visa caps and restrictions for researchers and skilled workers.
- Privatize research funding and eliminate federal research agencies.
- Replace government science diplomacy with private-sector and university-led international engagement.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives (on immigration and anti-profiling), Liberals (on visa reform).
- **Potential bridges:** Conservatives (on reducing government waste), Constitutionalists (on limiting executive power).
- **Unlikely partners:** Populists (on immigration), Democratic Socialists (on government funding).

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent focus on constitutional process, congressional authority, and transparency. |
| Principle consistency | Reliably applies separation of powers and enumerated authority principles. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; focus on process rather than substance ensures consistency. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; primarily concerned with how decisions are made rather than specific outcomes. |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists evaluate international cooperation primarily through the lens of proper constitutional process. They support congressional oversight of international commitments, insist that significant agreements receive formal legislative authorization, and are skeptical of executive unilateralism (including PP 10043). Their process-focused approach makes them predictable and reliable negotiating partners.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Federalist Society debates on the treaty power and executive agreements in science policy.
- Congressional constitutionalist caucus members questioning executive authority over visa restrictions.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agree that institutional fragmentation and lack of coordination are problems; less focused on the substantive dimensions of the analysis. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agree that executive overreach (PP 10043) and congressional abdication (funding instability) are root causes. |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation legal analysis on executive authority over immigration.
- Federalist Society, "Separation of Powers and Science Policy" panel (2023).

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Risk-based research security | 7/10 | Support statutory framework over executive discretion | Rule of law |
| STEM green card reform | 6/10 | Support Congress setting immigration policy rather than executive orders | Legislative authority |
| International Science Fund | 8/10 | Support: proper use of appropriations power for treaty commitments | Congressional power |
| Science diplomacy expansion | 5/10 | Neutral; support if properly authorized and funded | Process |
| PP 10043 reform | 7/10 | Support: Congress, not the President, should set research policy | Separation of powers |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act | 8/10 | Support the Council, Fund, and congressional oversight mechanisms; strong support for codifying research security standards in statute rather than leaving them to executive discretion | Congressional authority |
| Science Diplomacy and Mobility Act | 7/10 | Support immigration reform through legislation; support PP 10043 reform as reassertion of congressional power over visa policy | Proper process |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Require that all bilateral S&T agreements above a specified dollar threshold be submitted to the Senate as treaties.
- Prohibit executive branch expenditure of funds for international science projects not specifically authorized by Congress.
- Create a formal congressional notification and review process for all new international research partnerships.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (on oversight), Libertarians (on limiting executive power).
- **Potential bridges:** Liberals and Centrists (on codifying protections in statute).
- **Unlikely partners:** Populists (who prefer executive action on China).

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is "America First" and protecting workers; underlying motivation is often cultural anxiety about immigration and foreign influence. |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent: oppose foreign scientists entering the U.S. but support large defense research programs that depend on them. |
| Goalpost stability | Unstable; positions shift based on which country or group is being discussed. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very high; view science policy through a nationalist, zero-sum lens. |

**Justification:** Populists are the least predictable perspective on international scientific cooperation. Their "America First" framing leads them to oppose immigration of researchers and question the value of international projects, but they simultaneously support a strong defense industrial base that depends on international talent and collaboration. Their positions are heavily influenced by which country or group is under discussion (hostile toward China, more flexible toward allied nations).

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Populist congressional members questioning ITER funding while supporting defense R&D that involves international partners.
- Inconsistent positions on H-1B visas depending on whether the discussion focuses on tech companies or academic researchers.
- Strong opposition to the U.S.-China STA renewal.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agree that China is a threat but disagree that the U.S. needs more foreign scientists; believe American workers should come first. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Disagree with the analysis's framing; view the root cause as "too much" international cooperation, not too little. |

**Source references:**

- American Compass, "The Case for Industrial Policy Over Immigration" (2023).
- Populist media commentary on "sending American jobs overseas."

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Risk-based research security | 4/10 | Prefer stricter, country-based restrictions | China threat |
| STEM green card reform | 2/10 | Oppose: displaces American STEM workers | Economic nationalism |
| International Science Fund | 3/10 | Oppose: spending taxpayer money on foreign projects | America First |
| Science diplomacy expansion | 2/10 | Oppose: State Department waste | Anti-establishment |
| PP 10043 reform | 1/10 | Strongly oppose: PP 10043 should be maintained or expanded | Anti-China |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act | 3/10 | Oppose safe harbor and anti-profiling provisions; may support the Fund if limited to allied-nation projects | Nationalism |
| Science Diplomacy and Mobility Act | 2/10 | Oppose immigration provisions; oppose PP 10043 reform | America First |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Invest in domestic STEM education to produce American scientists rather than importing foreign ones.
- Limit international research collaboration to "Five Eyes" and NATO allies; exclude China entirely.
- Require that all federally funded research be conducted exclusively by U.S. citizens.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (on China restrictions, partially).
- **Potential bridges:** Constitutionalists (on congressional oversight).
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberals, Progressives, Libertarians (on immigration), Centrists (on international engagement).

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent focus on evidence-based policy, pragmatic balance between openness and security. |
| Principle consistency | Reliably applies cost-benefit analysis and bipartisan feasibility to science policy proposals. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; centrist science policy positions have been consistent for decades. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; view international cooperation as positive-sum when properly managed. |

**Justification:** Centrists are the core constituency for the proposed legislation. They support international scientific cooperation as essential for American competitiveness, favor evidence-based security measures over broad restrictions, and are willing to invest in science diplomacy and researcher immigration. Their pragmatic approach makes them reliable coalition partners.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan support for the CHIPS and Science Act.
- CSIS and Atlantic Council publications on science competition and cooperation.
- Bipartisan congressional caucuses supporting STEM immigration reform.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement with the analysis; see the problems as real and addressable through targeted reform. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree on all major root causes; may place slightly less emphasis on securitization than the analysis does. |

**Source references:**

- Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), "Technology Competition with China" series (2024).
- Bipartisan Policy Center, "Immigration and Innovation" report (2023).

| Risk-based research security | 9/10 | Strong support; the right balance of openness and security | Effectiveness |
| STEM green card reform | 8/10 | Support; key to competitiveness | Talent attraction |
| International Science Fund | 9/10 | Strong support; predictable funding is essential | U.S. credibility |
| Science diplomacy expansion | 8/10 | Support; science is a foreign policy tool | Strategic engagement |
| PP 10043 reform | 7/10 | Support individualized assessment; prefer reform over repeal | Balance |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act | 9/10 | Strong support across all provisions | Balanced approach |
| Science Diplomacy and Mobility Act | 8/10 | Strong support; may prefer "reform" language on PP 10043 over "rescind" | Political feasibility |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Create a bipartisan commission on international scientific cooperation to build political consensus for reforms.
- Pilot the Science Fast Track visa at a small number of consulates before nationwide expansion.
- Link Science Fund appropriations to measurable project milestones to address fiscal conservative concerns.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberals (on cooperation), Conservatives (on competitiveness).
- **Potential bridges:** Constitutionalists (on process), Religious Right (on ally engagement).
- **Unlikely partners:** Populists (on immigration and international spending).

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is moral clarity and supporting allies; underlying motivation includes cultural conservatism and opposition to secular internationalism. |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent: support international engagement with allies (Israel, democracies) but oppose engagement with adversaries (China) and secular international organizations. |
| Goalpost stability | Somewhat unstable; positions shift depending on which countries and values are involved. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate to high; view science cooperation through a moral/civilizational lens. |

**Justification:** The Religious Right's position on international scientific cooperation is filtered through its broader worldview of moral/civilizational struggle. They support scientific cooperation with democratic allies, particularly Israel and Christian-majority nations, but are deeply skeptical of engagement with China and secular international organizations. Science policy is not a primary focus, leading to less developed and more inconsistent positions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Christians United for Israel (CUFI) support for U.S.-Israel research cooperation.
- Religious right skepticism of international climate science cooperation.
- General support for strong defense research to counter atheist adversaries.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Partially agree; concerned about China but less focused on immigration or funding issues. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | View the root cause as moral decline and insufficient resolve against adversaries rather than institutional failures. |

**Source references:**

- Family Research Council policy positions on China and national security.
- ACLJ commentary on religious freedom dimensions of international engagement.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|

| STEM green card reform | 4/10 | Cautiously supportive for researchers from allied nations; oppose for Chinese researchers | Cultural concerns |
| International Science Fund | 6/10 | Support funding for projects with allies; skeptical of projects involving China | Ally preference |
| Science diplomacy expansion | 5/10 | Support diplomacy with democracies; oppose engagement with authoritarian regimes | Values-based diplomacy |
| PP 10043 reform | 2/10 | Oppose; China is a threat to religious freedom and democracy | Anti-China |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act | 5/10 | Support the Fund and Council if they prioritize allied engagement; oppose safe harbor provisions that benefit Chinese researchers | China suspicion |
| Science Diplomacy and Mobility Act | 4/10 | Support diplomacy expansion with allies; oppose PP 10043 reform and broad immigration provisions | Values filter |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Create a "Democratic Science Alliance" limited to U.S., EU, UK, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Australia, and Canada.
- Exclude China from all mega-science projects and require U.S. researchers to choose between Chinese and American collaborations.
- Prioritize international health research cooperation focused on religious freedom and persecuted communities.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (on China policy).
- **Potential bridges:** Centrists (on ally engagement), Populists (on anti-China measures).
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives (on engagement with adversaries), Democratic Socialists (on values), Libertarians (on immigration).

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent commitment to international solidarity and opposition to securitization; genuine belief in science as a global public good. |
| Principle consistency | Generally consistent; apply anti-imperialism and pro-worker principles to science policy. Minor tension between supporting government-funded research and opposing government security apparatus. |
| Goalpost stability | Mostly stable; consistently oppose the national security framing of science. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; view science as inherently international and cooperative. |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists view international scientific cooperation through the lens of global solidarity and opposition to what they see as the militarization of science. They strongly support open collaboration, oppose all forms of securitization and racial profiling, and want science to serve public goods rather than corporate or military interests. Their main critique of the proposed legislation is that it does not go far enough in dismantling the security apparatus and does not adequately address global equity in science.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- DSA International Committee positions on science as a global public good.
- Jacobin magazine coverage of the China Initiative as racial profiling.
- Sanders Institute advocacy for public investment in basic research.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement that securitization and racial profiling are the primary problems; would add corporate capture of research as an additional concern. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strong agreement on securitization, immigration dysfunction, and declining public investment; would add neoliberal privatization as a root cause. |

**Source references:**

- Jacobin, "The Witch Hunt Against Chinese-American Scientists" (2022).

### Common Ground Synthesis

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Risk-based research security | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc, Con | RelR | Pop |
| STEM green card reform | Lib, Prog, Libt, Cent, DemSoc, Const | Con | Pop, RelR |
| International Science Fund | Lib, Prog, Const, Cent, DemSoc, Con, RelR | Pop | Libt |
| Science diplomacy expansion | Lib, Prog, Cent, Con, DemSoc | Const, RelR | Pop, Libt |
| PP 10043 reform | Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Cent, DemSoc | - | Con, Pop, RelR |

**Key insight:** Risk-based research security and the International Science Fund have the broadest coalition support (7+ perspectives above threshold 5). PP 10043 reform has strong support from 6 perspectives but faces structural opposition from 3, making it the most politically polarizing proposal. The International Science Fund is the only proposal where Libertarians are in structural opposition while the rest of the spectrum generally agrees, reflecting the unique libertarian skepticism of government-funded research. Populists are structurally opposed to nearly every proposal, making them the most difficult perspective to include in any coalition.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: The "Secure Open Science" Framework

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Constitutionalist

**Core Agreement:** The United States must remain the world's leading destination for scientific talent and collaboration, but this openness must be paired with targeted, effective security measures that protect genuinely sensitive technologies without chilling legitimate research.

**Policy Description:**

Pass the **International Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act** with a modified protected technology list process that gives the intelligence community a stronger initial voice in defining the scope. Include a statutory requirement that the list be reviewed by a bipartisan congressional committee before publication. Pair this with full funding for the International Science Commitment Fund.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Protected technology list addresses security concerns; congressional review ensures accountability |
| Liberal | Risk-based framework replaces racial profiling; Fund ensures U.S. leadership in international projects |
| Centrist | Evidence-based approach balances security and openness; bipartisan process builds durability |
| Constitutionalist | Congressional review of the protected list and Fund prospectus preserve legislative authority |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts that most research is presumptively open; gives up broad country-based restrictions |
| Liberal | Accepts a protected technology list and intelligence community role in defining it |
| Centrist | Accepts that the process may be slower than purely executive action |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts that some executive discretion in list management is necessary for security reasons |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives (but the core of the policy establishment)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High; statutory framework creates lasting institutional architecture
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone bill or CHIPS and Science Act reauthorization

---

### Compromise 2: The "Talent Competitiveness" Package

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Libertarian + Centrist + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** The United States is losing the global competition for scientific talent due to a broken immigration system, and STEM immigration reform is essential for national competitiveness regardless of one's broader position on immigration.

**Policy Description:**

Pass the STEM immigration provisions of the **Science Diplomacy and Researcher Mobility Act** as a standalone bill: eliminate per-country caps for STEM doctoral graduates, create the Science Fast Track visa, waive the J-1 two-year home residency requirement for STEM researchers, and require individualized assessment under PP 10043.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Comprehensive immigration reform for researchers; addresses racial profiling |
| Progressive | Ends nationality-based discrimination; reduces securitization |
| Libertarian | Moves toward free movement of people; reduces government barriers |
| Centrist | Evidence-based reform that enhances competitiveness |
| Democratic Socialist | Ends racial profiling; opens opportunities for Global South researchers |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Accepts PP 10043 reform rather than full repeal |
| Progressive | Accepts targeted reform rather than comprehensive immigration overhaul |
| Libertarian | Accepts government-managed visa system rather than open borders |
| Centrist | Accepts political risk of pro-immigration legislation |
| Democratic Socialist | Accepts STEM-focused reform rather than universal immigration reform |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High for statutory changes (per-country cap elimination); medium for PP 10043 reform (executive action could reverse)
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone bill packaged as competitiveness legislation

---

### Compromise 3: The "Allied Science" Initiative

**Bridges:** Conservative + Centrist + Religious Right + Constitutionalist

**Core Agreement:** Scientific cooperation with democratic allies strengthens American security and should be expanded, while collaboration with strategic adversaries should be limited and carefully managed.

**Policy Description:**

Create a two-tier international science engagement framework: Tier 1 (democratic allies) receives expedited visa processing, streamlined collaboration approval, and priority access to the International Science Fund. Tier 2 (strategic competitors, including China) is subject to enhanced screening, restricted collaboration areas, and case-by-case approval for projects exceeding specified thresholds.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Strengthens allied cooperation while maintaining China restrictions |
| Centrist | Creates a structured, predictable framework for engagement |
| Religious Right | Prioritizes democracies and allies over authoritarian regimes |
| Constitutionalist | Creates a transparent, congressionally authorized framework |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts expanded science cooperation with allies (more openness than status quo) |
| Centrist | Accepts a tiered system that limits flexibility with China |
| Religious Right | Accepts that the tier system is based on strategic rather than moral/religious criteria |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts some executive discretion in managing the tier system |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives (plus partial Populist support)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Medium; the tier classification would face pressure from both sides
- **Implementation Path:** Executive order or NDAA amendment; could evolve into standalone legislation

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The **"Secure Open Science" coalition** (Compromise 1) is the most viable path to comprehensive reform. It unites the policy establishment (Liberals, Centrists, Conservatives) with the process-focused Constitutionalists around a framework that is both substantively sound and politically defensible. The key to this coalition is demonstrating that risk-based security is more effective than broad restrictions, which defuses the Conservative concern that openness equals vulnerability.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Immigration politics**: STEM immigration reform is the most impactful proposal but the most politically toxic. Any bill touching immigration risks being captured by the broader immigration debate.
2. **China consensus**: The bipartisan consensus that the U.S. must be "tough on China" makes it politically costly to reform PP 10043 or advocate for continued scientific engagement with Chinese institutions.
3. **Appropriations resistance**: Creating multi-year funding mechanisms reduces appropriations committee power, which both parties' appropriators will resist.
4. **Security community opposition**: The FBI and intelligence community will resist constraints on their investigative authority and the prohibition on ethnicity-based investigations.

### Low Consistency Partners

**Populists** (2/5) are the most difficult perspective to incorporate. Their nationalism and anti-immigration stance put them in structural opposition to nearly every proposed reform. The only entry point is framing reforms as essential to "winning" the competition with China, but even this framing is complicated by their opposition to immigration.

The **Religious Right** (3/5) can be partially incorporated through the "Allied Science" framework (Compromise 3), which aligns with their preference for engagement with democratic allies over authoritarian regimes.

### Recommended Approach

Pursue a **sequenced, multi-track strategy**:

1. **Track 1 (Immediate):** Pass the International Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act through the "Secure Open Science" coalition. This establishes the institutional framework (Council, Fund, risk-based security) that enables everything else.
2. **Track 2 (Year 2):** Package STEM immigration reform as a standalone competitiveness bill, leveraging the "Talent Competitiveness" coalition. Frame it as a national security measure: "China is trying to recruit our best scientists; we need to make it easier for them to stay."
3. **Track 3 (Ongoing):** Build toward PP 10043 reform through accumulating evidence of its costs, published through the annual reporting requirements established in Track 1. Reform becomes politically viable when the data demonstrates that the proclamation costs more than it protects.
