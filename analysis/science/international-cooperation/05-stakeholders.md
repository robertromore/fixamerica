- **Interest**: Access to international talent, protection of intellectual property, maintenance of technological edge, stable export control environment
- **Power**: Very high; major campaign contributors, large employers, significant lobbying presence
- **Position**: Generally favor immigration reform to attract talent and oppose overly broad technology restrictions that impede their global operations; defense contractors support targeted security measures
- **Key concerns**: H-1B visa caps, export controls on AI and semiconductor technology, impact of decoupling on global supply chains

#### International Partner Governments and Institutions

- **Who**: Research councils and science ministries of allied nations (UK Research and Innovation, German Research Foundation, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, etc.); CERN, ITER Organization, ESA
- **Interest**: Continued U.S. participation in international projects, predictable U.S. funding, stable visa environment for their researchers visiting the U.S.
- **Power**: Moderate; can redirect partnerships to other nations if the U.S. becomes an unreliable partner; collective bargaining power through multilateral organizations
- **Position**: Concerned about U.S. reliability; some are establishing their own research security frameworks in coordination with the U.S., while others resist what they see as American overreach
- **Key concerns**: U.S. funding instability for ITER and other projects, extraterritorial application of U.S. export controls, visa barriers for their researchers

#### Chinese Government and Research Institutions

- **Who**: Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, major Chinese universities (Tsinghua, Peking, Zhejiang, etc.), Chinese researchers in the U.S.
- **Interest**: Continued access to U.S. research infrastructure, talent, and knowledge; development of China's domestic science capacity; implementation of military-civil fusion strategy
- **Power**: Significant; second-largest R&D spender globally; can offer incentives (talent programs, facilities) to attract researchers away from the U.S.
- **Position**: Officially protest U.S. restrictions as discriminatory; in practice, accelerating efforts to build domestic capacity and attract Chinese researchers to return through programs like the Thousand Talents Plan
- **Key concerns**: U.S. technology export controls, visa restrictions, loss of access to U.S. research partnerships

## Key Dynamics

### Power Asymmetry

The stakeholders most affected by policy decisions (international students, early-career researchers, diaspora communities) have the least political power, while the stakeholders driving restrictive policies (national security agencies, congressional hawks) face minimal political cost from overreaction. This power asymmetry systematically biases policy toward excessive restriction.

### The Missing Voice Problem

Basic researchers in fields with no security implications (ecology, mathematics, cosmology, social science) are swept up in security measures designed for dual-use technologies (AI, quantum computing, advanced materials). These researchers have limited ability to advocate for exemptions because science policy debates are dominated by the high-profile technology and security communities.

### Industry Ambivalence

The technology industry simultaneously benefits from international talent (and thus favors immigration reform) and from restricted technology transfer (and thus supports some export controls). This ambivalence weakens what could otherwise be a powerful political coalition for open scientific cooperation.
