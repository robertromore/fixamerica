# International Cooperation: Overview

## Executive Summary

International scientific cooperation is one of the most powerful engines of discovery, innovation, and diplomacy that the United States possesses. From the International Space Station orbiting 250 miles overhead to the Large Hadron Collider probing the fundamental structure of matter, the most ambitious scientific endeavors of the modern era have been multinational projects that no single country could accomplish alone. The United States has historically been the world's leading convener of international research collaborations, leveraging its university system, federal laboratories, and funding agencies to attract the world's best talent and lead transformative global projects.

Yet this leadership is under growing strain. Geopolitical tensions, particularly the escalating strategic competition with China, have introduced unprecedented restrictions on scientific exchange. Visa backlogs and hostile immigration environments deter international researchers from coming to or remaining in the United States. Federal research funding has stagnated relative to GDP, limiting America's capacity to anchor major international projects. Meanwhile, competitors are investing heavily: China's R&D spending surpassed the European Union's in 2020 and is projected to exceed U.S. spending by the early 2030s if current trends continue.

The challenge is to sustain and strengthen international scientific cooperation while managing legitimate national security concerns about technology transfer and intellectual property theft. Getting this balance wrong in either direction carries profound consequences: too much restriction chokes the open exchange that drives American scientific preeminence, while too little vigilance risks enabling adversaries to acquire sensitive technologies.

## Scope

This analysis covers the major dimensions of U.S. international scientific cooperation:

- **Science diplomacy**: The use of scientific collaboration as a tool of foreign policy, including bilateral science and technology (S&T) agreements, science attache programs, and scientific exchanges
- **Major international research projects**: U.S. participation in large-scale multinational facilities and programs, including CERN, ITER, the International Space Station (ISS), the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), and international genomics initiatives
- **Researcher mobility and visas**: Policies governing the movement of scientists, students, and scholars across borders, including J-1, H-1B, and O-1 visa categories
- **China collaboration tensions**: The complex challenge of maintaining productive scientific relationships with China while mitigating risks of technology transfer and espionage, including the impact of the Department of Justice's "China Initiative" and its aftermath
- **Bilateral and multilateral S&T agreements**: The framework of over 60 bilateral science and technology agreements the U.S. maintains with partner nations
- **Open science and data sharing**: International norms around open access to research data, publications, and reproducibility standards

| DOJ "China Initiative" cases filed (2018-2022) | ~77 | MIT Technology Review, 2022 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Openness vs. Security**: The open exchange of ideas and talent that drives scientific progress is in direct tension with the need to protect sensitive technologies from adversary exploitation. Tightening security measures (export controls, visa restrictions, research screening) can deter legitimate collaboration alongside illegitimate acquisition.

- **Competition vs. Cooperation with China**: China is simultaneously the United States' most important scientific collaborator and its primary strategic competitor. U.S.-China co-authored papers are among the most highly cited in the world, yet concerns about intellectual property theft, military-civil fusion, and forced technology transfer have led to sweeping restrictions that also hamper beneficial research.

- **Federal Investment vs. Fiscal Constraint**: Anchoring major international projects requires substantial, sustained federal funding commitments, often over decades. Budget uncertainty and sequestration undermine U.S. credibility as a reliable partner and can result in cost overruns or partner withdrawal.

- **Brain Drain vs. Brain Gain**: The United States benefits enormously from attracting international STEM talent, but immigration restrictions, lengthy green card backlogs, and hostile political rhetoric risk turning "brain gain" into "brain drain" as talented researchers choose other destinations.

- **Bilateral vs. Multilateral Frameworks**: Bilateral S&T agreements offer flexibility and can be tailored to specific partner relationships, but they are ad hoc and lack the institutional durability of multilateral arrangements. Multilateral projects (CERN, ITER) are more resilient but slower to establish and harder to govern.

## Key Questions

1. How can the United States maintain productive scientific collaboration with China while adequately protecting national security interests?
2. What reforms to the visa and immigration system are needed to ensure the U.S. remains the world's top destination for scientific talent?
3. Is the current level of U.S. investment in international mega-science projects sufficient to maintain scientific leadership?
4. How should the U.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement, which has been periodically renewed since 1979 and was allowed to lapse in 2023 before a limited extension in 2024, be restructured?
5. What institutional mechanisms can ensure that research security measures do not create a chilling effect on legitimate international collaboration?

## Vision of Success

A successful international cooperation framework would feature:

- **Sustained U.S. leadership** in anchoring and participating in the world's most ambitious international research projects, from fusion energy to space exploration to pandemic preparedness
- **A welcoming immigration system** that attracts and retains the world's best scientific talent, with streamlined visa processes and clear pathways to permanent residency for researchers
- **Risk-calibrated engagement with China** that maintains productive collaboration in basic research while protecting genuinely sensitive technologies through targeted, evidence-based controls
- **Durable funding commitments** that make the United States a reliable partner in decade-long international projects, backed by bipartisan consensus
- **Robust science diplomacy** that uses scientific cooperation as a tool for building trust, advancing shared goals, and extending American influence
