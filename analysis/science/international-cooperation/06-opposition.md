# International Cooperation: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to international scientific cooperation, or at least to expanding it, comes from several distinct sources with different motivations. Understanding these opposition dynamics is essential for crafting reforms that address legitimate concerns while avoiding unnecessary restrictions on beneficial collaboration.

## Opposition Categories

### 1. National Security Hawks

**Who**: Elements within the FBI Counterintelligence Division, DOJ National Security Division, congressional defense committees, think tanks focused on China competition (e.g., Center for a New American Security, Foundation for Defense of Democracies), and some former intelligence officials.

**Core Argument**: China is engaged in a systematic, state-directed campaign to acquire U.S. technology and research through both legal and illegal means. Scientific collaboration with Chinese institutions is a primary vector for this acquisition. The risk of technology transfer far outweighs the benefits of cooperation, particularly in fields with dual-use potential.

**Specific Positions**:

- Support maintaining or expanding PP 10043 visa restrictions on Chinese students and researchers affiliated with military-linked institutions
- Advocate for broader application of deemed export controls to fundamental research
- Push for mandatory screening of international research collaborations for security risks before funding
- Support restricting Chinese access to U.S. cloud computing resources used for research
- Argue that the U.S.-China STA should not be renewed or should be limited to narrow, non-sensitive areas

**Strengths of Their Position**:

- Chinese espionage against U.S. research institutions is a documented, real threat. The FBI has identified hundreds of cases of attempted technology acquisition, and Chinese talent recruitment programs have facilitated the transfer of valuable research to Chinese institutions.
- China's military-civil fusion strategy blurs the line between civilian and military research, making it genuinely difficult to determine which collaborations are benign.
- Several high-profile cases have demonstrated actual technology theft, including the 2020 conviction of Charles Lieber (Harvard chemistry professor) for tax fraud related to undisclosed payments from the Wuhan University of Technology.

**Weaknesses of Their Position**:

- Overly broad restrictions harm U.S. competitiveness more than they protect it. Chinese science continues to advance regardless of U.S. restrictions; the primary effect is to deny the U.S. access to Chinese research and talent.
- The China Initiative's track record undermines their credibility. The majority of cases involved administrative violations (failure to disclose), not espionage, and multiple cases resulted in acquittals or were dropped.
- Country-based restrictions are inherently over-inclusive. Treating all Chinese researchers as potential threats based on national origin amounts to racial profiling and drives away loyal Chinese-American scientists who are among the most productive researchers in the U.S. system.
- Unilateral U.S. restrictions simply redirect Chinese engagement to European and other partners, achieving little net security benefit.

### 2. Economic Nationalists and Populists

**Who**: Members of Congress from both parties who frame science policy in terms of jobs and competitiveness, populist media figures, labor-focused advocacy organizations concerned about wage impacts of immigration.

**Core Argument**: International scientific cooperation enriches foreign nations and multinational corporations at the expense of American workers and taxpayers. U.S. tax dollars fund research that is then shared with competitors, and the immigration of foreign scientists depresses wages for American STEM workers.

**Specific Positions**:

- Oppose increases in H-1B visas and other immigration pathways for foreign researchers
- Argue that federal research funding should prioritize American-born scientists
- Question the value of U.S. contributions to expensive international projects (ITER, CERN) when domestic infrastructure and education are underfunded
- Advocate for stronger "buy American" provisions in research procurement
- Oppose open data and open access mandates that make taxpayer-funded research available to foreign competitors

**Strengths of Their Position**:

- There are legitimate concerns about the misuse of the H-1B program by some employers to hire cheaper foreign labor, though this is more prevalent in the IT sector than in academic research.
- U.S. contributions to some international projects have yielded questionable returns. ITER, in particular, has suffered massive cost overruns and schedule delays.
- Domestic STEM education and workforce development deserve significant investment, and there is a valid argument that overreliance on imported talent has reduced the urgency of addressing domestic workforce gaps.

**Weaknesses of Their Position**:

- The premise that international researchers displace American workers is not supported by evidence for academic research. International researchers complement rather than substitute for domestic researchers, and their presence generates jobs through research activity. Studies consistently find that immigrant scientists create more jobs than they fill (Kerr and Lincoln, "The Supply Side of Innovation: H-1B Visa Reforms and U.S. Ethnic Invention," *Journal of Labor Economics*, 2010).
- Restricting immigration of scientific talent does not build a domestic STEM workforce; it simply reduces total U.S. scientific capacity. Building a larger domestic pipeline takes decades and requires sustained investment in K-12 and higher education.
- Withdrawing from international projects would forfeit U.S. influence over the direction of research and access to results, making the U.S. a free rider rather than a leader.

### 3. Fiscal Conservatives

**Who**: Budget hawks in Congress, taxpayer advocacy groups, OMB officials focused on deficit reduction.

**Core Argument**: International mega-science projects are expensive, prone to cost overruns, and represent discretionary spending that should be scrutinized like any other federal expenditure. Decade-long funding commitments for projects like ITER limit congressional flexibility.

**Specific Positions**:

- Question whether U.S. participation in ITER (projected $6.5 billion U.S. share) is justified given the emergence of private fusion companies
- Oppose open-ended commitments to international projects without clear cost caps and milestones
- Advocate for cost-benefit analyses of bilateral S&T agreements
- Resist increases in State Department science diplomacy funding when the department's core diplomatic functions are underfunded

**Strengths of Their Position**:

- ITER's cost and schedule performance has been genuinely poor, and congressional skepticism is understandable.
- Fiscal discipline is important, and international scientific commitments should be subject to rigorous evaluation like any other federal spending.
- The authorization-appropriation gap (e.g., CHIPS and Science Act) reflects real fiscal constraints, not merely a lack of political will.

**Weaknesses of Their Position**:

- The long-term return on investment from basic research is well-documented and substantial. Studies by the National Bureau of Economic Research estimate that the social return on publicly funded research is approximately 30-100 percent per year (Jones and Summers, "A Calculation of the Social Returns to Innovation," *NBER Working Paper*, 2020).
- Cutting international commitments damages U.S. credibility and makes it harder to build future partnerships. Once trust is lost, it is very expensive to rebuild.
- Comparisons between ITER and private fusion companies are misleading. ITER is pursuing tokamak-scale demonstration that no private company is attempting; the two approaches are complementary, not substitutes.

### 4. Isolationists and Sovereignty Advocates

**Who**: Segments of the libertarian movement, some constitutional conservatives, and elements of both the progressive and populist right who oppose international entanglements.

**Core Argument**: International scientific agreements and organizations entangle the United States in commitments that constrain sovereignty, create bureaucratic dependencies, and divert resources from domestic priorities. Science should be funded domestically and its results should benefit Americans first.

**Specific Positions**:

- Oppose U.S. membership in or contributions to international scientific organizations
- Object to international agreements that require the U.S. to share data or research results with foreign nations
- Argue that the U.S. should build domestic alternatives to international facilities rather than depending on foreign-hosted projects
- Skeptical of science diplomacy as a legitimate use of State Department resources

**Strengths of Their Position**:

- There are genuine governance challenges in international scientific organizations. Decision-making can be slow, consensus-driven, and subject to political considerations unrelated to scientific merit.
- The U.S. experience with the SSC demonstrates that unilateral projects can be completed faster when they have adequate domestic political support.

**Weaknesses of Their Position**:

- Modern science is inherently international. The most important discoveries increasingly require capabilities that no single nation can afford or build alone. The era of unilateral mega-science ended with the SSC.
- The SSC was cancelled precisely because it lacked international cost-sharing, making it politically vulnerable. The lesson of the SSC is not that unilateral projects work but that they don't.
- Scientific isolationism would rapidly erode U.S. scientific leadership. The United States cannot maintain its position by fencing itself off from the global scientific enterprise.

### 5. Technology Protectionists

**Who**: Segments of the semiconductor industry, AI companies with military contracts, defense contractors, and some venture capitalists focused on "deep tech."

**Core Argument**: Open scientific collaboration gives competitors, particularly China, access to foundational research that enables them to develop competing technologies without bearing the cost of basic discovery. The U.S. should protect its technological edge by restricting the dissemination of research in strategically important fields.

**Specific Positions**:

- Support expanding export controls on AI models, quantum computing research, and advanced materials
- Advocate for pre-publication review of federally funded research in sensitive fields
- Push for restricting foreign access to U.S. cloud computing and high-performance computing resources
- Support the concept of "small yard, high fence" but argue the fence should be higher and the yard should be larger

**Strengths of Their Position**:

- Some technologies do warrant protection. Advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques, certain AI capabilities, and some quantum computing applications have clear national security implications.
- China's track record of acquiring technology through both legal and illegal means is well-documented.

**Weaknesses of Their Position**:

- Expanding pre-publication review or restricting fundamental research would undermine the open science norms that are the foundation of American scientific leadership.
- The line between "basic" and "applied" research is often unclear, and expanding restrictions would inevitably sweep in research with no realistic security implications.
- Many "protected" technologies are being developed simultaneously in multiple countries. Restricting U.S. dissemination does not prevent others from making the same discoveries independently.

## Common Threads

Despite their different motivations, these opposition groups share several characteristics:

- **Overestimation of restriction efficacy**: All tend to overestimate the ability of U.S. restrictions to prevent adversary advancement while underestimating the costs to U.S. competitiveness.
- **Visibility bias**: Threats (espionage cases, technology theft) are visible and dramatic; the benefits of open cooperation (discoveries enabled by international collaboration, talent attracted to the U.S.) are diffuse and hard to attribute.
- **Status quo bias**: Restricting collaboration has no visible victims (researchers who would have come to the U.S. but didn't are invisible), while the costs of collaboration gone wrong (a leaked technology, a spy) are highly visible.
- **Failure to consider second-order effects**: Restrictions that succeed in reducing U.S.-China collaboration do not reduce China's scientific output; they redirect Chinese engagement to other partners and accelerate China's efforts to build domestic capacity.
