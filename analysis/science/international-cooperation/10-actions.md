# International Cooperation: Actions

## Overview

This document outlines concrete actions that citizens, researchers, institutions, and policymakers can take to strengthen international scientific cooperation and address the systemic problems identified in this analysis. Actions are organized by audience and level of effort.

## For Individual Citizens

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

- **Contact your members of Congress** to express support for STEM immigration reform, including eliminating per-country caps on employment-based green cards. Emphasize that international scientists strengthen American competitiveness and create jobs.
- **Write to your senators** urging them to support stable, multi-year funding for U.S. participation in international research projects like ITER and CERN. Stress that budget volatility damages U.S. credibility as a partner.
- **Share information** about the importance of international scientific cooperation with your social networks. Counter narratives that frame all international collaboration as a security threat.

### Ongoing Actions

- **Vote for candidates** who support evidence-based science policy, robust research funding, and immigration reform that welcomes scientific talent.
- **Support organizations** that advocate for open science and international cooperation, such as the AAAS, Research!America, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.
- **Attend town halls** and ask elected officials about their positions on research funding, visa policy for scientists, and participation in international research projects.
- **Educate yourself** about the role of international scientists in your community. Research universities, national laboratories, and technology companies in your area likely employ significant numbers of international researchers who contribute to the local economy.

## For Researchers and Scientists

### Immediate Actions

- **Engage with your professional societies** on research security policy. Attend workshops, respond to calls for comment on proposed regulations, and participate in committees focused on international cooperation.
- **Mentor international students and postdocs** and help them navigate the visa and immigration system. Provide letters of support and connect them with immigration attorneys when needed.
- **Document the impact** of international collaboration on your research. When publishing, present data, or seek funding, highlight the contributions of international co-authors and collaborators.
- **Comply fully with disclosure requirements** while advocating for clearer, more consistent rules. Use the common disclosure form when available and report any confusion to your institutional research integrity office.

### Institutional Engagement

- **Advocate within your institution** for robust support services for international researchers, including immigration assistance, cultural integration programs, and legal support.
- **Participate in university task forces** on research security and international engagement. Ensure that security measures are proportionate and do not create a chilling effect on legitimate collaboration.
- **Organize public lectures and events** that highlight the contributions of international scientists to American research and innovation. Visibility counters narratives of suspicion.
- **Report instances of racial profiling or discriminatory enforcement** to your institution's legal counsel, professional societies, and organizations like the APA Justice Task Force.

### Policy Advocacy

- **Respond to requests for comment** from NSF, DOE, NIH, and other agencies on research security policies, international programs, and disclosure requirements. Agency staff report that comments from active researchers carry significant weight.
- **Testify before Congress** when invited about the importance of international cooperation for your field. Congressional staff actively seek expert witnesses, particularly for appropriations hearings.
- **Write op-eds and public commentary** for local newspapers, trade publications, and online platforms about the value of international scientific cooperation and the costs of excessive restriction.

## For Universities and Research Institutions

### Administrative Actions

- **Establish a dedicated international research partnerships office** that provides guidance to faculty on compliance, risk assessment, and opportunities for international collaboration.
- **Provide immigration legal support** to international researchers and students, including assistance with visa applications, green card petitions, and waiver requests.
- **Develop institutional policies** on international engagement that are clear, proportionate, and publicly available, so researchers know what is permitted and what requires additional review.
- **Invest in compliance infrastructure** for NSPM-33 and other research security requirements, including training, software systems, and dedicated staff.

### Advocacy

- **Engage through your institutional associations** (AAU, APLU, ACE) to lobby for immigration reform, stable research funding, and proportionate security measures.
- **Host forums and workshops** on research security that include perspectives from both security experts and working researchers, fostering constructive dialogue rather than adversarial dynamics.
- **Track and report** the impact of visa delays, PP 10043, and other restrictions on your institution's ability to recruit international talent. Data on lost talent is essential for policymaking.
- **Coordinate with peer institutions** to develop shared best practices for managing international partnerships, reducing duplication of effort, and presenting a united front to policymakers.

## For State and Local Officials

- **Promote your community's international research infrastructure** (universities, national laboratories, research parks) as economic assets that depend on international talent and partnerships.
- **Advocate at the federal level** for visa reforms that benefit your state's universities and technology employers.
- **Support state-level international exchange programs** that bring foreign researchers to local institutions and send local researchers abroad.
- **Resist state-level legislation** that restricts international research collaboration or discriminates against researchers based on national origin.

## For Congressional Staff and Policymakers

### Legislative Actions

- **Introduce or co-sponsor legislation** to eliminate per-country caps on employment-based green cards, create expedited visa processing for researchers, and establish multi-year funding mechanisms for international science projects.
- **Hold hearings** on the impact of research security policies on U.S. scientific competitiveness, inviting testimony from working researchers, university administrators, and international partner organizations.
- **Require cost-benefit analysis** for any proposed restriction on international research collaboration, ensuring that security benefits are weighed against competitiveness costs.
- **Provide full appropriations** for the CHIPS and Science Act's authorized funding levels, demonstrating that Congress's commitments to research funding are credible.

### Oversight Actions

- **Request GAO studies** on the effectiveness of current research security measures, including false positive rates, chilling effects, and comparison with allied nations' approaches.
- **Require annual reporting** from DOJ and FBI on research security investigations, including demographics, outcomes, and case dispositions.
- **Monitor implementation** of NSPM-33 across agencies to ensure consistency and proportionality.
- **Conduct regular reviews** of U.S. participation in international mega-science projects, balancing cost concerns with the strategic value of leadership in these endeavors.

## For the Executive Branch

- **Fill the Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary of State** position and ensure it carries sufficient rank and authority to influence policy.
- **Expand the ESTH officer corps** at U.S. embassies, particularly in major scientific partner nations.
- **Issue executive orders** directing agencies to adopt risk-based, evidence-driven approaches to research security rather than broad country-based restrictions.
- **Negotiate with allied nations** to develop coordinated research security frameworks that prevent unilateral U.S. restrictions from simply redirecting engagement.
- **Restructure the U.S.-China STA** to include robust IP protections while maintaining collaboration in fundamental research areas.
