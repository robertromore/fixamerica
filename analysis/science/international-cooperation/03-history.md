# International Cooperation: History

## Overview

The history of U.S. international scientific cooperation is a story of oscillation between visionary openness and security-driven restriction. From the Atoms for Peace initiative to the International Space Station, the United States has repeatedly leveraged scientific collaboration to advance both knowledge and geopolitical objectives. Understanding this history is essential to avoiding the mistakes of the past and building on its successes.

## Timeline of Key Developments

### The Postwar Foundation (1945-1960)

- **1945**: The devastation of World War II and the demonstration of nuclear weapons created an urgent need for international scientific governance. The United States, as the sole nuclear power, faced the question of whether to share scientific knowledge or hoard it.
- **1946**: The Atomic Energy Act (McMahon Act) restricted nuclear information sharing even with wartime allies like the United Kingdom, damaging the special relationship and driving the UK to develop its own nuclear program independently.
- **1953**: President Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" speech at the United Nations proposed sharing nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. This initiative led to the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1957 and established the paradigm of using scientific cooperation as a tool of Cold War diplomacy.
- **1954**: CERN was established by 12 European nations. The United States did not join as a member but began collaborative relationships with CERN that continue to this day.
- **1957**: The Soviet launch of Sputnik triggered a crisis of confidence in American science education and research capacity. The U.S. response included the creation of NASA (1958), the National Defense Education Act (1958), and a dramatic increase in federal R&D spending that made the United States the world's scientific superpower.
- **1958**: The U.S.-USSR Agreement on Exchanges (Lacy-Zarubin Agreement) established scientific and cultural exchanges between the superpowers, demonstrating that scientific cooperation could continue even during the most intense phases of the Cold War.

### The Golden Age of Science Diplomacy (1960-1980)

- **1961**: President Kennedy's call to land on the Moon catalyzed a massive investment in science and engineering that had profound international dimensions, attracting the world's top talent to American universities and laboratories.
- **1967**: The Outer Space Treaty established the principle that space exploration "shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries" and prohibited national appropriation of celestial bodies, creating the legal foundation for international space cooperation.
- **1969**: The Apollo 11 Moon landing was a singular national achievement, but the scientific instruments left on the lunar surface were designed for international use, and lunar samples were shared with researchers worldwide.
- **1972**: The U.S.-Soviet Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology established a broad framework for bilateral scientific collaboration. The agreement survived the Cold War's worst tensions and was renewed repeatedly until the collapse of the Soviet Union.
- **1975**: The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first joint U.S.-Soviet space mission, demonstrated that scientific cooperation could serve as a bridge between adversarial nations. The mission required the development of compatible docking systems, setting the stage for future space station cooperation.
- **1979**: The U.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement was signed as part of the normalization of diplomatic relations under President Carter. This agreement became the foundation for decades of expanding scientific exchange and remains the most consequential bilateral S&T agreement in U.S. history.

### Expansion and Institutionalization (1980-2000)

- **1984**: President Reagan signed the International Space Station Freedom agreement with Europe, Japan, and Canada, committing the United States to the largest international scientific project in history. The project was restructured multiple times before the current ISS design was finalized in 1993 with the addition of Russia as a partner.
- **1985**: The Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), a proposed 87-kilometer particle accelerator in Texas, was authorized by Congress. Intended as a purely American project (with some international contributions), its cancellation in 1993 due to cost overruns ($11 billion projected) effectively ceded leadership in high-energy physics to CERN and demonstrated the risks of unilateral mega-science.
- **1988**: The U.S.-Japan Science and Technology Agreement was strengthened, reflecting Japan's emergence as a major research power. Concerns about Japanese technological competition foreshadowed later anxieties about China.
- **1990**: The Human Genome Project was launched as an international collaboration between the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, and China. The decision to make all sequence data freely available in the public domain (the "Bermuda Principles" of 1996) established a landmark precedent for open science.
- **1993**: The SSC was cancelled by Congress. The same year, Russia was invited to join the International Space Station, transforming it from a Western alliance project into a truly global endeavor and providing employment for Russian rocket scientists who might otherwise have sold their expertise to proliferant states.
- **1998**: The first module of the International Space Station was launched. The ISS eventually grew to involve 15 nations and became the most expensive object ever constructed at approximately $150 billion.

### Post-9/11 Securitization (2001-2018)

- **2001**: The September 11 attacks led to sweeping changes in visa policy and border security that significantly affected the flow of international students and researchers to the United States. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) imposed new tracking requirements, and visa processing times increased dramatically.
- **2003**: Visa Mantis security checks, originally designed for a small number of cases, were expanded to cover a broad range of scientific and technical fields. Processing times for affected applications often exceeded six months, causing researchers to miss conferences, lose job offers, and abandon plans to work in the United States.
- **2005**: ITER was formally agreed upon, with the site selected in Cadarache, France. The United States joined as one of seven partners, committing to approximately 9.09 percent of construction costs. The project represented a return to large-scale international scientific collaboration after the SSC debacle.
- **2011**: The Wolf Amendment (P.L. 112-55, Sec. 539) prohibited NASA from using federal funds to engage in bilateral cooperation with China or Chinese-owned companies. Introduced by Rep. Frank Wolf, the amendment was motivated by concerns about technology transfer and espionage but effectively excluded China from the ISS partnership and constrained U.S.-China space cooperation.
- **2013**: Sequestration under the Budget Control Act imposed across-the-board cuts to federal agencies, reducing R&D funding and creating uncertainty about U.S. commitments to international projects.
- **2016**: The LIGO collaboration announced the first detection of gravitational waves, a discovery involving over 1,000 scientists from 18 countries. The achievement demonstrated the power of international collaboration in fundamental physics and was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics.

### The China Inflection Point (2018-Present)

- **2018**: The Department of Justice launched the "China Initiative," marking a fundamental shift in the U.S. approach to scientific engagement with China. Initially focused on economic espionage and hacking, the initiative expanded to target academic researchers for failure to disclose foreign funding and affiliations.
- **2018**: The National Institutes of Health began investigating researchers for undisclosed foreign ties, sending letters to over 100 institutions. Multiple researchers were terminated or resigned, and several were criminally charged.
- **2020**: Presidential Proclamation 10043 barred entry to students and researchers affiliated with Chinese entities connected to military-civil fusion, affecting thousands of visa applicants. The proclamation remains in effect.
- **2020**: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted in-person scientific collaboration worldwide while simultaneously demonstrating the critical importance of international cooperation for pandemic response. The rapid development of mRNA vaccines relied on decades of international basic science collaboration.
- **2021**: NSPM-33 established a government-wide framework for research security, attempting to balance openness and protection. Implementation began under the Biden administration.
- **2022**: The CHIPS and Science Act authorized historic increases in funding for NSF and DOE, including provisions for international cooperation and research security. However, appropriations fell short of authorized levels.
- **2022**: The DOJ formally ended the "China Initiative" branding in February 2022 following criticism about racial profiling and a string of acquittals, but continued prosecuting research security cases.
- **2023**: The U.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement was allowed to lapse in August 2023 for the first time since its signing in 1979, signaling a potentially permanent shift in the U.S.-China scientific relationship.
- **2024**: The STA was extended on a limited basis with significantly narrowed scope, but the broader trend of decoupling in scientific research continued.
- **2025**: CERN Council approved the Future Circular Collider feasibility study, with planning moving toward a construction decision. The U.S. position on participation remained undetermined.

## Historical Patterns

### Science as a Bridge

Throughout the Cold War, scientific cooperation served as one of the few reliable channels of communication between adversarial superpowers. The U.S.-Soviet scientific exchange programs continued even during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This track record suggests that severing scientific ties with China may eliminate a valuable diplomatic channel precisely when it is most needed.

### The SSC Lesson

The cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider in 1993 remains the most cautionary tale in U.S. science policy. By attempting to build the world's most powerful particle accelerator unilaterally rather than as an international project, the United States bore all costs and political risks alone. When Congress balked at the price, there was no international partnership to share the burden or provide political resilience. CERN, by contrast, successfully built the Large Hadron Collider as a multinational project precisely because the costs and risks were distributed across many nations.

### Security Overreaction Cycles

The United States has repeatedly overcorrected in response to security threats, imposing broad restrictions on scientific exchange that damage U.S. interests more than they protect them:

- Post-WWII: The McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear information sharing alienated allies and failed to prevent Soviet nuclear development.
- Post-9/11: Visa Mantis and other security checks created a "lost generation" of international researchers who chose other countries.
- Post-2018: The China Initiative's overreach damaged U.S. competitiveness for Chinese-American talent while producing few genuine espionage convictions.

In each case, the eventual correction took years, during which the United States suffered lasting damage to its scientific reputation and talent pipeline.
