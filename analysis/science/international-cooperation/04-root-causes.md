# International Cooperation: Root Causes

## Overview

The erosion of U.S. international scientific cooperation is not the result of a single policy failure but of multiple systemic causes that reinforce one another. These root causes span institutional design, political incentives, bureaucratic culture, and geopolitical dynamics. Addressing any one in isolation is unlikely to succeed; the challenge requires a systemic diagnosis and a systemic response.

## Root Cause 1: Securitization of Science Policy

### Description

Since 2018, national security concerns have become the dominant frame through which policymakers view international scientific cooperation, displacing the previous consensus that openness was a strategic asset. This "securitization" has shifted decision-making authority from science agencies (NSF, DOE, NIH) to national security agencies (DOJ, FBI, DHS), whose institutional culture prioritizes threat mitigation over the benefits of collaboration.

### Mechanisms

- **Threat inflation**: National security agencies have institutional incentives to emphasize threats. The FBI and DOJ's framing of Chinese scientific espionage as an "existential" threat to U.S. economic competitiveness led to sweeping investigative approaches that treated failure to disclose foreign affiliations as equivalent to espionage.
- **Blunt instruments**: Security measures such as Presidential Proclamation 10043, which bars students and researchers based on institutional affiliation with broadly defined entities, are by design over-inclusive. They sweep in legitimate basic researchers alongside genuine security risks because the cost of a false negative (missing a real spy) is politically visible while the cost of a false positive (deterring a legitimate scientist) is diffuse and invisible.
- **Classification creep**: Expanding definitions of "sensitive" or "dual-use" research progressively restrict the scope of permissible international collaboration, even in fields with no realistic military application.

### Evidence

- The DOJ's China Initiative resulted in approximately 77 cases, of which the majority involved grant disclosure violations rather than espionage. Multiple cases were dropped or resulted in acquittals, suggesting systematic overreach. (*MIT Technology Review*, 2022)
- Surveys by the Asian American Scholar Forum found that 72 percent of Chinese-American scientists felt unsafe, and 42 percent considered leaving the United States. (AASF Survey, 2022)
- NSF and DOE reported increases in international collaboration proposals withdrawn or declined due to uncertainty about compliance requirements. (NSF Annual Report, 2023)

## Root Cause 2: Immigration System Dysfunction

### Description

The U.S. immigration system was not designed for the modern global competition for scientific talent. Per-country caps on employment-based green cards, numerically limited visa categories, and cumbersome processing create barriers that drive talented researchers to competitor nations with more welcoming systems.

### Mechanisms

- **Per-country caps**: The Immigration and Nationality Act limits employment-based green cards to 7 percent per country, regardless of population size. This creates wait times of 10-15 years for applicants from India and China, the two largest sources of STEM talent, while applicants from smaller countries face minimal waits.
- **H-1B lottery**: The H-1B visa, the primary pathway for employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, is subject to an annual cap of 85,000 (including 20,000 for advanced degree holders). Demand consistently exceeds supply by a factor of 3-4, creating a lottery system that introduces pure randomness into hiring decisions for critical research personnel.
- **Two-year home residency requirement**: J-1 exchange visitors (a common visa for postdoctoral researchers) are often subject to a two-year home residency requirement before they can apply for permanent residency or certain other visa categories, disrupting career trajectories.
- **Administrative processing black hole**: Visa applications flagged for additional security screening (often triggered by technical fields of study) can languish for months or years with no transparency, no timeline, and no avenue for appeal.

### Evidence

- Canada's Global Skills Strategy visa processes work permits in two weeks. Canada saw a 50 percent increase in international STEM workers between 2017 and 2023. (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, 2023)
- The UK introduced the High Potential Individual visa and Global Talent visa, explicitly targeting researchers the U.S. system deters. (UK Home Office, 2022)
- Wait times for EB-2 green cards for Indian nationals exceeded 12 years as of 2024. (USCIS Visa Bulletin, 2024)

## Root Cause 3: Funding Instability and Short-Termism

### Description

The U.S. federal budget process is structurally incapable of providing the predictable, long-term funding commitments that international scientific cooperation requires. Annual appropriations cycles, government shutdowns, continuing resolutions, and sequestration create an environment of chronic uncertainty that undermines U.S. credibility as a partner.

### Mechanisms

- **Annual appropriations**: Federal research agencies operate on annual appropriations that must be renewed each fiscal year. International partners who commit to decade-long projects require assurance that the U.S. will sustain its contributions, but the annual appropriations process provides no such assurance.
- **Authorization-appropriation gap**: The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorized $81 billion for NSF over five years, but actual appropriations have fallen significantly short. This gap between what Congress promises and what it delivers erodes partner trust.
- **Government shutdowns and CRs**: Between 2010 and 2025, the federal government operated under continuing resolutions for a majority of fiscal year start dates. CRs freeze spending at prior-year levels, preventing new initiatives and creating planning uncertainty for ongoing international commitments.
- **Sequestration legacy**: The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that treated research investments identically to all other discretionary spending, despite the long-term nature of research commitments.

### Evidence

- ITER's cost overruns are partially attributable to partner nations, including the United States, failing to deliver components on schedule due to budget constraints. (GAO-14-499, 2014)
- NSF's international programs division reported that partner organizations increasingly express concern about U.S. funding reliability. (NSF OISE Annual Report, 2023)
- The CERN Council's 2025 FCC decision will require a U.S. commitment spanning 15-20 years, a timeline that the current budget process cannot credibly guarantee.

## Root Cause 4: Institutional Fragmentation

### Description

Responsibility for international scientific cooperation is fragmented across multiple federal agencies with different missions, cultures, and authorities. No single entity has the authority or resources to coordinate U.S. international science policy, leading to gaps, redundancies, and contradictions.

### Mechanisms

- **Agency silos**: NSF, DOE, NIH, NASA, State Department, DOD, and the Intelligence Community all manage international science relationships, often with minimal coordination. A researcher collaborating with a foreign partner may need to navigate compliance requirements from multiple agencies with different rules.
- **State Department weakness**: The State Department, which should be the natural coordinator of science diplomacy, has been chronically under-resourced for this role. The number of science and technology officers at U.S. embassies has declined from approximately 40 in the 1990s to approximately 20 today.
- **OSTP limitations**: The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has coordination authority but limited operational capacity. OSTP can issue guidance (as with NSPM-33), but implementation depends on individual agencies.
- **No dedicated international science agency**: Unlike France (CNRS international), Germany (DFG international programs), or the UK (UKRI international), the United States has no single agency dedicated to managing international research partnerships.

### Evidence

- The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have repeatedly called for better coordination of international science policy. (*Science and Technology for America's Reinvestment: A Report to the President*, NASEM, 2019)
- The GAO identified 13 federal agencies with international science cooperation authorities and found significant duplication and coordination gaps. (GAO-20-246, 2020)
- The State Department's ESTH officer corps is approximately one-tenth the size of the economics officer corps, despite science and technology being central to virtually every major foreign policy challenge. (State Dept. OIG, 2021)

## Root Cause 5: Geopolitical Framing of Science

### Description

The rise of U.S.-China strategic competition has led policymakers to frame scientific cooperation primarily through a geopolitical lens rather than a scientific one. This framing treats international collaboration as a zero-sum contest for technological supremacy rather than a positive-sum endeavor that benefits all participants.

### Mechanisms

- **Technology "decoupling" pressure**: Advocates of decoupling from China argue for severing scientific ties across the board, including in basic research areas with no immediate military application. This pressure comes from both Congress and elements of the national security establishment.
- **Military-civil fusion concerns**: China's stated policy of integrating civilian and military research creates legitimate concerns about technology transfer. However, the breadth of China's military-civil fusion strategy means that virtually any Chinese research institution can be characterized as having military connections, leading to overbroad restrictions.
- **Political incentives**: "Being tough on China" is one of the few truly bipartisan positions in American politics. This creates incentives for policymakers to impose restrictions on scientific exchange even when the security rationale is weak, because the political cost of appearing "soft" exceeds the political benefit of defending scientific openness.
- **Ally coordination failures**: The United States has not effectively coordinated research security policies with allied nations, leading to situations where restrictions imposed by the U.S. simply redirect Chinese engagement to European, Japanese, or Australian partners without reducing overall technology transfer risk.

### Evidence

- A 2023 Nature survey found that 32 percent of U.S.-based researchers reported reducing or ending collaborations with Chinese colleagues due to political pressure, even in fields with no security implications. (*Nature*, 2023)
- U.S. restrictions on Chinese researchers have not prevented China from continuing to increase its scientific output. China surpassed the U.S. in total number of scientific publications in 2022 and in highly cited publications in 2024. (NSF S&E Indicators, 2024)
- European Research Council data show that Chinese co-authorship with European institutions has increased as U.S.-China collaboration has declined, suggesting a redirection rather than a reduction in Chinese scientific engagement. (ERC Annual Report, 2023)

## Root Cause 6: Declining Public Investment in Basic Research

### Description

Federal investment in basic research as a share of GDP has declined from approximately 2 percent at its Cold War peak to approximately 0.77 percent today. This long-term trend reduces the capacity of U.S. institutions to anchor major international projects and diminishes the gravitational pull that attracted the world's best researchers.

### Mechanisms

- **Private sector displacement**: The growth of private R&D spending has offset some of the decline in federal research funding, but private R&D is concentrated in applied research and development with short time horizons. Basic research, which is the foundation of international collaboration, remains predominantly federally funded.
- **University dependence on grants**: U.S. universities' reliance on competitive federal grants for research funding creates a system where researchers spend increasing amounts of time writing proposals rather than conducting research, reducing the capacity for sustained international engagement.
- **Infrastructure aging**: Major U.S. research facilities, including particle accelerators, telescopes, and reactor facilities, are aging and require replacement. The cost of maintaining existing infrastructure competes with the cost of joining new international projects.

### Evidence

- Federal R&D as a percentage of GDP declined from 1.86 percent in 1964 to 0.77 percent in 2024. (AAAS R&D Budget and Policy Program, 2024)
- China's total R&D spending surpassed that of the EU in 2020 and is projected to approach U.S. levels by the early 2030s. (OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators, 2024)
- The NSF's research infrastructure condition survey found that approximately 30 percent of major research facilities rated as "fair" or "poor," limiting the capacity to host international collaborations. (NSF Infrastructure Report, 2023)

## Root Cause Interaction

These root causes interact in reinforcing ways:

- **Securitization + Immigration dysfunction**: Security-driven visa restrictions compound existing immigration system dysfunction, creating a doubly hostile environment for international researchers.
- **Funding instability + Institutional fragmentation**: No agency has the authority or resources to make binding long-term commitments, and the fragmented landscape means no one is accountable when commitments fail.
- **Geopolitical framing + Declining investment**: The framing of science as a geopolitical competition creates pressure to restrict collaboration while simultaneously failing to increase the domestic investment needed to compete independently.
- **All causes + talent loss**: Each root cause contributes to making the United States less attractive to international scientific talent, creating a compound effect that is greater than the sum of its parts.
