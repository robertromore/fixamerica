# International Cooperation: Current State

## Overview

The state of U.S. international scientific cooperation in 2026 is defined by a paradox: American science remains deeply international in practice while the policy environment has become increasingly restrictive and uncertain. Approximately 40 percent of all U.S. scientific publications now include at least one international co-author, the highest proportion in history. Yet visa backlogs, research security mandates, geopolitical tensions with China, and funding instability are eroding the foundations of this cooperation. The U.S. risks losing its position as the world's preeminent hub for international science unless systemic policy failures are addressed.

## Major International Research Projects

### CERN and High-Energy Physics

The United States is the largest non-member state contributor to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, headquartered in Geneva. Approximately 2,500 U.S. scientists from over 100 institutions participate in CERN experiments, including the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The U.S. contributed approximately $531 million to the LHC construction and continues to fund operations and upgrades through the Department of Energy's Office of High Energy Physics.

CERN's proposed Future Circular Collider (FCC), a 91-kilometer particle accelerator with an estimated cost of $17-21 billion, represents the next frontier. The U.S. has not yet committed to participation, and the decision will be a critical test of American willingness to invest in international mega-science. The FCC was approved by the CERN Council in June 2025 and construction is expected to begin in the early 2030s.

### ITER and Fusion Energy

The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in Cadarache, France, is the world's largest fusion energy experiment. The United States is one of seven partners (along with the EU, China, India, Japan, Russia, and South Korea), responsible for approximately 9.09 percent of construction costs. The project has experienced significant cost overruns and schedule delays, with the total cost now estimated at over $22 billion and first plasma postponed from 2025 to no earlier than 2035.

The U.S. ITER project, managed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has faced persistent budget pressures. Congress has repeatedly questioned the project's value, and the Government Accountability Office has issued multiple reports criticizing cost management. Nevertheless, ITER remains the only pathway to demonstrating sustained, net-positive fusion energy, and withdrawal would forfeit U.S. access to critical intellectual property and experimental data. The emergence of private fusion companies (Commonwealth Fusion Systems, TAE Technologies, Helion Energy) has complicated the political calculus, with some arguing that private ventures may achieve fusion faster than ITER.

### International Space Station

The International Space Station (ISS) has been the flagship of international space cooperation since its first module was launched in 1998. The partnership includes NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan), and CSA (Canada). The ISS has hosted over 3,000 experiments and maintained a continuous human presence in orbit for over 25 years.

NASA has announced plans to deorbit the ISS by approximately 2031, transitioning to commercially operated space stations. The geopolitical implications are significant: the ISS has been one of the few areas of sustained U.S.-Russia cooperation even during periods of severe diplomatic tension. China, excluded from the ISS by congressional mandate (the Wolf Amendment, P.L. 112-55, Sec. 539), has launched its own Tiangong space station and is actively inviting international partners.

### Other Major Collaborations

- **Square Kilometre Array (SKA)**: An international radio telescope project headquartered in the UK, with sites in Australia and South Africa. The U.S. is not a formal member but U.S. scientists participate through bilateral arrangements.
- **Human Genome Project (completed) and successor initiatives**: The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium demonstrated the power of open, multinational science. Current successors include the Human Cell Atlas and the Earth BioGenome Project.
- **Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)**: While primarily a U.S. facility (NSF-funded), LIGO operates in close coordination with the European Virgo detector and the Japanese KAGRA detector through the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.

## Bilateral Science and Technology Agreements

The United States maintains approximately 60 bilateral science and technology agreements with partner nations. These agreements provide the legal framework for joint research, personnel exchanges, and data sharing. The most consequential is the U.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement (STA), originally signed in 1979 as part of the normalization of relations.

### The U.S.-China STA Crisis

The U.S.-China STA, which had been routinely renewed every five years since 1979, was allowed to lapse in August 2023 amid congressional and executive branch concerns about technology transfer and intellectual property protection. After months of uncertainty, the agreement was extended for six months in early 2024, and again in late 2024, with a significantly narrowed scope.

The renegotiated agreement includes enhanced intellectual property protections, restrictions on research areas with dual-use potential, and new mechanisms for monitoring compliance. However, the prolonged uncertainty damaged trust on both sides and contributed to a broader chilling effect on U.S.-China scientific collaboration. Many U.S. universities and researchers report reduced engagement with Chinese counterparts, even in areas unrelated to national security.

## Researcher Mobility and Visa Issues

### Current Visa Landscape

International researchers come to the United States through several visa categories:

| Visa Category | Purpose | Annual Cap | Average Processing Time |
|---------------|---------|------------|------------------------|
| J-1 | Exchange visitors, including researchers | No cap | 2-4 months |
| H-1B | Specialty occupation workers | 65,000 + 20,000 (advanced degree) | 3-8 months |
| O-1 | Extraordinary ability | No cap | 2-6 months |
| F-1 (OPT/STEM OPT) | Student practical training | No cap | 3-5 months |

### Systemic Problems

- **Processing delays**: Average visa processing times have increased significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Some consulates report wait times exceeding 12 months for initial interviews, particularly in India and China.
- **Administrative processing**: Under Presidential Proclamation 10043 (issued June 2020), students and researchers with ties to certain Chinese universities and entities affiliated with China's military-civil fusion strategy are barred from obtaining U.S. visas. As of 2024, over 5,000 visa applications had been denied under this proclamation, and reports indicate it continues to be applied broadly.
- **Green card backlog**: Employment-based green card applicants from China and India face wait times of 10-15 years or more due to per-country caps, driving many talented researchers to seek opportunities in Canada, the UK, or Australia.
- **212(f) authority**: Broad presidential authority to restrict entry "in the national interest" has been used to impose travel bans and additional screening requirements that disproportionately affect researchers from specific countries.

### Impact on U.S. Competitiveness

International graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are the backbone of U.S. university research. In STEM doctoral programs, international students earned approximately 42 percent of all doctorates in 2023 (NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates). In fields like computer science, electrical engineering, and mathematics, the proportion exceeds 60 percent.

Evidence of declining U.S. attractiveness is mounting:

- International graduate applications to U.S. STEM programs declined by approximately 12 percent between 2019 and 2023 (Council of Graduate Schools).
- Canada's Global Skills Strategy visa, introduced in 2017, processes work permits in two weeks, and Canada has seen a 50 percent increase in international STEM workers since its introduction.
- The UK's Global Talent visa and the EU's European Research Council grants are actively recruiting researchers who might previously have gone to the United States.

## The China Initiative and Its Aftermath

The Department of Justice's "China Initiative," launched in November 2018, was designed to counter Chinese economic espionage, including the theft of trade secrets and hacking. However, the initiative's scope expanded to include academic researchers suspected of failing to disclose foreign funding or affiliations on grant applications.

### Key Outcomes

- Approximately 77 cases were brought between 2018 and 2022, of which only a handful involved actual espionage or theft of trade secrets. The majority involved grant fraud or failure to disclose foreign affiliations.
- Several high-profile acquittals and dropped charges (notably the cases of Gang Chen at MIT and Hu Anming at the University of Tennessee) raised serious concerns about racial profiling and the chilling effect on Chinese-American scientists.
- The DOJ formally ended the "China Initiative" branding in February 2022 but continues to prosecute research security cases under its broader "Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats."
- Surveys by the Asian American Scholar Forum found that approximately 72 percent of Chinese-American scientists felt unsafe or anxious about conducting research in the United States, and 42 percent considered leaving the country.

### NSPM-33 and Research Security

National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33), issued in January 2021, established a framework for strengthening research security while maintaining the openness of the U.S. research enterprise. Key provisions include:

- Standardized disclosure requirements for federally funded researchers
- A common digital disclosure form across federal agencies
- Prohibition on participation in foreign government talent recruitment programs (such as China's Thousand Talents Plan)
- Emphasis on risk-based, evidence-driven approaches rather than broad country-based restrictions

Implementation has been uneven. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issued guidance in 2022, but individual agencies have developed varying approaches to disclosure requirements and enforcement, creating confusion among researchers and institutions.

## Federal Funding for International Cooperation

### Budget Trends

U.S. federal R&D spending reached approximately $211 billion in FY2024, representing about 0.77 percent of GDP. This is substantially below the Cold War peak of approximately 2 percent of GDP in the mid-1960s. Within this total, funding specifically allocated to international cooperation is difficult to isolate, as it is distributed across multiple agencies:

| Agency | International Cooperation Mechanism | Approximate Annual Funding |
|--------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| NSF | International programs, bilateral agreements | ~$500 million |
| DOE | ITER, CERN, bilateral energy R&D | ~$800 million |
| NASA | ISS operations, bilateral space agreements | ~$3 billion |
| NIH | Fogarty International Center, global health | ~$500 million |
| State Dept. | Science attaches, S&T agreements | ~$50 million |

### Funding Instability

The most damaging aspect of U.S. research funding is not its level but its unpredictability. Government shutdowns, continuing resolutions, and sequestration create planning uncertainty that is particularly corrosive for long-term international commitments. Partners who commit to decade-long projects need confidence that the U.S. will sustain its contributions. Recent budget volatility has damaged that confidence:

- The FY2024 appropriations process was not completed until March 2024, six months into the fiscal year.
- ITER funding has been subject to annual congressional debates about whether to continue participation.
- The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorized significant increases for NSF and DOE, but appropriations have consistently fallen short of authorized levels.

## Science Diplomacy Infrastructure

The United States maintains a relatively thin science diplomacy infrastructure compared to its overall diplomatic presence:

- Approximately 20 environment, science, technology, and health (ESTH) officers at U.S. embassies worldwide (down from a peak of approximately 40 in the 1990s)
- The Office of the Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary of State, which has been periodically left vacant
- The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science and Technology Policy Fellowship program, which places scientists in government agencies
- Limited State Department budget for international S&T engagement relative to other foreign policy tools
