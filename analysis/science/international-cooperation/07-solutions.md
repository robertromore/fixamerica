# International Cooperation: Solutions

## Overview

The solutions proposed here address the root causes identified in the analysis: securitization of science policy, immigration system dysfunction, funding instability, institutional fragmentation, geopolitical framing, and declining public investment. The approach is organized around five pillars: reforming research security, modernizing immigration for science, stabilizing international project funding, strengthening science diplomacy institutions, and recalibrating China engagement.

## Pillar 1: Reform Research Security

### Solution 1.1: Risk-Based Research Security Framework

**Description**: Replace broad, country-based restrictions with a targeted, risk-based approach that evaluates specific research projects, technologies, and individuals rather than imposing blanket restrictions on entire nationalities or institutions.

**Key Elements**:

- Establish a standardized risk assessment methodology across all federal research agencies, building on NSPM-33 but with clearer implementation guidance
- Create a tiered system that distinguishes between fundamental research (open by default), applied research with dual-use potential (enhanced disclosure), and classified or export-controlled research (restricted)
- Require that any new restriction on international research collaboration include an assessment of the costs to U.S. competitiveness, not just the security benefits
- Provide "safe harbor" provisions for researchers who make good-faith disclosures, even if those disclosures are later found to be incomplete

**Evidence Base**: The National Academies' *Protecting U.S. Technological Advantage* (2022) report recommended a risk-based approach calibrated to specific threats rather than broad country-based restrictions. The Jason advisory group's 2019 report on fundamental research security reached similar conclusions.

**Estimated Impact**: Would reduce the chilling effect on legitimate collaboration while maintaining protection for genuinely sensitive technologies. Could reverse the decline in international researcher applications within 2-3 years.

### Solution 1.2: End Racial Profiling in Research Security Enforcement

**Description**: Prohibit the use of ethnicity, national origin, or institutional affiliation as the sole or primary basis for research security investigations. Require that investigations be predicated on specific, articulable evidence of wrongdoing.

**Key Elements**:

- Amend DOJ guidelines to prohibit opening investigations based solely on a researcher's country of origin or ethnicity
- Require FBI field offices to obtain supervisor approval before opening an investigation involving a researcher whose primary connection is national origin
- Mandate annual public reporting on research security investigations, including demographics, outcomes, and case dispositions, to enable oversight of potential profiling
- Establish an independent ombudsman within the DOJ Inspector General's office to receive and investigate complaints of discriminatory enforcement

**Evidence Base**: The DOJ's own review of the China Initiative acknowledged concerns about perceptions of bias. Analysis by MIT Technology Review found that acquittal and dismissal rates in China Initiative cases were significantly higher than DOJ averages, suggesting that many cases were not supported by adequate evidence.

### Solution 1.3: Harmonize Disclosure Requirements

**Description**: Create a single, standardized disclosure form and process for all federal research agencies, replacing the current patchwork of agency-specific requirements that create confusion and compliance burdens.

**Key Elements**:

- Implement the common disclosure form mandated by NSPM-33 across all agencies within 12 months
- Provide clear definitions of what must be disclosed (financial support, institutional affiliations, talent program participation) and what need not be disclosed (informal collaborations, conference attendance, peer review)
- Establish a centralized database for disclosures, reducing the burden on researchers who receive funding from multiple agencies
- Provide training and compliance support to universities and research institutions

## Pillar 2: Modernize Immigration for Science

### Solution 2.1: STEM Green Card Reform

**Description**: Eliminate per-country caps for employment-based green cards and create a dedicated pathway for STEM researchers to obtain permanent residency.

**Key Elements**:

- Eliminate per-country caps for EB-1 (extraordinary ability), EB-2 (advanced degree), and EB-3 (skilled workers) categories, or create a STEM-specific exemption
- Create a new "National Interest STEM" green card category that allows researchers with doctoral degrees in STEM fields and a record of significant research contributions to self-petition for permanent residency
- Reduce green card processing times for STEM researchers to a maximum of 18 months from application to decision
- Allow concurrent filing of immigrant and nonimmigrant visa petitions, enabling researchers to work while their green card applications are pending

**Evidence Base**: The Bipartisan Policy Center, the National Academies, and the American Immigration Lawyers Association have all recommended eliminating per-country caps. Economic research consistently finds that immigrant scientists generate significant positive externalities for the U.S. economy (Kerr, "The Gift of Global Talent," 2018).

### Solution 2.2: Researcher Visa Streamlining

**Description**: Create an expedited visa processing pathway for researchers invited to participate in federally funded research or international scientific conferences in the United States.

**Key Elements**:

- Establish a "Science Fast Track" visa processing category with a guaranteed 30-day processing time for researchers with documented invitations from accredited U.S. research institutions
- Reduce the scope of Visa Mantis security checks by exempting fundamental research fields (defined by NSDD-189) from mandatory technology alert list screening
- Create multi-year, multi-entry visas for researchers who are regular visitors to U.S. institutions
- Eliminate the two-year home residency requirement for J-1 exchange visitors in STEM fields who receive offers of employment from U.S. research institutions

**Evidence Base**: Canada's Global Skills Strategy visa achieves a two-week processing time for skilled workers; the U.S. should be able to match this timeline for researchers. Australia's Global Talent visa program has similarly demonstrated that expedited processing is feasible.

### Solution 2.3: Rescind or Reform Presidential Proclamation 10043

**Description**: Narrow or rescind PP 10043 to target specific individuals with documented security concerns rather than broadly banning students and researchers based on institutional affiliation.

**Key Elements**:

- Replace the institutional affiliation-based ban with individualized security assessments
- Create an expedited waiver process for students and researchers in non-sensitive fields (e.g., ecology, mathematics, social science, humanities)
- Require annual review and public reporting on the proclamation's application, including the number of denials, waivers granted, and fields affected
- Coordinate with allied nations to develop common standards for researcher screening, preventing unilateral U.S. restrictions from simply redirecting Chinese researchers to allied institutions

## Pillar 3: Stabilize International Project Funding

### Solution 3.1: International Science Commitment Fund

**Description**: Create a dedicated, multi-year funding mechanism for U.S. contributions to international scientific projects, insulated from annual appropriations volatility.

**Key Elements**:

- Establish a "Science Commitment Fund" at the Department of Energy or NSF, modeled on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or the Exchange Stabilization Fund, with multi-year appropriations authority
- Authorize 5-year advance appropriations for U.S. contributions to treaty-based international projects (ITER, CERN, future projects)
- Require that any U.S. commitment to a new international project be accompanied by a 10-year cost estimate and a credible funding plan
- Create an automatic continuing resolution provision that maintains international project funding at the prior-year level if full-year appropriations are not enacted

**Evidence Base**: Multi-year appropriations are used for military construction, VA health care, and other programs where long-term predictability is essential. The National Academies have recommended similar mechanisms for international science commitments. GAO reports on ITER have specifically cited funding instability as a major driver of cost overruns.

### Solution 3.2: International Mega-Science Partnership Authority

**Description**: Create a standing legislative authority for the executive branch to negotiate and enter U.S. participation in international mega-science projects, subject to congressional review but with streamlined approval procedures.

**Key Elements**:

- Authorize the OSTP Director, in coordination with relevant agency heads, to negotiate U.S. participation in international scientific projects
- Require submission of a prospectus to Congress that includes scientific justification, cost estimates, governance arrangements, IP protections, and exit provisions
- Establish a 90-day congressional review period, after which participation proceeds unless Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval
- Mandate 5-year milestones and performance reviews for all international projects, with the option of withdrawal if milestones are not met

## Pillar 4: Strengthen Science Diplomacy Institutions

### Solution 4.1: Rebuild the Science Diplomacy Corps

**Description**: Significantly expand the number and stature of science and technology officers in the Foreign Service and create a dedicated science diplomacy career track.

**Key Elements**:

- Increase the number of environment, science, technology, and health (ESTH) officers from approximately 20 to at least 60, with priority placement at embassies in major scientific partner nations
- Create a "Science Counselor" position at the 30 most scientifically important embassies, comparable in rank and influence to the Economic Counselor
- Establish a joint State Department-NSF fellowship program that places active researchers in embassies for 1-2 year rotations
- Ensure that the Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary of State position is always filled and reports directly to the Secretary

**Evidence Base**: The UK, France, Germany, Japan, and China all maintain substantially larger science diplomacy operations than the United States. The Royal Society's 2010 report *New Frontiers in Science Diplomacy* documented the effectiveness of science attache programs in advancing national interests.

### Solution 4.2: Interagency Coordination Mechanism

**Description**: Create a permanent interagency body to coordinate international science policy across the federal government.

**Key Elements**:

- Establish an International Science Coordination Council within OSTP, chaired by the OSTP Director and including representatives from NSF, DOE, NIH, NASA, State, DOD, and the Intelligence Community
- Charge the council with developing and maintaining a National Strategy for International Scientific Cooperation, updated every 4 years
- Require the council to review and approve any new restriction on international research collaboration before it takes effect
- Provide the council with a dedicated staff and budget sufficient to conduct independent analysis

## Pillar 5: Recalibrate China Engagement

### Solution 5.1: "Small Yard, High Fence" Implementation

**Description**: Rigorously implement the "small yard, high fence" concept by clearly defining which technologies and research areas require protection and maintaining open collaboration in all other areas.

**Key Elements**:

- Task the National Science and Technology Council with identifying, in coordination with the intelligence community, a specific, enumerated list of technologies and research areas that warrant restrictions on international collaboration
- Require that the list be reviewed and updated annually, with additions and removals subject to interagency deliberation
- Mandate that any research area not on the list is presumptively open for international collaboration, including with Chinese institutions
- Publish unclassified summaries of the protected areas so that researchers and institutions can make informed decisions about their collaborations

**Evidence Base**: The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (2021) and the National Academies (2022) both recommended a precisely defined scope of protected technologies, warning that an expanding definition would undermine the concept.

### Solution 5.2: Restructure the U.S.-China STA

**Description**: Negotiate a new U.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement with strengthened safeguards that enables continued collaboration in areas of mutual benefit while protecting sensitive technologies.

**Key Elements**:

- Maintain the STA framework for fundamental research areas: climate science, public health, ecology, agriculture, basic physics, and mathematics
- Exclude research areas on the protected list (Solution 5.1) from the STA's coverage
- Incorporate robust intellectual property protections, including clear data-sharing protocols, joint IP ownership agreements, and dispute resolution mechanisms
- Include transparency requirements for both sides regarding talent recruitment programs and institutional affiliations
- Build in a regular 3-year review cycle with clear metrics for evaluating the agreement's effectiveness and security

### Solution 5.3: Ally Coordination on Research Security

**Description**: Coordinate research security policies with allied nations to ensure that U.S. restrictions are part of a multilateral approach rather than unilateral measures that simply redirect engagement.

**Key Elements**:

- Establish a "Five Eyes Plus" research security coordination group (U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, plus Japan, Germany, France, and other willing allies)
- Develop common standards for researcher screening, disclosure requirements, and technology protection
- Share information on espionage threats and technology acquisition patterns
- Coordinate export controls and deemed export policies to prevent circumvention through allied institutions

**Evidence Base**: The UK, Australia, Canada, and Japan have all developed research security frameworks since 2019, but with minimal coordination. A 2023 RAND Corporation study found that unilateral U.S. restrictions were the least effective approach to research security compared to multilateral coordination.
