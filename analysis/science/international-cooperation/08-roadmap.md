# International Cooperation: Roadmap

## Overview

Implementing the proposed solutions requires a sequenced approach that accounts for political feasibility, institutional capacity, and the urgency of different problems. This roadmap organizes reforms into three phases: immediate actions (Year 1), medium-term reforms (Years 2-3), and long-term structural changes (Years 4-7). The sequencing prioritizes reforms that can be accomplished through executive action before those requiring legislation, and reforms with broad bipartisan support before more contested measures.

## Critical Path Dependencies

The following dependencies are on the critical path and could delay the entire roadmap if not addressed:

1. **Executive leadership**: Many Phase 1 actions require presidential executive orders and OSTP directives. Delays in filling key positions (OSTP Director, Science Adviser to Secretary of State) would cascade through the roadmap.

2. **Congressional action on immigration**: STEM green card reform and the elimination of per-country caps require legislation that has historically been caught up in broader immigration debates. Packaging STEM immigration reform as a standalone national security and competitiveness measure may be the most viable legislative strategy.

3. **Appropriations for Science Commitment Fund**: The Fund requires a new appropriations structure that appropriations committees may resist as reducing their annual control over spending.

4. **China cooperation**: Restructuring the U.S.-China STA requires Chinese willingness to negotiate and accept enhanced IP protections and transparency requirements. If China refuses, the U.S. must be prepared to proceed without a formal agreement while maintaining unofficial channels.

5. **Allied coordination**: The "Five Eyes Plus" research security framework depends on participation by allies who may have different threat perceptions and economic interests (e.g., European nations with significant trade relationships with China may be reluctant to adopt U.S.-style restrictions).

## Metrics for Success

| Metric | Baseline (2025) | Year 3 Target | Year 7 Target |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| International STEM graduate applications to U.S. | -12% trend | Stabilize (0%) | +10% |
| Average visa processing time for researchers | 3-8 months | 2 months | 30 days |
| EB-2 green card wait time (India/China) | 10-15 years | 5-7 years | Under 18 months |
| ESTH officers at embassies | ~20 | ~40 | 60 |
| U.S. share of global highly cited publications | ~25% | Stabilize | Stabilize or increase |
| Research security investigations resulting in conviction | ~25% | >50% (better targeting) | >60% |
| International project funding delivered on schedule | ~60% | 80% | 95% |
| Bilateral S&T agreements reviewed in past 4 years | ~20% | 50% | 100% |

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Congressional gridlock on immigration reform | High | High | Pursue executive actions first; package STEM reform separately from comprehensive immigration |
| Escalation of U.S.-China tensions blocks STA renewal | Medium | High | Maintain unofficial science channels; coordinate with allies; pursue collaboration in climate and health as entry points |
| Appropriations committees reject multi-year funding mechanism | Medium | Medium | Offer enhanced oversight in exchange for multi-year authority; start with a pilot for one project (ITER) |
| Security incident undermines political support for openness | Medium | Very High | Ensure that reforms include strong, targeted security measures; demonstrate that risk-based approaches catch more genuine threats than broad restrictions |
| Allies resist coordinated research security framework | Medium | Medium | Start with bilateral agreements before seeking multilateral consensus; offer U.S. intelligence sharing as an incentive |
