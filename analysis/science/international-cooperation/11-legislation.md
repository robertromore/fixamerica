# International Cooperation: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

The legislative framework for international scientific cooperation seeks to address the systemic problems identified in this analysis: the securitization of science policy, immigration barriers for researchers, funding instability for international projects, and the lack of institutional coordination. Current law is fragmented across dozens of statutes, executive orders, and agency regulations with no coherent framework for managing international scientific engagement.

This legislative approach focuses on two pillars: (1) the **International Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act**, which reforms research security, streamlines researcher immigration, and establishes stable funding mechanisms for international projects; and (2) the **Science Diplomacy and Researcher Mobility Act**, which rebuilds the science diplomacy infrastructure and creates an expedited visa pathway for international researchers. Together, these bills address the supply side (funding and institutions) and the demand side (talent and mobility) of international cooperation.

The constitutional basis for this legislation rests on Congress's Article I powers to regulate commerce with foreign nations, establish a uniform rule of naturalization, appropriate funds, and provide for the general welfare. The President's Article II authority over foreign affairs and the treaty power provides the executive foundation for science diplomacy and international agreements. The legislation is designed to maximize congressional-executive collaboration, operating within Category One of the *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer*, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), framework.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required. Congress's existing powers over appropriations, immigration, and foreign commerce, combined with the President's foreign affairs authority, provide ample constitutional basis for comprehensive reform of international scientific cooperation policy.*

## Federal Legislation

### The International Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act

**Purpose**: To establish a coherent federal framework for international scientific cooperation by creating a risk-based research security system, a dedicated multi-year funding mechanism for international mega-science projects, and an interagency coordination structure for international science policy.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Standalone bill referred to the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, with sequential referral to the Appropriations and Judiciary committees. Could alternatively be incorporated as a title within the CHIPS and Science Act reauthorization.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Risk-Based Research Security**: Replaces country-based restrictions with targeted, risk-based assessment of specific technologies and research areas.
2. **International Science Commitment Fund**: Creates a multi-year funding mechanism for U.S. contributions to international research projects.
3. **Interagency Coordination**: Establishes a permanent International Science Coordination Council within OSTP.
4. **Disclosure Harmonization**: Mandates a single, common disclosure form for all federal research agencies.
5. **Research Security Ombudsman**: Creates an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of discriminatory enforcement.

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To enhance United States participation in international scientific
cooperation, establish a risk-based framework for research security,
create stable funding mechanisms for international research projects,
and improve interagency coordination of international science policy.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "International Scientific Cooperation
Enhancement Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) International scientific cooperation is a strategic asset
of the United States that advances national security, economic
competitiveness, and scientific discovery.
(2) Approximately 40 percent of United States scientific
publications include at least one international co-author, and
international collaborations produce disproportionately
high-impact research (NSF Science and Engineering Indicators,
2024).
(3) The United States faces growing competition for scientific
talent from nations that offer more streamlined visa processes,
stable research funding, and welcoming environments for
international researchers.
(4) Current research security measures, including
country-based visa restrictions and inconsistent disclosure
requirements, have created a chilling effect on legitimate
international collaboration without demonstrably reducing
genuine security threats.
(5) United States participation in international mega-science
projects, including the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER), the European Organization for
Nuclear Research (CERN), and successor programs to the
International Space Station (ISS), requires stable, predictable
funding that the annual appropriations process cannot reliably
provide.
(6) Responsibility for international scientific cooperation
is fragmented across more than a dozen federal agencies with
no effective coordination mechanism, resulting in gaps,
redundancies, and contradictory policies.
(7) The 2019 JASON Advisory Group report on fundamental
research security and the 2022 National Academies report on
protecting United States technological advantage both
recommended risk-based approaches calibrated to specific
threats rather than broad country-based restrictions.
(8) The People's Republic of China has surpassed the
European Union in total research and development spending and
is projected to approach United States spending levels by the
early 2030s, making it essential that the United States
maintain its scientific leadership through strategic
international engagement.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3**: The definitions establish critical distinctions, particularly between "fundamental research" (open by default under NSDD-189) and research involving "protected technologies" (restricted). The $500 million threshold for mega-science projects ensures the Fund covers only the largest international commitments.
- **Section 4**: The risk-based framework is the centerpiece of the bill. By replacing country-based presumptions with individualized assessments, it addresses the chilling effect while maintaining security. The safe harbor provision (subsection (b)(4)) is designed to encourage disclosure by removing the fear that an honest mistake will trigger criminal prosecution. The prohibition on ethnicity-based investigations (subsection (b)(5)) directly addresses the China Initiative's legacy.
- **Section 5**: The Council fills the institutional gap identified in the root cause analysis. By requiring interagency review of proposed restrictions before they take effect, the Council ensures that security measures are balanced against competitiveness concerns.
- **Section 6**: The Fund addresses chronic funding instability by providing multi-year appropriations authority and an automatic continuing resolution provision. The congressional review mechanism (subsection (g)) preserves legislative oversight while preventing annual budget fights from undermining decade-long commitments.
- **Section 7**: The Ombudsman provides an independent check on research security enforcement, filling the accountability gap exposed by the China Initiative. Whistleblower protections (subsection (d)) ensure that researchers can report problems without fear of retaliation.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Establish Council and appoint staff | 90 days after enactment | OSTP |
| Publish risk-based framework | 180 days after enactment | OSTP/DNI/DoD |
| Publish protected technology list | 270 days after enactment | NSTC |
| Deploy common disclosure form | 12 months after enactment | OSTP/OMB |
| First Fund appropriation | FY 2027 | Congress |
| First annual Council report | March 1, 2028 | Council |
| First GAO assessment | 3 years after enactment | GAO |
| First Ombudsman annual report | 18 months after enactment | DOJ OIG |

**Challenges**:

- **National security community resistance**: The FBI and intelligence community will resist constraints on their investigative authority, particularly the prohibition on ethnicity-based investigations and the requirement for Council review of new restrictions.
- **Appropriations committee jurisdiction**: Creating a multi-year fund with automatic continuing authority reduces the appropriations committees' annual control over spending, which they will resist.
- **Protected technology list scope**: Defining the scope of the protected technology list will be contentious. The intelligence community will push for a broader list, while the scientific community will push for a narrower one.
- **Implementation burden**: The common disclosure form and centralized database require significant IT investment and interagency coordination, which may take longer than the statutory timeline.

**Refinements**:

- Include transition provisions for existing investigations and enforcement actions to ensure the new framework does not retroactively disrupt ongoing cases.
- Authorize the Council to grant temporary exemptions from the protected technology list for specific research collaborations that serve compelling scientific or diplomatic interests.
- Establish a classified advisory panel of scientists with security clearances to assist the Council in evaluating the protected technology list.

### The Science Diplomacy and Researcher Mobility Act

**Purpose**: To strengthen U.S. science diplomacy by rebuilding the science attache corps, to create an expedited visa pathway for international researchers, and to reform immigration provisions that impede the recruitment and retention of scientific talent.

**Legislative Vehicle**: Standalone bill referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee (immigration provisions), and the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. Immigration provisions could alternatively be included in a broader STEM immigration reform package.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Science Diplomat Expansion**: Triples the number of ESTH officers at U.S. embassies.
2. **Science Fast Track Visa**: Creates an expedited 30-day visa processing pathway for researchers.
3. **STEM Green Card Reform**: Eliminates per-country caps for STEM employment-based green cards.
4. **PP 10043 Reform**: Requires individualized assessments instead of institutional affiliation-based bans.
5. **J-1 Home Residency Waiver**: Eliminates the two-year home residency requirement for STEM researchers.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To strengthen the science diplomacy capacity of the United States,
to create an expedited visa processing pathway for international
researchers, and to reform immigration provisions that impede the
recruitment and retention of scientific talent.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Science Diplomacy and Researcher
Mobility Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States maintains approximately 20 environment,
science, technology, and health (ESTH) officers at embassies
worldwide, a decline from approximately 40 in the 1990s,
despite the growing importance of science and technology in
virtually every dimension of foreign policy.
(2) Competitor nations, including the People's Republic of
China, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, maintain
substantially larger science diplomacy operations and are
using them to build research partnerships that attract talent
away from the United States.
(3) International graduate students earned approximately 42
percent of all STEM doctoral degrees in the United States in
2023, and in fields such as computer science, electrical
engineering, and mathematics, the proportion exceeded 60
percent (NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates, 2024).
(4) Average visa processing times for international
researchers have increased significantly, with some consulates
reporting wait times exceeding 12 months for initial
interviews, causing the United States to lose talent to
nations with faster processing systems.
(5) Per-country caps on employment-based green cards create
wait times of 10 to 15 years or more for applicants from
India and the People's Republic of China, driving talented
researchers to seek permanent opportunities in Canada, the
United Kingdom, and Australia.
(6) Presidential Proclamation 10043, issued on June 1, 2020,
bars entry to students and researchers based on institutional
affiliation with broadly defined Chinese entities, an approach
that is over-inclusive and has deterred legitimate researchers
without demonstrably reducing espionage.
(7) Canada's Global Skills Strategy visa, which processes
work permits within 2 weeks, has contributed to a 50 percent
increase in international STEM workers in Canada since its
introduction in 2017, demonstrating that expedited processing
is both feasible and effective.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4**: The ESTH expansion addresses the chronic understaffing of science diplomacy. By creating Science Counselor positions with rank comparable to Economic Counselors, the bill signals that science and technology are core elements of diplomacy, not afterthoughts. The NSF-State fellowship (subsection (d)) brings active scientific expertise into the diplomatic corps.
- **Section 5**: The Science Fast Track visa directly addresses the processing delays that deter researchers. The 30-day guarantee and multi-year validity bring the U.S. in line with competitor systems (Canada's 2-week processing, UK's Global Talent visa). The exemption from technology alert list screening for fundamental research fields (subsection (c)(2)(A)) removes the single largest source of processing delays for researchers in non-sensitive fields.
- **Section 6**: Eliminating per-country caps for STEM doctoral graduates is the single most impactful immigration reform for scientific talent. The concurrent filing provision (subsection (c)) eliminates the "legal limbo" that keeps researchers in temporary status for years.
- **Section 7**: Rather than attempting to repeal PP 10043 outright (which would face political resistance), the bill requires individualized assessments, which achieves the practical effect of narrowing the ban to genuine security risks while maintaining the framework for cases where individual evidence warrants denial.
- **Section 8**: The J-1 home residency waiver removes a barrier that forces researchers to leave the U.S. and potentially never return, disrupting research programs and wasting the investment the U.S. has made in their training.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Establish Science Fast Track procedures | 180 days after enactment | State Dept./DHS |
| Amend PP 10043 per Section 7 | 90 days after enactment | President |
| Begin ESTH officer recruitment | 6 months after enactment | State Dept. |
| Launch NSF-State fellowship program | 12 months after enactment | NSF/State Dept. |
| Deploy Science Fast Track at all major consulates | 18 months after enactment | State Dept. |
| Complete initial ESTH expansion (40 officers) | 3 years after enactment | State Dept. |
| First PP 10043 annual report | March 1 following enactment | State Dept. |
| Full ESTH expansion (60 officers) | 5 years after enactment | State Dept. |
| Achieve 30-day average processing for Science Fast Track | 2 years after enactment | State Dept. |

**Challenges**:

- **Immigration politics**: Any bill touching immigration reform risks being caught in the broader immigration debate. Framing STEM immigration as a national security and competitiveness issue, rather than as immigration policy, may be the most viable path.
- **State Department capacity**: The State Department's hiring and training processes are slow. Tripling the ESTH corps within 5 years will require significant investments in recruitment, training, and retention.
- **PP 10043 political sensitivity**: The proclamation has bipartisan support rooted in China competition concerns. Requiring individualized assessments rather than outright repeal is designed to be politically feasible while achieving the practical goal.
- **Consular operations**: The 30-day processing guarantee will require significant operational changes at consulates, including dedicated staff, improved IT systems, and streamlined security screening procedures.

**Refinements**:

- Include provisions for reciprocal visa facilitation with allied nations that adopt similar expedited processing for U.S. researchers.
- Establish a Science Fast Track pre-clearance pilot at the 10 consulates with the highest volume of researcher applications.
- Create a "Global STEM Talent" visa category that combines work authorization with a direct pathway to permanent residency, modeled on Canada's Express Entry system.

## State Model Legislation

*International scientific cooperation is primarily a federal responsibility under the Constitution's foreign affairs and immigration powers. State legislation in this area is limited but can complement federal action in several ways:*

### Model State International Research Partnership Act

**Purpose**: To authorize state universities and research institutions to enter international research partnerships with appropriate safeguards and to provide state funding for international research collaboration.

**Key Provisions**:

- Authorize state universities to enter memoranda of understanding with foreign research institutions, subject to compliance with federal research security requirements
- Establish a state-funded international research exchange program that supplements federal programs
- Prohibit state agencies from discriminating against researchers or students based on national origin in admissions, hiring, or funding decisions
- Create a state international research advisory board to coordinate engagement with foreign partners

**Adaptations**: States with major research universities (California, Massachusetts, Texas, New York, Michigan) would benefit most. States with national laboratories (New Mexico, Tennessee, Illinois, Idaho) should include provisions for state-federal coordination on international projects.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agencies**: Office of Science and Technology Policy, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Risk-Based Framework Regulation**: OSTP must issue a final rule implementing the risk-based research security framework within 180 days of enactment, including the tiered system for fundamental, dual-use, and protected research.
2. **Common Disclosure Form**: OSTP and OMB must develop and deploy the common disclosure form within 12 months, including the secure centralized database.
3. **Science Fast Track Visa Regulation**: State Department must amend 22 C.F.R. (visa regulations) to establish the Science Fast Track processing pathway and training requirements for consular officers.
4. **STEM Green Card Implementation**: USCIS must amend 8 C.F.R. to implement the STEM per-country cap exemption and concurrent filing provisions.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Congressional Oversight**: Annual reporting requirements provide a regular accountability mechanism.
- **GAO Audits**: Triennial GAO assessments provide independent evaluation of implementation effectiveness.
- **Ombudsman Independence**: The Research Security Ombudsman operates independently of DOJ enforcement divisions.
- **Appropriations Conditionality**: Congress retains the ability to condition future appropriations on satisfactory implementation.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Power**: The International Science Commitment Fund operates under Congress's Article I, Section 8 spending power. Multi-year appropriations are constitutionally permissible and are used in other contexts (military construction, VA health care). The automatic continuing funding provision (Section 6(e)) may face objections as constraining future Congresses, but it is structured as a standing appropriation rather than a binding commitment, which is constitutionally permissible.

**Immigration Power**: Congress has plenary power over immigration under Article I, Section 8. The STEM green card reform and J-1 waiver are well within this authority. Amending per-country caps modifies a statutory provision enacted by Congress, which Congress has full authority to change.

**Executive Authority**: Section 7's requirement that the President amend PP 10043 raises separation of powers questions. Congress cannot compel the President to exercise or modify his Article II authority in a specific way. However, Congress can condition appropriations on compliance, create alternative visa pathways that circumvent the proclamation's effect, or express its sense that the proclamation should be modified.

### Preemption

Federal immigration and foreign affairs law preempts state regulation of these areas. The Model State International Research Partnership Act is designed to complement federal policy rather than conflict with it. States cannot enact immigration provisions or foreign policy restrictions that conflict with federal law under *Arizona v. United States*, 567 U.S. 387 (2012).

### Enforcement and Compliance

- **Risk-Based Framework**: Enforcement relies on agency compliance with the Council's guidelines. The GAO triennial assessment provides independent verification.
- **Visa Processing Guarantee**: The 30-day processing guarantee creates an administrative standard but is unlikely to be judicially enforceable by individual applicants under the consular non-reviewability doctrine (*Kleindienst v. Mandel*, 408 U.S. 753 (1972)).
- **Per-Country Cap Reform**: Self-executing upon enactment; USCIS must apply the amended statutory provision to pending and future applications.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### International Scientific Cooperation Enhancement Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Protected list scope creep | Intelligence community could progressively expand the protected technology list to cover broad categories of research, undermining the presumption of openness | High |
| Safe harbor exploitation | Researchers could make deliberately vague disclosures and then claim safe harbor protection when discrepancies are discovered | Medium |
| Council capture | Security-focused Council members could dominate deliberations, turning the Council into a restriction-approving body rather than a coordination mechanism | High |
| Automatic funding diversion | Automatic continuing funding provision could be used to maintain funding for underperforming projects that should be terminated | Medium |
| Agency non-compliance | Agencies could implement the common disclosure form while maintaining separate, additional disclosure requirements | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No enforcement mechanism for 30-day visa guarantee | Researchers have no legal remedy if processing exceeds 30 days | Consular non-reviewability doctrine |
| PP 10043 reform depends on presidential cooperation | If the President refuses to amend the proclamation, Section 7 has limited effect | Separation of powers |
| No mechanism for allied coordination | The bill addresses domestic policy but does not create a multilateral framework | Limits of domestic legislation |
| Funding authorization is not appropriation | The Fund requires actual appropriations, which Congress may not provide at authorized levels | Authorization-appropriation gap |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Protected list guardrails**: Require that any addition to the protected technology list be accompanied by a written justification demonstrating that the technology meets all three criteria in Section 4(c)(2), subject to annual GAO review.
2. **Safe harbor precision**: Define "good-faith disclosure" more precisely in implementing regulations, specifying that the safe harbor applies only to disclosures that are substantially accurate and that any omission was unintentional.
3. **Council balance**: Require that the Council include non-government advisers from the research community who serve in a formal advisory capacity with the ability to dissent publicly from Council decisions.
4. **Project termination authority**: Require that the 5-year GAO performance review include a recommendation on whether to continue, modify, or terminate U.S. participation in each project.
5. **Visa processing accountability**: Require the State Department to publish monthly data on average processing times for Science Fast Track applications and to report to Congress any consulate that consistently exceeds the 30-day target.

### Science Diplomacy and Researcher Mobility Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| STEM field definition gaming | The broad definition of "STEM field" could be used to extend green card benefits to non-research positions | Medium |
| Accredited institution certification abuse | Bad-faith entities could seek NSF certification to sponsor Science Fast Track visas for purposes other than research | Low |
| Waiver process backlog | The PP 10043 waiver process could become a bottleneck if demand exceeds processing capacity, recreating the delay problem under a different name | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address H-1B cap | Researchers employed outside academia still face H-1B lottery | Beyond bill scope |
| ESTH recruitment challenges | Foreign Service may struggle to recruit sufficient scientists willing to join the diplomatic corps | Career incentive mismatch |
| No reciprocity mechanism | U.S. expedites processing but cannot compel reciprocal treatment of U.S. researchers abroad | Limits of domestic legislation |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **STEM field precision**: Require DHS to publish a specific, enumerated list of STEM fields eligible for the per-country cap exemption, aligned with the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) codes.
2. **Certification safeguards**: Require NSF to conduct periodic audits of certified institutions and revoke certification for entities that do not maintain active research programs.
3. **Waiver capacity**: Authorize the State Department to hire dedicated adjudicators for PP 10043 waiver applications, with appropriations linked to application volume.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Interagency coordination delays on protected technology list | Establish a 60-day deadline for interagency deliberation on proposed additions, with automatic inclusion only upon unanimous agency agreement |
| State Department hiring timeline exceeds ESTH expansion schedule | Authorize direct-hire authority for ESTH officers, bypassing standard Foreign Service recruitment timelines |
| USCIS processing capacity for STEM green card reform | Authorize additional adjudicators specifically funded through premium processing fees |
| Resistance from consular officers to Science Fast Track requirements | Include Science Fast Track training in standard consular officer certification; track compliance in officer performance evaluations |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- **Science Fast Track visa**: Subject to a 5-year reauthorization to allow evaluation of effectiveness and security implications.
- **STEM green card reform**: Permanent; no sunset. Per-country cap elimination addresses a structural flaw in immigration law.
- **International Science Commitment Fund**: Authorization expires after 5 years (FY 2027-2031), requiring reauthorization based on project performance and strategic assessment.
- **Protected technology list**: Annual review cycle ensures the list remains current and does not expand beyond genuine security needs.
