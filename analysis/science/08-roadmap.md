# Science Policy: Roadmap

## Overview

Reforming American science policy requires a phased approach that builds political support, demonstrates results, and progressively addresses deeper structural problems. This roadmap sequences reforms from immediately achievable executive actions to long-term legislative and cultural change, recognizing that the political window for science reform is often narrow and must be seized when opportunity arises.

---

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions (0-12 Months)

### Executive Branch Actions (No Congressional Approval Required)

| Action | Lead Agency | Timeline |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Fully implement Nelson Memo open access requirements | OSTP | Ongoing |
| Strengthen scientific integrity policies at all agencies | OSTP | 3-6 months |
| Issue executive order on multi-year grant stability | OMB | 3 months |
| Reform NRSA postdoc stipend scale (increase minimum) | NIH | 6 months |
| Standardize research security disclosure requirements | OSTP/NSTC | 6 months |
| Expand existing diversity programs (INCLUDES, EPSCoR) | NSF/NIH | 6-12 months |
| Issue guidance on AI use in research and peer review | OSTP | 6 months |
| Appoint scientific integrity officers at all agencies | Agency heads | 3 months |

### Quick Wins

- **Streamline grant applications**: Direct NIH and NSF to pilot shorter preliminary proposals
- **Standardize biosketches and current-and-pending forms**: Reduce duplication across agencies
- **Publish indirect cost spending data**: Increase transparency without changing rates
- **Restore government scientist communication rights**: Clarify that federal scientists may publish and speak publicly about their research
- **Create interagency research coordination dashboard**: Improve visibility of the total federal research portfolio

## Phase 2: Short-Term Goals (1-2 Years)

### Legislative Priorities

| Bill | Key Provisions | Political Feasibility |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| Scientific Integrity and Open Science Act | Codify integrity protections, open access mandates | Moderate (bipartisan interest post-pandemic) |
| Federal Research Stability Act | Multi-year appropriations for research agencies | Moderate (requires appropriations committee buy-in) |
| STEM Workforce Development Act | Postdoc reforms, visa streamlining, diversity programs | High (broad bipartisan appeal) |
| OTA Restoration Act | Restore congressional science advisory capacity | Moderate (some bipartisan support) |

### Agency-Level Reforms

- **NIH grant reform pilot**: Test 7-year grants with mid-term review for R01 equivalents
- **NSF TIP Directorate scale-up**: Fund the Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships directorate at authorized levels
- **Interagency data sharing**: Create shared data infrastructure across research agencies
- **Research security harmonization**: Implement unified disclosure and compliance requirements
- **Postdoc registry**: Establish a national registry of postdoctoral positions with salary and benefit data

### Coalition Building

- Engage industry allies (tech companies, biotech firms) as advocates for increased research funding
- Build bipartisan congressional science caucus with members from both chambers
- Launch public awareness campaign on the economic returns of research investment
- Partner with university systems in politically diverse states to broaden geographic support

## Phase 3: Medium-Term Goals (3-5 Years)

### Structural Reforms

| Reform | Target | Dependencies |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Reach 0.85% GDP in federal R&D | FY 2029 | Political will, budget capacity |
| Implement indirect cost transparency requirements | Year 3 | Data infrastructure, university buy-in |
| Establish Research Stabilization Fund | Year 3 | Legislative authorization and appropriation |
| Scale up regional innovation hubs | Year 3-5 | CHIPS Act appropriations |
| Create 10,000 staff scientist positions | Year 4-5 | Funding increase, institutional change |

### Grant System Transformation

- Expand people-based funding to 25% of total agency research budgets
- Implement lottery-based funding for proposals meeting quality thresholds (pilot at NSF)
- Reduce maximum indirect cost rate to 50% with full transparency requirements
- Introduce "negative results" publication requirements for all federally funded research
- Create rapid-response funding mechanisms for emerging scientific opportunities

### Open Science Infrastructure

- Build national research data commons with FAIR-compliant repositories
- Develop alternative metrics for research impact beyond journal impact factors
- Fund open-source software and tools used widely in research
- Create public-facing science communication platforms linked to funded research

---

## Phase 4: Long-Term Transformation (5-10 Years)

### Systemic Goals

| Goal | Target Date | Metric |
|------|------------|--------|
| Federal R&D at 1% of GDP | 2035 | Budget analysis |
| NIH R01 success rate at 30%+ | 2035 | NIH data |
| Postdoc median salary at $75,000+ | 2033 | NRSA scale |
| URM share of S&E faculty at 15%+ | 2035 | NSF survey data |
| 100% open access for federally funded research | 2030 | Compliance monitoring |
| All agencies with statutory integrity protections | 2032 | Legislative tracking |
| Restored congressional science capacity | 2030 | OTA or equivalent operational |

### Cultural Change

- Shift academic promotion criteria to value reproducibility, mentorship, and societal impact alongside publication volume
- Normalize career paths outside the tenure track (staff scientists, industry, policy, communication)
- Build public science literacy through sustained investment in science education and communication
- Rebuild bipartisan trust in scientific institutions through transparency and community engagement

### Institutional Evolution

- Restructure federal lab management contracts to reward innovation and collaboration
- Create new interdisciplinary research institutes that span traditional agency boundaries
- Reform university tenure and promotion systems to reduce publish-or-perish pressure
- Develop a national strategy for research infrastructure investment (computing, facilities, instrumentation)

## Dependencies and Sequencing

### Critical Path Items

1. **Scientific integrity legislation** should come first, as it creates the foundation for evidence-based policymaking on all other reforms
2. **Funding increases** must accompany structural reforms -- reducing overhead or changing grant structures without more money will create zero-sum conflicts
3. **Workforce reforms** (postdoc pay, career paths) require both funding and institutional buy-in from universities
4. **Open science infrastructure** must be built before mandates can be fully enforced
5. **Research security harmonization** should precede any new enforcement actions to avoid repeating China Initiative errors

### Political Dependencies

| Reform | Requires | Risk Factor |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Multi-year appropriations | Appropriations committee buy-in | High (committees guard prerogatives) |
| Funding increase to 1% GDP | Bipartisan support + budget room | High (competing fiscal priorities) |
| Indirect cost reform | University acceptance | Medium (strong institutional resistance) |
| Integrity legislation | Congressional action | Medium (bipartisan potential) |
| Open access mandates | Agency implementation | Low (executive authority exists) |
| Workforce reforms | Funding + institutional change | Medium (widespread support in principle) |

---

## Risks and Contingencies

### Risk: Political Backlash Against Science

**Scenario**: Continued politicization of science erodes bipartisan support for funding increases.

**Contingency**: Focus on national security and economic competitiveness framing; build support through regional innovation hubs that distribute benefits broadly; engage industry as advocates.

### Risk: Budget Austerity

**Scenario**: Deficit concerns prevent meaningful increases in research funding.

**Contingency**: Prioritize efficiency reforms that improve the system without additional funding (grant streamlining, open science, interagency coordination); pursue mandatory funding mechanisms less vulnerable to annual appropriations.

### Risk: China Competition Overcorrection

**Scenario**: Security concerns lead to further restrictions on international collaboration.

**Contingency**: Maintain evidence-based approach to research security; document the costs of overbroad restrictions; ensure scientific community voice in security policy.

### Risk: Institutional Resistance

**Scenario**: Universities and agencies resist structural reforms that threaten existing power structures.

**Contingency**: Phase in changes gradually; provide incentives for early adopters; use transparency requirements to build public pressure for reform; work with reform-minded institutional leaders.
