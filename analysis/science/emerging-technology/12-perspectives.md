# Emerging Technology Research: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes emerging technology research governance through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints. Emerging technology research is notable for generating unusual cross-partisan alignments: national security concerns unite otherwise opposed factions, while disagreements about the role of government in directing research cut across traditional left-right lines.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of 2026-02-05)

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Conservatives state concern about government overreach in research governance, but selectively support massive government spending (CHIPS Act) when framed as national security* |
| Principle consistency | *Limited government principles are inconsistently applied: fiscal restraint rhetoric coexists with support for defense R&D spending* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions on industrial policy have shifted significantly; previously opposed government picking winners, now support semiconductor subsidies* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Moderate: generally willing to engage on research funding if framed in competitive or security terms* |

**Justification:** *Conservatives demonstrate mixed consistency on emerging technology research because national security and economic competitiveness concerns frequently override small-government principles. The CHIPS Act received significant Republican support despite representing industrial policy that conservatives would typically oppose. This creates a negotiable space but makes positions difficult to predict from first principles alone.*

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan passage of CHIPS and Science Act with significant Republican votes (64-33 in Senate)*
- *Heritage Foundation oscillation between opposing industrial policy and supporting strategic technology investment*
- *Republican support for DARPA and defense R&D even while proposing cuts to NSF and NIH*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Agree that US faces competitive threats and needs stronger research investment, but dispute emphasis on governance gaps and equity concerns* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Reject regulatory capture and private sector dominance as problems; see government bureaucracy and overregulation as primary obstacles* |

**Source references:**

- *Heritage Foundation, "Blueprint for Reorganizing Federal R&D" (2024)*
- *AEI reports on technology competition with China*

#### Solution Evaluations

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *NETRC Act* | 4/10 | *Coordination good in theory, but creates new bureaucracy; NAIRR is government overreach; march-in rights dangerous* | *Expanding government role in research direction; open-licensing threatens industry* |
| *Research Safety Act* | 4/10 | *Board too powerful; regulations will drive research overseas; criminal penalties excessive* | *New independent agency with broad authority conflicts with deregulatory goals* |

#### Alternative Proposals

*Conservatives would prefer: (1) Strengthening existing agency coordination through OSTP without a new office, (2) Tax incentives for private R&D over direct government spending, (3) Expanding public-private partnerships over government-managed infrastructure like NAIRR, (4) Voluntary industry frameworks for dual-use oversight rather than mandatory government review, (5) Targeted export controls over broad regulatory frameworks.*

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** *Libertarian (on deregulation), Constitutionalist (on limited government), Populist (on China competition)*
- **Potential bridges:** *Centrist (on pragmatic research funding), Liberal (on bipartisan CHIPS implementation)*
- **Unlikely partners:** *Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on government role), Progressive (on IP reform)*

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Liberals genuinely support expanded research investment and governance; positions largely align with stated values of equity and safety* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistent support for government role in research and regulation; occasionally inconsistent on open science vs. security classification* |
| Goalpost stability | *Relatively stable positions on research funding and governance, though specific priorities shift with political opportunities* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Low: generally open to compromise that advances core goals* |

**Justification:** *Liberals are mostly consistent partners on emerging technology research because their core commitments to public investment, equity, and safety align naturally with the proposed reforms. Minor inconsistencies appear around national security classification, where some liberals defer to security state preferences despite stated transparency values.*

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Consistent Democratic support for NSF and NIH funding increases*
- *Democratic sponsorship of NAIRR legislation (Wyden-Booker-Heinrich)*
- *Liberal think tanks (CAP, Brookings) consistently advocate for research governance reform*

#### Position Scores

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Progressives genuinely prioritize equity, public ownership, and worker protection in technology policy; positions reflect principles* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently apply structural reform lens; may underweight security concerns relative to equity concerns* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable positions on public investment and corporate accountability; occasionally escalate demands in negotiations* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Moderate: sometimes frame technology policy as zero-sum between workers and corporations* |

**Justification:** *Progressives are mostly consistent because their structural reform orientation provides a coherent lens for technology policy. Their emphasis on equity and public ownership sometimes leads them to oppose pragmatic compromises that could advance their goals partially. Predictable but occasionally rigid.*

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Congressional Progressive Caucus consistent positions on public technology investment*
- *Progressive think tanks (Roosevelt Institute, EPI) coherent technology policy frameworks*
- *Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren consistent corporate accountability positions*

#### Position Scores

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Libertarians genuinely oppose government direction of research and mandatory oversight frameworks* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently apply minimal-state principles to technology policy; rare exceptions for intellectual property (contested within libertarian thought)* |
| Goalpost stability | *Very stable positions on deregulation; predictably oppose new agencies and mandates* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Low: principled opposition rather than strategic positioning* |

**Justification:** *Libertarians are mostly consistent because their minimal-state principles provide clear, predictable positions on technology policy. Their opposition to government direction of research and mandatory oversight is principled rather than strategic. Minor inconsistency around intellectual property, where some libertarians support patents (market incentive) and others oppose them (government-granted monopoly).*

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Cato Institute consistent opposition to industrial policy and technology regulation*
- *Reason Foundation critiques of CHIPS Act as corporate welfare*
- *Libertarian Party platform on government research spending*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Constitutionalists genuinely evaluate technology policy through enumerated powers and federalism lens* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently apply constitutional framework; occasionally strain interpretation to accommodate defense spending* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable positions rooted in constitutional text; predictable framework for evaluation* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Low: principled evaluation rather than strategic opposition* |

**Justification:** *Constitutionalists provide a consistent analytical framework for technology policy, evaluating each proposal against enumerated powers. Their positions are predictable and principled, with minor inconsistency around defense research (broad national security authority) vs. civilian research (questioned constitutional basis).*

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Federalist Society analyses of federal research authority*
- *Constitutional scholars' analyses of Commerce Clause applicability to research governance*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Agree on some governance problems but question federal authority to address them; support states' role* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *See constitutional overreach as a root cause; federal government has exceeded legitimate research authority* |

**Source references:**

- *Federalist Society regulatory studies papers*
- *Heritage Foundation constitutional analysis of federal research authority*

#### Solution Evaluations

|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *NETCO coordination office* | 3/10 | *No constitutional authority for coordinating civilian research from EOP* | *Genuine constitutional concern about executive branch expansion* |
| *Full NAIRR funding* | 3/10 | *Spending Clause authority exists, but massive appropriation raises Tenth Amendment concerns* | *Question whether this is a legitimate federal function* |
| *Dual-use oversight reform* | 5/10 | *National security rationale provides constitutional basis; scope must be limited* | *Support security-related oversight; oppose extending to all research* |
| *CHIPS appropriations* | 6/10 | *Commerce Clause and national defense provide adequate constitutional basis* | *More comfortable with defense-framed technology investment* |
| *Technology transfer reform* | 5/10 | *Property Clause authority over federal inventions is clear; march-in raises Due Process concerns* | *Constitutional property rights analysis drives position* |
| *Workforce development* | 4/10 | *Education is a state function; federal role should be limited to immigration and military training* | *Tenth Amendment concerns about federal education programs* |
| *International collaboration* | 7/10 | *Treaty power and foreign affairs authority clearly support international cooperation* | *Constitutional authority is clear for international agreements* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *NETRC Act* | 4/10 | *NETCO has questionable constitutional basis in EOP; NAIRR better grounded through Spending Clause; march-in raises property rights concerns* | *Each provision evaluated against specific constitutional authority* |
| *Research Safety Act* | 5/10 | *Board has stronger constitutional basis through Commerce Clause for interstate research; criminal penalties must meet Due Process requirements* | *National security rationale provides strongest constitutional foundation* |

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Populists frame technology policy around worker protection and anti-elitism, but positions frequently shift based on political dynamics* |
| Principle consistency | *Anti-elite rhetoric coexists with support for corporate subsidies (CHIPS Act); inconsistent on government role* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions shift significantly based on which elites are perceived as benefiting; China competition framing overrides other concerns* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *High: frequently frame technology policy as zero-sum between workers and elites, US and China* |

**Justification:** *Populists demonstrate low consistency because their anti-elite orientation produces different positions depending on which "elite" is the target. They may support government research spending when framed as challenging Big Tech monopoly but oppose it when seen as benefiting university elites. China competition is the most reliable motivator but can justify contradictory policies.*

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Populist support for CHIPS Act (anti-China) alongside opposition to NSF funding increases (seen as academic elite subsidy)*
- *Shifting positions on tech regulation: anti-Big Tech rhetoric coexists with opposition to government regulation*
- *JD Vance and populist right technology positions combining anti-monopoly with anti-regulation*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Agree on competitive threats from China and Big Tech dominance; disagree on emphasis on equity and diversity* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | *Agree on regulatory capture and private sector dominance but attribute to "elites" broadly; reject structural/systemic analysis* |

| *Full NAIRR funding* | 3/10 | *Benefits academics and tech companies, not workers* | *Perceive research infrastructure as serving elite institutions* |
| *Dual-use oversight reform* | 5/10 | *Support oversight of Big Tech; skeptical of broad research regulation* | *Anti-corporate sentiment supports some oversight; anti-government sentiment limits scope* |
| *CHIPS appropriations* | 8/10 | *Strongly support domestic manufacturing and supply chain security* | *National security and reshoring align with populist economic nationalism* |
| *Technology transfer reform* | 6/10 | *Support faster commercialization for American workers; mixed on open access* | *Want technology to create American jobs, not academic publications* |
| *Workforce development* | 6/10 | *Support domestic training; strongly oppose visa expansion* | *Immigration restriction is a core populist priority that overrides workforce needs* |
| *International collaboration* | 4/10 | *Skeptical of international agreements; strongly support tough China policy* | *Economic nationalism conflicts with international cooperation* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *NETRC Act* | 4/10 | *CHIPS provisions good; NETCO unnecessary bureaucracy; NAIRR benefits elites* | *Support industrial policy portions; oppose academic research provisions* |
| *Research Safety Act* | 5/10 | *Support oversight of Big Tech AI; skeptical of broad research regulation; oppose gene synthesis provisions as niche concern* | *Anti-corporate sentiment partially aligned; anti-regulation sentiment partially opposed* |

#### Alternative Proposals

*Populists would prefer: (1) Buy American requirements for all federally funded research equipment, (2) Worker retraining programs directly tied to technology displacement, (3) Aggressive China export controls and technology decoupling, (4) Anti-monopoly action against Big Tech rather than new regulation, (5) Domestic manufacturing requirements over research investment.*

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** *Conservative (on China competition, immigration), Progressive (on anti-monopoly)*
- **Potential bridges:** *Liberal (on worker protection aspects), Democratic Socialist (on anti-corporate measures)*
- **Unlikely partners:** *Libertarian (on trade and immigration), Constitutionalist (on federal spending)*

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Centrists genuinely seek pragmatic, evidence-based technology policy; stated positions align with problem-solving orientation* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently pragmatic; willing to support government action where evidence supports it* |
| Goalpost stability | *Relatively stable positions; adjust based on evidence rather than political pressure* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Very low: actively seek compromise and bipartisan solutions* |

**Justification:** *Centrists are mostly consistent partners on emerging technology research because the issue lends itself to pragmatic, evidence-based approaches. The bipartisan success of the CHIPS Act demonstrates centrist ability to build coalitions on technology policy. Minor inconsistency when institutional preservation instincts conflict with necessary structural reform.*

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center technology governance recommendations*
- *Senate bipartisan passage of CHIPS Act as centrist achievement*
- *Third Way technology policy positions emphasizing pragmatic governance*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Religious Right engages with technology research primarily through bioethics lens; stated moral concerns are genuine but selectively applied* |
| Principle consistency | *Strong consistency on bioethics (embryonic research, genetic modification); less coherent positions on AI and quantum* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable on bioethics; positions on other technology areas shift with conservative coalition dynamics* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Moderate: frame bioethics issues in absolute terms; more flexible on other technology areas* |

**Justification:** *The Religious Right demonstrates mixed consistency because their engagement with emerging technology policy is primarily driven by bioethics concerns. On biotechnology and genetic modification, their positions are principled and predictable. On AI, quantum computing, and semiconductors, they generally follow conservative coalition positions without independent analysis.*

**Evidence for assessment:**

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Democratic Socialists genuinely prioritize public ownership, worker control, and democratic governance of technology* |
| Principle consistency | *Consistently apply public goods framework to technology policy; coherent worldview produces predictable positions* |
| Goalpost stability | *Stable positions on public ownership and worker rights; may escalate demands but maintain core framework* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Moderate to high: frame technology as class struggle between workers and capital* |

**Justification:** *Democratic Socialists are mostly consistent because their public goods framework provides a coherent, principled approach to technology policy. Their positions follow logically from core commitments to democratic control of the economy. Occasional rigidity in opposing market mechanisms that could advance public interest reduces score slightly.*

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *DSA technology policy platform emphasizing public ownership and worker control*
- *Bernie Sanders consistent positions on public investment and corporate accountability*
- *Jacobin and Current Affairs analyses of technology policy from democratic socialist perspective*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | *Strongly agree on private sector dominance, public benefit capture, and equity failures; would emphasize class dynamics more* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | *Strongest agreement with root cause analysis, particularly on regulatory capture, private sector dominance, and technology transfer failures* |

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| *CHIPS appropriations* | *Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Centrist, Constitutionalist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist* | *None at 3-4* | *Libertarian* |
| *Dual-use oversight* | *Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist, Conservative, Populist, Constitutionalist* | *None at 3-4* | *Libertarian* |
| *Workforce development* | *Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist, Populist, Conservative, Religious Right* | *Libertarian, Constitutionalist* | *None* |
| *Technology transfer reform* | *Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist, Conservative, Populist, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Religious Right* | *None* | *None* |
| *NAIRR full funding* | *Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist* | *Conservative, Religious Right, Populist, Constitutionalist* | *Libertarian* |
| *NETCO coordination* | *Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist* | *Conservative, Populist, Religious Right* | *Libertarian, Constitutionalist* |
| *International collaboration* | *Liberal, Centrist, Constitutionalist, Conservative, Libertarian, Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Religious Right* | *Populist* | *None* |

**Key insight:** *CHIPS appropriations and technology transfer reform have the broadest coalitions, with near-universal support (7-8/9 perspectives scoring 5+). Dual-use oversight achieves broad support when framed through the specific lens each perspective values (national security for conservatives, corporate accountability for progressives, bioethics for Religious Right). NAIRR and NETCO face narrower coalitions but could be advanced through the liberal-progressive-centrist-democratic socialist alliance (4/9 with strong support). The Libertarian perspective is the most structurally opposed to the overall legislative framework.*

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Bipartisan Technology Competitiveness and Safety Package*

**Bridges:** *Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist*

**Core Agreement:** *National security and economic competitiveness require sustained research investment and basic safety governance. All four perspectives agree that China competition is a legitimate threat and that the US needs to maintain technology leadership.*

**Policy Description:**

*A combined bill that fully appropriates CHIPS Act R&D provisions, establishes streamlined technology transfer from federal labs, creates a light-touch coordination mechanism through an enhanced OSTP office (rather than a new independent NETCO), and establishes dual-use research oversight limited to biosecurity and AI safety in national security contexts. NAIRR would be included at a reduced initial scale ($1 billion over 4 years) with performance-based expansion. Immigration provisions would include STEM PhD exemptions from H-1B caps paired with enhanced security vetting.*

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | *CHIPS investment framed as national security; coordination through existing OSTP structure; reduced NAIRR scale; security vetting for immigration* |
| Liberal | *Full CHIPS R&D funding; NAIRR pilot expansion; workforce development; some equity provisions* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based, bipartisan approach; phased implementation; performance metrics* |
| Populist | *Strong CHIPS domestic manufacturing focus; China competition framing; domestic workforce training* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | *Accept expanded government research spending and coordination mechanism* |
| Liberal | *Accept reduced NAIRR scale, lighter oversight framework, enhanced immigration vetting* |
| Centrist | *Accept more ambitious spending levels than purely incremental approach* |
| Populist | *Accept some immigration expansion for STEM researchers* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives (but representing political center-of-gravity in Congress)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 2/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Centrist)
- **Durability:** *Moderate - competitiveness framing durable; populist support may waver if framing shifts*
- **Implementation Path:** *Attach to NDAA or stand-alone bipartisan bill; model on CHIPS Act legislative process*

---

### Compromise 2: *Public Research Infrastructure for Innovation and Equity*

**Bridges:** *Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Democratic Socialist*

**Core Agreement:** *Public investment in research infrastructure is essential for both innovation and equity. All four perspectives agree that concentration of AI research capability in a few private companies is problematic and that publicly funded research should serve the public.*

**Policy Description:**

*Full NAIRR authorization at $2.6 billion over six years with strong equity provisions, including priority access for MSIs, open-licensing requirements for NAIRR-supported models, and community college participation. Technology transfer reform including march-in rights guidance, open-access publication mandates, and a unified national lab marketplace. Workforce development including 10,000 new STEM graduate fellowships, expanded REU programs, and loan forgiveness for public-sector researchers.*

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | *Full NAIRR with equity provisions; open access; workforce diversity* |
| Progressive | *Public infrastructure challenges corporate monopoly; march-in rights; worker investment* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based research infrastructure; phased implementation with metrics* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Public ownership of AI infrastructure; open licensing; challenge to corporate control* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | *Accept some Progressive demands on march-in that may concern university allies* |
| Progressive | *Accept market-compatible framework rather than full public ownership model* |
| Centrist | *Accept march-in rights provisions that may concern industry allies* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Accept incremental public infrastructure rather than comprehensive public ownership* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *High - all coalition members have principled, stable commitment to public research investment*
- **Implementation Path:** *Stand-alone NAIRR authorization bill or inclusion in NSF reauthorization; technology transfer provisions through Bayh-Dole amendment*

---

### Compromise 3: *Emerging Technology Safety Framework*

**Bridges:** *Liberal + Conservative + Centrist + Religious Right + Progressive*

**Core Agreement:** *Dual-use research in biotechnology and AI poses genuine risks that current voluntary frameworks inadequately address. A risk-based oversight framework can protect safety without unreasonably burdening research. Each perspective has different reasons for supporting oversight but converges on the need for governance.*

**Policy Description:**

*A narrowly scoped dual-use oversight bill focused on the highest-risk research: gain-of-function pathogen research, gene synthesis screening, and AI capability assessments for systems with potential WMD applications. Oversight through an independent board with balanced membership including biosecurity experts, AI safety researchers, bioethicists (addressing Religious Right concerns), and research community representatives. Tiered approach: registration for all dual-use research, enhanced review only for highest-risk categories. Criminal penalties limited to willful creation of catastrophic risk. Strong whistleblower protections. International coordination provisions.*

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | *Mandatory oversight fills governance gaps; safety protections; whistleblower provisions* |
| Conservative | *Narrowly scoped to highest risks; national security rationale; not overly burdensome* |
| Centrist | *Risk-based, evidence-driven approach; tiered requirements; pragmatic design* |
| Religious Right | *Bioethics representation on board; oversight of genetic modification; human dignity framework* |
| Progressive | *Corporate accountability for dual-use research; strong penalties for violations* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | *Accept narrower scope than comprehensive Research Safety Act* |
| Conservative | *Accept new independent agency and mandatory oversight requirements* |
| Centrist | *Accept mandatory rather than initially voluntary framework* |
| Religious Right | *Accept that bioethics provisions are advisory rather than determinative* |
| Progressive | *Accept narrower scope and lower penalties than preferred* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Centrist, Progressive)
- **Durability:** *Moderate-High - biosecurity framing durable across parties; Religious Right engagement stabilizes right flank*
- **Implementation Path:** *Stand-alone biosafety and technology safety bill with bipartisan sponsorship; leverage post-COVID biosafety momentum*

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most productive coalition for emerging technology research reform is the **Liberal-Centrist-Conservative alignment on competitiveness grounds**, supplemented by Progressive and Democratic Socialist support on public investment provisions. This coalition mirrors the CHIPS Act alliance and can be activated by framing reforms in terms of:

- National security and China competition (attracts conservatives, populists)
- Evidence-based governance (attracts centrists)
- Public investment and equity (attracts liberals, progressives, democratic socialists)

### Key Obstacles

1. **Appropriations process** - Authorization is bipartisan; appropriation is where coalitions fracture over spending levels and conditions
2. **Industry lobbying** - Technology companies will resist mandatory oversight provisions and open-licensing requirements
3. **Populist unpredictability** - Low consistency rating makes populist support unreliable; framing must consistently emphasize worker benefit and China competition
4. **Libertarian structural opposition** - Cannot be incorporated into coalition without abandoning core provisions; manage rather than accommodate

### Low Consistency Partners

- **Populist (2/5)** - Engage through China competition and domestic manufacturing framing; avoid academic or equity framing that triggers anti-elite response; build in worker protection provisions to maintain populist support
- **Conservative (3/5)** - Engage through national security framing; accept conservative modifications on scope and spending levels; leverage defense committee jurisdiction
- **Religious Right (3/5)** - Engage specifically on bioethics dimensions; include bioethics representation on oversight bodies; do not over-promise on scope of moral governance

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with CHIPS appropriations** and technology transfer reform as highest-viability reforms with broadest coalition
2. **Package dual-use safety with CHIPS** as competitiveness measure (strong research governance as competitive advantage, not burden)
3. **Advance NAIRR** through the liberal-progressive-centrist-democratic socialist coalition, with phased implementation to build evidence base
4. **Sequence NETCO** as second-tier priority, starting with enhanced OSTP coordination before seeking independent office
5. **Build workforce provisions** into all packages as cross-cutting priority with universal support
6. **Engage international partners** through executive action while legislative process proceeds
