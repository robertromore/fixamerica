# Emerging Technology Research: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming US emerging technology research governance requires action across multiple domains: institutional structure, funding mechanisms, dual-use oversight, workforce development, and international coordination. The following solutions are designed to be complementary and sequenced for political viability.

## Solution 1: Establish a National Emerging Technology Coordination Office

### Problem Addressed

Fragmented governance across dozens of agencies with no authoritative coordination mechanism.

### Proposal

Create a statutory National Emerging Technology Coordination Office (NETCO) within the Executive Office of the President, with:

- **Director** appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, for a 6-year term
- **Budget coordination authority** over emerging technology research across agencies
- **Interagency board** with representatives from DARPA, NSF, DOE, NIH, NIST, Commerce, and DOD
- **Annual National Emerging Technology Strategy** submitted to Congress with cross-agency priorities, funding recommendations, and governance assessments
- **Dual-use risk assessment** authority with ability to commission reviews of emerging research areas

### Key Design Features

- Term-protected leadership to survive presidential transitions
- Budget coordination (not control) to preserve agency autonomy while improving alignment
- Statutory mandate (not executive order) for durability
- Sunset review every 10 years to prevent bureaucratic ossification

### Evidence Base

- The National Quantum Initiative Subcommittee demonstrates interagency coordination value but lacks authority
- UK's Government Office for Science provides a partial model for cross-government coordination
- GAO has repeatedly recommended improved interagency coordination for emerging technology (GAO-22-105895)

## Solution 2: Fully Fund the National AI Research Resource

### Problem Addressed

Concentration of AI research capability in a few large companies; academic researchers and smaller institutions lack access to compute, data, and models.

### Proposal

Appropriate $2.6 billion over six years to implement the full NAIRR vision as recommended by the NAIRR Task Force:

- **Compute infrastructure** - Federally funded cloud computing and dedicated research clusters accessible to all accredited researchers
- **Curated datasets** - Privacy-protected datasets for AI research across domains
- **Model sharing platform** - Repository of open foundation models for research use
- **Educational access** - Training resources and mentorship programs for underrepresented institutions
- **Governance** - Independent board with academic, civil society, and government representation

### Key Design Features

- Open access for researchers at accredited institutions, with priority for MSIs and under-resourced universities
- Privacy and security review for all shared datasets
- Intellectual property rules ensuring publicly funded models remain accessible
- International collaboration permitted with allied-nation institutions

## Solution 3: Reform Dual-Use Research Governance

### Problem Addressed

Current dual-use oversight applies only to federally funded research, is inconsistent across institutions, and fails to address emerging risks from AI-enabled biology, quantum computing, and autonomous systems.

### Proposal

Establish a comprehensive dual-use research oversight framework:

**Tier 1 - Universal requirements:**

- All research institutions (public and private) conducting research on designated dual-use topics must register with a national oversight body
- Gene synthesis providers must screen orders against a curated pathogen database
- AI model developers must conduct and document dual-use risk assessments for models above capability thresholds

**Tier 2 - Enhanced review:**

- Research meeting specific risk criteria (gain-of-function, autonomous weapons capabilities, offensive cyber capabilities) undergoes independent review
- Review panels include technical experts, biosecurity specialists, and public representatives
- Approval required before commencement; ongoing monitoring during research

**Tier 3 - Restricted research:**

- Categories of research deemed to pose unacceptable risk are prohibited or strictly licensed
- Enforcement through penalties and facility inspections
- International coordination with allied nations on restricted categories

### Key Design Features

- Risk-based approach avoids burdening low-risk research
- Independent review panels (not just institutional committees)
- Coverage regardless of funding source
- Regular update of risk categories as technology evolves
- Whistleblower protections for researchers reporting violations
- Appeal process for adverse decisions

### Evidence Base

- National Academies recommendations on biosecurity and dual-use research
- UK Biological Security Strategy (2023)
- Australia's Security of Critical Infrastructure Act as model for technology-agnostic oversight
- Post-COVID biosafety reviews identifying gaps in current frameworks

## Solution 4: Close the CHIPS Act Appropriations Gap

### Problem Addressed

CHIPS and Science Act R&D provisions are significantly under-appropriated, undermining their intent and US competitiveness.

### Proposal

Enact a dedicated appropriations package to fund CHIPS Act R&D authorizations:

| Program | Remaining Authorization | Proposed Appropriation Timeline |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| NSF TIP Directorate | ~$16.5B | $3.3B/year for 5 years |
| DOE research programs | ~$12.9B | $2.6B/year for 5 years |
| NIST research programs | ~$4.5B | $900M/year for 5 years |
| Regional Technology Hubs | ~$9.5B | $1.9B/year for 5 years |
| STEM education | ~$11.1B | $2.2B/year for 5 years |

### Key Design Features

- Multi-year appropriations to enable long-term planning
- Advance appropriation authority where possible to reduce annual uncertainty
- Geographic distribution requirements to prevent concentration in existing tech hubs
- Performance reporting to Congress with specific milestones
- Private sector matching requirements for some programs

### Evidence Base

- AAAS analysis of CHIPS Act appropriations gap
- Congressional Research Service reports on R&D funding trends
- SIA workforce studies demonstrating need for STEM pipeline investment

## Solution 5: Modernize Technology Transfer

### Problem Addressed

Publicly funded research takes too long to reach public benefit; technology transfer processes are bureaucratic and favor private capture over broad access.

### Proposal

**Reform Bayh-Dole implementation:**

- Establish clear criteria for exercising march-in rights when licensees charge unreasonable prices or fail to make inventions available
- Require public benefit plans as a condition of exclusive licenses
- Mandate transparency in licensing terms for federally funded inventions
- Create a public licensing option for government-funded foundational technologies

**Streamline national lab technology transfer:**

- Reduce CRADA processing time from 12+ months to under 90 days
- Create "express" licensing for pre-approved technology categories
- Establish a unified technology marketplace across all 17 DOE national labs
- Fund bridge programs to span the "valley of death" between lab discovery and commercialization

**Create an open-science default:**

- Federally funded research publications must be immediately open-access (building on OSTP Nelson Memo)
- Government-funded software defaults to open-source licensing
- Research data underlying publications must be deposited in accessible repositories
- Exceptions available for legitimate national security or privacy reasons

### Evidence Base

- NIH Public Access Policy results showing increased research impact from open access
- European Commission open science mandates
- KEI analysis of Bayh-Dole march-in rights non-enforcement
- DOE Inspector General reports on technology transfer delays
