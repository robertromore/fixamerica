# Emerging Technology Research: Actions

## Overview

Citizens, researchers, professionals, and organizations can take concrete actions to improve US emerging technology research governance. This document organizes actions by audience and effort level.

## For All Citizens

### Learn and Stay Informed

- **Understand the basics** - Follow emerging technology developments through accessible sources such as the Stanford AI Index (<https://aiindex.stanford.edu>), AAAS Science & Policy updates, and the Federation of American Scientists blog
- **Attend public events** - National Academies hosts free public webinars on emerging technology topics; DARPA hosts periodic public demonstrations
- **Read GAO reports** - The Government Accountability Office publishes accessible technology assessments on quantum computing, AI, and biosecurity
- **Follow appropriations** - Track whether Congress funds authorized research programs using the AAAS R&D Budget Tracker

### Contact Elected Officials

- **Call your representatives** about fully funding CHIPS Act R&D provisions - Emphasize bipartisan support and local economic impact
- **Write to senators** about STEM visa reform - Frame as both economic competitiveness and national security issue
- **Attend town halls** - Ask about representatives' positions on emerging technology research funding and governance
- **Submit public comments** - When agencies publish proposed rules on AI, biosafety, or export controls, submit comments through <https://www.regulations.gov>

### Support Organizations

- **Donate to science advocacy** - Organizations like the Federation of American Scientists, Union of Concerned Scientists, and AAAS work on science policy
- **Support digital rights groups** - EFF and Access Now advocate for technology governance that protects civil liberties
- **Join civic technology organizations** - Code for America and similar groups work on technology policy at local levels

## For Researchers and Scientists

### Within Your Institution

- **Engage with biosafety processes** - Serve on Institutional Biosafety Committees; advocate for rigorous review even when not required
- **Conduct dual-use risk assessments** - Even when not mandatory, assess potential misuse applications of your research and document mitigations
- **Support open science** - Publish preprints, share data, release code; advocate for institutional open-access policies
- **Mentor diverse students** - Actively recruit and support students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM research

### In Your Professional Community

- **Participate in standards development** - NIST, IEEE, and ISO standards processes need technical expert input to avoid industry capture
- **Engage with policymakers** - Testify before Congress, brief congressional staff, participate in National Academies studies
- **Publish policy-relevant research** - Write for accessible audiences, not just specialist journals; submit op-eds to major outlets
- **Join professional society policy committees** - AAAS, ACM, IEEE, ASM, and other societies shape policy positions

### Advocate for Reform

- **Support NAIRR full funding** - Sign academic letters, write to congressional appropriators, testify about compute access challenges
- **Advocate for grant reform** - Push NSF and NIH to fund more high-risk research, reduce bureaucratic burden, support young investigators
- **Champion technology transfer reform** - Advocate for march-in rights enforcement, open licensing, and streamlined CRADA processes
- **Support visa reform for researchers** - Share stories of talented international colleagues lost to immigration barriers

## For Technology Industry Professionals

### Within Your Company

- **Advocate for responsible research practices** - Push for internal dual-use assessments, safety testing, and transparency
- **Support public-interest research** - Encourage your company to partner with academic institutions and share compute resources
- **Participate in government engagement** - Provide technical expertise to agencies developing emerging technology policy
- **Whistleblower protections** - If you observe unsafe research practices or policy violations, use available channels; support strengthening whistleblower protections

### Industry-Wide

- **Support meaningful regulation** - Push back against industry lobbying positions that oppose all governance; advocate for smart, risk-based regulation
- **Engage with export control processes** - Provide technical input on which controls are effective and which are counterproductive
- **Fund open-source research** - Support open foundation models, open datasets, and public research infrastructure
- **Participate in workforce development** - Partner with community colleges and MSIs to train next-generation researchers and technicians

## For State and Local Officials

### State-Level Actions

- **Invest in research infrastructure** - State matching funds for federal research programs increase competitiveness for grants
- **Workforce development** - Fund semiconductor and AI training programs at community colleges, especially near new manufacturing facilities
- **Biosafety oversight** - Strengthen state-level oversight of high-containment research facilities
- **Research ethics boards** - Create state-level advisory boards on emerging technology research with public participation

### Local-Level Actions

- **Support STEM education** - Fund K-12 STEM programs, science fairs, and maker spaces
- **Engage with research facilities** - Ensure community input on siting of new research facilities and laboratories
- **Economic development** - Pursue Regional Technology Hub designations and related federal programs
- **Public engagement** - Host community forums on local emerging technology research and its implications

---

## For Educators

### K-12

- **Integrate emerging technology into curriculum** - Teach about AI, biotechnology, and quantum computing at age-appropriate levels
- **Build critical thinking** - Help students evaluate technology claims, understand dual-use concerns, and think about governance
- **Expose students to research careers** - Partner with local universities and national labs for student visits and mentorship
- **Address equity** - Ensure STEM education quality is not determined by zip code; advocate for equitable resource allocation

### Higher Education

- **Reform graduate programs** - Advocate for shorter PhD timelines, better stipends, and career flexibility
- **Expand research opportunities** - Create undergraduate research positions, especially at MSIs
- **Teach responsible innovation** - Include ethics, policy, and societal impact in STEM curricula
- **Build interdisciplinary programs** - Combine STEM with policy, law, and social science to train the next generation of technology governance professionals
