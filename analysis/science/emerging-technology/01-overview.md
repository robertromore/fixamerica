# Emerging Technology Research: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States faces a defining challenge in governing emerging technology research across artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, and other frontier domains. Federal research agencies such as DARPA, ARPA-H, NSF, and DOE have historically driven breakthrough innovations, but the current governance framework struggles to keep pace with the speed, scale, and dual-use implications of modern technology research. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorized landmark investments, yet appropriations have lagged behind authorizations, and coordination across agencies remains fragmented. Meanwhile, strategic competitors--particularly China--are making massive, centralized investments in the same technologies. The stakes extend beyond economic competitiveness to encompass national security, public health, democratic governance, and the future of scientific discovery itself.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **AI research policy** - Federal investment in AI research, the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR), open vs. proprietary development, and the role of agencies such as DARPA and ARPA-H
- **Quantum computing** - National Quantum Initiative, quantum networking, post-quantum cryptography, and government-industry-academic partnerships
- **Biotechnology and synthetic biology** - Biosafety governance, gain-of-function research, biomanufacturing, and the Bioeconomy Executive Order
- **Governance of emerging research** - Dual-use research oversight, technology transfer, export controls, and institutional review mechanisms
- **CHIPS Act provisions** - Semiconductor R&D funding, the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), and advanced packaging programs
- **Cross-cutting issues** - Workforce development, international collaboration, intellectual property, and ethics review

## Key Questions

1. How should the federal government structure and fund emerging technology research to maintain strategic competitiveness?
2. What governance frameworks can adequately address dual-use risks in AI, biotech, and quantum computing without stifling innovation?
3. How can the National AI Research Resource democratize access to AI infrastructure beyond well-funded corporate labs?
4. What reforms are needed in technology transfer and export control regimes to protect national security while preserving scientific openness?
5. How should gain-of-function and synthetic biology research be governed to prevent catastrophic biosafety failures?
6. What role should DARPA-style agencies play in directing research priorities, and how should their mandates evolve?
7. How can the US build the workforce pipeline needed for quantum computing, advanced semiconductors, and biotechnology?

## Current State Summary

The emerging technology research landscape as of early 2026:

**Federal investment:**

- CHIPS Act semiconductor manufacturing incentives being disbursed, but R&D titles significantly under-appropriated
- ARPA-H operational with initial project portfolio in health breakthroughs
- National Quantum Initiative reauthorized through 2028
- NAIRR pilot launched with limited scope relative to original vision
- DARPA continues advanced research across AI, biotech, microelectronics, and hypersonics

**Governance gaps:**

- No unified framework for dual-use emerging technology oversight
- Export controls on AI chips and quantum technology contested by industry
- Gain-of-function research oversight reformed post-pandemic but still debated
- Technology transfer from federal labs remains slow and fragmented
- Interagency coordination on emerging tech scattered across OSTP, NSC, and agency-level offices

**Key tensions:**

- Open science vs. national security classification
- Industrial policy vs. market-driven innovation
- Speed of deployment vs. safety assessment
- International collaboration vs. technology protection
- Public investment vs. private capture of benefits

## The Stakes

**If emerging technology research is well-governed:**

- US maintains strategic leadership in critical technologies
- Breakthrough discoveries broadly benefit public welfare
- Dual-use risks are identified and mitigated before harm
- Diverse research community produces more robust innovation
- International partnerships strengthen collective security

**If governance fails:**

- Strategic competitors surpass the US in critical domains
- Private capture of publicly funded research deepens inequality
- Biosafety or AI safety failures cause catastrophic harm
- Talent pipeline collapses due to inadequate investment
- Export controls fail, enabling adversary capability development

## Reform Approaches

| Approach | Proponents | Key Features |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **DARPA-scale expansion** | Defense hawks, innovation advocates | New ARPA agencies, expanded mission-driven research |
| **Public research infrastructure** | Progressives, academic community | NAIRR at full scale, open-access computing, public data commons |
| **Strategic industrial policy** | Bipartisan CHIPS supporters | Government-industry partnerships, domestic supply chain investment |
| **Deregulatory innovation** | Libertarians, industry groups | Remove export controls, reduce oversight, let markets direct research |
| **Safety-first governance** | AI safety community, biosecurity experts | Mandatory risk assessments, dual-use review boards, international treaties |
| **Workforce-centered** | Education advocates, labor groups | Training pipeline investment, immigration reform for STEM talent |
