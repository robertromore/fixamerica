# Emerging Technology Research: Opposition

## Overview

Efforts to reform emerging technology research governance face opposition from multiple directions. Some oppose increased government involvement, others resist specific oversight mechanisms, and still others object to the distribution of costs and benefits. Understanding these opposition dynamics is essential for designing reforms that can survive political resistance.

## Industry Opposition to Regulation

### Large Technology Companies

**What they oppose:**

- Mandatory safety testing and reporting requirements for AI systems
- Export controls on AI chips and models (particularly NVIDIA, AMD)
- Government-mandated open-source requirements for publicly funded AI research
- Dual-use research oversight that extends to privately funded work
- Data-sharing mandates that could reveal proprietary methods

**Arguments used:**

- Regulation will drive innovation overseas
- The US will fall behind China if burdened by compliance costs
- Industry self-regulation is more effective and adaptive than government mandates
- Premature regulation will lock in inferior approaches
- Compliance costs disproportionately burden smaller companies

**Tactics:**

- Lobbying: Tech industry spent $69+ million on federal lobbying in 2024, with AI governance a top priority
- Revolving door: Former OSTP and agency officials move to industry advisory roles
- Standards capture: Industry representatives dominate technical standards committees
- Preemptive self-regulation: Voluntary commitments designed to forestall binding rules
- Narrative control: Frame any regulation as "anti-innovation" regardless of content
- Coalition building: Fund think tanks and academic centers sympathetic to industry positions

**Underlying interests:**

- Protect competitive position and profit margins
- Avoid liability for harms caused by AI systems
- Maintain control of compute infrastructure and data
- Prevent disclosure of training data sourcing practices

### Semiconductor Industry

**What they oppose:**

- CHIPS Act guardrails restricting China-related investment
- Environmental and labor requirements attached to manufacturing incentives
- Reporting requirements perceived as disclosing competitive information
- Technology transfer mandates for publicly funded chip R&D

**Arguments used:**

- Guardrails make US incentives less competitive than foreign subsidies
- Environmental compliance delays facility construction
- Reporting requirements expose trade secrets
- Market should determine chip architecture investments

### Biotech and Pharmaceutical Industry

**What they oppose:**

- Expanded gain-of-function oversight extending beyond federally funded research
- Gene synthesis screening mandates
- Open-access requirements for publicly funded biotech research
- Broader biosafety regulation of private labs and startups

**Arguments used:**

- Oversight slows life-saving research
- Regulation will push research to less regulated countries
- Industry screening is already adequate
- Small biotech companies cannot absorb compliance costs

## Opposition to Increased Federal Spending

### Fiscal Conservatives

**What they oppose:**

- Fully appropriating CHIPS Act R&D authorizations
- Expanding NAIRR beyond pilot phase
- New ARPA-style agencies (ARPA-H, proposed ARPA-C for climate)
- Increased NSF and DOE research budgets

**Arguments used:**

- Federal deficit and debt make new spending irresponsible
- Government picks losers; markets allocate research investment more efficiently
- Historical examples of failed government technology programs (Solyndra)
- R&D tax credits are more efficient than direct spending

**Underlying interests:**

- Ideological opposition to expanded government
- Prioritize tax cuts over discretionary spending
- Skepticism of government competence in technology direction

### Small-Government Advocates

**What they oppose:**

- New federal agencies or offices for technology governance
- Federal research mandates on universities and companies
- Government-directed research priorities (industrial policy)
- Expansion of federal research workforce

**Arguments used:**

- DARPA's success is the exception, not the model for government research
- Market signals are better than bureaucratic judgment
- Federal research spending crowds out private investment
- Government technology programs are vulnerable to political distortion

## Opposition to Dual-Use Oversight

### Research Community Resistance

**What they oppose:**

- Pre-registration requirements for potentially dangerous research
- Expanded Institutional Review Board (IRB) or IBC authority over emerging technology research
- Government review of research proposals before funding
- Restrictions on publication of dual-use research findings

**Arguments used:**

- Scientific freedom is essential for progress
- Oversight slows research and creates bureaucratic burden
- Scientists are the best judges of research risk
- Restrictions on publication undermine peer review and reproducibility

**Underlying interests:**

- Professional autonomy and prestige
- Publication pressure ("publish or perish")
- Concern that oversight committees lack technical expertise
- Fear of precedent for broader government control of research content

### National Security Hawks

A distinct group opposes dual-use oversight for different reasons:

**What they oppose:**

- Transparency requirements for defense-adjacent research
- International collaboration on sensitive technologies
- Open-source mandates for government-funded AI research
- Public reporting on classified research programs

**Arguments used:**

- Transparency aids adversaries
- Open science in strategic domains is naive
- Classification is necessary for national security
- Allied sharing frameworks already exist

**Underlying interests:**

- Maintain information advantage over strategic competitors
- Protect defense industry positions
- Preserve intelligence community equities

## Opposition to Workforce Reforms

### Immigration Restrictionists

**What they oppose:**

- Expanding H-1B visas for STEM researchers
- Green card reform for STEM PhD holders
- International student recruitment incentives
- Visa pathways for foreign researchers at national labs

**Arguments used:**

- Foreign researchers displace American workers
- STEM shortage is exaggerated by industry seeking cheaper labor
- National security risks from foreign nationals in sensitive research
- Immigration reform should not be tied to technology policy

**Underlying interests:**

- Broader opposition to immigration
- Wage competition concerns for existing STEM workers
- National security concerns (some legitimate, some pretextual)

### Higher Education Skeptics

**What they oppose:**

- Increased federal funding for graduate research programs
- University overhead rate reforms
- New federal research fellowships and scholarships
- STEM education mandates or standards

**Arguments used:**

- Universities waste federal research funding on overhead
- Graduate programs produce more PhDs than the market needs
- Higher education has a political bias that affects research
- Private sector training is more efficient

## Opposition to Open Science and Access

### Intellectual Property Advocates

**What they oppose:**

- Open-access mandates for federally funded research publications
- Compulsory licensing of taxpayer-funded inventions
- March-in rights enforcement under Bayh-Dole
- Open-source requirements for government-funded software

**Arguments used:**

- Patent protection incentivizes technology transfer
- Open access undermines publisher sustainability
- Compulsory licensing deters private investment in commercialization
- Bayh-Dole system has been enormously successful

**Underlying interests:**

- University technology licensing office revenue
- Academic publisher business models
- Corporate licensing arrangements
- Patent attorney practices

### Universities (on Technology Transfer)

Universities have a complex relationship with reform--they advocate for increased research funding but resist changes to technology transfer that might reduce licensing revenue:

- Oppose march-in rights enforcement
- Resist transparency requirements for licensing agreements
- Lobby against caps on overhead rates
- Defend exclusive licensing even when it limits public access

## Opposition Dynamics and Coalitions

### Industry-Conservative Alliance

Technology companies and fiscal conservatives find common ground opposing:

- New regulatory agencies
- Mandatory compliance frameworks
- Increased government direction of research

*This alliance is unstable*: Industry supports government R&D funding and immigration reform that fiscal conservatives oppose.

### Bipartisan Security Consensus Against Openness

National security hawks from both parties align against:

- Open-source AI mandates
- International research collaboration in sensitive domains
- Transparency in defense-funded research

*This consensus overrides* normal partisan divisions on science policy.

### Researcher-Industry Alliance Against Oversight

Academic researchers and industry find common cause opposing:

- Dual-use research restrictions
- Pre-publication review
- Expanded biosafety regulation

*This alliance is fragile*: Researchers and industry have opposing interests on funding levels, open access, and technology transfer.

## Strategies for Overcoming Opposition

| Opposition Source | Productive Response | Counter-Productive Response |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Industry anti-regulation | Tiered requirements, performance standards | Blanket mandates, prescriptive rules |
| Fiscal conservatives | Demonstrate ROI, sunset provisions | Open-ended authorizations |
| Research community | Researcher-designed oversight, reduced bureaucracy | Top-down mandates without expert input |
| Security hawks | Classified annex, allied sharing | Public disclosure of sensitive details |
| Immigration restrictionists | Security vetting improvements, domestic pipeline | Ignore national security concerns |
| IP advocates | Balanced licensing, public benefit sharing | Eliminate patents for federally funded work |
