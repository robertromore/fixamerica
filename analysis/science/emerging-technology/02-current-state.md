# Emerging Technology Research: Current State

## Federal Research Agency Landscape

### DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)

DARPA remains the premier model for high-risk, high-reward research investment. With an annual budget of approximately $4.1 billion, DARPA operates through program managers with significant autonomy to pursue breakthrough capabilities.

**Current priority areas:**

- **AI Next Campaign** - Third wave AI emphasizing contextual reasoning and adversarial resilience
- **Microsystems Technology Office** - Advanced chip architectures, heterogeneous integration, and post-Moore computing
- **Biological Technologies Office** - Synthetic biology, pandemic preparedness, and bio-manufacturing
- **Electronics Resurgence Initiative** - Next-generation circuit design tools and materials
- **Quantum computing programs** - Including the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative and quantum networking

**Challenges:**

- Program manager tenure (3-5 years) creates continuity gaps
- Increasing difficulty attracting talent from private-sector AI labs offering significantly higher compensation
- Growing classification barriers impede technology transition to civilian applications
- Congressional earmarking pressures conflict with agency mission

### ARPA-H (Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health)

Established in 2022 and headquartered in Dallas, ARPA-H applies the DARPA model to health research with initial focus areas:

- **PROACTIVE** - Preemptive tools for cancer detection
- **PARADIGM** - Precision immunology platforms
- **RESILIENT** - Pandemic readiness and rapid-response therapeutics
- **UPGRADE** - Gene editing delivery systems

ARPA-H received $2.5 billion in FY2024 but faces institutional challenges including defining its relationship with NIH, recruiting program managers, and establishing evaluation metrics distinct from traditional biomedical research.

### NSF and the NAIRR

The National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot launched in January 2024, providing researchers at academic institutions access to computational resources, datasets, and AI tools. As of early 2026:

- 35+ institutions participating in the pilot
- Access to cloud computing through partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and others
- Limited scale relative to original NAIRR Task Force vision of $2.6 billion over six years
- Significant unmet demand from researchers at minority-serving institutions and smaller universities

NSF also administers the National AI Research Institutes, a network of 25 multi-institutional centers focusing on areas from trustworthy AI to AI for agriculture.

### DOE National Laboratories

The Department of Energy's 17 national laboratories represent a critical but underappreciated emerging technology research asset:

- **Exascale computing** - Frontier (Oak Ridge) and Aurora (Argonne) systems among world's most powerful
- **Quantum research** - Five DOE Quantum Information Science Research Centers
- **Materials science** - Advanced materials for semiconductors and energy storage
- **AI for science** - Machine learning applications to physics, chemistry, and climate modeling

Technology transfer from DOE labs remains slow, with an average of 7+ years from discovery to commercial application.

## Quantum Computing

### National Quantum Initiative (NQI)

Reauthorized through 2028, the NQI coordinates quantum research across agencies:

| Agency | Role | Key Programs |
|--------|------|--------------|
| NSF | Fundamental research | Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes |
| DOE | Hardware and networking | QIS Research Centers |
| NIST | Standards and metrology | Quantum Economic Development Consortium |
| DOD | Defense applications | Quantum computing programs via DARPA, NSA |

**Current state of quantum hardware:**

- IBM, Google, and IonQ among US leaders in superconducting and trapped-ion systems
- Logical qubit milestones being reached but fault-tolerant quantum computing remains years away
- Quantum networking prototypes demonstrated over short distances
- Post-quantum cryptography standards published by NIST in 2024

**Concerns:**

- China's reported investments in quantum technology exceed $15 billion
- Talent pipeline insufficient for projected workforce needs
- Private investment concentrated in a few large companies
- Unclear timeline for quantum advantage in practical applications

### Post-Quantum Cryptography

NIST finalized four post-quantum cryptographic algorithms in 2024 (CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, SPHINCS+). Federal agencies face migration deadlines, but:

- Legacy system migration is enormously complex
- Many critical infrastructure systems lack upgrade paths
- Private sector adoption is uneven
- "Harvest now, decrypt later" attacks are an ongoing threat

## Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology

### Current Governance

Biotechnology research governance relies on a patchwork of oversight mechanisms:

- **NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules** - Voluntary for non-federally funded research
- **Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs)** - Variable quality and enforcement across institutions
- **Select Agent Program** (CDC/APHIS) - Regulates possession and use of dangerous pathogens
- **Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC)** policy - Revised in 2024 but applies only to federally funded research
- **Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogen (ePPP)** framework - Strengthened post-COVID but criticized as inadequate

### Synthetic Biology Advances

- Gene synthesis costs have fallen below $0.10 per base pair
- CRISPR-based tools enable increasingly precise genome editing
- AI-assisted protein design (following AlphaFold) accelerates drug discovery
- Biomanufacturing capacity growing through BioMADE and related initiatives
- DIY biology community expanding with limited regulatory oversight

### Biosafety Concerns

| Risk Category | Current Mitigation | Adequacy |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| Lab accidents | BSL classifications, IBC review | Inconsistent enforcement |
| Dual-use research | DURC/ePPP policies | Limited to federally funded work |
| Gene synthesis screening | Voluntary industry guidelines | Incomplete coverage |
| AI-enabled bioweapons design | No specific governance | Major gap |
| Environmental release | EPA/USDA oversight for GMOs | Framework outdated |

## CHIPS Act Implementation

### Semiconductor Manufacturing

The CHIPS Act's $52.7 billion in manufacturing incentives is being disbursed through the Commerce Department's CHIPS Program Office:

- **Major awards announced** - Intel ($8.5B), TSMC ($6.6B), Samsung ($6.4B), Micron ($6.1B)
- **New fabrication facilities** - Under construction in Arizona, Ohio, Texas, New York
- **Timeline concerns** - Most facilities not operational until 2027-2029
- **Workforce gap** - Industry projects 67,000 additional workers needed by 2030

### R&D Provisions

The CHIPS Act's R&D provisions have been significantly under-appropriated:

| Authorized Program | Authorized Amount | Appropriated (through FY2025) |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| NSF Technology Directorate | $20B over 5 years | ~$3.5B |
| DOE research programs | $16.9B over 5 years | ~$4B |
| NIST research programs | $6.3B over 5 years | ~$1.8B |
| Regional tech hubs | $10B over 5 years | ~$500M |
| STEM education programs | $13.2B over 5 years | ~$2.1B |

The gap between authorization and appropriation represents one of the most significant failures in US science policy.
