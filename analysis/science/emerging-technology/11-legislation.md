# Emerging Technology Research: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Governing emerging technology research requires legislation that addresses institutional coordination, dual-use risk oversight, public research infrastructure, and workforce development. This document provides draft legislation for two federal bills--the National Emerging Technology Research Coordination Act and the Emerging Technology Research Safety Act--along with state model legislation and regulatory frameworks. The legislative approach balances innovation promotion with safety governance, drawing on the DARPA model's success while addressing its governance gaps.

## Federal Legislation

### National Emerging Technology Research Coordination Act

**Purpose**: Establish a permanent coordination office for emerging technology research across the federal government, authorize full funding for the National AI Research Resource, and modernize technology transfer from federal laboratories.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "National Emerging Technology Research
Coordination Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) the United States faces strategic competition in artificial
    intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, advanced
    semiconductors, and other emerging technologies;
    (2) federal emerging technology research is fragmented across
    more than 20 agencies with no authoritative coordination
    mechanism;
    (3) the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorized critical
    research investments that remain significantly under-
    appropriated;
    (4) access to computational resources for AI research is
    increasingly concentrated in a small number of private
    companies, disadvantaging academic and public-interest
    researchers;
    (5) technology transfer from federal laboratories to public
    benefit is slow and inefficient;
    (6) the United States must coordinate emerging technology
    research strategy to maintain innovation leadership while
    ensuring public safety; and
    (7) a permanent, statutory coordination mechanism is necessary
    to sustain coherent research strategy across presidential
    administrations.

```

**Explanation**: This bill addresses three interconnected problems: fragmented governance, concentrated AI research infrastructure, and slow technology transfer. NETCO provides durable coordination through a term-protected director with statutory authority, avoiding the fragility of executive orders. The NAIRR provisions implement the NAIRR Task Force recommendations with full funding authorization. Technology transfer reforms target the specific bottlenecks identified in DOE Inspector General and GAO reports. The march-in rights clarification addresses decades of non-enforcement without eliminating the patent incentive structure.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Turf battles from agencies whose coordination NETCO would oversee
- Appropriations committees may resist multi-year funding commitments
- Technology industry may oppose open-licensing requirements for NAIRR-supported models
- OMB may resist placing a new coordination office in the EOP with statutory independence

**Refinements**:

- NETCO's budget coordination role could be advisory rather than directive to reduce agency resistance
- NAIRR open-licensing requirements could include time-delayed release provisions
- Technology Translation Fund could require private-sector matching to reduce fiscal objections
- NETCO sunset provision reassures those concerned about bureaucratic growth

### Emerging Technology Research Safety Act

**Purpose**: Establish a comprehensive framework for governing dual-use risks in emerging technology research, including mandatory biosafety oversight, AI capability assessments, and gene synthesis screening.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Emerging Technology Research Safety
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) emerging technology research in artificial intelligence,
    biotechnology, and other domains poses dual-use risks that
    current governance frameworks inadequately address;
    (2) existing biosafety oversight applies only to federally
    funded research, leaving privately funded dual-use research
    ungoverned;
    (3) advances in gene synthesis technology enable the creation
    of dangerous pathogens with decreasing cost and expertise
    barriers;
    (4) AI systems can increasingly assist in the design of
    biological, chemical, and cyber weapons;
    (5) current Institutional Biosafety Committees vary widely in
    quality, independence, and enforcement;
    (6) the voluntary nature of dual-use research oversight
    creates gaps that could be exploited or result in accidental
    harm;
    (7) the United States has a compelling interest in ensuring
    that emerging technology research does not create catastrophic
    risks; and
    (8) a risk-based oversight framework can protect safety
    without unreasonably burdening beneficial research.

```

**Explanation**: This bill fills the most critical gap in emerging technology research governance: the absence of mandatory, universal oversight for dual-use research regardless of funding source. The three-pillar approach (research review, gene synthesis screening, AI capability assessment) addresses the highest-risk vectors identified by biosecurity and AI safety experts. The independent board structure insulates oversight from political interference while ensuring diverse expertise. The tiered enforcement regime (civil penalties for negligence, criminal penalties for willful creation of catastrophic risk) calibrates consequences to culpability. The whistleblower provisions address the documented pattern of institutional pressure to minimize safety concerns.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Research community resistance to mandatory pre-approval for dual-use research
- First Amendment concerns regarding restrictions on research and publication
- Private sector opposition to AI capability assessment requirements
- International gene synthesis providers may undercut US screening requirements
- Board confirmation process may be slow or politicized
- Defining "dual-use research of concern" broadly enough to be useful without capturing too much low-risk research

**Refinements**:

- Expedited review tracks for lower-risk categories of dual-use research
- Safe harbor provisions for institutions with demonstrated strong internal oversight
- Phase-in periods allowing covered entities time to develop compliance capacity
- International cooperation provisions to prevent regulatory arbitrage
- Regular review and update of category definitions as technology evolves

Violations are subject to civil penalties of up to $[50,000] per
violation per day and facility closure orders for imminent danger.

SECTION 8. RELATIONSHIP TO FEDERAL LAW.

This Act supplements and does not preempt federal biosafety
requirements.

SECTION 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect [date].
```

**Explanation**: This model act fills the gap left by federal biosafety oversight, which primarily governs federally funded research. State-level registration, inspection, and community notification requirements ensure local accountability for high-containment facilities regardless of funding source.

**Adaptations**: States with existing environmental or public health agency infrastructure may assign oversight to existing agencies. States with large research university systems may need to negotiate implementation timelines.

**Draft Regulation**: OSTP directive requiring all federal agencies funding emerging technology research to:

1. Include dual-use risk assessments in grant applications for designated research categories
2. Require principal investigators to complete dual-use awareness training
3. Report annually to NETCO on the volume and outcomes of dual-use reviews
4. Implement standardized risk assessment tools developed by NETCO

### Commerce Department Export Control Modernization

**Existing Authority**: Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774.

**Draft Regulation**: Revise EAR to:

1. Create a "Trusted Researcher" designation for foreign nationals at allied-nation institutions conducting fundamental research
2. Streamline licensing for technology exports to AUKUS and Quad partner nations
3. Establish expedited review for academic exchanges in non-sensitive emerging technology areas
4. Require annual review and sunset of entity list designations older than 5 years

### NSF NAIRR Operating Regulations

**Existing Authority**: National AI Initiative Act of 2020; proposed NAIRR authorization.

**Draft Regulation**: NSF regulations governing NAIRR operations, including:

1. Merit review criteria for compute allocation
2. Privacy standards for shared datasets
3. Open-licensing requirements for NAIRR-supported models
4. Reporting requirements for NAIRR-funded research
5. Priority allocation criteria for MSIs and under-resourced institutions

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Commerce Clause** | Research safety regulation falls within federal commerce power, particularly for activities with interstate effects |
| **First Amendment** | Research restrictions must be content-neutral and narrowly tailored; the government interest in preventing catastrophic harm is compelling |
| **Due Process** | Board review process includes notice, hearing, and appeal provisions satisfying procedural due process |
| **Takings** | Regulatory requirements that reduce research value may raise takings concerns; designed to avoid per se takings |
| **Non-delegation** | Board's authority to designate research categories and AI thresholds must include intelligible principles |

### Preemption Questions

- Federal legislation establishes a floor, not a ceiling, preserving state authority
- State biosafety requirements supplement federal oversight
- Export control authority remains exclusively federal
- Gene synthesis screening preempts conflicting state requirements to ensure uniformity

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- Board administrative enforcement through inspections and penalties
- DOJ criminal enforcement for willful violations
- Whistleblower protections with private right of action
- State attorneys general enforcement of state-level provisions
- International coordination for cross-border enforcement

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- NETCO: 10-year sunset with GAO review
- Board research categories: biennial review and update
- AI capability thresholds: annual review as technology evolves
- Gene synthesis screening database: quarterly updates

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### National Emerging Technology Research Coordination Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Advisory-only coordination | Agencies may ignore NETCO recommendations since coordination is not mandatory compliance | High |
| NAIRR eligibility gaming | Well-funded institutions may create affiliates to access priority allocation for under-resourced entities | Medium |
| Open-licensing workaround | Researchers may conduct preliminary work on NAIRR, then develop commercially on private infrastructure to avoid licensing requirements | Medium |
| Technology transfer delay | 90-day CRADA target is not enforceable; agencies may claim "complexity" exceptions | Medium |
| March-in rights guidance | Guidance without enforcement mechanism may be as ineffective as current non-enforcement | High |
| Sunset manipulation | Opponents may allow NETCO sunset without reauthorization, eliminating coordination | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No budget authority | NETCO coordinates but cannot direct agency spending | EOP offices traditionally lack budget authority |
| NAIRR scale insufficient | $2.6B over 6 years is modest relative to private compute investment | Fiscal constraints limit public investment |
| Technology transfer culture | Process reforms cannot override institutional resistance to change | Deep cultural norms in federal labs and universities |
| Appropriations dependence | NAIRR and technology transfer depend on annual appropriations | Structural features of congressional budget process |
| MSI capacity constraints | Priority access to NAIRR is useless if MSIs lack faculty and students to utilize resources | Broader systemic inequity in higher education |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen NETCO authority** by requiring agencies to respond formally to NETCO recommendations and report disagreements to Congress
2. **Anti-gaming provisions** requiring NAIRR applicants to certify institutional resource levels and imposing penalties for misrepresentation
3. **Open-licensing duration** requiring open licensing for models whose development relied on NAIRR resources at any stage, with a reasonable commercial transition period
4. **Enforceable CRADA timelines** with automatic approval if agencies exceed 90-day processing deadline
5. **March-in rights exercise** mandating that NIST initiate march-in proceedings upon petition meeting specified criteria
6. **Advance appropriations** for NAIRR to reduce annual appropriations uncertainty

### Emerging Technology Research Safety Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Offshore research | Entities may conduct dual-use research outside US jurisdiction to avoid Board oversight | Critical |
| Definition narrowness | Precise categories of dual-use research of concern may miss novel risk vectors | High |
| AI threshold gaming | Developers may keep systems just below capability thresholds or misrepresent capabilities | High |
| Gene synthesis workaround | International providers not subject to US screening may fulfill orders for US-based customers | Critical |
| Board capture | Industry and academic interests may dominate Board appointments over time | Medium |
| Exemption abuse | Institutions with "strong internal oversight" exemptions may not maintain standards after initial certification | Medium |
| Publication restrictions | Board may interpret authority to include pre-publication review, chilling research | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Limited international reach | US-only regulation cannot govern global research activity | Sovereignty constraints |
| Review timeline pressure | 60-day review may be insufficient for complex dual-use assessments | Need to balance thoroughness with speed |
| AI threshold obsolescence | Rapidly advancing AI capabilities may outpace threshold definitions | Pace of technology change |
| Board expertise shortage | Qualified experts for all relevant domains may be difficult to recruit | Small expert pool |
| Research community resistance | Mandatory oversight may drive researchers away from federally regulated institutions | Cultural norms of scientific autonomy |
| Enforcement resource constraints | Board budget may be inadequate for inspections across all covered entities | Fiscal limits |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Extraterritorial provisions** extending jurisdiction to research conducted by US persons or entities abroad, and to research using US-origin materials, equipment, or data
2. **Adaptive categories** empowering the Board to designate new categories of concern through expedited rulemaking with 30-day public comment
3. **Functional AI thresholds** based on demonstrated capabilities (not just compute metrics) assessed through standardized benchmarks
4. **International gene synthesis agreements** requiring screening as a condition of US market access for foreign providers
5. **Board independence protections** including restrictions on members' prior and subsequent industry employment
6. **Continuous certification** requiring institutions with exemptions to undergo annual re-certification with unannounced inspections
7. **Explicit limitation** on Board authority stating it may not restrict publication of research findings except to redact specific technical details enabling direct misuse

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Regulatory arbitrage across jurisdictions | International cooperation agreements with mutual recognition |
| Compliance burden on small entities | Tiered requirements with simplified processes for small labs and startups |
| Technology outpacing governance | Annual Board review of categories, thresholds, and procedures |
| Political interference with Board | Term protections, bipartisan requirements, removal only for cause |
| Resource competition with existing agencies | Dedicated appropriations; no raiding of existing research budgets |
| Interagency conflict between Board and NETCO | Clear jurisdictional boundaries; Board focuses on safety, NETCO on coordination |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- NETCO undergoes GAO review at year 10 with congressional reauthorization required
- Board research categories reviewed biennially with public comment
- AI capability thresholds reviewed annually with technical advisory input
- Gene synthesis screening database updated quarterly
- Overall legislative framework reviewed by Congress every 5 years
- Independent evaluation of NAIRR impact and governance at year 5
