# Emerging Technology Research: Root Causes

## Why the US Struggles to Govern Emerging Technology Research

The United States has produced more breakthrough technologies than any other nation, yet consistently fails to govern the research process in ways that maximize public benefit and minimize catastrophic risk. The root causes of this failure are structural, institutional, and political.

## Structural Causes

### 1. Fragmented Federal Research Governance

No single entity coordinates emerging technology research across the federal government. Responsibility is scattered across dozens of agencies:

| Domain | Primary Agencies | Coordination Gap |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| AI research | NSF, DARPA, DOE, NIST, NIH | No lead agency; OSTP advisory only |
| Quantum computing | DOE, NSF, NIST, DOD | NQI provides framework but limited authority |
| Biotechnology | NIH, BARDA, DARPA, USDA, EPA | No unified biosafety authority |
| Semiconductors | Commerce (CHIPS), DARPA, DOE | CHIPS Program Office temporary |
| Dual-use oversight | Multiple | OSTP guidance, no enforcement |

The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is designed to coordinate but lacks budget authority, regulatory power, or statutory mandate to compel agency action. The result is duplicated efforts, missed synergies, and governance gaps.

### 2. Authorization-Appropriation Gap

Congress routinely authorizes ambitious research programs but fails to appropriate the funding. The CHIPS and Science Act exemplifies this pattern:

- Authorized over $170 billion in R&D across agencies
- Appropriations through FY2025 covered roughly 20-25% of authorized levels
- NSF's TIP Directorate received a fraction of its authorized budget
- Regional Technology Hubs funded at ~5% of authorization

This gap undermines program design, prevents long-term planning, and signals unreliability to researchers and institutions.

### 3. Short Political Cycles vs. Long Research Timelines

Emerging technology research operates on timescales of 5-20 years for basic research to reach application. Political incentives operate on 2-4 year election cycles:

- **Administrations** reverse predecessors' science priorities (EO 14110 on AI issued 2023, future uncertain)
- **Congressional authorizations** expire before programs mature
- **Agency leadership** turns over with administrations, disrupting institutional knowledge
- **Budget uncertainty** prevents multi-year commitments essential for research programs

### 4. Private Sector Research Dominance

The private sector now funds approximately 75% of US R&D, fundamentally altering the research landscape:

- **Corporate labs** (Google DeepMind, Microsoft Research, Meta FAIR) attract top AI talent with compensation federal agencies cannot match
- **Venture capital** shapes research priorities toward commercially viable applications
- **Proprietary research** reduces knowledge sharing that historically accelerated progress
- **Concentration** - A handful of companies control the compute infrastructure needed for frontier AI research
- **Misaligned incentives** - Profit-driven research neglects public goods like safety, equity, and long-term risks

## Institutional Causes

### 5. Technology Transfer Failures

The system for moving discoveries from federal labs and universities to public benefit is broken:

- **Bayh-Dole distortions** - Universities optimize for licensing revenue rather than broad public access
- **National lab bureaucracy** - DOE CRADA (Cooperative Research and Development Agreement) process averages 12+ months
- **Patent thickets** - Overlapping IP claims block downstream innovation
- **Valley of death** - Gap between basic research funding and commercial viability lacks adequate bridge programs
- **March-in rights** never exercised - Government retains but has never used rights to require licensing of taxpayer-funded inventions

### 6. Inadequate Dual-Use Research Oversight

Governance of research with both beneficial and harmful applications is structurally weak:

- **Voluntary compliance** - NIH guidelines apply only to federally funded research
- **Institutional Biosafety Committees** - Quality varies enormously; conflicts of interest common
- **No regulatory authority** - No federal agency has clear statutory authority to regulate dangerous research regardless of funding source
- **Classification overreach** - Legitimate dual-use governance is conflated with excessive secrecy
- **Emerging risks unaddressed** - AI-enabled bioweapon design, quantum code-breaking, and autonomous weapons lack specific governance

### 7. Workforce Pipeline Dysfunction

The US cannot produce enough researchers in critical emerging technology fields:

- **Graduate education model** outdated - PhD programs take 5-7 years, discouraging many candidates
- **Compensation gap** - Federal research positions pay 30-60% less than private sector equivalents
- **Immigration barriers** - H-1B caps and green card backlogs lose trained researchers to competitor nations
- **Diversity failures** - Women, Black, Hispanic, and Native American researchers significantly underrepresented in STEM
- **K-12 pipeline** - Uneven STEM education quality creates geographic and socioeconomic disparities

### 8. Risk-Averse Funding Culture

Despite DARPA's success, most federal research funding is conservative:

- **Peer review bias** - NIH and NSF review panels favor incremental over transformative research
- **Success rate decline** - NIH grant success rates fell from ~30% (2000) to ~20% (2024), encouraging conservative proposals
- **Young investigator disadvantage** - Average age of first R01 grant is 43, suppressing fresh approaches
- **Metrics misalignment** - Publications and citations reward quantity over breakthrough potential
- **Fear of failure** - Congressional scrutiny of "wasted" research spending chills ambitious programs

## Political Causes

### 9. Partisan Polarization of Science Policy

Science policy has become increasingly partisan:

- **Climate science politicization** spills over into broader distrust of government research
- **COVID-era conflicts** undermined public confidence in scientific institutions
- **Culture war dynamics** target specific research areas (gender studies, DEI in STEM)
- **Anti-government sentiment** opposes expanded federal research investment
- **Industry lobbying** frames regulation as anti-innovation

### 10. Regulatory Capture and Industry Influence

The revolving door between government and industry shapes research governance:

- Former industry executives in OSTP and agency leadership positions
- Lobbying against export controls, dual-use oversight, and safety regulations
- Industry-funded think tanks shape policy narratives
- Self-regulatory proposals designed to preempt government action
- Campaign contributions correlate with technology policy positions

### 11. Geopolitical Competition Distortions

The framing of emerging technology as primarily a national security competition distorts research priorities:

- **Overclassification** restricts knowledge sharing that benefits research progress
- **Export controls** isolate US researchers from international collaborators
- **"Techno-nationalism"** prioritizes competitive advantage over collective benefit
- **Security framing** crowds out consideration of equity, safety, and ethics
- **Threat inflation** justifies research spending without adequate governance

## Interaction Effects

These root causes compound each other:

```text
Fragmented governance
    + Short political cycles
    + Authorization-appropriation gap
    = Inconsistent, underfunded research strategy

Private sector dominance
    + Regulatory capture
    + Technology transfer failures
    = Public investment yields private benefit

Risk-averse funding
    + Workforce pipeline dysfunction
    + Compensation gap
    = Brain drain from public to private sector

Partisan polarization
    + Geopolitical competition
    + Inadequate dual-use oversight
    = Security-first framing crowds out safety governance
```

## Why These Causes Persist

Each root cause has constituencies that benefit from the status quo:

| Root Cause | Beneficiaries | Why It Persists |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Fragmented governance | Agency leaders protecting turf | Each agency resists coordination that reduces autonomy |
| Appropriation gap | Deficit hawks | Authorizations provide political credit without fiscal cost |
| Private sector dominance | Tech companies | Corporations capture talent and shape research agenda |
| Technology transfer failures | University TTOs, patent lawyers | Revenue-generating system resists reform |
| Weak dual-use oversight | Researchers, some industry | Oversight perceived as burdensome; risks abstract |
| Workforce dysfunction | Existing workforce (reduced competition) | Immigration restrictions have broad political support |
| Partisan polarization | Political parties | Science issues mobilize base voters |
| Regulatory capture | Industry | Access and influence yield policy outcomes |
