# Science Communication: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the science communication crisis requires interventions at multiple levels: rebuilding the journalism infrastructure that once mediated scientific information for the public, reforming platform incentives that amplify misinformation, training and incentivizing scientists for public engagement, building institutional capacity for science communication, and developing new approaches that move beyond the failed deficit model. No single solution is sufficient; an integrated strategy targeting structural, economic, institutional, and cultural dimensions is necessary.

## Solution 1: Rebuild Science Journalism Infrastructure

### Problem Addressed

The collapse of advertising-supported science journalism has removed the critical translation layer between scientific research and public understanding, leaving a vacuum that misinformation fills.

### Proposed Interventions

**A. Federal Science Journalism Fund**

Create a federally funded, editorially independent fund to support science journalism, modeled on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting:

- Annual appropriation of $250 million (approximately the cost of one F-35 fighter jet)
- Grants to nonprofit newsrooms, local news organizations, and freelance science journalists
- Editorial independence guaranteed by statute, with an independent board (scientists, journalists, public members)
- Focus on underserved communities and local science reporting
- Matching funds for philanthropic investment in science journalism

**B. Tax Incentives for Science Journalism Employment**

- Tax credits for news organizations that employ full-time science journalists
- Enhanced credits for outlets serving rural or underserved communities
- Modeled on the Local Journalism Sustainability Act (proposed in 117th and 118th Congress)

**C. Platform Revenue Sharing for Science Content**

- Require major platforms that distribute news content to share revenue with original science journalism producers
- Modeled on Australia's News Media Bargaining Code and Canada's Online News Act (C-18)
- Revenue directed to a science journalism trust fund with independent governance

### Evidence of Effectiveness

- Countries with public media investment (UK, Germany, Scandinavia) show higher public trust in science
- Nonprofit science journalism outlets (*Inside Climate News*, *The Markup*) have demonstrated that foundation-funded models can produce high-quality reporting
- The Corporation for Public Broadcasting model has maintained editorial independence for over 50 years with federal funding

### Potential Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Government funding threatens independence | Independent board, statutory editorial protections, CPB model |
| Insufficient to replace market losses | Designed as supplement, not replacement; leverages matching funds |
| Political opposition to public media | Bipartisan framing around informed citizenry and local journalism |

## Solution 2: Reform Platform Incentives

### Problem Addressed

Social media algorithms systematically amplify misinformation because it generates more engagement than accurate scientific information, and platforms face no accountability for the societal consequences.

### Proposed Interventions

**A. Algorithmic Transparency Requirements**

- Require platforms with more than 50 million U.S. users to disclose how algorithms rank and recommend science and health content
- Mandate independent audits of algorithmic impact on science misinformation amplification
- Publish regular transparency reports on science and health content moderation

**B. Science Information Labeling**

- Require platforms to label science and health content with source authority indicators (peer-reviewed, government agency, news organization, user-generated)
- Implement interstitial warnings before sharing content flagged as science misinformation by independent fact-checkers
- Provide contextual links to authoritative sources alongside science-related content

**C. Engagement Metric Reform**

- Prohibit algorithmic amplification of content that independent fact-checkers have flagged as science misinformation
- Create safe harbors for platforms that adopt approved science information quality standards
- Fund research into alternative recommendation algorithms that weight accuracy alongside engagement

**D. "Prebunking" and Inoculation Support**

- Fund development and deployment of "prebunking" tools that build resistance to misinformation before exposure
- Support platform integration of inoculation-based interventions (teaching users to recognize manipulation techniques)
- Research by Sander van der Linden (Cambridge) and Jon Roozenbeek has shown prebunking can reduce susceptibility to misinformation by 20-30%

### Evidence of Effectiveness

- EU's Digital Services Act has increased platform transparency and content moderation
- YouTube's climate misinformation policy reduced distribution of climate denial content by 70% (Google report, 2023)
- Prebunking campaigns in Europe reduced sharing of misinformation by 20-30% in randomized trials
- Wikipedia-style community moderation on Reddit's science subreddits maintains high information quality

### Potential Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| First Amendment concerns | Focus on transparency and labeling, not content removal; government does not determine truth |
| Platform resistance | Regulatory mandate with enforcement; safe harbors create incentives for compliance |
| Definition of "misinformation" | Independent scientific advisory panels, not government officials, assess claims |
| Gaming and evasion | Ongoing audits and adaptive standards |

## Solution 3: Train and Incentivize Scientists for Public Engagement

### Problem Addressed

Scientists are the most credible communicators of scientific information but lack training, time, incentives, and institutional support for public engagement. The academic reward structure actively penalizes communication.

### Proposed Interventions

**A. NSF and NIH Communication Training Requirements**

- Require federally funded research grants above $500,000 to include a "public engagement plan" (not just the existing broader impacts statement, which is widely regarded as pro forma)
- Fund science communication training programs at research universities
- Create competitive science communication fellowships for graduate students and postdocs

**B. Academic Incentive Reform**

- Encourage universities to include public engagement as a criterion for tenure and promotion, through NSF and NIH guidance
- Create a "public engagement portfolio" system where scientists document communication activities alongside publications
- Establish annual science communication awards at the national level (modeled on NSF's Public Service Award)

**C. Institutional Communication Support**

- Fund dedicated science communication staff at research universities (beyond existing press offices, which focus on institutional marketing)
- Create rapid-response science communication networks that connect journalists with relevant experts within hours
- Establish a National Science Media Center modeled on the UK's Science Media Centre, providing journalists with rapid expert commentary, evidence summaries, and briefings

**D. Harassment Protection**

- Federal agencies should require institutions receiving research funding to have anti-harassment policies that cover online harassment of scientists engaged in public communication
- Develop and disseminate best practices for institutional support of scientists facing online harassment
- Fund research on the prevalence and impact of harassment on science communication

### Evidence of Effectiveness

- The UK Science Media Centre has been credited with significantly improving the quality of science reporting in British media since 2002
- The Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University has trained over 15,000 scientists, with measurable improvements in communication skills
- Institutions that include public engagement in promotion criteria see 40-60% increases in faculty communication activity (University of Wisconsin-Madison study)

### Potential Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Scientists resist mandates | Incentives and support, not mandates; make engagement rewarding |
| Time trade-offs with research | Institutional communication staff reduce burden on individual scientists |
| Quality concerns | Training programs address quality; professional communicators supplement scientist engagement |
| Harassment risks | Institutional support and policy protections essential |

## Solution 4: Build Institutional Science Communication Infrastructure

### Problem Addressed

The United States lacks the institutional infrastructure for science communication that other countries have developed, leaving communication to ad hoc individual efforts and market forces.

### Proposed Interventions

**A. National Science Communication Initiative**

- Create a cross-agency initiative coordinating science communication efforts across federal agencies
- Housed in the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)
- Develop shared standards for agency science communication
- Coordinate rapid-response communication during science-related crises

**B. Statutory Protections for Government Science Communication**

- Codify the right of government scientists to communicate research findings to the public and media without prior political approval
- Establish whistleblower protections for scientists who report political interference with science communication
- Require agencies to publish scientific findings promptly, without political review of scientific content
- Modeled on the Scientific Integrity Act (introduced in multiple Congresses)

**C. Community Science Communication Programs**

- Fund community-based science communication programs through libraries, museums, extension services, and community organizations
- Target underserved communities with culturally appropriate science communication
- Support training of local trusted messengers (health workers, teachers, clergy, community leaders) in science communication
- Leverage existing infrastructure: USDA Cooperative Extension, public library systems, community health centers

**D. Science Communication Research Investment**

- Increase federal funding for research on science communication effectiveness from approximately $50 million to $200 million annually
- Support research on what communication strategies work for different audiences, topics, and channels
- Fund longitudinal studies of how trust in science forms and erodes
- Develop and disseminate evidence-based best practices for science communication

### Evidence of Effectiveness

- Germany's Wissenschaft im Dialog (Science in Dialogue), established in 2000, has built systematic public engagement infrastructure that correlates with higher public trust
- Canada's Chief Science Advisor (established 2017) has improved coordination of science communication across government
- Cooperative Extension programs (USDA) have a century-long track record of successful science communication in agricultural communities

### Potential Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Government communication as propaganda | Independent oversight, statutory protections, transparency requirements |
| Political vulnerability of new institutions | Bipartisan design, broad stakeholder governance |
| Coordination across agencies | OSTP leadership, shared standards, joint budgeting |
| Reaching skeptical communities | Community-based approach, local messengers, participatory design |

## Solution 5: Move Beyond the Deficit Model

### Problem Addressed

Most science communication still operates on the discredited assumption that providing more information will change attitudes. Effective communication requires engaging with values, identity, trust, and community---not just knowledge deficits.

### Proposed Interventions

**A. Dialogue-Based Engagement Programs**

- Fund and expand programs that bring scientists and communities together for genuine dialogue (not one-way lectures)
- Models include: citizen science projects, community advisory boards for research institutions, deliberative forums on science policy, science cafes
- Focus on listening as well as informing---understanding public concerns and values as inputs to science communication design

**B. Values-Based Communication Training**

- Train scientists in values-based framing: connecting scientific findings to values that resonate across political lines (health, family, economic opportunity, stewardship, national competitiveness)
- Develop audience-specific communication strategies based on cultural cognition research
- Avoid condescension: treat audiences as intelligent people with different values, not as ignorant people needing education

**C. Participatory Science Communication**

- Expand citizen science programs that involve the public in the research process
- Support community-based participatory research that centers community priorities
- Create feedback mechanisms where public concerns and questions inform science communication priorities

**D. Media Literacy Integration**

- Support integration of media literacy education into K-12 curriculum (modeled on Finland)
- Develop and disseminate tools for evaluating science claims (source assessment, study design basics, statistical reasoning)
- Partner with libraries, museums, and community organizations for adult media literacy programming

### Evidence of Effectiveness

- Citizen science programs (iNaturalist, Galaxy Zoo, Foldit) have demonstrated that participatory engagement increases scientific literacy and trust
- Values-based framing research by Matthew Nisbet and others has shown that connecting climate science to economic opportunity or national security is more effective with conservative audiences than environmental framing
- Finland's media literacy curriculum has produced one of the world's most misinformation-resistant populations
- Deliberative forums (e.g., the Danish Board of Technology's consensus conferences) have demonstrated that informed public deliberation on complex scientific issues produces thoughtful, nuanced conclusions

### Potential Challenges

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Scale | Start with pilot programs; build evidence base; expand what works |
| Cost relative to mass communication | More effective per dollar for attitude change; mass communication for awareness |
| Manipulation by bad actors | Clear guidelines; trained facilitators; transparency |
| Perceived condescension | Genuine dialogue; respect for lived experience; listening |
