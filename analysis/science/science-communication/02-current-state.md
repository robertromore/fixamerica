# Science Communication: Current State

## Overview

Science communication in the United States is undergoing a profound transformation driven by the collapse of traditional science journalism, the rise of social media as a primary information channel, deepening political polarization around scientific topics, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on public trust. While new channels for science communication have emerged---podcasts, YouTube, social media platforms---the overall quality and reach of accurate scientific information has declined relative to the volume of misinformation competing for public attention.

## Public Trust in Science

### Overall Trust Levels

Public trust in scientists remains higher than trust in many other institutions, but has declined significantly from its pandemic-era peak and shows growing partisan divergence:

| Metric | 2019 | 2020 | 2022 | 2024 |
|--------|------|------|------|------|
| Great deal of confidence in scientists | 35% | 40% | 29% | 27% |
| Fair amount of confidence | 43% | 40% | 39% | 40% |
| Not too much/no confidence | 21% | 19% | 31% | 32% |

### Partisan Polarization of Trust

The most significant trend is the growing partisan gap in trust:

| Group | Trust in scientists (2024) | Change since 2019 |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Democrats/Lean Democratic | 73% great deal/fair amount | +2 |
| Republicans/Lean Republican | 45% great deal/fair amount | -14 |
| Partisan gap | 28 points | Widened by 16 points |

*Source: Pew Research Center (2024)*

This polarization is not uniform across scientific topics. Republicans express lower trust specifically regarding climate science, public health mandates, and environmental regulation, while maintaining higher trust in technology and defense-related science.

### Trust by Demographic Group

| Group | High trust in scientists | Notable pattern |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------|
| College graduates | 68% | Substantially higher than non-graduates |
| Ages 18-29 | 62% | Higher than older cohorts |
| Ages 65+ | 52% | Declining faster than younger groups |
| White evangelical Protestants | 34% | Lowest of religious groups |
| Hispanic Americans | 64% | Higher than white Americans |
| Black Americans | 55% | Moderate, with legacy distrust of medical research |
| Rural residents | 43% | Significantly lower than urban/suburban |

## State of Science Journalism

### The Decline

Science journalism has experienced a structural collapse that mirrors the broader crisis in local and specialized reporting:

**Newspaper science coverage:**

- In 1989, 95 U.S. newspapers had dedicated science sections; by 2025, fewer than 20 maintain regular science coverage
- The number of full-time science reporters at daily newspapers fell from approximately 95 in 2000 to approximately 35 in 2025
- Major outlets including CNN, NBC, and the *Boston Globe* have eliminated dedicated science desks
- The *New York Times* maintains the largest science desk with approximately 15 reporters, but coverage has shifted toward climate and health

**Broadcast science coverage:**

- Network TV evening news coverage of science stories has declined by approximately 70% since 2000
- Cable news covers science primarily during crises (pandemics, natural disasters)
- Local TV stations rarely employ science reporters

**Wire services:**

- The Associated Press maintains a small science team, but coverage has narrowed
- Reuters has invested in fact-checking but reduced original science reporting

### New Channels

While traditional outlets have contracted, new platforms have expanded:

| Channel | Reach | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Science podcasts (e.g., *Radiolab*, *Science Vs*) | Millions of downloads | Deep engagement, narrative storytelling | Self-selecting audience |
| YouTube science channels (e.g., Veritasium, SciShow) | Tens of millions of subscribers | Visual explanation, global reach | Algorithm favors engagement over accuracy |
| Science Twitter/X, Bluesky, Threads | Millions of scientists active | Direct expert access, real-time | Prone to context collapse, harassment |
| Substack and newsletters | Growing niche audiences | Expert-driven, in-depth | Behind paywalls, limited reach |
| TikTok science creators | Hundreds of millions of views | Youth engagement, accessibility | Extreme brevity, oversimplification |
| Science museums and centers | 95 million annual visitors | Hands-on engagement, trusted | Geographic access, funding constraints |

### Funding Models Under Stress

| Model | Status | Examples |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Advertising-supported science desks | Collapsing | Most newspaper science sections |
| Nonprofit science journalism | Growing but fragile | *Inside Climate News*, *The Markup*, *Undark* |
| Foundation-funded reporting | Increasing | Howard Hughes Medical Institute Tangled Bank Studios, Heising-Simons Foundation |
| Membership/subscription | Viable for niche | *Science*, *Nature*, specialized outlets |
| Public media | Stable but underfunded | NPR science desk, PBS *NOVA* |
| Philanthropic endowment | Rare | ProPublica model |

## Misinformation Landscape

### Scale of the Problem

Scientific misinformation circulates at unprecedented scale:

- A 2023 study in *Nature* found that exposure to science-related misinformation on social media increased from 2019 to 2023 across every major platform
- The World Health Organization declared an "infodemic" during COVID-19, with misinformation spreading faster than the virus itself
- A Kaiser Family Foundation survey (2024) found that 65% of adults had encountered at least one piece of COVID-19 misinformation they believed to be true

### Topic-Specific Misinformation

| Topic | Common misinformation claims | Estimated reach | Health/policy impact |
|-------|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| COVID-19 vaccines | Microchips, infertility, mRNA alters DNA | Billions of impressions | Reduced vaccination rates |
| Climate change | Natural cycles, no consensus, models wrong | Pervasive | Delayed policy action |
| 5G technology | Causes cancer, COVID-19, surveillance | Hundreds of millions | Cell tower attacks, deployment delays |
| GMOs | Cause cancer, destroy biodiversity | Hundreds of millions | Unnecessary regulation, consumer fear |
| Fluoride in water | Brain damage, mass medication | Tens of millions | Water system policy reversals |
| Evolution | "Just a theory," missing links | Persistent | Educational standards battles |

### Sources of Misinformation

**Industry-funded doubt campaigns:**

- The fossil fuel industry has spent an estimated $2 billion since 1998 on campaigns to create doubt about climate science, modeled on the tobacco industry's earlier efforts
- Pharmaceutical skepticism has been amplified by alternative health product industries with billions in annual revenue
- Chemical industry funding has shaped public perception of pesticide and environmental health research

**Political actors:**

- Elected officials routinely contradict scientific consensus on climate, vaccines, and other topics
- Political media ecosystems amplify anti-science narratives that align with ideological positions
- Government scientists have faced political interference in communicating findings

**Social media dynamics:**

- Platform algorithms reward engagement, which misinformation generates through emotional provocation
- Anti-science influencers have built large followings (millions of followers in some cases)
- Recommendation algorithms create "rabbit holes" that progressively radicalize users toward fringe beliefs
- AI-generated content has made creating convincing misinformation cheaper and faster

### Platform Responses

| Platform | Policies (as of 2025) | Effectiveness |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| Meta (Facebook/Instagram) | Reduced enforcement; rolled back COVID misinformation policies | Declining |
| X (Twitter) | Eliminated most content moderation teams; relies on Community Notes | Minimal |
| YouTube | Maintains climate and vaccine misinformation policies | Moderate but inconsistent |
| TikTok | Content moderation, labels on science content | Limited enforcement |
| Google Search | Elevates authoritative health sources in results | Moderate |

## Risk Communication

### Chronic Challenges

Government agencies and scientists struggle with communicating uncertainty, risk, and probability to the public:

- **Probabilistic vs. binary thinking**: The public often wants yes/no answers where science provides probabilities
- **Shifting guidance**: Changes in scientific understanding (e.g., COVID mask guidance) are interpreted as unreliability rather than the scientific process working
- **Precautionary communication**: Officials must balance avoiding panic with providing adequate warning
- **Numeracy gaps**: A significant portion of the public struggles to interpret statistical risk

### Institutional Communication

| Agency | Communication strength | Key challenge |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| CDC | Broad reach, established authority | Political interference, slow messaging |
| FDA | Regulatory communication | Drug safety communication complexity |
| EPA | Environmental risk communication | Budget cuts, political interference |
| NOAA | Weather and climate communication | Climate change politicization |
| NASA | Strong public engagement | Funding uncertainty |
| NIH | Research communication | Public health messaging during crises |

## Scientist Engagement

### Training and Incentives

Most scientists receive little formal training in public communication:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Scientists who received communication training in graduate school | ~15% |
| Universities offering science communication courses | ~35% of R1 institutions |
| Scientists who have engaged with media | ~30% |
| Scientists citing fear of backlash as barrier to engagement | ~40% |
| Scientists whose institutions reward public engagement in promotion | ~10% |
| Scientists active on social media for professional purposes | ~55% |

*Sources: National Academies (2017); Pew Research Center (2023)*

### Barriers to Scientist Engagement

- **Time**: Communication competes with research, teaching, and grant writing
- **Incentives**: Academic reward structures rarely value public engagement
- **Training**: Most scientists are not trained in accessible communication
- **Harassment**: Scientists who engage publicly, especially women and minorities, face online abuse
- **Institutional caution**: Universities and agencies may discourage public statements
- **Fear of oversimplification**: Scientists worry about sacrificing accuracy for accessibility

## International Comparison

| Country | Public trust in science | Key features |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| Finland | ~75% | Strong science education, media literacy in curriculum |
| Canada | ~70% | Chief Science Advisor, public engagement mandates |
| United Kingdom | ~68% | Science Media Centre, Wellcome Trust investment |
| Germany | ~65% | *Wissenschaft im Dialog* (Science in Dialogue) program |
| United States | ~57% | Fragmented, politicized, declining |
| Japan | ~55% | Post-Fukushima trust challenges |
| Brazil | ~50% | Political interference, pandemic misinformation |

*Sources: Wellcome Global Monitor (2024); Pew Research Center (2024)*

### Models Worth Studying

- **United Kingdom Science Media Centre**: A nonprofit that provides journalists with rapid access to expert commentary, improving quality and speed of science coverage
- **Finland's media literacy education**: Integrated into K-12 curriculum, producing citizens more resistant to misinformation
- **Canada's Chief Science Advisor**: Institutionalized role for ensuring scientific evidence reaches policymakers and the public
- **Germany's Science in Dialogue**: Government-funded program supporting two-way engagement between scientists and citizens

## Key Trends

### Positive Developments

- Growing recognition that science communication is a professional skill requiring training
- Expansion of AAAS, National Academies, and university programs for science communication
- Increased scientist activity on social media and in public discourse
- New nonprofit science journalism outlets filling some gaps
- Growth of science communication research as an academic field
- Increased foundation investment in science communication infrastructure

### Negative Developments

- Continued erosion of institutional science journalism
- Deepening partisan polarization around scientific topics
- Platform retreat from content moderation
- AI-powered misinformation becoming more sophisticated and cheaper to produce
- Political attacks on scientific agencies and government scientists intensifying
- Online harassment driving scientists, especially women and minorities, from public engagement

## Summary

The current state of science communication in the United States is characterized by a paradox: more channels for science information exist than ever before, yet the public is less well-served. The collapse of professional science journalism has removed a critical quality filter, social media algorithms amplify misinformation, political polarization has weaponized science itself, and the institutions responsible for science communication---agencies, universities, newsrooms---are underfunded and under attack. Addressing this crisis requires systemic reforms to how scientific information is produced, mediated, and consumed.
