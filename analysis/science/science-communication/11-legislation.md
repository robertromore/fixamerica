# Science Communication: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Science communication reform requires legislation addressing two critical gaps: protecting government scientists' right to communicate research findings without political interference, and rebuilding the science journalism infrastructure that mediates scientific information for the public. The two bills presented here---the Scientific Communication Protection Act and the Science Journalism Sustainability Act---address the institutional and economic dimensions of the crisis respectively. Both are designed to survive First Amendment scrutiny by focusing on transparency, institutional independence, and support for journalism rather than content regulation.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Scientific Communication Protection Act

**Purpose**: Protect the right of government scientists and researchers to communicate scientific findings to the public and media without political interference, and establish institutional infrastructure for federal science communication.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Scientific Communication
Protection Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(a) Federal scientists and researchers produce knowledge
essential to public health, safety, environmental protection,
and national security.
(b) Political interference with the communication of
scientific findings undermines public trust in government
institutions and impairs evidence-based policymaking.
(c) Government scientists have been subjected to censorship,
gag orders, and retaliation for communicating research findings
that conflict with political agendas.
(d) The public has a right to timely access to the scientific
findings produced with taxpayer funding.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(a) COVERED AGENCY.--The term "covered agency" means any
Executive agency (as defined in section 105 of title 5,
United States Code) that funds, conducts, or oversees
scientific research.
(b) COVERED SCIENTIST.--The term "covered scientist" means
any Federal employee or contractor whose primary duties involve
scientific research, analysis, or communication of scientific
findings.
(c) SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS.--The term "scientific findings"
means the results of research conducted or funded by a covered
agency, including data, analyses, conclusions, and
methodological descriptions.
(d) POLITICAL INTERFERENCE.--The term "political interference"
means any action by a non-scientific official to suppress,
alter, delay, or misrepresent scientific findings for
non-scientific reasons, including but not limited to:
  (1) altering scientific reports, data, or conclusions;
  (2) preventing or delaying the publication or communication
  of scientific findings;
  (3) directing scientists to reach predetermined conclusions;
  (4) retaliating against scientists who communicate findings;

  personally identifiable information, or information that
  would compromise ongoing law enforcement investigations;
  (3) not include review of scientific conclusions,
  interpretations, or policy implications of findings;
  (4) provide written explanation for any proposed changes
  or delays.

(c) LIMITATION.--Nothing in this section shall be construed
to require agencies to fund or facilitate individual
scientists' communication activities, or to prevent agencies
from issuing official agency positions that may differ from
individual scientists' findings.

SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON POLITICAL INTERFERENCE.

(a) IN GENERAL.--No officer or employee of the United States
shall engage in political interference with the communication
of scientific findings by a covered scientist or covered
agency.

(b) SPECIFIC PROHIBITIONS.--It shall be unlawful for any
officer or employee of the United States to:
  (1) direct a covered scientist to alter, suppress, or
  delay the communication of scientific findings for
  non-scientific reasons;
  (2) retaliate against a covered scientist for exercising
  the rights established under Section 4;
  (3) alter the scientific content of agency reports,
  press releases, testimony, or other public communications
  without the concurrence of the responsible scientist;
  (4) require political appointees to approve scientific
  content prior to publication or communication.

SEC. 6. SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY OFFICERS.

(a) APPOINTMENT.--Each covered agency shall appoint a
Scientific Integrity Officer, who shall:
  (1) be a career employee with scientific credentials;

  science communication;
  (5) support the establishment of a National Science
  Media Center, operated by an independent nonprofit
  organization, to provide journalists with rapid access
  to expert scientific commentary.

(c) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.--There is authorized
to be appropriated $25,000,000 annually for the Initiative.

SEC. 8. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.--A covered scientist who discloses
information about political interference with science
communication shall be protected from retaliation under
the Whistleblower Protection Act (5 U.S.C. 2302) and
the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012.

(b) BURDEN OF PROOF.--In any proceeding arising under
this section, if a covered scientist demonstrates that
the exercise of rights under this Act was a contributing
factor in a personnel action, the agency shall bear the
burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that
it would have taken the same action absent the protected
activity.

SEC. 9. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) OFFICE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL.--The Office of Special
Counsel shall have authority to investigate and prosecute
violations of this Act.

(b) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.--A covered scientist who
suffers retaliation for exercising rights under this Act
may bring a civil action in United States district court
for reinstatement, back pay, compensatory damages, and
reasonable attorneys' fees.

violates Section 5 shall be subject to:
  (1) disciplinary action up to and including removal;
  (2) civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date
of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3** defines key terms precisely, including a specific definition of "political interference" that captures documented abuses without being overbroad
- **Section 4** establishes affirmative rights for scientists while preserving reasonable prepublication review for legitimate security concerns; the 15-day timeline prevents indefinite delays used as de facto censorship
- **Section 5** prohibits specific forms of political interference documented in previous administrations
- **Section 6** creates independent Scientific Integrity Officers modeled on Inspectors General, with career protections against political removal
- **Section 7** establishes institutional infrastructure for proactive science communication, including the National Science Media Center
- **Sections 8-9** provide robust enforcement through both administrative and judicial channels

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Presidential authority over executive branch communications | Distinguishes scientific content (protected) from policy positions (agency prerogative) |
| First Amendment concerns | Act protects speech rather than restricting it; no content mandates |
| Overbroad definition of political interference | Specific enumeration of prohibited actions limits scope |
| Cost of enforcement | Enforcement mechanisms use existing institutions (OSC, federal courts) |
| Resistance from administrations seeking message control | Career protections and whistleblower provisions reduce political leverage |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Include criminal penalties for willful destruction or suppression of scientific data
- **Fallback version**: Executive order implementing key provisions at covered agencies (less durable but faster)
- **Extension**: Cover state government scientists through conditional funding requirements

### Bill 2: Science Journalism Sustainability Act

**Purpose**: Establish sustainable funding mechanisms for science journalism to rebuild the infrastructure that mediates scientific information for the public, with robust editorial independence protections.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Science Journalism
Sustainability Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(a) The number of full-time science journalists at
American news organizations has declined by more than
60 percent since 2000.
(b) This decline has created an information vacuum that
is filled by misinformation, undermining public health,
environmental protection, and democratic governance.
(c) An informed citizenry capable of evaluating
scientific evidence is essential to democratic
self-governance.
(d) The market alone has proven unable to sustain the
science journalism that democracy requires.
(e) Public investment in independent journalism is
consistent with the First Amendment and has been
successfully implemented in other democracies and
through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** creates a substantial fund ($250 million/year) with matching requirements to leverage private investment, ensuring the government does not become the sole funder
- **Section 5** establishes an independent, bipartisan board with staggered terms and removal protections, modeled on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting but with additional independence safeguards
- **Section 6** contains the strongest editorial independence protections in any federal journalism support program, including explicit prohibitions on government influence, editorial standards requirements, and clawback provisions
- **Section 7** ensures transparency and accountability through annual reporting and GAO oversight
- **Section 8** creates tax incentives for science journalism employment, with enhanced credits for underserved communities; the sunset provision ensures congressional review

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Government-funded journalism is not independent | Robust editorial independence provisions; independent board; no content review |
| First Amendment concerns about government picking winners | Board makes decisions, not government; broad eligibility criteria |
| Insufficient to replace market losses | Designed as supplement; matching requirements leverage private investment |
| Political vulnerability of appropriations | Authorized (not mandatory) funding; build bipartisan support |
| Definition of "science journalism" too broad or narrow | Professional standards requirement; Board determines eligibility |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Mandatory appropriations rather than authorized; larger fund
- **Fallback version**: Tax incentives only (Section 8) without the fund---lower cost, lower impact, but less political resistance
- **Extension**: Add platform revenue-sharing provisions requiring major platforms to contribute to the fund

## Regulatory Framework

### Agency Science Communication Standards (OSTP)

**Existing Authority**: OSTP Memorandum on Scientific Integrity (2021); 42 U.S.C. Chapter 79.

**Draft Regulation**: OSTP should issue binding guidance requiring all covered agencies to:

1. Adopt and publish science communication policies consistent with the Scientific Communication Protection Act
2. Establish timelines for prepublication review (maximum 15 business days)
3. Designate Scientific Integrity Officers with specified qualifications
4. Publish annual science communication activity reports
5. Include science communication training in professional development programs for scientists

**Explanation**: This regulatory framework implements the statutory requirements of the Scientific Communication Protection Act at the agency level, providing consistent standards across the federal government.

### FTC Guidance on Science Misinformation in Advertising

**Existing Authority**: 15 U.S.C. Section 45 (FTC authority over unfair or deceptive acts or practices).

**Draft Regulation**: The FTC should issue updated guidance clarifying that:

1. Advertising claims that contradict established scientific consensus (e.g., "vaccines cause autism," "climate change is a hoax") may constitute deceptive advertising when used to sell products or services
2. Health supplement marketing that implies scientific backing without credible evidence is subject to enforcement action
3. Social media influencers who receive compensation for promoting anti-science claims must disclose the commercial relationship

**Explanation**: This uses existing FTC authority to address the commercial dimension of science misinformation, particularly in the health and wellness space, without raising First Amendment concerns about non-commercial speech.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**First Amendment**: Both bills are designed to survive First Amendment scrutiny:

- The Scientific Communication Protection Act *protects* speech rather than restricting it; it prevents government from censoring its own scientists
- The Science Journalism Sustainability Act funds journalism without controlling content, consistent with the CPB model upheld for over 50 years
- Neither bill regulates private speech; platform provisions focus on transparency, not content mandates

**Separation of Powers**: The Scientific Communication Protection Act limits executive discretion over science communication. This raises potential separation-of-powers questions, but Congress has broad authority to structure the operations of executive agencies.

### Preemption Questions

These bills primarily address federal institutions and do not preempt state law. States would retain authority to:

- Establish their own science communication protections for state employees
- Create state-level science journalism support programs
- Regulate advertising claims under state consumer protection law

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Bill | How it works |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Scientific Integrity Officers | Bill 1 | Internal investigation and corrective action |
| Office of Special Counsel | Bill 1 | Federal investigation and prosecution |
| Private right of action | Bill 1 | Scientists can sue for retaliation |
| Civil penalties | Bill 1 | Up to $50,000 per violation |
| Board oversight | Bill 2 | Independent board monitors editorial independence |
| GAO review | Bill 2 | Triennial audit of fund operations |
| Clawback provisions | Bill 2 | Recovery of funds from non-compliant recipients |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Scientific Communication Protection Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Organizational restructuring | Agency could eliminate scientist positions rather than censor them, achieving the same result | High |
| Indirect pressure | Political appointees could pressure scientists through performance reviews, funding decisions, or reassignment rather than direct censorship | High |
| Contractor exclusion | Contractors may have weaker protections than federal employees | Medium |
| Classification abuse | Legitimate classification authority could be abused to suppress inconvenient findings | Medium |
| Delayed appointments | Administration could fail to appoint Scientific Integrity Officers or appoint unqualified individuals | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address state government scientists | State-level political interference unaddressed | Federal legislation cannot directly regulate state employment |
| Enforcement depends on political will | OSC and DOJ under political leadership may not pursue violations aggressively | Structural limitation of enforcement through executive branch |
| Does not address private sector scientists | Industry scientists face different but related communication constraints | Different legal framework for private employment |
| Reactive rather than preventive | Protections activate after interference occurs | Difficult to prevent interference before it happens |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-restructuring provision**: Add language prohibiting elimination of scientific positions within 2 years of a scientist exercising communication rights under the Act
2. **Broad anti-retaliation**: Expand retaliation definition to include performance reviews, reassignment, funding decisions, and organizational changes that affect scientists who communicate publicly
3. **Contractor extension**: Explicitly extend protections to contractors performing scientific research for covered agencies
4. **Classification review**: Require independent review when classification authority is invoked to restrict scientific communication
5. **Appointment mandates**: Set 90-day deadline for Scientific Integrity Officer appointments with automatic escalation to OSTP if deadline is missed

### Science Journalism Sustainability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Soft influence | Board members or their associates could informally influence editorial decisions without triggering formal prohibitions | Medium |
| Grant criteria manipulation | Future Congresses could modify grant criteria to favor or disfavor certain types of coverage | Medium |
| Matching fund capture | Entities could create affiliated foundations to provide "matching" funds that are effectively self-dealing | Medium |
| Quality dilution | Low-quality entities could meet technical eligibility requirements without producing substantive journalism | Low |
| Sunset pressure | Threat of non-reauthorization could create implicit pressure on grant recipients | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| $250M insufficient to replace market losses | Addresses a fraction of the journalism funding gap | Political limits on appropriations |
| Does not address platform business models | Root cause of journalism economic collapse unaddressed | Requires separate legislation |
| Authorized, not mandatory, funding | Appropriations could be zeroed out | Political vulnerability |
| Does not address AI-generated misinformation | New technology creates challenges faster than fund can address | Rapidly evolving threat |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Influence firewall**: Require Board members to recuse from decisions involving entities with which they have financial or professional relationships; prohibit ex parte communications about pending grants
2. **Criteria stability**: Require supermajority Board vote to change grant criteria; prohibit Congress from directing grants to specific entities or topic areas
3. **Matching fund verification**: Require independent audit of matching fund sources; prohibit self-dealing through affiliated entities
4. **Quality standards**: Require grant recipients to demonstrate adherence to professional journalism standards through independent assessment; tie continued funding to quality metrics
5. **Mandatory funding**: In refinement, convert to mandatory appropriations to reduce political vulnerability

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Political turnover could reverse reforms | Statutory protections rather than executive orders; bipartisan governance structures |
| Funding uncertainty undermines long-term planning | Multi-year authorizations; mandatory funding provisions; foundation co-investment |
| Enforcement requires political will | Multiple enforcement mechanisms (internal, OSC, private right of action); congressional oversight |
| Technology evolution outpaces legislation | Regular GAO reviews; adaptive standards authority for Board and OSTP |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Both bills should include 10-year sunset provisions with mandatory congressional review
- GAO should conduct comprehensive reviews at years 3, 6, and 9
- OSTP should publish annual assessments of legislation effectiveness
- Board should commission independent evaluation of fund impact on science journalism ecosystem
