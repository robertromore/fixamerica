# Science Communication: Actions

## Overview

This document outlines concrete actions that individuals, communities, organizations, and policymakers can take to improve science communication in the United States. Actions are organized by actor and by time horizon, with specific steps that can be taken immediately as well as longer-term efforts that require sustained engagement.

## What Citizens Can Do

### Immediate Actions

**Become a better consumer of science information:**

- Learn to evaluate sources: check credentials, look for peer review, assess conflicts of interest
- Use fact-checking resources before sharing science claims: Health Feedback (<https://healthfeedback.org/>), Climate Feedback (<https://climatefeedback.org/>), Science Feedback (<https://sciencefeedback.co/>)
- Understand the difference between a single study and scientific consensus
- Be skeptical of claims that all experts are wrong and only one outsider has the truth
- Recognize emotional manipulation: if science content makes you angry or afraid before informing you, question the source

**Improve your information diet:**

- Subscribe to at least one quality science journalism outlet (*STAT News*, *Inside Climate News*, *Science News*, *Undark*, *Quanta Magazine*)
- Follow credentialed scientists on social media (look for institutional affiliations and publication records)
- Listen to science podcasts (*Short Wave* from NPR, *Science Vs*, *Radiolab*, *Science Friday*)
- Watch science documentaries (*NOVA*, *Cosmos*)
- Visit your local science museum, planetarium, or nature center

**Counter misinformation in your networks:**

- When you see science misinformation shared by friends or family, respond with credible sources---not hostility
- Use the "truth sandwich" technique: lead with the fact, mention the myth briefly, then explain why it is wrong
- Share quality science content proactively, not just reactively
- If you lack the expertise to counter a specific claim, share a link to a fact-checking organization rather than engaging in debate

### Sustained Actions

**Support science journalism financially:**

- Subscribe to science journalism outlets (subscriptions directly fund reporting)
- Donate to nonprofit science journalism organizations
- Support local news outlets that cover science and health
- Advocate for public media funding

**Engage with science in your community:**

- Attend science cafes, public lectures, and museum events
- Participate in citizen science projects (iNaturalist, Globe Observer, eBird, Zooniverse)
- Join community advisory boards for local research institutions
- Volunteer at science museums and libraries
- Support science programming in your local schools

**Advocate for policy reform:**

- Contact your representatives to support science communication legislation
- Advocate for media literacy education in your school district
- Support candidates who respect scientific evidence and oppose science denial
- Attend town halls and ask candidates about their positions on science communication

## What Scientists Can Do

### Immediate Actions

**Start communicating:**

- Write for public audiences: blog posts, *The Conversation* articles, op-eds in local papers
- Use social media to share your research in accessible language
- Accept media interview requests when your expertise is relevant
- Give public talks at libraries, museums, schools, and community organizations
- Participate in Science Cafe events and public engagement forums

**Improve your communication skills:**

- Take a science communication training course (Alan Alda Center, AAAS, institutional programs)
- Join the National Association of Science Writers or AAAS communicators network
- Practice explaining your research in plain language (the "elevator pitch")
- Read science communication research to understand what works and what does not
- Seek feedback from non-expert audiences on your communication

**Support science journalism:**

- Respond to journalist inquiries promptly and helpfully
- Proactively reach out to journalists when your research has public relevance
- Provide context, not just findings---help journalists understand significance and limitations
- Do not demand quote approval, but do offer to review technical accuracy

### Sustained Actions

**Advocate for institutional change:**

- Push for public engagement to be valued in tenure and promotion decisions at your institution
- Mentor junior scientists in communication skills
- Support institutional communication infrastructure (press offices, media training, communication staff)
- Advocate for science communication training in graduate programs
- Build relationships with local journalists, community organizations, and schools

**Protect the communication ecosystem:**

- Support colleagues who face harassment for public engagement
- Report political interference with science communication through appropriate channels
- Participate in professional society communication programs
- Contribute to efforts to counter misinformation in your field
- Support open access publishing so the public can read the research their taxes funded

## What Journalists Can Do

### Immediate Actions

**Cover science better:**

- Include context about scientific consensus, not just individual studies
- Avoid false balance: do not give equal weight to fringe positions and established consensus
- Report on the process of science, not just dramatic findings
- Cover science policy, funding, and institutional issues, not just discoveries
- Provide uncertainty information clearly: explain what is known, what is uncertain, and why

**Build expertise:**

- Specialize in a science beat if possible
- Attend science journalism training (Knight Science Journalism fellowship, CASW workshops, AHCJ training)
- Develop relationships with scientists who can serve as sources and reviewers
- Learn basic statistics and study design to evaluate research papers

### Sustained Actions

**Advocate for science journalism infrastructure:**

- Join and support professional organizations (NASW, SEJ, AHCJ)
- Advocate within your organization for science coverage and dedicated beats
- Mentor younger journalists in science reporting
- Support nonprofit science journalism models
- Push for fair compensation for science journalism work

## What Technology Platforms Can Do

### Immediate Actions

- Elevate authoritative science sources in recommendation algorithms
- Label science and health content with source authority indicators
- Implement interstitial warnings before sharing flagged misinformation
- Provide contextual links to authoritative sources alongside science-related content
- Reduce algorithmic amplification of content flagged by independent fact-checkers

### Sustained Actions

- Invest in independent research on algorithmic impacts on science information quality
- Share revenue with science journalism organizations whose content drives engagement
- Develop and deploy prebunking/inoculation tools
- Publish regular transparency reports on science and health content moderation
- Partner with science communication organizations on information quality initiatives

## What Universities and Research Institutions Can Do

### Immediate Actions

- Offer science communication training to graduate students and faculty
- Include public engagement in tenure and promotion criteria
- Hire dedicated science communication staff (distinct from institutional marketing)
- Support faculty who face harassment for public engagement
- Improve press releases: avoid overselling findings, include limitations

### Sustained Actions

- Create science communication programs and degree tracks
- Establish community engagement partnerships
- Fund science communication research
- Build rapid-response systems connecting faculty experts with journalists
- Develop metrics for assessing public engagement quality and impact

## What Policymakers Can Do

### Immediate Actions

- Support and co-sponsor the Scientific Communication Protection Act (or equivalent)
- Defend science agency communication budgets against cuts
- Refrain from interfering with agency science communication
- Use scientific evidence accurately in public statements and policy debates
- Attend science briefings offered by AAAS, National Academies, and other organizations

### Sustained Actions

- Establish a Federal Science Journalism Fund
- Enact platform transparency and accountability legislation
- Fund science communication research at NSF and NIH
- Support media literacy education initiatives
- Protect government scientists' right to communicate findings

## What Philanthropic Foundations Can Do

### Immediate Actions

- Increase funding for nonprofit science journalism
