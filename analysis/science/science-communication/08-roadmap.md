# Science Communication: Roadmap

## Overview

Reforming science communication in the United States requires a phased strategy that sequences actions by political feasibility, institutional readiness, and interdependencies between reforms. This roadmap prioritizes quick wins that build momentum and institutional capacity for more ambitious reforms, while recognizing that some changes require long-term cultural and structural shifts.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)

### Goal

Establish legal protections, institutional infrastructure, and baseline capacity for science communication reform.

### Priority Actions

#### 1.1 Enact the Scientific Communication Protection Act

- **Action**: Pass federal legislation protecting government scientists' right to communicate research findings
- **Key provisions**: Prohibition on political review of scientific content; whistleblower protections; right to speak at professional conferences and to the media
- **Champion**: Bipartisan sponsorship (Science Committee members from both parties)
- **Opposition**: Administrations that want political control of agency messaging
- **Milestone**: Bill introduced within 6 months; committee hearings within 12 months

#### 1.2 Establish the National Science Media Center

- **Action**: Create an independent, nonprofit rapid-response science communication organization modeled on the UK Science Media Centre
- **Structure**: Independent board with scientists, journalists, and public members; funded by a combination of federal seed funding and foundation support
- **Functions**: Rapid expert commentary for journalists; evidence summaries on breaking science stories; media briefings on major studies; training for scientists on media engagement
- **Milestone**: Launch within 18 months; operational within 24 months

#### 1.3 Issue Federal Grant Communication Requirements

- **Action**: NSF and NIH issue guidance requiring "public engagement plans" for grants exceeding $500,000
- **Mechanism**: Administrative action, no legislation required
- **Support**: Fund science communication training at major research universities
- **Milestone**: Guidance issued within 12 months; implemented in next grant cycle

#### 1.4 Launch Algorithmic Transparency Pilot

- **Action**: Negotiate voluntary transparency agreements with major platforms regarding science and health content ranking
- **Mechanism**: OSTP-led working group with platform representatives, scientists, and journalists
- **Deliverable**: Published reports on how algorithms affect science content distribution
- **Milestone**: Agreements in place within 12 months; first reports within 18 months

#### 1.5 Convene National Science Communication Summit

- **Action**: White House-convened summit bringing together scientists, journalists, platform executives, foundation leaders, museum directors, and community representatives
- **Purpose**: Establish national strategy, identify coordination gaps, and build stakeholder commitment
- **Deliverable**: National Science Communication Strategy document
- **Milestone**: Summit within 9 months of Phase 1 launch

### Phase 1 Budget Estimate

| Item | Annual cost |
|------|------------|
| Scientific Communication Protection Act (enforcement) | $10 million |
| National Science Media Center (seed funding) | $15 million |
| Grant communication requirements (training programs) | $30 million |
| Algorithmic transparency pilot | $5 million |
| National summit and strategy development | $2 million |
| **Phase 1 total** | **~$62 million/year** |

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Development (Years 2-5)

### Goal

Build sustainable funding mechanisms, institutional capacity, and reformed incentive structures for science communication.

### Priority Actions

#### 2.1 Create the Federal Science Journalism Fund

- **Action**: Establish a federally funded, editorially independent fund to support science journalism
- **Appropriation**: $250 million annually
- **Governance**: Independent board modeled on Corporation for Public Broadcasting
- **Grant categories**: Nonprofit newsrooms, local science reporting, investigative science journalism, science journalism fellowships
- **Editorial independence**: Statutory guarantee; no government review of editorial content
- **Milestone**: Legislation passed by Year 2; first grants by Year 3

#### 2.2 Enact Platform Science Information Accountability Act

- **Action**: Pass legislation requiring algorithmic transparency, science information labeling, and amplification accountability for major platforms
- **Key provisions**: Mandatory transparency reports; independent audits; prohibition on algorithmic amplification of content flagged as misinformation by independent fact-checkers; safe harbors for platforms that adopt approved standards
- **First Amendment design**: No government determination of truth; independent scientific panels assess claims; focuses on transparency and amplification, not content removal
- **Milestone**: Legislation introduced by Year 2; enacted by Year 3-4

#### 2.3 Launch Community Science Communication Program

- **Action**: Fund community-based science communication through existing networks
- **Channels**: Public libraries (16,500+ locations), Cooperative Extension (3,000+ offices), community health centers (1,400+ organizations), science museums (600+ institutions)
- **Focus**: Underserved communities, rural areas, communities of color
- **Approach**: Train local trusted messengers; support culturally appropriate communication; create feedback mechanisms
- **Budget**: $100 million annually
- **Milestone**: Pilot programs in 50 communities by Year 2; scale to 500 by Year 4

#### 2.4 Reform Academic Incentive Structures

- **Action**: NSF and NIH issue guidance that tenure and promotion decisions should consider public engagement
- **Mechanism**: Tie institutional eligibility for federal research funding to adoption of public engagement criteria in evaluation systems
- **Support**: Fund "public engagement portfolios" and assessment systems
- **Timeline**: Guidance by Year 2; adoption by research universities by Year 4-5
- **Milestone**: 50% of R1 universities include public engagement in promotion criteria by Year 5

#### 2.5 Invest in Science Communication Research

- **Action**: Increase federal funding for science communication research
- **Current level**: ~$50 million/year
- **Target**: $200 million/year by Year 4
- **Focus areas**: What works for different audiences; the role of trust; countering misinformation; measuring communication effectiveness; digital platform dynamics
- **Milestone**: Funding doubles by Year 3; reaches target by Year 4

### Phase 2 Budget Estimate

| Item | Annual cost (at full scale) |
|------|---------------------------|
| Federal Science Journalism Fund | $250 million |
| Platform accountability enforcement | $30 million |
| Community science communication | $100 million |
| Academic incentive reform support | $20 million |
| Science communication research | $200 million |
| **Phase 2 total (new spending)** | **~$600 million/year** |

## Phase 3: Transformation (Years 5-10)

### Goal

Achieve systemic change in how science is communicated, received, and integrated into public decision-making.

### Priority Actions

#### 3.1 Integrate Media Literacy into K-12 Education

- **Action**: Develop and disseminate science media literacy curriculum standards, funded by NSF
- **Model**: Finland's media literacy education, adapted for U.S. context
- **Components**: Source evaluation, statistical reasoning, understanding scientific process, recognizing manipulation techniques
- **Implementation**: Through state education agencies and existing standards-setting bodies
- **Timeline**: Standards developed by Year 5; pilot implementation by Year 6; widespread adoption by Year 8-10

#### 3.2 Transition to Engagement Model at Scale

- **Action**: Shift federal science communication from deficit model (one-way information delivery) to engagement model (dialogue and participation)
- **Elements**: Citizen science expansion; community advisory boards for agencies; deliberative forums on science policy; two-way digital engagement
- **Metrics**: Track trust, understanding, and participation rather than simple information delivery
- **Timeline**: Pilot programs by Year 5; institutional adoption by Year 7-10

#### 3.3 Establish Science Communication as a Profession

- **Action**: Develop professional standards, certification, and career pathways for science communicators within the research enterprise
- **Components**: Graduate programs in science communication; professional certifications; career tracks at universities and agencies; professional association development
