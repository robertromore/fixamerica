# Science Communication: History

## Overview

The relationship between science and the American public has evolved through distinct phases, from the popularization efforts of the nineteenth century through the post-war prestige of science, the rise of professional science journalism, the manufactured doubt campaigns of the late twentieth century, and the digital disruption of the twenty-first. Understanding this history reveals that public trust in science has never been static---it has been actively constructed, undermined, and contested throughout American history.

## Timeline of Key Developments

### Early Republic to Gilded Age (1776-1900)

**Science as democratic knowledge:**

- The founding generation valued scientific literacy as essential to self-governance; Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and others were scientist-statesmen
- The Lyceum movement (1826-1860s) brought public lectures on science to hundreds of communities
- Scientific American, founded in 1845, established the popular science magazine as a genre
- The Smithsonian Institution (1846) was created with a mandate for the "increase and diffusion of knowledge"
- World's fairs and expositions (Philadelphia 1876, Chicago 1893) presented science and technology to mass audiences
- Public museums---the American Museum of Natural History (1869), the Field Museum (1893)---became institutions of science education

**Key tension**: Science was largely the province of wealthy amateurs and was communicated through a lens of wonder and progress, with little attention to uncertainty or limitation.

### Progressive Era and Early Twentieth Century (1900-1945)

**Professionalization and public engagement:**

- Science became professionalized through universities, professional societies, and government agencies
- The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) expanded public outreach efforts
- Science Service (1921), founded by journalist E.W. Scripps, created the first wire service for science news
- Paul de Kruif's *Microbe Hunters* (1926) established the narrative nonfiction science genre
- Radio brought science to new audiences through programs like *The Johns Hopkins Science Review* (1948)
- The Manhattan Project and wartime science created both awe and anxiety about scientific power

**Key development**: Vannevar Bush's *Science---The Endless Frontier* (1945) articulated the social compact: public funding for science would yield benefits for society, but scientists should determine research priorities with minimal political interference.

### The Golden Age of Science and the Public (1945-1970)

**Science as national project:**

- Post-war America invested heavily in science, and public enthusiasm was high
- The space race (1957-1969) generated unprecedented public engagement with science and engineering
- Rachel Carson's *Silent Spring* (1962) demonstrated the power of science communication to change policy, sparking the modern environmental movement
- Television brought science to mass audiences through programs like *Mr. Wizard* (1951-1965) and *Wild Kingdom* (1963-1988)
- Government science agencies (NIH, NSF, NASA) developed public affairs offices
- Trust in scientists peaked during this period, with surveys showing 70%+ expressing high confidence

**Key tension**: The thalidomide disaster (1961), nuclear testing concerns, and environmental pollution revealed that science could cause harm as well as good, planting seeds of skepticism.

### The Rise of Science Journalism (1970-2000)

**Professionalization of science reporting:**

- Major newspapers established dedicated science sections: *New York Times* "Science Times" (1978), *Washington Post*, *Boston Globe*, *Los Angeles Times*
- The National Association of Science Writers grew from a few dozen members to over 2,000
- Television science programming expanded: *NOVA* (1974), *Cosmos* with Carl Sagan (1980), *Nature* (1982)
- Sagan became the prototype of the "celebrity scientist" who could communicate complex ideas to millions
- Science magazines proliferated: *Discover* (1980), *Science News*, *New Scientist*
- CNN (1980) and the 24-hour news cycle initially increased science coverage

**Simultaneously, the seeds of crisis were planted:**

- The tobacco industry pioneered the strategy of manufacturing doubt about scientific consensus, spending billions to create uncertainty about the link between smoking and cancer
- Religious conservatives challenged the teaching of evolution, culminating in *Edwards v. Aguillard* (1987)
- The Cold Fusion controversy (1989) showed how media hype could outpace scientific verification
- The "Science Wars" of the 1990s saw postmodern scholars challenge the objectivity of scientific knowledge
- The precautionary principle debates revealed tensions between scientific uncertainty and public demand for definitive answers

### The Manufactured Doubt Era (1990-2010)

**Industry campaigns against science:**

- The fossil fuel industry adopted the tobacco industry's playbook to create doubt about climate science
- ExxonMobil funded organizations like the Global Climate Coalition and the George C. Marshall Institute to challenge the IPCC consensus
- The "Merchants of Doubt" (documented by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway) showed how a small group of scientists were recruited to dispute consensus findings across multiple issues
- The anti-vaccine movement gained traction after Andrew Wakefield's fraudulent 1998 *Lancet* paper linking the MMR vaccine to autism
- Intelligent Design advocates pursued a new strategy to introduce creationism into science classrooms, defeated in *Kitzmiller v. Dover* (2005)
- "Climategate" (2009)---stolen emails from climate scientists---was weaponized to undermine climate science despite multiple investigations exonerating the researchers

**Key development**: These campaigns demonstrated that scientific consensus could be effectively contested in the public sphere through strategic communication, even when the underlying science was overwhelming.

### The Digital Disruption (2005-2020)

**The transformation of information ecosystems:**

| Year | Development | Impact on science communication |
|------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 2004-2006 | Facebook, Twitter, YouTube launch | New direct channels for scientists; new vectors for misinformation |
| 2007-2010 | Smartphone adoption | Science information accessible anywhere, anytime |
| 2008-2012 | Newspaper advertising collapse | Science desks eliminated at dozens of papers |
| 2010 | *Merchants of Doubt* published | Framework for understanding organized science denial |
| 2012 | Facebook surpasses 1 billion users | Social media becomes primary news source for millions |
| 2014 | "Ice Bucket Challenge" | Viral science engagement demonstrates social media potential |
| 2016 | March for Science organized | Scientists enter political sphere at scale |
| 2017 | "Alternative facts" enters discourse | Political delegitimization of expertise accelerates |
| 2018 | IPCC 1.5C report | Urgency of climate communication highlighted |
| 2019 | Anti-vax movement triggers measles outbreaks | Health misinformation consequences become undeniable |

**Key developments:**

- The blogosphere (2004-2012) enabled scientists to communicate directly with the public, bypassing traditional media
- YouTube science channels (Vsauce, MinutePhysics, Veritasium) reached audiences in the millions
- Science Twitter created a vibrant but chaotic arena for real-time scientific discourse
- The decline of gatekeepers meant that misinformation could reach audiences at the same scale as vetted information
- Algorithmic curation replaced editorial judgment in determining what science content people encountered

### The Pandemic and Aftermath (2020-Present)

**COVID-19 as stress test:**

The pandemic represented the most intense test of science communication in American history:

- Scientists and public health officials became household names (Anthony Fauci, Deborah Birx)
- Real-time science communication at scale was attempted for the first time during a rapidly evolving crisis
- Shifting scientific guidance (masks, transmission, treatments) was interpreted by many as evidence of scientific unreliability rather than the iterative nature of science
- Political polarization of public health measures reached extreme levels
- Anti-vaccine movements expanded from a fringe concern to a mainstream political force
- Trust in scientists initially surged, then declined below pre-pandemic levels among Republicans

**Post-pandemic developments (2022-2025):**

- Congressional investigations targeted public health agencies and officials
- State legislatures passed laws restricting public health authority
- Social media platforms retreated from content moderation, including science misinformation policies
- AI-generated misinformation created new challenges for fact-checking
- The "lab leak" debate illustrated the complexity of science communication when uncertainty is genuine and political stakes are high

## Key Historical Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Construction and Destruction of Authority

Scientific authority has never been automatically granted---it has been constructed through institutions, media, and public engagement, and it can be deconstructed through the same means. The tobacco and fossil fuel industries proved that strategic communication campaigns can erode consensus understanding among the public, even when the scientific evidence is overwhelming.

### Pattern 2: Media Technology Shapes Science Communication

Each new medium has transformed how science reaches the public---print, radio, television, the internet, social media. Each has brought both opportunities (wider reach, new formats) and risks (sensationalism, misinformation, loss of context). The current crisis is partly a function of the transition to digital media outpacing the development of new quality-assurance mechanisms.

### Pattern 3: The Deficit Model Persists Despite Evidence

Despite decades of research showing that information deficits are not the primary driver of public skepticism, most science communication efforts still default to "if people just knew the facts, they'd agree." The deficit model persists because it is simple, flattering to scientists, and avoids the harder work of engaging with values, identity, and trust.

### Pattern 4: Politicization Is Cyclical but Escalating

Science has been politicized before---Galileo, Lysenko, the Scopes trial. What distinguishes the current era is the scale (social media amplification), the coordination (industry-funded campaigns), and the breadth (multiple scientific topics simultaneously politicized).

### Pattern 5: Crises Create Windows for Reform

The thalidomide crisis led to FDA reform. The Cuyahoga River fire helped create the EPA. COVID-19 created temporary momentum for investment in science communication. These windows close quickly, making preparedness for reform essential.

## Lessons from History

1. **Scientific authority must be maintained, not assumed.** Public trust is earned through transparency, accountability, and engagement---not through claims of expertise alone.

2. **Manufactured doubt is a proven strategy.** Recognizing and countering strategic doubt campaigns requires institutional capacity, not just individual effort.

3. **Media ecosystems matter as much as scientific content.** The quality of science communication depends on the health of the information ecosystem that delivers it.

4. **The deficit model is insufficient but not irrelevant.** Public knowledge matters, but it must be combined with trust-building, values engagement, and institutional reform.

5. **Communication failures during crises have lasting consequences.** The erosion of trust after COVID-19 will shape science communication challenges for a generation.
