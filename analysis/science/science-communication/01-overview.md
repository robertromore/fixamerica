# Science Communication: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States faces a crisis in science communication that threatens public health, environmental policy, and democratic governance. Declining trust in scientific institutions, the collapse of dedicated science journalism, the rise of misinformation on social media platforms, and a persistent gap between scientific consensus and public understanding have created a dangerous information environment in which evidence-based policymaking becomes increasingly difficult.

Historically, science communication followed a "deficit model"---the assumption that public skepticism of science results from ignorance, and that providing more information would close the gap. Decades of research have shown this model to be inadequate. Public attitudes toward science are shaped by cultural identity, values, trust in institutions, and social networks, not simply by access to facts. The transition to an "engagement model" that treats citizens as active participants rather than passive recipients of knowledge has been slow and incomplete.

Meanwhile, structural changes in the media ecosystem have hollowed out the infrastructure that once mediated scientific information for the public. The number of full-time science journalists at major outlets has declined by more than half since 2000. Social media algorithms amplify sensational and emotionally resonant content, favoring misinformation over nuanced scientific findings. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and accelerated every fault line: expert credibility was simultaneously elevated and undermined, health misinformation proliferated at unprecedented scale, and political polarization around scientific questions reached new extremes.

Effective science communication is not a luxury---it is a prerequisite for a functioning democracy that must make decisions about climate change, emerging technologies, public health, and national security based on the best available evidence.

## The Core Problem

### The Trust Gap

Public trust in science varies dramatically by topic and by demographic group:

| Issue | Scientific Consensus | Public Agreement | Gap |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|-----|
| Climate change is human-caused | 97%+ of climate scientists | ~57% of U.S. adults | ~40 points |
| Vaccines are safe and effective | Overwhelming medical consensus | ~70% confident | ~25 points |
| Evolution by natural selection | 98%+ of biologists | ~60% of U.S. adults | ~35 points |
| GMO foods are safe to eat | 88% of AAAS scientists | ~37% of U.S. adults | ~50 points |

### The Media Ecosystem Collapse

| Metric | 2000 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Full-time newspaper science reporters | ~95 | ~35 | -63% |
| Science sections in major dailies | ~95 | ~20 | -79% |
| Network TV science coverage hours/year | ~500 | ~150 | -70% |
| Science-focused podcasts | 0 | 4,000+ | New medium |
| Social media science content creators | 0 | Millions | New medium |

### The Misinformation Challenge

- An MIT study found false news stories spread six times faster than true ones on social media
- Health misinformation reaches millions before corrections can be issued
- Industry-funded "doubt merchants" have successfully delayed action on tobacco, climate, and other issues for decades
- AI-generated content is making the production of convincing misinformation cheaper and faster

## By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Americans who trust scientists to act in public interest | ~57% (Pew, 2024) |
| Partisan gap in science trust (Dem. vs. Rep.) | ~30 points |
| Americans who get science news from social media | ~45% |
| Americans who can identify a scientific hypothesis | ~50% |
| Annual revenue decline in journalism (2005-2024) | ~60% |
| NIH spending on science communication research | <$50 million/year |
| Scientists who received media training | ~15% |
| Science misinformation posts removed by platforms (2020-2023) | Millions, inconsistently |

## Key Concepts

### Communication Models

**Deficit Model**: Assumes public skepticism stems from lack of knowledge; solution is to provide more facts. Simple but largely ineffective for controversial topics.

**Engagement Model**: Treats communication as dialogue; incorporates public values, concerns, and participation. More effective but harder to scale.

**Cultural Cognition**: People interpret scientific information through the lens of their cultural identity and group affiliations, often rejecting evidence that threatens their worldview.

**Motivated Reasoning**: People seek out and preferentially accept information that confirms their existing beliefs, while scrutinizing or dismissing contradictory evidence.

### Key Distinctions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Misinformation** | False or misleading information spread without intent to deceive |
| **Disinformation** | Deliberately false information spread to deceive |
| **Malinformation** | Genuine information shared out of context to mislead |
| **Science denial** | Rejection of well-established scientific findings |
| **Manufactured doubt** | Strategic creation of uncertainty to delay action |

### Trust Formation and Erosion

1. **Competence**: Does the public perceive scientists as knowledgeable?
2. **Integrity**: Does the public believe scientists are honest and transparent?
3. **Benevolence**: Does the public believe scientists care about their well-being?
4. **Value alignment**: Does the public feel scientists share their values and concerns?
5. **Institutional trust**: Does the public trust the institutions that govern science?

## Why This Matters

### For Public Health

Misinformation about vaccines, treatments, and disease prevention directly costs lives. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that communication failures can turn a health crisis into a political crisis, leading to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths.

### For Climate Action

The gap between scientific consensus on climate change and public understanding has delayed meaningful policy action for decades. Effective science communication is a prerequisite for the political will needed to address climate change.

### For Democratic Governance

Democracy requires an informed citizenry capable of evaluating evidence and making reasoned judgments about policy. When science communication fails, demagogues and special interests fill the vacuum with misinformation that serves their agendas.

### For Scientific Enterprise

Public distrust threatens the political support for research funding, regulatory authority, and the institutional independence that science requires to function. Without public trust, the social compact between science and society erodes.
