# Science Communication: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to science communication reform comes from multiple sources with different motivations: industries that profit from public confusion about scientific findings, political actors who leverage anti-expert sentiment, ideological movements that view science as threatening to their values, and even well-meaning actors who resist reform for legitimate reasons related to free speech, government overreach, or concerns about scientific institutions themselves. Understanding opposition requires distinguishing between bad-faith actors who deliberately manufacture doubt and good-faith critics whose concerns deserve engagement.

## Industry-Funded Science Denial

### The Fossil Fuel Industry

**What they oppose**: Effective communication of climate science consensus, which would strengthen the case for regulations that threaten their business model.

**Strategy**: Adapted from the tobacco industry playbook documented by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway in *Merchants of Doubt* (2010):

1. **Fund contrarian scientists**: Provide financial support and media platforms for the small minority of researchers who dispute the consensus
2. **Create front organizations**: Establish think tanks and advocacy groups that appear independent but serve industry interests (Global Climate Coalition, Heartland Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute)
3. **Emphasize uncertainty**: Highlight areas of legitimate scientific uncertainty to create the impression that the entire body of climate science is unsettled
4. **Attack the process**: Characterize scientific consensus as "groupthink," peer review as "gatekeeping," and climate models as unreliable
5. **Frame as economic threat**: Position climate action as job-killing, economy-destroying overregulation

**Scale**: ExxonMobil alone spent an estimated $40 million between 1998 and 2014 on organizations that spread climate disinformation. The broader fossil fuel industry network has spent billions on lobbying, advertising, and communications designed to delay climate action.

**Effectiveness**: Despite 97%+ scientific consensus on human-caused climate change, only ~57% of the American public accepts this finding---a gap that industry campaigns have deliberately maintained.

### The Pharmaceutical and Alternative Health Industries

**What they oppose**: Different segments oppose different aspects of science communication:

- **Alternative health industry** ($60+ billion annually): Opposes effective communication of evidence-based medicine, which threatens sales of unproven supplements, treatments, and wellness products
- **Pharmaceutical industry**: Opposes transparency in clinical trial data, which could expose unfavorable results; also benefits from public trust in medicine generally

**Strategies:**

- Alternative health influencers build distrust of conventional medicine while promoting their own products
- "Natural" health narratives position pharmaceuticals as toxic and science as corrupted by industry
- Social media marketing creates the appearance of grassroots skepticism while driving product sales

### The Tobacco Industry (Historical Model)

**Legacy**: The tobacco industry's multi-decade campaign to deny the link between smoking and cancer (1953-1990s) created the template for all subsequent science denial campaigns. Key innovations included:

- Creating the Tobacco Industry Research Committee to fund "alternative research"
- Hiring public relations firms to develop messaging strategies for scientific doubt
- Identifying and promoting scientists willing to publicly dispute the consensus
- Using free speech and academic freedom arguments to defend the dissemination of misleading claims
- Maintaining scientific controversy long after internal documents showed the industry knew its products were deadly

**Relevance today**: Every major science denial campaign since has followed this model. Understanding the tobacco template is essential for recognizing and countering current denial operations.

## Political Opposition

### Elected Officials

**Who**: Members of Congress and state legislators who actively oppose science communication reform or undermine science communication:

**Motivations:**

| Motivation | Mechanism | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Donor protection | Opposing climate communication protects fossil fuel donors | Blocking EPA science communication budgets |
| Base mobilization | Anti-expert populism energizes voters | Attacks on Fauci, CDC, "the science" |
| Ideological commitment | Government communication seen as propaganda | Defunding agency public affairs |
| Regulatory opposition | Science communication strengthens case for regulation | Attacking scientific consensus to weaken regulatory basis |

**Tactics:**

- Cutting science agency communication budgets through appropriations riders
- Holding hostile hearings to intimidate scientists and agency officials
- Passing state laws restricting public health communication authority
- Appointing officials hostile to science communication to leadership positions at agencies
- Using congressional investigation authority to target scientists who communicate publicly

### Political Media

**Who**: Media outlets and commentators across the political spectrum who benefit from framing science as political:

**Right-wing media:**

- Fox News, Newsmax, OAN regularly feature climate skepticism and anti-public health messaging
- Talk radio hosts (historically Rush Limbaugh, currently others) have built audiences partly through anti-science commentary
- Right-wing podcasts and YouTube channels amplify science denial narratives

**Anti-establishment media (left and right):**

- Some progressive outlets promote anti-GMO and anti-nuclear messaging that contradicts scientific consensus
- Anti-corporate narratives sometimes extend to rejecting industry-independent science
- "Both sides" false balance in mainstream media gives equal weight to fringe positions

**Why they persist**: Anti-science content generates engagement, which generates advertising revenue. The business model rewards controversy over accuracy.

## Ideological Opposition

### Religious Opposition to Specific Scientific Findings

**Who**: Religious communities and organizations that view certain scientific findings as incompatible with their beliefs.

| Scientific finding | Religious objection | Organizational presence |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Evolution | Contradicts literal biblical creation | Discovery Institute, Answers in Genesis, Institute for Creation Research |
| Age of the universe | Contradicts young-earth interpretation | Same organizations |
| Stem cell research | Moral objection to embryo destruction | Various religious organizations |
| Climate change | Ranges from skepticism to "God controls the climate" | Cornwall Alliance |

**Important distinction**: Many religious leaders and organizations strongly support science communication. The Vatican, the National Council of Churches, and many evangelical leaders have affirmed the reality of climate change and the value of science. Religious opposition to science communication is significant but not representative of all religious perspectives.

### Libertarian and Anti-Government Opposition

**What they oppose**: Government-funded or government-directed science communication, which they view as potential propaganda, paternalism, or government overreach.

**Core arguments:**

- Government should not be in the business of telling people what to believe
- Public funding for science communication gives government a monopoly on information
- Market forces should determine what science information the public receives
- Content moderation of misinformation constitutes censorship
- Individual responsibility, not government intervention, should guide information consumption

**Validity assessment**: These concerns deserve engagement. Government science communication *can* be used for propaganda (as demonstrated by political interference with agency communications). The challenge is designing systems that protect scientific integrity while respecting individual liberty and avoiding government censorship.

### "Do Your Own Research" Culture

**Who**: A broad, politically heterogeneous movement that distrusts institutional authority and believes individuals can and should evaluate scientific evidence independently.

**Driving factors:**

- Legitimate institutional failures (Tuskegee, opioid crisis, Iraq WMD claims) that eroded trust
- Internet access to primary research that was previously inaccessible to non-experts
- Social media communities that validate independent investigation
- Perceived condescension from experts who dismiss public concerns
- Genuine desire for autonomy and informed self-governance

**Challenge for reform**: This movement includes both conspiratorial thinkers impervious to evidence and genuine citizen-scientists who want to engage more deeply with research. Effective science communication must find ways to support productive engagement while countering misinformation.

## Good-Faith Critics of Science Communication Reform

### Free Speech Advocates

**Concern**: Government intervention in science communication---labeling content, regulating platforms, funding "approved" messaging---could infringe on First Amendment rights.

**Specific arguments:**

- Government determination of what constitutes "misinformation" is inherently political
- Content moderation mandates give government control over speech
- Even well-intentioned censorship creates precedents that can be abused
- The remedy for bad speech is more speech, not censorship
- Government-funded communication campaigns can become propaganda

**How to engage**: These concerns are constitutionally grounded and must be addressed in any legislative approach. Solutions should emphasize transparency, disclosure, and support for quality journalism rather than content control.

### Scientists Who Oppose Communication Mandates

**Concern**: Requiring scientists to engage in public communication could reduce research productivity, lead to oversimplification, and politicize individual researchers.

**Specific arguments:**

- Not all scientists are good communicators, and forcing engagement could produce poor-quality communication
- Time spent on communication is time not spent on research
- Public exposure increases the risk of harassment, especially for women and minority scientists
- Oversimplification can distort findings and mislead the public
- Scientists should not be political advocates

**How to engage**: Reform should create *opportunities* and *incentives* for communication, not mandates. Training, institutional support, and professional communication staff can address quality concerns. Harassment protections are essential.

### Media Skeptics

**Concern**: Proposals to fund science journalism through government subsidies or platform mandates could compromise editorial independence.

**Specific arguments:**

- Government-funded journalism is not independent journalism
- Platform-mandated revenue sharing gives platforms influence over editorial decisions
- Designated "authoritative sources" creates a hierarchy that marginalizes independent journalists
- Science journalism should serve the public, not the scientific establishment

**How to engage**: Funding mechanisms must include robust editorial independence protections, modeled on successful examples like the BBC, NPR, or the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Independence should be structural, not merely aspirational.

## Opposition Power Assessment

| Opposition group | Financial power | Political power | Cultural influence | Likely to change |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Fossil fuel industry | Very high | Very high | Moderate | Only with regulation |
| Alternative health industry | High | Moderate | High | Only with enforcement |
| Political opponents | Moderate | Very high | High | Only with electoral pressure |
| Political media | Moderate | High | Very high | Only with market changes |
| Religious opponents | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate in specific communities | Partially, with engagement |
| Libertarian critics | Low | Moderate | Moderate | Partially, with design |
| Free speech advocates | Low | Moderate | High | With careful legislation |

## Strategic Implications

### Opponents That Must Be Overcome

Industry-funded denial campaigns and political actors who deliberately undermine science communication cannot be persuaded---they must be countered through:

- Disclosure requirements for funding of science denial organizations
- Platform accountability for algorithmic amplification of misinformation
- Statutory protections for government science communication
- Public investment in independent science journalism

### Critics That Must Be Engaged

Good-faith critics---free speech advocates, scientists concerned about mandates, media independence advocates---must be treated as partners in designing better solutions:

- Legislative proposals must pass First Amendment scrutiny
- Communication programs should incentivize rather than mandate participation
- Funding mechanisms must protect editorial independence
- Transparency and accountability should apply to science communication itself

### Communities That Must Be Heard

Communities with legitimate distrust require a fundamentally different approach:

- Acknowledge historical harms and ongoing injustices
- Center community voices and concerns in communication design
- Invest in local trusted messengers rather than national campaigns
- Ensure that science communication reform addresses power imbalances, not just information deficits
