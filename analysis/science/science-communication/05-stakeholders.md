# Science Communication: Stakeholders

## Overview

The science communication ecosystem involves a wide range of stakeholders with varying degrees of power, interest, and capacity to influence reform. This analysis maps who is affected by the current crisis, who has the power to change it, and where interests align or conflict. Effective reform requires understanding these dynamics and building coalitions among stakeholders whose interests, while not identical, are compatible.

## Primary Stakeholders

### The General Public

**Role**: Ultimate audience for science communication; citizens whose decisions---about health, voting, consumption, and community---depend on accurate scientific information.

**How affected:**

- Exposed to misinformation that influences health decisions (vaccine refusal, unproven treatments)
- Unable to make informed judgments on policy issues shaped by science (climate, AI, public health)
- Varying levels of scientific literacy (only ~28% of Americans considered scientifically literate by NSF metrics)
- Dependent on intermediaries (journalists, social media, government) for science information

**Subgroups with distinct interests:**

| Subgroup | Specific interest | Key concern |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Parents | Child health, school curriculum | Vaccine safety, science education quality |
| Patients | Treatment information | Accuracy of health information, access to clinical trial data |
| Rural communities | Environmental and agricultural science | Relevance to local concerns, distrust of outside experts |
| Communities of color | Health equity, environmental justice | Historical mistreatment, representation in research |
| Older adults | Health and technology information | Digital literacy, trusted sources |
| Young adults (18-29) | Climate, technology, career | Social media as primary information channel |

**Power**: High in aggregate (voters, consumers, research participants) but diffuse and difficult to mobilize on communication reform specifically.

### Scientists and Researchers

**Role**: Producers of scientific knowledge; increasingly expected to also serve as communicators.

**How affected:**
