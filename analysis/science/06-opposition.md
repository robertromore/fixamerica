# Science Policy: Opposition Analysis

## Overview

Opposition to science policy reform comes from diverse sources with different motivations. Some oppose increased government spending on principle. Others benefit from the current system's dysfunction. Still others object to specific reforms that threaten their interests. Understanding the landscape of opposition is essential for designing politically viable reform strategies.

## Primary Opponents and Their Motivations

### Fiscal Conservatives and Anti-Spending Advocates

**Who**: Budget hawks in Congress, deficit-focused think tanks (Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute fiscal policy programs), taxpayer advocacy groups

**Stated Position**: Federal spending must be reduced; science funding should compete with all other discretionary spending on its merits; the private sector can fund research more efficiently.

**Underlying Concerns**:

- Genuine belief that government spending crowds out private innovation
- Concern that research funding is a form of corporate welfare for universities
- Skepticism about the economic returns claimed for publicly funded research
- Resistance to any growth in discretionary spending

**Tactics**:

- Opposing appropriations increases for research agencies
- Highlighting examples of seemingly frivolous research projects (the "Golden Fleece" tradition)
- Promoting across-the-board spending cuts that include research
- Using continuing resolutions and debt ceiling negotiations as leverage

**Evidence**: Heritage Foundation budget proposals have repeatedly recommended cuts to NSF, NIH, and DOE research programs. The annual "Wastebook" reports from some congressional offices single out individual grants to ridicule publicly funded research.

### Those Who Politicize Science

**Who**: Politicians, media figures, and advocacy groups that selectively embrace or reject scientific findings based on political convenience

**Motivations**:

- Maintaining policy positions that conflict with scientific evidence (especially on climate change, public health, and environmental regulation)
- Mobilizing political bases through anti-establishment messaging
- Protecting industries (fossil fuels, tobacco, chemicals) whose products are implicated by research
- Genuine ideological disagreements about the role of expertise in democratic governance

**Tactics**:

- Attacking individual scientists and their credibility
- Demanding "balance" between scientific consensus and fringe positions
- Defunding or restricting research in politically inconvenient areas
- Appointing industry representatives to scientific advisory boards
- Restricting government scientists' ability to communicate findings

**Impact**: Politicization of science has been the single most damaging force to the science-society relationship, contributing to the 37-percentage-point partisan gap in trust in scientists.

### Academic Publishers Resisting Open Access

**Who**: Major commercial publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, SAGE), publishing industry associations

**Stakes**: The global scholarly publishing market generates approximately $28 billion annually, with profit margins of 30-40% for the largest publishers.

**Stated Position**: Open access mandates threaten the sustainability of peer review and publishing infrastructure; the current system serves science well; rapid transition would be destabilizing.

**Underlying Concerns**:

- Open access mandates directly threaten subscription revenue, which is the primary business model
- Shift to author-pays (article processing charges) may not fully replace lost revenue
- Loss of market power as research becomes freely available

**Tactics**:

- Lobbying Congress and agency officials against open access requirements
- Promoting "green" open access (delayed access after embargo) as sufficient
- Supporting the Research Works Act (2012, unsuccessful) that would have prohibited open access mandates
- Offering hybrid models that maintain subscription pricing while charging authors for open access
- Emphasizing the value publishers add through peer review management and editorial services

### Universities Protecting Overhead Revenue

**Who**: University administrators, research vice presidents, the Association of American Universities (AAU), the Council on Governmental Relations (COGR)

**What they protect**: Indirect cost recovery -- the percentage of each federal grant that goes to the institution for facilities and administrative costs, typically 50-65% of direct costs.

**Scale**: Approximately $11 billion per year flows to universities through indirect cost recovery on NIH grants alone.

**Stated Position**: Indirect costs are necessary to support the research infrastructure (buildings, utilities, compliance, libraries, administration) that makes research possible. Cuts to indirect cost rates would force universities to subsidize federal research from other revenue sources.

**Underlying Concerns**:

- Indirect cost revenue is a significant and relatively predictable revenue stream
- Some universities use indirect cost recovery to cross-subsidize other institutional activities
- Reducing rates would make research less financially attractive to institutions
- Transparency about how indirect cost funds are spent could reveal controversial allocations

**Tactics**:

- Opposing any caps on indirect cost rates
- Lobbying against transparency requirements for indirect cost spending
- Framing overhead as essential infrastructure investment
- Warning that cuts would force universities to close labs or reduce research

### Agencies Protecting Turf

**Who**: Individual federal agencies resistant to coordination or restructuring

**Motivations**:

- Maintaining budget autonomy and programmatic authority
- Protecting institutional culture and mission identity
- Resisting oversight or coordination by OSTP or OMB
- Competing with other agencies for congressional support

**Tactics**:

- Emphasizing unique mission requirements to justify independent operations
- Building strong relationships with congressional authorization and appropriations committees
- Resisting interagency coordination initiatives
- Framing reform proposals as threats to mission effectiveness

## Secondary Opponents

### Industry Groups Opposing Specific Reforms

| Industry | Reform They Oppose | Reason |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Pharmaceutical companies | Drug pricing tied to federally funded research | Threatens pricing power |
| Fossil fuel industry | Climate science funding and communication | Findings threaten business model |
| Defense contractors | Shift from defense to civilian R&D | Reduces defense R&D funding |
| Agricultural chemical companies | Research on pesticide health effects | Findings may lead to regulation |
| For-profit testing companies | Reforms to standardized testing in STEM | Threatens market |

### Status Quo Beneficiaries in Academia

Some senior researchers and established institutions benefit from the current system's dysfunction:

- **Well-funded principal investigators** benefit from a system where success breeds success (the "Matthew effect")
- **Elite institutions** benefit from geographic and prestige concentration of funding
- **Those who succeeded under current rules** may resist changes that benefit the next generation at their expense
- **Faculty governance structures** at many universities give disproportionate voice to senior faculty

## Opposition Messaging and Narratives

### Common Arguments Against Science Reform

| Argument | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| "The system works -- look at mRNA vaccines" | Vaccines built on decades of basic research that nearly lost funding multiple times |
| "Competition makes science stronger" | Beyond a point, competition wastes resources and encourages corner-cutting |
| "Government shouldn't pick winners" | All funding decisions involve choices; the question is what criteria guide them |
| "Universities should fund their own research" | Tuition and state funding have already been cut; research universities depend on federal grants |
| "American science is still the best" | True but the margin is shrinking; complacency is the greatest risk |
| "If we spend more, it will just be wasted" | Unfunded grant applications rated "excellent" by peer review demonstrate unmet demand |
| "Scientists are liberal elites" | Scientists span the political spectrum; the issue is evidence, not ideology |

## Weaknesses in Opposition Positions

### Fiscal Conservative Weakness

The return on investment in federal research is among the highest of any government expenditure. The Human Genome Project returned an estimated $141 for every $1 invested. GPS, the internet, and mRNA vaccines all originated from federally funded research. Cutting science funding to reduce the deficit is penny-wise and pound-foolish.

### Politicization Weakness

Anti-science positions are increasingly unpopular with younger voters and educated suburban voters, creating long-term political risks for those who embrace them. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that undermining scientific institutions has tangible, deadly consequences.

### Publisher Weakness

The trend toward open access is accelerating globally. The European Union's Plan S, the UK's open access mandate, and the U.S. Nelson Memo are creating a global open access environment that publishers cannot resist indefinitely. Their business model is transitioning whether they cooperate or not.

### Overhead Resistance Weakness

Growing scrutiny of university spending -- including executive compensation, administrative bloat, and luxury amenities funded partly by overhead revenue -- undermines the claim that every overhead dollar is essential. Transparency would strengthen universities that spend wisely and expose those that do not.

## Counter-Strategies

### For Fiscal Opposition

- Frame science funding as investment, not expense, with documented economic returns
- Highlight national security implications of underinvestment (China competition)
- Build bipartisan coalitions around specific programs with clear constituent benefits
- Propose efficiency reforms alongside funding increases to demonstrate fiscal responsibility
- Emphasize that unfunded excellent proposals represent wasted opportunity

### For Politicization

- Depoliticize science communication by emphasizing shared values (health, prosperity, security)
- Support scientists running for office and engaging in civic life
- Strengthen institutional protections for scientific integrity
- Invest in science literacy and critical thinking education
- Build trust through transparency and public engagement

### For Publisher Resistance

- Implement open access mandates with clear timelines and enforcement
- Support alternative publishing models (preprints, open access journals, institutional repositories)
- Redirect subscription spending toward open access infrastructure
- Ensure Article Processing Charges do not create new barriers for underfunded researchers

### For Overhead Resistance

- Propose transparency requirements rather than arbitrary rate caps
- Develop metrics that distinguish productive infrastructure spending from administrative bloat
- Offer incentives for institutions that reduce overhead while maintaining research quality
- Engage university presidents as reform partners rather than adversaries

### For Agency Turf Protection

- Strengthen OSTP's coordination authority with congressional backing
- Create cross-agency funding mechanisms for interdisciplinary challenges
- Reward agencies that collaborate effectively
- Restore the Office of Technology Assessment or equivalent congressional science capacity
