# STEM Workforce: Solutions

## Reform Strategy

Effective reform must address the STEM workforce crisis at multiple levels: the graduate training pipeline, postdoctoral working conditions, academic career structures, immigration pathways, and the information environment. No single intervention is sufficient because the problems are systemic. The solutions below are organized from the most targeted to the most structural.

## Solution 1: Transparent Career Outcome Reporting

### The Problem

Prospective graduate students lack standardized, accessible data on what happens to PhD graduates from specific programs. Without this information, students cannot make informed enrollment decisions, and departments face no accountability for poor career outcomes.

### The Proposal

Require all PhD programs that receive federal research funding to track and publicly report career outcomes for all graduates at 1, 5, and 10 years post-graduation. Reports must use standardized taxonomy (academic tenure-track, academic non-tenure-track, industry, government, nonprofit, other employment, unemployed) and disaggregate by demographic category.

### How It Works

- NSF and NIH condition training grant eligibility on career outcome reporting
- Programs use a standardized reporting framework developed by professional societies and agencies
- Data are published in a searchable, publicly accessible database
- Programs with consistently poor outcomes face enhanced review of their training practices

### Evidence

- The Coalition for Next Generation Life Sciences launched a voluntary career outcome reporting initiative in 2017, and participating institutions saw no decline in applications, contradicting fears that transparency would deter students
- The UK's Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education survey has been operating for decades, providing a model for systematic outcome tracking

### Limitations

- Tracking graduates over 10 years is logistically challenging
- Programs may game metrics by changing how they classify outcomes
- Transparency alone does not reduce PhD production---students may still enroll despite poor odds

## Solution 2: Postdoctoral Position Reform

### The Problem

Postdocs are poorly compensated, classified as trainees to avoid employee protections, and serve indefinite terms with no clear path to career advancement.

### The Proposal

Restructure postdoctoral positions around three principles: adequate compensation, time limits, and genuine career development.

### Specific Measures

- **Salary floor**: Set a federal minimum postdoc salary at NIH NRSA Year 0 level, indexed to inflation and adjusted for cost of living, for all institutions receiving federal research funding. Raise the NRSA minimum to $70,000 by 2028.
- **Time limits**: Cap federally funded postdoc positions at five years total (across all institutions). After five years, researchers must be hired into staff scientist, research faculty, or other permanent positions---or the PI must justify an extension.
- **Employee classification**: Require that all postdocs at institutions receiving federal funds be classified as employees (not trainees) with full access to benefits, retirement contributions, unemployment insurance, and labor protections.
- **Career development**: Require that 10% of postdoc effort be devoted to professional development activities, including industry exposure, grant writing, teaching, and career planning. Fund these activities through a dedicated line in training grants.

### Evidence

- Germany's system sets postdoc positions at roughly 100% of the public-sector pay scale for comparably educated professionals, with a 6-year cap (12 years total including PhD) before a permanent position must be offered
- The University of California postdoc union contract (UAW 5810) negotiated salary minimums of $66,250-$70,000 by 2024, with full benefits, demonstrating feasibility

### Limitations

- Higher postdoc costs may reduce the number of positions, potentially harming some early-career researchers
- PIs may shift to hiring technicians or research associates instead, which may or may not be a worse outcome
- Time limits may create pressure to produce results quickly, potentially compromising research quality

## Solution 3: Graduate Program Right-Sizing

### The Problem

PhD programs are sized to meet departmental labor needs rather than labor market demand, producing far more PhDs than permanent research positions can absorb.

### The Proposal

Use federal funding levers to encourage---and eventually require---PhD programs to align enrollment with career outcomes.

### Specific Measures

- **Outcome-based training grant allocation**: Weight training grant funding toward programs with strong career outcome data (not just academic placements, but positive career outcomes broadly defined)
- **Funding mechanism reform**: Shift the balance of graduate funding from research assistantships (which incentivize enrollment expansion) toward fellowships (which go directly to students and can be capped)
- **Program review requirements**: Require programs receiving federal training support to undergo periodic external review of their enrollment, completion, and career outcome data
- **Incentive restructuring**: Provide supplemental funding to programs that implement evidence-based practices for career preparation, mentoring, and workforce alignment

### Evidence

- Japan reduced its postdoctoral researcher surplus through a combination of program consolidation and government-funded transition programs
- Several U.S. chemistry departments have voluntarily reduced PhD admissions and seen improved per-student funding, shorter time-to-degree, and better career outcomes

### Limitations

- Reducing admissions may disproportionately affect underrepresented groups if not implemented with equity considerations
- Departments will resist any change that reduces their graduate student labor force
- Outcome-based metrics are complex and can create perverse incentives

## Solution 4: STEM Immigration Reform

### The Problem

The U.S. immigration system simultaneously attracts international STEM talent and creates conditions that suppress wages, limit mobility, and drive scientists away.

### The Proposal

Reform visa and green card systems to attract, empower, and retain international scientists.

### Specific Measures

- **STEM visa portability**: Allow H-1B holders in STEM occupations to change employers without losing status, eliminating employer dependence
- **STEM green card track**: Create a dedicated green card category for STEM PhD holders from U.S. institutions, exempt from per-country caps, with expedited processing (target: 12 months from application to approval)
- **Startup visa**: Create a visa category for scientists and engineers starting companies based on their research
- **Dual-intent J-1**: Allow J-1 researchers to apply for permanent residence without triggering the two-year home residency requirement
- **O-1 streamlining**: Simplify the O-1 extraordinary ability visa application process for scientists with strong publication records and research funding

### Evidence

- Canada's Express Entry system processes skilled worker applications in approximately six months and has attracted significant numbers of scientists who might otherwise have gone to the U.S.
- The UK's Global Talent visa provides a streamlined immigration pathway for scientists and has been successful in attracting researchers post-Brexit
- Countries that have implemented portable work visas (Australia, Canada) have not experienced the workforce instability that opponents predict

### Limitations

- Immigration reform faces perennial congressional gridlock
- Expanding STEM immigration without addressing domestic wage suppression concerns will face opposition from labor advocates
- Per-country green card cap reform affects all employment-based immigration and involves complex legislative tradeoffs

## Solution 5: Alternative Career Path Infrastructure

### The Problem

PhD training is oriented almost exclusively toward academic careers, yet 70%+ of PhD graduates will work outside academia. Those who leave face cultural stigma, skill gaps, and inadequate institutional support.

### The Proposal

Restructure graduate and postdoctoral training to prepare scientists for the full range of careers they will actually hold.

### Specific Measures

- **Curricular reform**: Require PhD programs to include coursework or modules in project management, communication, teamwork, entrepreneurship, science policy, and industry research practices
- **Industry internships**: Fund structured internship programs that allow graduate students and postdocs to spend 3-6 months in industry, government, or nonprofit settings without penalty to their academic progress
- **Career services**: Fund dedicated PhD career services offices at research universities, staffed by professionals with non-academic career experience
- **Cultural change**: Redefine success metrics for PhD programs to include industry, government, and nonprofit placements alongside academic positions
- **Alumni networks**: Build and maintain networks of PhD graduates in diverse careers who can serve as mentors and role models

### Evidence

- The NIH BEST (Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training) program funded universities to develop career development programs for biomedical PhD students. Participating institutions reported improved student satisfaction and career preparation.
- The University of California San Francisco's career development office is a model for PhD-focused career services, with dedicated staff, employer relationships, and programming
- Many European doctoral programs (particularly in Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK) incorporate structured professional development and industry exposure

### Limitations

- Faculty may resist using training time for non-research activities
- Industry internships require relationships with employers that many institutions lack
- Cultural change is slow and difficult to mandate

## Solution 6: Reversing Adjunctification

### The Problem

The replacement of tenure-track faculty with adjuncts and contingent instructors degrades teaching quality, research capacity, and the academic profession.

### The Proposal

Implement a combination of federal, state, and institutional policies to rebuild the tenure-track faculty and improve conditions for contingent faculty.

### Specific Measures

- **Federal funding conditions**: Condition institutional eligibility for federal student aid on maintaining a minimum ratio of tenure-track to contingent faculty (e.g., at least 50% of credit hours taught by tenure-track or full-time faculty)
- **Adjunct pay floor**: Establish a minimum per-course payment for adjuncts at institutions receiving federal funds, pegged to a fraction of the full-time faculty equivalent salary
- **Conversion pathways**: Require institutions to create pathways for long-serving adjuncts to transition to full-time positions with benefits
- **Pro rata benefits**: Require that adjuncts teaching at least half-time receive pro rata benefits (health insurance, retirement, professional development)
- **State legislation**: Support model state legislation establishing adjunct faculty rights, minimum pay, and benefits requirements

### Evidence

- The City University of New York (CUNY) adjunct union has negotiated significant improvements in adjunct pay, benefits, and job security, providing a model for other systems
- Vancouver Community College in Canada converted the majority of its contingent positions to regular appointments, resulting in improved teaching quality and student satisfaction
- Several states (California, Massachusetts, Colorado) have enacted or considered legislation addressing adjunct pay and working conditions

### Limitations

- Increasing instructional costs may be passed to students through higher tuition
- Institutions may respond by reducing course offerings rather than improving adjunct conditions
- A 50% tenure-track threshold may be too ambitious for some institution types (e.g., community colleges)

## Solution 7: Federal Research Workforce Strategy

### The Problem

No entity is responsible for the overall health of the STEM workforce. Funding agencies, universities, professional societies, and employers each manage their piece without coordination.

### The Proposal

Create a coordinated federal strategy for the research workforce, analogous to workforce planning in other sectors.

### Specific Measures

- **Interagency workforce coordination**: Establish an interagency working group (NIH, NSF, DOE, DOD, OSTP) responsible for monitoring the STEM workforce and coordinating training investments
- **National STEM workforce data system**: Create a comprehensive, longitudinal data system tracking STEM workers from graduate school through their careers, modeled on the Census Bureau's LEHD program
- **Periodic workforce assessments**: Mandate biennial reports on the state of the STEM workforce, with recommendations for adjusting training investment
- **Research on research**: Fund research on the effectiveness of different training models, career interventions, and workforce policies

### Evidence

- The UK's Research Councils have implemented coordinated workforce planning, including doctoral training partnerships that link funding to career outcomes
- Germany's Max Planck Society conducts systematic career tracking and adjusts training programs based on employment data

### Limitations

- Interagency coordination is difficult to sustain across administrations
- A national data system raises privacy concerns
- Workforce planning risks government overreach into academic autonomy
