# STEM Workforce: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Reforming the STEM workforce requires legislation addressing two distinct but interconnected problems: the dysfunction of the domestic academic labor market (PhD overproduction, postdoc exploitation, adjunctification) and the dysfunction of the immigration system for scientists (visa dependence, green card backlogs, brain drain). This document provides draft text for two federal bills targeting these problems, along with state model legislation, regulatory frameworks, and a loopholes analysis.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Research Workforce Fairness and Transparency Act

**Purpose**: Restructure the postdoctoral research system, mandate career outcome transparency for federally funded PhD programs, and establish minimum standards for the treatment of research trainees at institutions receiving federal research funding.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Research Workforce Fairness
and Transparency Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
    (1) The United States invests over $40 billion annually
    through the National Institutes of Health, the National
    Science Foundation, and other agencies in research
    conducted at universities and research institutions.
    (2) This investment supports approximately 60,000 to
    80,000 postdoctoral researchers and over 300,000
    graduate research assistants who perform the majority
    of federally funded research.
    (3) Postdoctoral researchers earn salaries significantly
    below comparably educated professionals, are frequently
    classified as trainees rather than employees, and serve
    in positions of indefinite duration with limited career
    advancement prospects.
    (4) Prospective graduate students lack standardized,
    publicly available data on the career outcomes of PhD
    program graduates, preventing informed enrollment
    decisions.
    (5) The structural misalignment between PhD production
    and permanent research positions wastes public
    investment in scientific training and imposes personal
    costs on early-career researchers.
(b) PURPOSE.—The purposes of this Act are—
    (1) to establish minimum compensation and employment
    standards for postdoctoral researchers at institutions
    receiving Federal research funding;
    (2) to require transparent reporting of career outcomes
    for PhD programs receiving Federal training support;
    (3) to promote the development of career preparation
    programs for PhD students and postdoctoral researchers;
    and
    (4) to limit the duration of postdoctoral appointments
    funded by Federal research grants.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

may be necessary to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** addresses the two most immediate postdoc welfare issues: employee classification (ending the "trainee" loophole) and adequate compensation. The salary floor is set above the current NRSA minimum to signal that the minimum is too low, while the cost-of-living supplement addresses geographic variation. The five-year cap prevents indefinite postdoc extensions while allowing for extensions in genuinely meritorious cases.

- **Section 5** creates the data infrastructure necessary for all subsequent reforms. Without career outcome data, prospective students cannot make informed decisions, departments cannot be held accountable, and funding agencies cannot assess the effectiveness of their training investments. The noncompliance penalty (loss of training grant eligibility) provides meaningful enforcement.

- **Section 6** funds the career development infrastructure that most institutions currently lack, recognizing that transparency alone is insufficient without institutional capacity to prepare trainees for diverse careers.

- **Section 7** addresses the coordination failure at the federal level, where multiple agencies fund workforce training without a shared strategy.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Cost to institutions | Phased implementation (Sec. 8b); career development grants offset some costs (Sec. 6) |
| PI resistance to postdoc limits | Five-year cap aligns with international norms; extension mechanism provides flexibility |
| Privacy concerns with career reporting | Disaggregated data subject to existing privacy protections; small-cell suppression |
| Institutional gaming of metrics | Standardized taxonomy and external oversight limit manipulation |
| Unfunded mandate concerns | Authorized appropriations (Sec. 9); most costs shift existing expenditures |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Tie faculty hiring ratios to federal funding eligibility, requiring that a minimum percentage of instructional effort be provided by tenure-track faculty
- **Fallback version**: Limit career reporting requirements to programs receiving training grants (not all programs at funded institutions)
- **Expansion**: Include provisions for graduate student stipend minimums and working condition standards

### Bill 2: STEM Immigration and Talent Retention Act

**Purpose**: Reform immigration pathways for scientists and engineers to attract and retain international STEM talent, eliminate employer dependence, reduce green card backlogs, and create new visa categories for researchers and STEM entrepreneurs.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "STEM Immigration and Talent
Retention Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
    (1) Foreign-born individuals constitute approximately
    45 percent of the United States doctoral STEM workforce
    and approximately 57 percent of PhD students in computer
    science and engineering.
    (2) Immigrants and their children have founded
    approximately 55 percent of America's billion-dollar
    startup companies and have won a disproportionate share
    of Nobel Prizes awarded to U.S.-based researchers.
    (3) The current H-1B visa system does not distinguish
    between scientific researchers and other specialty
    occupation workers, subjects workers to employer
    dependence that suppresses wages and mobility, and fails
    to prioritize the most talented applicants.
    (4) Per-country caps on employment-based green cards
    create backlogs of 10 to 20 or more years for nationals
    of India and China, driving talented scientists to
    competitor nations with faster immigration pathways.
    (5) Competitor nations including Canada, the United
    Kingdom, and Australia have implemented streamlined
    immigration pathways for STEM talent that increasingly
    divert scientists and engineers who would otherwise
    contribute to the United States economy.
(b) PURPOSE.—The purposes of this Act are—
    (1) to create a dedicated immigration pathway for STEM
    doctoral graduates of United States institutions;
    (2) to eliminate employer dependence in the H-1B
    program for STEM workers;
    (3) to reduce green card processing times for STEM
    workers;
    (4) to establish a visa category for STEM entrepreneurs;
    and
    (5) to strengthen the ability of the United States to
    attract and retain the world's leading scientific talent.

            (ii) have maintained lawful status in the United
            States; and
            (iii) have received or have a bona fide offer of
            employment in a STEM occupation at a salary at
            or above the median wage for such occupation as
            determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
        (B) NUMERICAL LIMITATION.—The number of visas made
        available under this paragraph shall not exceed
        30,000 per fiscal year.
        (C) EXEMPTION FROM PER-COUNTRY LIMITATION.—The
        per-country numerical limitation under subsection
        (a) shall not apply to immigrants described in
        this paragraph.
        (D) PROCESSING TIME.—The Secretary of Homeland
        Security shall adjudicate applications under this

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** creates a dedicated green card pathway for STEM PhDs from U.S. institutions, addressing the most critical retention problem. The 30,000-per-year cap is meaningful but manageable. Exemption from per-country caps eliminates the disparate treatment that currently drives away Indian and Chinese scientists. The 180-day processing requirement signals urgency.

- **Section 5** breaks the employer dependence that is the central structural problem with H-1B. Allowing workers to begin new employment upon petition filing (rather than approval) and providing a 180-day grace period after termination gives STEM workers genuine labor market mobility. The wage protection provision addresses concerns about wage suppression.

- **Section 6** creates a startup visa---a category that has been proposed in various forms for over a decade but never enacted. The requirements ($250,000 in investment, 10% equity, job creation) are designed to ensure genuine entrepreneurship while being achievable for scientist-founders.

- **Section 7** removes the J-1 two-year home residency requirement for researchers, which currently disrupts research programs and discourages postdocs from transitioning to permanent positions.

- **Section 8** streamlines the O-1 visa for scientists by establishing clear evidentiary standards aligned with academic achievement metrics.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Per-country cap elimination opposition | STEM pathway is capped at 30,000/year; exemption limited to this category |
| Wage suppression concerns | Median wage floor in Sec. 4(a)(6)(A)(iii) and Sec. 5 wage protection |
| USCIS capacity for processing timelines | Sec. 10 authorizes appropriations for additional staff |
| Startup visa fraud risk | Investment threshold, equity requirement, and job creation metrics provide guardrails |
| Domestic worker displacement | Salary floors set at median (not minimum), ensuring immigrants are not undercutting domestic workers |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: Eliminate per-country caps for all employment-based green card categories, not just the STEM doctoral pathway
- **Fallback version**: Implement the STEM doctoral green card as a pilot program with a sunset provision and evaluation mandate
- **Expansion**: Include provisions for STEM master's degree holders, with a separate numerical cap

## State Model Legislation

### Model Adjunct Faculty Fair Employment Act

**Purpose**: Establish minimum compensation and employment standards for part-time and contingent faculty at public institutions of higher education.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Adjunct Faculty
Fair Employment Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.

As used in this Act:
    (a) "Adjunct faculty" means any individual employed on
    a per-course or part-time basis to provide instruction
    at a public institution of higher education who is not
    on a tenure track or under a full-time contract.
    (b) "Public institution of higher education" means any
    college or university operated by the State or a
    political subdivision thereof.

SECTION 3. MINIMUM COMPENSATION.

(a) No public institution of higher education shall
compensate adjunct faculty at a rate less than $7,000 per
three-credit-hour course or equivalent, adjusted annually
for inflation.
(b) Adjunct faculty teaching 6 or more credit hours per
semester shall receive pro rata health insurance benefits
equivalent to those provided to full-time faculty.
(c) Adjunct faculty teaching 9 or more credit hours per
semester shall receive pro rata retirement benefits
equivalent to those provided to full-time faculty.

SECTION 4. EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS.

(a) Adjunct faculty who have taught at least 6 courses at
the same institution over 3 or more academic years shall be
offered a renewable contract of not less than 1 academic
year.
(b) Institutions shall provide not less than 60 days
notice before canceling a course for which an adjunct
faculty member has been assigned.
(c) Adjunct faculty shall have access to office space,
technology resources, and professional development
opportunities comparable to those available to full-time
faculty.

SECTION 5. REPORTING.

Each public institution of higher education shall
publish annually a report including:
    (a) the number of adjunct faculty employed;
    (b) the proportion of credit hours taught by adjunct
    faculty;
    (c) median compensation per course; and
    (d) benefits provided to adjunct faculty.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the first day of the
academic year beginning not less than 1 year after the
date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This model legislation targets the most egregious aspects of adjunct exploitation---poverty-level pay, lack of benefits, and zero job security---while leaving institutions flexibility in how they structure their workforce. The $7,000 per course minimum roughly doubles the current median and brings adjunct pay closer to (though still well below) what full-time faculty earn per course.

**Adaptations**: States may adjust the per-course minimum based on regional cost of living. Some states may wish to extend coverage to private institutions or to include graduate teaching assistants.

## Regulatory Framework

### NIH Postdoctoral Compensation and Training Standards

**Existing Authority**: NIH has authority under 42 U.S.C. Section 288 (National Research Service Awards) to set stipend levels and training conditions for NRSA recipients, and can condition institutional eligibility for research grants on compliance with workforce standards under its grants policy.

**Draft Regulation**:

- Set NRSA Year 0 stipend at $70,000 effective fiscal year following enactment, with annual cost-of-living adjustments
- Require that all postdoctoral researchers on NIH-funded grants be classified as employees with full benefits, regardless of funding mechanism
- Limit total postdoctoral service supported by NIH funding to five years per individual
- Require Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for all NIH-funded postdocs, with annual progress reviews
- Require grantee institutions to report postdoctoral researcher career outcomes as a condition of continued NIH funding

**Explanation**: NIH can implement many workforce reforms without new legislation through its existing authority to set grant conditions. The NRSA stipend level, while technically applying only to NRSA-funded postdocs, functions as a de facto national minimum because most institutions peg all postdoc salaries to it.

### NSF Career Outcome Reporting Standards

**Existing Authority**: NSF has authority under 42 U.S.C. Section 1862 to collect data and set conditions on grants and training programs.

**Draft Regulation**:

- Require all institutions with active NSF training grants (including RTPs and NRTs) to report career outcomes for PhD graduates using the standardized taxonomy
- Incorporate career outcome data into training grant review criteria
- Fund the development and maintenance of a public career outcome database

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Spending Clause**: The federal government's authority to condition research funding on workforce standards is well-established under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8). The nexus between funding conditions and research workforce outcomes is direct and rational.
- **Immigration Power**: Congress has plenary authority over immigration under Article I, Section 8, Clause 4. The STEM immigration provisions are well within established congressional power.
- **Commerce Clause**: Federal regulation of adjunct and postdoc labor conditions at institutions engaged in interstate commerce (all research universities) is supported by Commerce Clause authority, though direct regulation is more complex than conditioning federal funding.

### Preemption Questions

- State labor law governs employee classification in many contexts; federal legislation must either preempt state classification standards or work in harmony with them. The proposed legislation takes the approach of setting a federal floor through funding conditions rather than direct preemption.
- State adjunct legislation may be preempted by collective bargaining agreements where they exist. The model legislation should include a savings clause preserving collectively bargained terms that exceed statutory minimums.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Funding conditions**: Primary enforcement through eligibility for federal research grants and training programs. Institutions that fail to comply face loss of funding.
- **Reporting requirements**: Public reporting creates accountability through transparency. Noncompliance triggers loss of training grant eligibility.
- **USCIS adjudication**: Immigration provisions are enforced through the visa and green card adjudication process.
- **State enforcement**: Model state legislation would be enforced through state labor departments and boards of higher education.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The interagency working group (Sec. 7 of Bill 1) shall conduct a comprehensive review of all provisions five years after enactment, with recommendations for modifications
- The STEM doctoral green card pathway (Sec. 4 of Bill 2) shall include a 10-year authorization with reauthorization contingent on a GAO assessment of its impact on STEM workforce retention and domestic worker employment

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Research Workforce Fairness and Transparency Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Title reclassification | Institutions could reclassify postdocs as "research associates" or "research scientists" with different titles to evade postdoc-specific requirements | Critical |
| Subcontracting | Institutions could employ researchers through staffing agencies or subcontractors not directly covered by the Act | High |
| Reporting gaming | Programs could classify underemployed graduates as "employed" in broad categories that obscure poor outcomes | High |
| Small-institution exemption | The $1 million threshold could exclude smaller institutions where exploitation also occurs | Medium |
| Extension abuse | The one-year extension mechanism could become routine rather than exceptional | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No graduate student stipend provisions | Graduate students face similar exploitation but are not covered | Political complexity of defining graduate student employment |
| No private adjunct coverage | Model state legislation applies only to public institutions | Limited state regulatory authority over private institutions |
| Voluntary career development | Career development programs are funded but not mandated for all programs | Concern about federal overreach into academic curriculum |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Expand the definition of "postdoctoral researcher" to cover any PhD-holding researcher in a temporary position primarily involving research, regardless of title, at a covered institution
2. Include a provision prohibiting institutions from using staffing agencies or subcontractors to circumvent the Act's requirements
3. Develop detailed, prescriptive career outcome reporting categories with external audit requirements
4. Lower the funding threshold or eliminate it, applying requirements to all institutions receiving any federal research funding
5. Require funding agencies to track extension rates and flag institutions with systematic overuse

### STEM Immigration and Talent Retention Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Sham enterprises | The startup visa could be exploited by creating shell companies to obtain immigration benefits | High |
| Wage floor circumvention | Employers could understate job requirements or misclassify positions to offer lower wages | High |
| Processing time noncompliance | USCIS could fail to meet processing deadlines without meaningful consequences | Medium |
| Degree mill exploitation | The STEM doctoral pathway could incentivize low-quality PhD programs designed primarily for immigration benefits | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 30,000 cap may be insufficient | Cap may not accommodate demand, creating new backlogs | Political constraints on immigration numbers |
| No provision for STEM master's holders | Many STEM workers hold master's degrees and face similar immigration challenges | Scope limitation to maintain political viability |
| No retroactive relief for current backlog | Individuals already waiting years are not given priority | Legal complexity of retroactive immigration relief |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require startup visa applicants to undergo in-person interviews and provide evidence of genuine business operations, including tax returns, payroll records, and product demonstrations
2. Mandate that USCIS verify prevailing wage compliance through annual audits and impose penalties (including debarment from the program) for employers found to circumvent wage protections
3. Establish a statutory remedy (automatic approval) if USCIS fails to adjudicate applications within the required timeframe
4. Limit the STEM doctoral pathway to degrees from institutions accredited by agencies recognized by the Department of Education and meeting minimum research output thresholds

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Coordination between workforce and immigration reforms | Interagency working group (Bill 1, Sec. 7) should include DHS and USCIS representatives |
| Data privacy across systems | Develop a unified privacy framework before launching the national workforce data system |
| Enforcement capacity | Appropriate funds for enforcement staff at DOL, USCIS, and funding agencies |
| Political durability | Embed reforms in permanent statute rather than executive orders; build bipartisan support |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- All provisions should be subject to GAO review at five-year intervals
- The interagency working group should publish biennial assessments of implementation progress and recommend adjustments
- Congressional committees should hold oversight hearings annually for the first five years after enactment
