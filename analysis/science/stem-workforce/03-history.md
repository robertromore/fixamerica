# STEM Workforce: History

## Timeline of Key Developments

### The Postwar Expansion (1945-1970)

The modern American research enterprise was built in the aftermath of World War II. Vannevar Bush's 1945 report *Science, The Endless Frontier* argued that federal investment in basic research was essential for national security, public health, and economic prosperity. This vision shaped the creation of a research workforce system that persists, in modified form, to this day.

**Key developments**:

- **1945**: Vannevar Bush publishes *Science, The Endless Frontier*, advocating permanent federal support for basic research
- **1946**: Office of Naval Research (ONR) begins funding university research, establishing the model of federal grants to academic investigators
- **1950**: National Science Foundation (NSF) created to support basic research and science education
- **1957**: Sputnik crisis triggers massive increase in federal science funding. National Defense Education Act (1958) funds graduate fellowships. NASA created (1958)
- **1960s**: Federal R&D spending reaches its peak as a share of GDP (~2% in 1964), driven by the space race and Cold War. NIH budget grows rapidly. PhD production expands to meet perceived demand

During this period, the system worked relatively well. PhD production was modest, postdoctoral positions were brief (one to two years), and the expanding university system absorbed most graduates into tenure-track positions. Federal funding was generous, and the research workforce was small enough that supply roughly matched demand.

### The First Surplus Warnings (1970-1990)

By the late 1960s, the postwar boom had begun to slow. Federal R&D spending declined as a share of GDP after the Apollo program wound down. Universities, having expanded rapidly, could not sustain growth in faculty hiring.

**Key developments**:

- **1969-1971**: "PhD glut" becomes a topic of national concern. The job market tightens sharply as baby-boom-era PhDs enter a contracting academic labor market
- **1971**: NSF's "Cartter Report" warns of PhD overproduction and projects continued surpluses
- **1975**: The proportion of tenure/tenure-track faculty begins its long decline from ~56%
- **1979**: NIH biomedical workforce reports begin documenting the growing imbalance between PhD production and faculty openings
- **1980**: Bayh-Dole Act allows universities to patent federally funded inventions, creating new incentives for university research expansion but also contributing to the growth of the research labor force
- **1985-1990**: Fears of a STEM shortage reemerge. Industry groups and some policymakers warn of impending scientist shortages, leading to calls for expanded PhD training. These warnings prove largely unfounded

The postdoctoral position began its transformation during this period. What had been a one-to-two-year transition became a longer holding pattern as more PhDs competed for fewer faculty slots. Average postdoc duration began to lengthen.

### The Adjunctification Era (1990-2010)

The 1990s saw the acceleration of two trends that would fundamentally reshape the academic workforce: the replacement of tenure-track positions with contingent appointments, and the continued expansion of PhD production despite a contracting academic labor market.

**Key developments**:

- **1990**: NSF publishes projections warning of a coming STEM worker shortage, leading to increased support for graduate training. The projections are later criticized as methodologically flawed
- **1993**: An *Academies* report (the Zumeta report) documents the growing use of non-tenure-track faculty and warns of its implications for higher education quality
- **1995**: Non-tenure-track faculty surpass tenure/tenure-track faculty as the majority of the instructional workforce for the first time
- **1998**: American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act raises the H-1B visa cap from 65,000 to 115,000 (later to 195,000 temporarily), increasing international STEM worker inflow
- **2000**: NIH budget doubling begins (completed 2003), vastly expanding the biomedical research workforce. Many new grants fund additional graduate students and postdocs, but the growth creates expectations of continued expansion that Congress does not sustain
- **2003**: After the doubling, NIH budget flattens in real terms for more than a decade, but the expanded workforce persists, intensifying competition for grants
- **2005**: *Rising Above the Gathering Storm* (National Academies) warns of declining U.S. competitiveness and recommends expanding STEM education and research, further fueling PhD production

The NIH budget doubling (1998-2003) is a cautionary tale. The doubling expanded research capacity---more labs, more graduate students, more postdocs---but when growth stalled, the expanded workforce competed for a relatively fixed pool of funding. Grant success rates at NIH dropped from ~30% in the early 2000s to ~18-20% by 2013, and the average age of a first-time R01 grantee (a proxy for independent faculty appointment) rose from 37 in 1980 to 43 by 2014.

### The Crisis Crystallizes (2010-Present)

The past fifteen years have seen the STEM workforce crisis move from academic concern to mainstream awareness, driven by advocacy, data, and the lived experiences of thousands of early-career researchers.

**Key developments**:

- **2012**: NIH Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group (Tilghman Committee) publishes landmark report documenting the unsustainability of the biomedical workforce pyramid and recommending reduced PhD enrollment and better postdoc conditions
- **2013**: Sequestration cuts federal research budgets by approximately 5%, triggering lab closures and layoffs. NIH grant success rates hit historic lows
- **2014**: NIH introduces the Next Generation Researchers Initiative to prioritize funding for early-career investigators
- **2014-2018**: Graduate student unionization accelerates. Students at private universities gain NLRB recognition (2016, reversed 2019, then restored 2021)
- **2017-2020**: Travel ban executive orders restrict entry from several predominantly Muslim countries, affecting STEM researchers and students. International student enrollment declines
- **2018**: DOJ launches the China Initiative to investigate economic espionage and research security threats, leading to investigations of researchers at universities and federal labs
- **2020**: COVID-19 disrupts research and exacerbates postdoc career delays. Labs close, experiments halt, and the timeline for early-career researchers extends further
- **2022**: DOJ ends the China Initiative after criticism of racial profiling. CHIPS and Science Act passes, authorizing major increases in NSF and STEM workforce funding
- **2023-2024**: Postdoc salary reform gains momentum. NIH raises NRSA stipends. Multiple universities increase postdoc minimum salaries to $60,000-$70,000. Postdoc unions win contracts at several institutions
- **2024-2025**: AI boom creates unprecedented demand for PhD talent in computer science and machine learning, with industry salaries vastly outpacing academia. Concerns mount about brain drain from academic AI research

## Key Historical Patterns

### The Shortage-Surplus Cycle

The STEM workforce has been subject to recurring cycles of alarm about shortages followed by overproduction:

| Period | Alarm | Response | Outcome |
|--------|-------|----------|---------|
| 1957-1965 | Sputnik "gap" | Massive expansion of graduate education | Surplus by late 1960s |
| 1985-1990 | NSF shortage projections | Expanded PhD training | Projections proved wrong |
| 1998-2003 | NIH doubling, competitiveness fears | More grants, more trainees | Chronic oversupply in biomedicine |
| 2005-2010 | *Gathering Storm* report | COMPETES Act, more fellowships | Continued surplus in most fields |
| 2020-present | AI talent war, CHIPS Act | New training programs | Acute shortage in AI/CS only |

The pattern reveals a fundamental flaw: the response to perceived shortages is always to produce more PhDs, but the structural capacity to employ them in research positions does not expand accordingly.

### The Ratchet Effect

PhD production tends to ratchet upward and rarely contracts. Universities have strong incentives to maintain or grow graduate programs (graduate students provide cheap labor and research output), while the mechanisms for scaling back are weak. Even when faculty acknowledge oversupply, individual departments face collective action problems---no department wants to be the one to cut admissions.

### The Visa Pendulum

Immigration policy for STEM workers has swung between openness and restriction, often driven by factors unrelated to scientific workforce needs. Post-9/11 security concerns reduced visa issuances. The China Initiative chilled Chinese-born researcher participation. Meanwhile, competitor nations have steadily liberalized their skilled immigration pathways.

## Lessons from History

1. **Shortage predictions have been consistently wrong**: The U.S. has rarely experienced genuine economy-wide STEM shortages; the problem is structural misalignment, not aggregate supply
2. **Workforce expansion without structural reform creates misery**: The NIH doubling expanded the workforce without expanding permanent positions, worsening the postdoc bottleneck
3. **Market signals are distorted**: Graduate students receive misleading information about career prospects, and the "prestige economy" of academia obscures labor market realities
4. **International talent is a strategic asset**: Policies that deter foreign scientists---whether through visa restrictions, security overreach, or unwelcoming environments---harm American competitiveness
5. **Organized labor improves conditions**: Graduate student and postdoc unions have consistently won improved compensation and working conditions where they have formed
