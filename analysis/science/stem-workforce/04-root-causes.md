# STEM Workforce: Root Causes

## Why the Problem Persists

The STEM workforce crisis is not the result of a single failure but a system of interlocking incentives, each rational from the perspective of individual actors, that collectively produce irrational outcomes. Understanding these structural drivers is essential for designing effective reforms.

## Structural Drivers

### 1. The Graduate Student Labor Model

**The core problem**: Universities depend on graduate students as cheap, highly skilled research and teaching labor. PhD programs are sized to meet departmental labor needs, not labor market demand.

**How it works**:

- A faculty member receives a grant that funds, say, three graduate research assistants at ~$35,000/year each (stipend plus tuition remission)
- Those students perform the bench work, data analysis, and manuscript writing that generates publications and preliminary data for the next grant
- Teaching assistants, paid similarly modest stipends, cover undergraduate instruction that would otherwise require hiring more expensive faculty or lecturers
- The university collects indirect cost recovery (typically 50-65% of direct costs) on the grants, generating revenue
- The department benefits from research output, publications, and rankings that attract more students and more funding

**Why it persists**:

- Faculty need graduate students to run their labs and maintain productivity
- Departments need teaching assistants to cover undergraduate courses
- Universities benefit from the indirect cost revenue that research grants generate
- Individual students, often motivated by passion and unaware of career statistics, continue to apply
- No individual actor has an incentive to reduce the size of the system

### 2. The Postdoc Trap

**The core problem**: Postdoctoral positions have become a mechanism for employing surplus PhDs at below-market wages rather than a genuine training experience.

**How it works**:

- A new PhD cannot find a faculty position and takes a postdoc, hoping it will strengthen their candidacy
- After one postdoc, they are told they need more publications, so they take a second
- By year three to five, they have invested too much to leave (sunk cost) but are still far from a faculty appointment
- PIs benefit from experienced, skilled researchers who cost less than technicians or research scientists in many cases
- The system normalizes multi-year postdocs, raising the bar for subsequent applicants

**Why it persists**:

- PIs get highly skilled labor at below-market rates
- The classification of postdocs as "trainees" allows institutions to avoid employee protections and benefits
- The hope of eventual academic appointment keeps postdocs working without organized resistance (though this is changing)
- NIH and NSF grant structures fund postdoc positions without requiring evidence that the training leads to career advancement

### 3. The Prestige Economy

**The core problem**: Academic culture values tenure-track faculty positions above all other career outcomes, creating a distorted hierarchy that stigmatizes the majority of PhD graduates who pursue other careers.

**How it works**:

- Faculty advisors define success as obtaining a tenure-track position at a research university
- Students who leave academia are described as having "left science" even when they do scientific work in industry, government, or nonprofits
- Departmental rankings and reputation depend on placing graduates in academic positions
- Professional socialization throughout graduate training reinforces academic careers as the only legitimate path
- Students who explore non-academic options may face advisor disapproval or reduced support

**Why it persists**:

- Faculty reproduce their own career paths and evaluate students by their own criteria
- The "prestige economy" rewards academic placements in rankings and reputation systems
- Graduate training curricula are designed by faculty for academic careers, with little input from non-academic employers
- Career services for PhD students are underdeveloped compared to undergraduate career centers

### 4. The Visa Dependency System

**The core problem**: Immigration policy creates conditions of employer dependence that suppress wages and mobility for international STEM workers, while simultaneously failing to retain many of the scientists the U.S. trains.

**How it works**:

- International students earn PhDs at U.S. universities (often funded by federal grants)
- They seek H-1B sponsorship or green cards to remain
- H-1B workers are tied to their sponsoring employer, limiting their ability to change jobs, negotiate salaries, or report workplace violations
- Green card backlogs (especially for Indian and Chinese nationals) create years or decades of uncertainty
- Some researchers leave for countries with clearer immigration pathways, taking their U.S.-funded training with them

**Why it persists**:

- Employers benefit from a captive, less-mobile workforce
- Per-country green card caps are politically difficult to reform due to concerns about any single nation dominating immigration flows
- H-1B lottery system does not distinguish between scientific researchers and other specialty occupation workers
- Congressional gridlock on comprehensive immigration reform prevents targeted fixes

### 5. The Adjunctification Incentive

**The core problem**: Universities have discovered that they can meet instructional needs far more cheaply by hiring contingent faculty than by creating tenure-track positions.

**How it works**:

- A tenure-track professor costs $100,000-$200,000+ in salary plus benefits, startup packages, research space, and administrative support
- An adjunct teaching the same course costs $3,500-$5,000 per course with no benefits
- Administrators under budget pressure replace retiring tenure-track faculty with adjuncts, pocketing the difference
- The surplus of PhDs ensures an endless supply of adjuncts willing to work for low pay in hopes of eventually securing a permanent position

**Why it persists**:

- Cost savings are enormous and immediate
- Faculty governance structures (where tenured faculty make decisions) are slow to address the issue because tenured faculty benefit from the system's support structures
- Accreditation standards focus on student outcomes rather than faculty working conditions
- Competition among institutions for students (and their tuition revenue) creates pressure to keep costs down
- The cultural prestige of "professor" attracts applicants despite terrible working conditions

### 6. Information Asymmetry

**The core problem**: Prospective graduate students lack accurate information about career outcomes, and institutions have weak incentives to provide it.

**How it works**:

- Undergraduate students considering PhD programs receive information about admission rates, stipends, and research opportunities---but rarely about career placement data
- Departments may report that 90% of graduates are "employed" without specifying that most are in temporary postdoc positions
- Students rely on faculty mentors who may have little knowledge of non-academic career paths
- The sunk cost fallacy keeps students in programs even after learning the true odds
- By the time students understand the labor market, they have invested five to eight years

**Why it persists**:

- Reporting career outcomes honestly might reduce applications, shrinking the labor pool that departments depend on
- No federal requirement mandates standardized, transparent career outcome reporting for PhD programs
- Professional societies have begun publishing career data, but it remains fragmented and inconsistent
- Students may discount negative information due to optimism bias ("I'll be the one who makes it")

### 7. Funding Structure Misalignment

**The core problem**: The federal research funding system incentivizes workforce expansion but does not bear the costs of workforce surplus.

**How it works**:

- Federal grants fund personnel (graduate students, postdocs) as a cost of doing research
- The grant system rewards productivity, and productivity depends on labor
- More grants mean more trainees, and more trainees produce more publications, supporting more grant applications
- But the grant system does not fund the permanent positions these trainees need after training
- When trainees cannot find permanent positions, the costs fall on individuals (career disruption) and institutions (adjunct labor), not on the agencies that funded the training

**Why it persists**:

- Funding agencies measure success by research output, not workforce outcomes
- Principal investigators control personnel decisions on their grants with limited oversight of training quality
- The distinction between "training" and "labor" allows the system to avoid labor market accountability
- Proposed reforms (like limiting trainee numbers) face resistance from PIs who depend on cheap labor

## Interaction Effects

These root causes do not operate independently. They form a reinforcing system:

```text
PhD overproduction --> postdoc surplus --> cheap research labor
       ^                     |                    |
       |                     v                    v
Faculty need students   Wage suppression   Tenure lines replaced
       ^                     |              with adjuncts
       |                     v                    |
Grant system funds    Brain drain of       <------+
more trainees         international talent
```

- **Overproduction feeds exploitation**: The surplus of PhDs creates a buyer's market that suppresses postdoc and adjunct wages
- **Cheap labor enables overproduction**: Because postdocs and graduate students are cheap, PIs can staff large labs, generating more research output and more grants that fund more trainees
- **Prestige culture masks the problem**: The framing of all non-academic outcomes as failure prevents honest assessment of the system
- **Visa dependency deepens power imbalances**: International postdocs and graduate students are even more vulnerable to exploitation because their immigration status depends on their employer

## Why Reform Is Difficult

| Barrier | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Collective action problem | No individual department wants to cut admissions if others do not |
| Misaligned incentives | Every actor in the system benefits from cheap labor in the short term |
| Cultural resistance | The "prestige economy" stigmatizes acknowledging the problem |
| Data gaps | Lack of standardized career outcome tracking obscures the scale of dysfunction |
| Beneficiary diffusion | Those harmed (individual trainees) are dispersed and transient; those who benefit (institutions, PIs) are concentrated and permanent |
| Policy silos | Workforce, immigration, education, and research policies are made by different agencies and committees with little coordination |
