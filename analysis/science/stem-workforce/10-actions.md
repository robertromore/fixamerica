# STEM Workforce: Actions

## For Individuals

### If You Are a Prospective Graduate Student

**Before Applying**

- [ ] Research career outcome data for programs you are considering (ask departments directly if data are not published)
- [ ] Talk to recent graduates (not just faculty) about their career experiences and job search outcomes
- [ ] Understand the difference between a stipend and a salary, and calculate the real cost of 5-7 years at that income level
- [ ] Read the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates data for your field
- [ ] Consider whether a master's degree or industry experience might better serve your career goals

**Questions to Ask Programs**

- [ ] What percentage of graduates hold tenure-track positions five years after graduation?
- [ ] What is the median time to degree?
- [ ] What career development resources exist beyond academic preparation?
- [ ] What is the average stipend, and how does it compare to the local cost of living?
- [ ] Are graduate students classified as employees with access to benefits and labor protections?

### If You Are a Current Graduate Student

**Protect Your Interests**

- [ ] Track career outcomes of graduates from your program informally if official data are unavailable
- [ ] Explore non-academic career paths early---do not wait until year five
- [ ] Attend career development workshops, industry networking events, and informational interviews
- [ ] Build skills outside the lab: communication, project management, data science, policy analysis
- [ ] Know your rights regarding working hours, benefits, and workplace protections

**Organize**

- [ ] Learn about graduate student unionization efforts at your institution
- [ ] Join or support existing graduate student organizations that advocate for improved conditions
- [ ] Participate in departmental governance and advocate for career outcome transparency
- [ ] Connect with national organizations like the National Postdoctoral Association and disciplinary societies

### If You Are a Postdoctoral Researcher

**Career Planning**

- [ ] Build a professional network outside academia through conferences, LinkedIn, and alumni connections
- [ ] Acquire skills valued outside academia: project management, industry-relevant techniques, communication

**Advocate for Yourself**
