# STEM Workforce: Current State

## The Problem Today

### PhD Production Outpaces Academic Demand

American universities awarded approximately 82,000 research doctorates in 2023, up from 45,000 in 2000 and 33,000 in 1990. This growth has been driven primarily by expansion in the life sciences, engineering, and computer science. Yet tenure-track faculty openings have not grown commensurately. In the biomedical sciences, the ratio of new PhDs to new tenure-track positions is estimated at roughly 6:1. In the humanities, the ratio is even worse.

The result is a structural surplus of PhD-trained researchers competing for a shrinking pool of permanent academic positions. Only about 10-20% of life science PhDs will ultimately secure tenure-track faculty positions. The rest must find alternative employment---often after years of low-paid postdoctoral training that delays career establishment, family formation, and financial security.

### Postdoctoral Researchers: A Permanent Underclass

Postdoctoral positions were originally conceived as brief apprenticeships---one to two years of advanced training before a faculty appointment. Today, the average postdoc tenure is four to six years, and some researchers remain in postdoc positions for a decade or more. As of 2024, the NIH estimates roughly 60,000-80,000 postdoctoral researchers work in the United States.

**Postdoc compensation**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| NIH NRSA minimum stipend (FY 2024, Year 0) | $56,484 |
| Average postdoc salary (all fields) | ~$56,000-$65,000 |
| Average PhD age at first postdoc | ~31 years |
| Average age at first tenure-track position | ~38-42 years |
| Median starting salary for PhD in industry | ~$100,000-$130,000 |
| Percentage of postdocs with employer-sponsored retirement | ~40% |
| Percentage classified as trainees (not employees) | ~50% |

NIH raised the NRSA minimum stipend to $56,484 in 2024 after sustained advocacy, but many institutions still pay at or near the minimum, and the stipend remains below the living wage in most metropolitan areas where research universities are located. Many postdocs are classified as trainees rather than employees, limiting their access to benefits, unemployment insurance, and labor protections.

### The Tenure-Track Collapse

The proportion of faculty holding tenure or on the tenure track has declined steadily for four decades:

| Year | Tenure/Tenure-Track (%) | Non-Tenure-Track (%) |
|------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 1975 | ~56% | ~44% |
| 1995 | ~37% | ~63% |
| 2005 | ~32% | ~68% |
| 2015 | ~27% | ~73% |
| 2023 (est.) | ~24% | ~76% |

Today, approximately three-quarters of all instructional faculty in American higher education are off the tenure track. This includes adjunct faculty, full-time lecturers, visiting professors, and other contingent positions. In many departments, a single tenured professor oversees a lab staffed by postdocs, graduate students, and technicians, while adjuncts handle the majority of undergraduate teaching.

### Adjunct Faculty: Working Conditions

Adjunct faculty---part-time instructors hired on a per-course basis---represent roughly half of all instructional faculty nationwide. Their working conditions are well documented:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Median pay per course | ~$3,500-$4,000 |
| Percentage earning less than $25,000/year | ~25% |
| Percentage with employer-provided health insurance | ~22% |
| Percentage with access to retirement benefits | ~18% |
| Percentage who have sought public assistance | ~25% |
| Average course load to approximate full-time income | 8-10 courses/year across multiple institutions |

Adjuncts typically receive no office space, no research support, no professional development funding, and no job security. Contracts are semester-to-semester, and courses can be canceled with little notice. Many adjuncts teach at two, three, or four institutions simultaneously, commuting between campuses while earning less than many of their students will earn upon graduation.

### Visa Policy and International STEM Talent

International students and researchers are a critical component of the U.S. STEM workforce. Foreign-born individuals constitute approximately 45% of STEM workers with doctoral degrees and roughly 57% of PhD students in computer science and engineering.

**Key visa categories for STEM workers**:

| Visa | Purpose | Annual Cap | Duration |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| H-1B | Specialty occupation workers | 85,000 (general lottery) | 3 years, renewable to 6 |
| O-1A | Extraordinary ability in sciences | No cap | 3 years, renewable |
| J-1 | Exchange visitors (postdocs, scholars) | No cap | Varies by category |
| F-1 OPT | Post-graduation work authorization | No cap | 12 months (36 for STEM) |
| EB-1 | Priority worker green card | ~40,000/year | Permanent |
| EB-2 NIW | National interest waiver green card | Part of ~40,000/year | Permanent |

**Current problems with the visa system**:

- **H-1B lottery**: Demand far exceeds supply. In FY 2024, USCIS received over 750,000 registrations for 85,000 slots. The lottery system does not prioritize scientific talent over other specialty occupations.
- **Green card backlogs**: Scientists from India and China face wait times of 10-20+ years for employment-based green cards due to per-country caps, creating a decade-long limbo.
- **Employer dependence**: H-1B workers are tied to their sponsoring employer, creating power imbalances and discouraging job mobility, salary negotiation, and whistleblowing.
- **J-1 two-year home residency requirement**: Some postdocs on J-1 visas must return to their home country for two years before applying for permanent residence, disrupting research programs and careers.
- **Visa uncertainty**: Policy changes across administrations create unpredictability that deters talented scientists from choosing the United States.

### Brain Drain and Brain Gain

The United States has historically been the world's top destination for scientific talent---a pattern often called "brain gain." The nation benefits enormously from this inflow: immigrants and their children have founded roughly 55% of America's billion-dollar startup companies, and foreign-born researchers have won a disproportionate share of U.S. Nobel Prizes.

However, the direction of flow is shifting:

- **China's Thousand Talents Program** and similar initiatives have attracted thousands of Chinese-born scientists back from the U.S.
- **The China Initiative** (2018-2022) investigated researchers with Chinese ties, leading to wrongful prosecutions and a chilling effect on collaboration. Many Chinese-born scientists left or declined to come.
- **Canada, the EU, and Australia** have streamlined immigration pathways for skilled workers, competing more effectively for global talent.
- **Stay rates** for foreign PhD graduates are declining. NSF data show that the percentage of foreign-born STEM PhDs remaining in the U.S. five years after graduation fell from ~70% in 2005 to ~64% in 2019, with sharper declines among Chinese nationals.
- **Remote work** enables scientists to contribute to U.S. institutions from abroad, complicating traditional measures of brain drain.

### Industry vs. Academia: The Growing Divide

The gap between academic and industry STEM careers has widened:

| Dimension | Academia | Industry |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Starting salary (PhD, life sciences) | $56,000-$65,000 (postdoc) | $100,000-$140,000 |
| Job security timeline | 10-15 years to tenure | Varies, but faster advancement |
| Research freedom | High (in theory) | Directed, but well-resourced |
| Work-life balance | Variable, often poor | Variable, often better |
| Geographic flexibility | Go where the job is | More options in many fields |
| Benefits | Often limited for postdocs | Typically comprehensive |
| Publication rights | Expected | Often restricted |
| Mentorship and training | Lab-dependent | Structured in many companies |

Industry increasingly employs PhD scientists---roughly 40% of recent STEM PhD graduates take industry positions immediately after degree completion, up from 25% two decades ago. Technology companies, biotechnology firms, pharmaceutical companies, national laboratories, and consulting firms absorb significant numbers. Yet academic culture still treats industry careers as second-class, and PhD training rarely prepares students for non-academic work.

### Mental Health and Career Satisfaction

The structural pressures of the STEM workforce take a documented toll:

- Studies find that roughly one-third of graduate students experience depression or anxiety, rates significantly higher than the general population
- Postdoctoral researchers report high rates of burnout, career dissatisfaction, and uncertainty
- The "two-body problem"---dual-career academic couples competing for scarce positions in the same geographic area---forces difficult personal compromises
- Imposter syndrome, perfectionism, and fear of failure are pervasive in research training environments
- International researchers face additional stresses from visa uncertainty, cultural isolation, and family separation
