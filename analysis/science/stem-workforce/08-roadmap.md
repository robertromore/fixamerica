# STEM Workforce: Roadmap

## Implementation Strategy

Reform of the STEM workforce must proceed on multiple tracks simultaneously, because the problems are interconnected and change in one area creates enabling conditions for change in others. The roadmap below sequences reforms from quick wins to structural transformation, with realistic timelines for each phase.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)

### Objective

Establish the data infrastructure, policy frameworks, and stakeholder coalitions necessary for deeper reforms.

### Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Dependencies |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Mandate career outcome reporting for federally funded PhD programs | NIH, NSF, DOE | Year 1 | Agency rulemaking authority |
| Develop standardized career outcome taxonomy | Professional societies, OSTP | Year 1 | Stakeholder consensus |
| Raise NIH NRSA postdoc minimum stipend to $65,000 | NIH | Year 1 | Appropriations |
| Require postdoc employee classification at grantee institutions | NIH, NSF | Year 1-2 | Agency policy change, legal review |
| Launch interagency STEM workforce working group | OSTP | Year 1 | Executive order or OSTP directive |
| Commission National Academies study on PhD program right-sizing | Congress or OSTP | Year 1 | Funding |
| Begin drafting STEM immigration reform legislation | Congressional committees | Year 1-2 | Committee leadership support |

### Milestones

- Standardized career outcome reporting framework published
- First cohort of programs reporting outcomes to public database
- Postdoc minimum stipend increased to $65,000
- Interagency working group operational with published charter

### Risks

- Agency rulemaking takes longer than anticipated
- Institutions resist employee classification for postdocs on legal grounds
- Congressional inaction on immigration reform
- Pushback from PIs and departments on career reporting requirements

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 2-4)

### Objective

Implement the core workforce reforms using the data and policy infrastructure built in Phase 1.

### Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Dependencies |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Implement five-year cap on federally funded postdoc positions | NIH, NSF | Year 2-3 | Employee classification complete |
| Shift graduate funding balance from RA ships to fellowships | NIH, NSF | Year 2-4 | Appropriations, agency policy |
| Launch STEM PhD career services grant program | NSF | Year 2 | Appropriations |
| Fund industry internship programs for graduate students and postdocs | NSF, NIH | Year 2-3 | Appropriations, industry partnerships |
| Create STEM green card track (legislation) | Congress | Year 2-3 | Immigration reform bill passage |
| Implement H-1B portability for STEM workers (legislation) | Congress | Year 2-3 | Immigration reform bill passage |
| Establish adjunct faculty pay and benefits floor at Title IV institutions | Congress or DOE | Year 3-4 | Legislative action or regulatory authority |
| Begin outcome-based training grant allocation | NIH, NSF | Year 3-4 | Two years of career outcome data |

### Milestones

- Five-year postdoc cap in effect for new positions
- STEM green card legislation enacted
- First round of outcome-based training grant reviews completed
- At least 100 industry internship partnerships established
- Adjunct pay floor established at federal level

### Risks

- Postdoc time limits create hardship for researchers in fields with longer research timelines
- Immigration reform stalls in Congress
- Institutions find ways to circumvent adjunct pay requirements
- Outcome-based allocation creates perverse incentives (gaming metrics)

## Phase 3: System Transformation (Years 4-7)

### Objective

Achieve fundamental changes in the culture, economics, and structure of STEM careers.

### Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Dependencies |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Implement tenure-track faculty ratio requirement for Title IV institutions | Congress or DOE | Year 4-5 | Legislative action |
| Launch national STEM workforce longitudinal data system | NSF, Census Bureau | Year 4-6 | Appropriations, privacy framework |
| Mandate biennial national STEM workforce assessment | Congress | Year 4 | Interagency working group operational |
| Scale successful career development models nationally | NSF, NIH | Year 4-7 | Evidence from Phase 2 pilots |
| Raise NRSA postdoc stipend to $70,000+ (inflation-adjusted) | NIH | Year 5 | Appropriations |
| Establish staff scientist career tracks at research universities | Universities, NIH | Year 5-7 | Funding mechanism reform, institutional culture change |
| Achieve STEM green card processing within 12 months | USCIS | Year 5-7 | Immigration reform enacted, USCIS capacity |

### Milestones

- Tenure-track ratio requirement in effect
- National longitudinal STEM workforce data system operational
- Staff scientist positions established as a recognized career track at major research universities
- STEM green card average processing time under 18 months
- Biennial workforce assessment published, with policy recommendations

### Risks

- Tenure-track ratio requirement triggers institutional restructuring challenges
- National data system faces privacy objections or funding cuts
- Staff scientist positions are created without adequate salary or advancement structures
- Political changes reverse reforms

## Phase 4: Sustained Improvement (Years 7-10+)

### Objective

Consolidate gains, refine systems based on data, and institutionalize ongoing workforce management.

### Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Dependencies |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Evaluate and refine career outcome reporting standards | Interagency group | Ongoing | Longitudinal data |
| Adjust training investment based on workforce assessment data | NIH, NSF | Ongoing | Biennial assessments |
| Expand international models of research career reform | OSTP, professional societies | Year 7-10 | International partnerships |
| Institutionalize faculty ratio, adjunct pay, and postdoc protections | Congress | Year 8-10 | Demonstrated effectiveness |
| Support research on the effectiveness of workforce reforms | NSF | Ongoing | Appropriations |

### Milestones

- Ten-year longitudinal career data available for first cohort
- Workforce reforms demonstrably improving career outcomes and satisfaction
- International benchmarking shows improved U.S. competitiveness for STEM talent
- Cultural shift in academia: non-academic careers valued as legitimate outcomes

## Critical Path

The following reforms are on the critical path---delays in any one will slow the entire roadmap:

1. **Career outcome reporting**: All subsequent reforms depend on having data
2. **Postdoc employee classification**: Required before time limits and salary reforms can be effectively enforced
3. **Congressional action on immigration**: Cannot be achieved through agency action alone
4. **Appropriations**: Many reforms require funding increases that depend on congressional budget cycles

## Quick Wins

These actions can be taken immediately with existing authority:

| Action | Authority | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Raise NRSA postdoc stipend | NIH Director | Immediate salary improvement for thousands |
| Publish existing career outcome data | NSF (Survey of Earned Doctorates) | Improved transparency at no cost |
| Issue guidance on postdoc employee classification | DOL, IRS | Clarify legal status, improve benefits access |
| Expand BEST program or equivalent | NIH | Improve career preparation at funded institutions |
| Convene stakeholder summit on workforce reform | OSTP | Build coalition, identify consensus reforms |

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | 5-Year Target | 10-Year Target |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Postdoc minimum salary (inflation-adjusted) | $56,484 | $70,000 | $80,000 |
| Average postdoc duration | 4-6 years | 3-4 years | 2-3 years |
| Tenure/tenure-track faculty share | ~24% | ~30% | ~40% |
| PhD career outcome reporting compliance | ~20% | 80% | 100% |
| STEM green card processing time | 5-20+ years | 2-3 years | <12 months |
| PhD programs with career development requirements | ~30% | 70% | 100% |
| Foreign STEM PhD stay rate (5-year) | ~64% | ~70% | ~75% |
