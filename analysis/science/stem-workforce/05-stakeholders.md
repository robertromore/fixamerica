# STEM Workforce: Stakeholders

## Who Is Affected

### Graduate Students

**Population**: Approximately 800,000 students enrolled in STEM graduate programs in the United States.

**Interests**:

- Fair stipends and benefits during training
- Honest information about career prospects before and during enrollment
- Training that prepares them for the careers they will actually hold
- Reasonable time-to-degree and workload expectations
- Protection from advisor abuse and exploitation

**Current impact**: Graduate students provide essential research and teaching labor at below-market wages. They enter programs with limited career outcome data, undergo training oriented almost exclusively toward academic careers that most will never hold, and emerge with uncertain employment prospects after five to eight years of investment.

**Power**: Historically low, but growing through unionization. Graduate student unions now exist at many major research universities and have won improved stipends, benefits, and protections. Students also exert influence through enrollment decisions---departments that cannot attract students lose capacity and prestige.

### Postdoctoral Researchers

**Population**: An estimated 60,000-80,000 postdocs in the United States.

**Interests**:

- Livable wages and full employee benefits
- Time-limited positions with genuine career development
- Recognition as employees rather than perpetual trainees
- Transparent evaluation and mentorship
- Viable pathways out of postdoc positions (whether academic or non-academic)

**Current impact**: Postdocs perform a disproportionate share of the nation's research, often working 50-60+ hours per week for salaries that, adjusted for education level and age, place them well below comparably trained professionals. Many sacrifice years of earning potential, retirement savings, and family stability.

**Power**: Growing through unionization and advocacy. Postdoc associations and unions at institutions like the University of California, Columbia, and others have won salary increases. National organizations like the National Postdoctoral Association advocate for policy changes. However, the transience of postdoc positions (most move on within a few years) limits sustained collective action.

### Adjunct and Contingent Faculty

**Population**: Approximately 750,000 part-time faculty and 350,000 full-time non-tenure-track faculty in the United States.

**Interests**:

- Fair compensation and benefits
- Job security and multi-year contracts
- Access to professional development and research support
- Pathways to permanent positions
- Recognition of their contribution to institutional missions

**Current impact**: Adjuncts and contingent faculty teach the majority of undergraduate courses at many institutions while earning poverty-level wages with no job security, no benefits, and no research support. Many piece together work across multiple institutions.

**Power**: Limited but growing. Adjunct unions have formed at some institutions. Public awareness campaigns (such as the hashtag #AdjunctLife) have drawn attention to working conditions. However, the oversupply of PhD-trained applicants weakens bargaining power, and adjuncts are often excluded from faculty governance.

### International Researchers and Students

**Population**: Approximately 400,000 international students in STEM graduate programs; roughly 45% of the doctoral STEM workforce is foreign-born.

**Interests**:

- Clear, stable immigration pathways
- Freedom to change employers without losing visa status
- Timely green card processing without per-country backlogs
- Protection from discriminatory security investigations
- Equal treatment in hiring, promotion, and compensation

**Current impact**: International researchers power much of American science but face unique vulnerabilities. Visa dependence limits job mobility and salary negotiation. Green card backlogs create decade-long uncertainty. Security investigations have created a chilling effect, particularly for Chinese-born researchers.

**Power**: Limited by immigration status. International researchers who speak out risk visa complications. However, their collective importance to the research enterprise gives them implicit leverage---policies that drive away international talent visibly harm U.S. research output.

### Tenured and Tenure-Track Faculty

**Population**: Approximately 350,000 tenured or tenure-track faculty at U.S. institutions.

**Interests**:

- Maintaining research productivity (which depends on graduate students and postdocs)
- Attracting talented students to their labs
- Preserving academic freedom and tenure protections
- Adequate funding for research programs
- Maintaining departmental prestige and rankings

**Current impact**: Tenured faculty are the primary beneficiaries of the current system. They direct the labor of graduate students and postdocs, control hiring decisions, and set the cultural norms that define "success." Most tenured faculty are genuinely committed to mentoring and student welfare, but the structural incentives they operate within reward labor extraction.

**Power**: High. Tenured faculty control departmental governance, hiring committees, graduate admissions, and the peer review systems that distribute funding and prestige. They are the most politically influential group within universities and professional societies.

### University Administrators

**Interests**:

- Controlling costs (adjuncts are cheaper than tenure-track faculty)
- Generating revenue from research grants (indirect cost recovery)
- Maintaining enrollment and tuition revenue
- Building institutional prestige through research output
- Managing accreditation and regulatory compliance

**Current impact**: Administrators drive the adjunctification of the faculty by replacing tenure-track lines with contingent positions. They benefit from the indirect cost revenue generated by the research enterprise. Their decisions about faculty hiring, facilities investment, and graduate program size shape the labor market.

**Power**: Very high. Administrators control budgets, hiring lines, and institutional strategy. The growing "administrative bloat" at universities has shifted power from faculty governance to professional management.

### Federal Funding Agencies (NIH, NSF, DOE, etc.)

**Interests**:

- Maximizing research output per dollar invested
- Training the next generation of researchers
- Advancing national competitiveness and security
- Ensuring responsible stewardship of public funds
- Maintaining the health of the research enterprise

**Current impact**: Funding agencies shape the workforce through grant mechanisms that fund trainee positions, training grant programs, career development awards, and postdoc salary guidelines. Their policies on stipend levels, time limits, and career development requirements directly affect trainee welfare.

**Power**: Enormous. NIH alone funds approximately 300,000 researchers. Agency policies on stipend minimums, training duration limits, and career outcome reporting can reshape the workforce landscape.

### Industry Employers

**Interests**:

- Access to PhD-trained talent with relevant skills
- Workers who can transition smoothly from academic training to industrial research
- Immigration pathways that allow hiring and retaining international talent
- Research collaborations with universities
- Advocacy for STEM education funding that builds the talent pipeline

**Current impact**: Industry employs a growing share of STEM PhDs and generally offers dramatically better compensation, benefits, and work-life balance than academia. However, industry hiring often values skills (project management, communication, teamwork, industry-specific knowledge) that academic training does not provide.

**Power**: Significant and growing. Large technology, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies are major employers of STEM PhDs and increasingly shape the labor market through compensation practices. Industry lobbying influences H-1B policy and STEM education funding.

### Professional Societies and Advocacy Organizations

**Key organizations**:

- **National Postdoctoral Association (NPA)**: Advocates for postdoc welfare
- **American Association of University Professors (AAUP)**: Defends academic freedom and faculty governance
- **Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)**: Advocates for biomedical research funding and workforce reform
- **American Chemical Society (ACS)**: Tracks chemistry workforce trends and advocates for chemist welfare
- **Service Employees International Union (SEIU)**: Organizes adjuncts, graduate students, and postdocs
- **National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine**: Produces authoritative workforce studies

**Power**: Moderate. These organizations shape the discourse, produce influential reports, and lobby Congress and agencies, but their recommendations are often implemented slowly or incompletely.

## Key Dynamics

### The Principal Investigator Dilemma

Individual PIs face a genuine tension. They care about their trainees' welfare and career success, but the incentive structure rewards maximizing research output through low-cost labor. A PI who reduces lab size, pays postdocs more, or encourages students to explore non-academic paths may produce fewer publications, win fewer grants, and fall behind colleagues who do not. Structural reform must change the incentives, not just appeal to individual virtue.

### The Administrator-Faculty Divide

Faculty and administrators have fundamentally different perspectives on the workforce. Faculty see graduate students and postdocs as junior colleagues in training; administrators see them as cost-effective labor inputs. Faculty want more tenure-track lines; administrators want flexibility. This divide makes internal reform difficult without external pressure from funders, accreditors, or legislators.

### The International Talent Paradox

The United States benefits enormously from international STEM talent but treats international researchers in ways that undermine their welfare and, increasingly, their willingness to come or stay. Visa restrictions, green card backlogs, employer dependence, and security overreach work at cross-purposes with the goal of attracting and retaining the world's best scientists.
