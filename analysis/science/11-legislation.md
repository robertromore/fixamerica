# Science Policy: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Science policy legislation operates primarily at the federal level, as the constitutional authority for federal research spending derives from the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8) and the Commerce Clause. Unlike many other policy domains, federal science policy has historically enjoyed bipartisan support, though this consensus has eroded in recent years. This document proposes two major federal bills addressing the core structural problems in American science policy: funding instability and the absence of statutory protections for scientific integrity.

Constitutional amendments are not required for science policy reform. The federal government has clear constitutional authority to fund research, regulate research conduct, and establish open access requirements for federally funded work. The primary legislative challenges are political, not constitutional.

## Federal Legislation

### Federal Research Stability and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To stabilize federal research funding through multi-year appropriations authority, reform the grant system to reduce waste and encourage innovation, modernize indirect cost policies, and strengthen protections for the research workforce.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Research Stability and
Accountability Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Federal investment in research and development is essential to
    national security, economic competitiveness, and public health.
(2) The annual appropriations cycle creates funding instability that
    disrupts multi-year research programs, wastes researcher time, and
    reduces the efficiency of federal research investment.
(3) The current grant system imposes excessive administrative burden
    on researchers, with principal investigators spending 40 to 50
    percent of their time on grant writing rather than research.
(4) Declining grant success rates discourage innovative, high-risk
    research and create perverse incentives that undermine scientific
    quality.
(5) The United States faces growing competition from China and other
    nations in research investment and scientific output.
(6) The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorized historic increases
    in research funding, but appropriations have consistently fallen
    short of authorized levels.

            of continuing resolutions;
        (B) bridge funding gaps caused by lapses in appropriations;
            and
        (C) supplement agency research budgets when appropriations
            fall below the levels authorized in the most recent
            authorization act by more than 5 percent.
    (4) REPORTING.—The Director of OSTP shall submit to Congress an
        annual report on deposits, expenditures, and balances in
        the Fund.
(d) CONTINUING RESOLUTION PROTECTION.—During any period in which a

    assessment of progress toward the target described in subsection
    (a).

SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary
to carry out this Act.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** addresses the core problem of funding instability by creating multi-year appropriations authority and a stabilization fund. The continuing resolution protection ensures that ongoing research is not disrupted by congressional budget disputes.
- **Section 5** reforms the grant system to reduce wasted researcher time, encourage innovation through longer grants and people-based funding, and address bias in peer review.
- **Section 6** balances the need for institutional support with accountability by requiring transparency in indirect cost spending and phasing in a rate cap over 5 years.
- **Section 7** addresses workforce exploitation by setting minimum compensation and benefits for postdocs and graduate students, with term limits to prevent indefinite postdoctoral service.
- **Section 8** establishes a non-binding investment target as a signal of national commitment.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Appropriations committees may resist multi-year authority as an encroachment on their power
- Universities will lobby vigorously against indirect cost caps
- Budget hawks may oppose the Research Stabilization Fund as a spending bypass
- Some agencies may resist standardization of grant processes

**Refinements**:

- If full multi-year appropriations prove politically infeasible, advance appropriations (one year ahead) for research agencies could serve as a compromise
- Indirect cost transparency requirements could be enacted first, with caps considered after data on spending patterns is available
- People-based funding percentages could start lower and ramp up based on evaluation results
- Postdoc salary mandates could be phased in regionally to account for cost-of-living differences

### Scientific Integrity and Open Science Act

**Purpose**: To codify scientific integrity protections at all federal agencies, mandate open access to federally funded research and data, establish whistleblower protections for government scientists, and create enforcement mechanisms for scientific integrity violations.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Scientific Integrity and Open
Science Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Scientific integrity is essential for evidence-based
    policymaking, public health, and national security.
(2) Political interference with scientific research, findings, and
    communication undermines public trust and produces worse policy
    outcomes.
(3) The Federal Government invests approximately $200,000,000,000
    annually in research and development, and the results of that
    investment should be freely accessible to the public that
    funded it.
(4) Existing scientific integrity policies are executive actions
    that can be reversed without congressional authorization,
    providing insufficient protection for the scientific enterprise.
(5) Government scientists have faced retaliation for communicating
    findings that conflict with political preferences, creating a
    chilling effect on scientific independence.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(a) COVERED AGENCY.—The term "covered agency" means any Federal
    agency that—
    (1) funds, conducts, or oversees scientific research;
    (2) uses scientific information to inform policy decisions; or
    (3) communicates scientific findings to the public.
(b) SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY.—The term "scientific integrity" means the
    adherence to professional values and practices in the conduct,
    reporting, communication, and use of science, free from
    inappropriate political, ideological, financial, or personal
    influence.
(c) GOVERNMENT SCIENTIST.—The term "government scientist" means any
    Federal employee, contractor, or grantee whose primary duties
    involve conducting, supervising, or communicating scientific
    research.
(d) SCIENTIFIC FINDING.—The term "scientific finding" means any
    conclusion, recommendation, assessment, or communication based
    on scientific research, data, or analysis produced by or for a
    covered agency.
(e) FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH.—The term "federally funded research"
    means any research activity supported in whole or in part by
    Federal funds, whether conducted by Federal employees, at
    universities, at national laboratories, or by other entities.

SEC. 4. SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY POLICIES.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment
    of this Act, each covered agency shall establish, maintain, and
    enforce a scientific integrity policy that, at a minimum—
    (1) ensures that scientific findings are generated and
        communicated free from political interference, censorship,
        or inappropriate influence;
    (2) prohibits any political appointee, supervisor, or other
        official from—
        (A) directing, pressuring, or coercing the alteration of
            scientific findings;
        (B) suppressing or delaying the publication or
            communication of scientific findings;
        (C) retaliating against any government scientist for
            communicating scientific findings; or
        (D) misrepresenting scientific findings in official
            communications;
    (3) protects the right of government scientists to—
        (A) publish research in peer-reviewed journals;

(c) BURDEN OF PROOF.—If a government scientist demonstrates that
    protected activity was a contributing factor in a personnel
    action, the burden shifts to the agency to demonstrate by clear
    and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action
    absent the protected activity.

SEC. 7. OPEN ACCESS TO FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH.

(a) PUBLICATIONS.—
    (1) Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment, each
        covered agency shall require that all peer-reviewed
        scholarly publications arising from federally funded
        research be made freely available to the public—
        (A) immediately upon publication in a peer-reviewed
            journal; and
        (B) in a publicly accessible repository designated by the
            agency.
    (2) No embargo period shall apply to publications arising from
        federally funded research.
    (3) Authors shall retain sufficient rights to comply with this
        requirement, and any publication agreement that prevents
        compliance shall be void as against public policy.
(b) RESEARCH DATA.—
    (1) Each covered agency shall require that research data
        generated with Federal funding be—
        (A) deposited in a publicly accessible repository within
            12 months of publication of associated findings;
        (B) formatted in accordance with FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
            Interoperable, Reusable) data principles; and
        (C) accompanied by sufficient metadata and documentation

        trends in article processing charges and their impact on
        research budgets.

SEC. 8. SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY COMMITTEES.

(a) COMPOSITION.—Scientific advisory committees established under
    the Federal Advisory Committee Act shall—
    (1) include members selected primarily on the basis of
        scientific expertise;
    (2) limit the participation of individuals with financial
        conflicts of interest; and
    (3) reflect the diversity of the scientific community.

There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary
to carry out this Act.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4** codifies scientific integrity requirements that currently exist only as executive policies, making them resistant to reversal by future administrations.
- **Section 5** creates independent Scientific Integrity Officers at each agency with for-cause removal protection, modeled on the Inspector General structure.
- **Section 6** provides robust whistleblower protections, including a burden-shifting framework that makes retaliation cases viable.
- **Section 7** codifies and strengthens the Nelson Memo's open access requirements, eliminating embargo periods and requiring FAIR data sharing.
- **Section 8** protects the integrity of scientific advisory committees from political manipulation.
- **Section 9** creates multiple enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Some agencies may argue that scientific integrity requirements conflict with their mission needs
- Publishers will lobby against immediate open access and the APC cap
- Political appointees may resist constraints on their authority over agency communications
- Data sharing requirements raise legitimate privacy and security concerns that must be carefully addressed

**Refinements**:

- Privacy exceptions for data sharing could be expanded to cover sensitive ecological data (e.g., locations of endangered species)
- The APC cap could be set as a percentage of grant size rather than a fixed dollar amount
- A phase-in period for open access could be provided for agencies that lack repository infrastructure
- Scientific Integrity Officer removal protections could be strengthened by requiring Senate confirmation

## State Model Legislation

### State Science Advisory Act

**Purpose**: To establish science advisory capacity in state governments and protect state-employed scientists.

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Science Advisory and
Integrity Act".

SECTION 2. STATE SCIENCE ADVISOR.

(a) The Governor shall appoint a State Science Advisor with
    demonstrated expertise in scientific research.
(b) The State Science Advisor shall—
    (1) advise the Governor and state agencies on scientific
        matters;
    (2) coordinate science-related policy across state agencies;
    (3) promote evidence-based policymaking; and
    (4) facilitate collaboration between state government and
        research institutions.

SECTION 3. SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY.

(a) No state official shall direct, pressure, or coerce the
    alteration or suppression of scientific findings produced by
    state employees.
(b) State scientists shall have the right to publish research
    findings and communicate with the public about their work.

SECTION 4. OPEN ACCESS.

(a) Research produced by state agencies shall be made publicly
    available in a timely manner.
(b) The state shall maintain or designate a public repository for
    state-funded research.
```

**Adaptations**: States with large research universities may expand this to include state-funded research at those institutions. States with significant natural resource or environmental science programs may add specific provisions for environmental data transparency.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### OSTP Scientific Integrity Implementation Rule

**Existing Authority**: National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6611 et seq.)

**Draft Regulation**: OSTP would issue a government-wide directive (building on the 2023 Scientific Integrity Framework) that:

- Requires each agency to appoint a Scientific Integrity Official within 6 months
- Establishes minimum standards for scientific integrity policies
- Creates a government-wide complaints database
- Requires annual reporting on scientific integrity compliance
- Establishes procedures for cross-agency coordination on integrity issues

### OMB Indirect Cost Transparency Circular

**Existing Authority**: OMB Circular A-21 (2 CFR Part 200)

**Draft Regulation**: Revise OMB Circular A-21 to:

- Require institutions to publish annual reports on indirect cost expenditures
- Establish standardized categories for reporting indirect cost spending
- Create a public database of institutional indirect cost rates and expenditure patterns
- Phase in a maximum indirect cost rate over 5 years

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

Federal science funding rests on well-established constitutional authority:

- **Spending Clause**: Congress has broad authority to spend for the "general welfare," which clearly encompasses scientific research
- **Commerce Clause**: Regulation of federally funded research (including open access requirements) is a valid exercise of commerce power
- **First Amendment**: Protections for government scientist speech must be balanced against the government's ability to control official communications; the proposed legislation carefully navigates this by protecting professional scientific communication while acknowledging agency authority over official statements

### Preemption Questions

- Federal open access requirements would preempt any state laws restricting access to federally funded research
- Scientific integrity protections supplement, but do not preempt, state employee protections
- Indirect cost regulations apply only to institutions receiving federal funds and do not raise preemption issues

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- Inspector General oversight provides internal accountability
- GAO audits provide external oversight
- Whistleblower protections with private right of action provide individual enforcement
- Congressional reporting requirements maintain legislative oversight
- OSTP coordination ensures government-wide consistency

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- GAO audit required 3 years after enactment and every 5 years thereafter
- OSTP annual reporting creates continuous monitoring
- APC cap indexed to inflation provides automatic adjustment
- Scientific Integrity Officer terms ensure regular review of implementation

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Federal Research Stability and Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Stabilization Fund raids | Congress could redirect Fund balances to non-research purposes | High |
| Agency definition gaming | Agencies could restructure to avoid "covered agency" threshold | Medium |
| Indirect cost workarounds | Universities could shift costs to direct charges to circumvent caps | High |
| People-based funding lip service | Agencies could relabel existing programs to meet percentage targets | Medium |
| Postdoc reclassification | Institutions could reclassify postdocs as "research associates" to avoid requirements | High |
| CR protection erosion | Future CRs could include language overriding the protection provisions | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Non-binding R&D target | 1% GDP target is "sense of Congress" with no enforcement | Political reality -- binding targets would face opposition |
| No mandatory funding | All funding remains discretionary and subject to annual appropriations | Constitutional -- Congress cannot bind future Congresses |
| Limited scope of grant reform | Reforms apply only to "covered agencies," leaving smaller programs unaddressed | Administrative complexity of universal requirements |
| No enforcement for indirect cost transparency | Reporting requirement lacks penalties for non-compliance | University lobbying resistance |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Stabilization Fund protection**: Add a provision requiring a supermajority vote to redirect Fund balances, similar to Social Security Trust Fund protections
2. **Anti-reclassification provision**: Define "postdoctoral researcher" broadly to include any individual with a doctoral degree in a temporary research training position, regardless of title
3. **Indirect cost enforcement**: Add a provision suspending new grant awards to institutions that fail to comply with transparency requirements
4. **People-based funding verification**: Require OSTP to verify that programs counted toward the percentage are genuinely people-based, with published criteria and annual reporting
5. **CR override prevention**: Include a provision stating that the research protection provisions may only be overridden by specific reference to this Act

### Scientific Integrity and Open Science Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "National security" exception abuse | Agencies could classify findings as security-sensitive to avoid disclosure | High |
| Contractor loophole | Integrity protections may not cover contractors performing scientific work | Medium |
| APC cap circumvention | Publishers could unbundle services and charge separately for formatting, indexing, etc. | Medium |
| Advisory committee stacking | Agencies could define "scientific expertise" broadly to include industry advocates | Medium |
| Slow-walking investigations | Integrity Officers could delay investigations without formal deadlines | Medium |
| Data exception overuse | Agencies could claim broad privacy or security exceptions to avoid data sharing | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No penalties for political appointees | Violators face no personal consequences beyond policy remediation | Separation of powers concerns |
| Limited reach to state-funded research | Open access applies only to federally funded work | Federalism -- cannot mandate state policy |
| Repository sustainability | No permanent funding stream for data repositories | Discretionary funding vulnerability |
| International publisher jurisdiction | Cannot directly regulate foreign publishers' practices | Limits of U.S. jurisdiction |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **National security exception narrowing**: Require that any security classification of scientific findings be reviewed by the Scientific Integrity Officer and reported to the Inspector General
2. **Contractor coverage**: Explicitly define "government scientist" to include all contractors whose primary duties involve scientific research
3. **APC cap expansion**: Define "article processing charges" to include all charges associated with publication, regardless of how they are labeled
4. **Investigation timelines**: Add a requirement that investigations be completed within 180 days, with extensions only for cause
5. **Repository funding**: Establish a dedicated appropriation line for research data infrastructure, separate from agency research budgets

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Agency resistance to standardization | OSTP coordination authority with OMB budget enforcement |
| Publisher lobbying against open access | Build coalition of universities, libraries, and funders to counter |
| University resistance to indirect cost reform | Phase in changes; provide separate infrastructure funding |
| Political will for funding increases | Frame as national security and competitiveness investment |
| Workforce reform implementation | Require compliance as condition of grant eligibility |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- 3-year GAO audit assesses initial implementation across all covered agencies
- OSTP annual reports create continuous feedback loop
- 5-year congressional reauthorization review for grant reform provisions
- Automatic adjustment of postdoc salary minimums and APC caps for inflation
- Scientific Integrity Officer terms create regular opportunities for review and adjustment
