# Research Infrastructure: Stakeholders

## Overview

Research infrastructure touches a broad range of stakeholders, from the scientists who use facilities daily to the taxpayers who fund them and the communities that host them. Understanding the interests, power, and positions of these stakeholders is essential for crafting viable reforms.

---

## Primary Stakeholders

### Researchers and Scientists

**Interest**: Access to state-of-the-art facilities and equipment to conduct competitive research.

**Key concerns:**

- Oversubscription of user facilities limits access to beamtime, computing allocations, and ship time
- Aging equipment reduces data quality and experimental capabilities
- Geographic barriers disadvantage researchers at institutions far from major facilities
- Proposal-based access systems favor established researchers over early-career scientists
- Facility shutdowns for upgrades disrupt ongoing research programs

**Power level**: Moderate. Researchers influence policy through professional societies, advisory committees, and testimony but do not constitute a politically powerful constituency.

**Segments:**

| Segment | Distinct Interests |
|---------|-------------------|
| National lab scientists | Facility operations budgets; lab infrastructure renewal |
| University faculty at R1 institutions | Access to national facilities; on-campus instrumentation |
| Faculty at under-resourced institutions | Equity of access; remote capabilities; travel support |
| Early-career researchers | Access to facilities without established track records |
| Industry scientists | Proprietary-access options; rapid turnaround |
| International collaborators | Visa access; reciprocal facility agreements |

### Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Researchers

**Interest**: Training opportunities at world-class facilities; career preparation.

**Key concerns:**

- Limited beamtime and computing allocations constrain thesis research
- Facility closures or reduced schedules extend time to degree
- Training on obsolete equipment reduces competitiveness in the job market
- Housing and travel costs for facility visits are poorly supported
- Inequitable access based on advisor reputation and institutional prestige

**Power level**: Low. Trainees have minimal political influence and depend on their advisors and institutions for advocacy.

### Technical and Operations Staff

**Interest**: Stable employment, competitive compensation, and recognition for essential contributions to research.

**Key concerns:**

- Salaries below private sector equivalents
- Job insecurity during budget fluctuations and continuing resolutions
- Aging infrastructure creates safety hazards
- Retirement of experienced colleagues without knowledge transfer
- Limited career advancement pathways at some facilities

**Power level**: Low to moderate. Unionized staff at some facilities have some collective bargaining power. Professional associations provide limited advocacy.

## Institutional Stakeholders

### Research Universities

**Interest**: Modern laboratory facilities to attract faculty, win grants, and train students.

**Key concerns:**

- Deferred maintenance backlog measured in billions across the university sector
- Capital construction costs increasingly borne by universities rather than federal grants
- Competition for faculty requires state-of-the-art facilities
- Indirect cost rates do not fully cover facility operation and maintenance
- Disparities between wealthy and less-resourced institutions

**Power level**: High. The Association of American Universities (AAU) and other higher education associations are effective lobbyists with significant Congressional influence.

**Segments:**

| Institution Type | Priority Infrastructure Needs |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| R1 public universities | Core facility upgrades; deferred maintenance; computing |
| R1 private universities | Often self-fund but seek federal partnership for major projects |
| R2 universities | Basic laboratory renovation; instrumentation |
| HBCUs and MSIs | Foundation-level infrastructure; new research capacity |
| Primarily undergraduate institutions | Teaching lab modernization; research equipment |

### National Laboratories

**Interest**: Sustained investment in facility construction, operations, and maintenance.

**Key concerns:**

- Deferred maintenance backlog at DOE labs estimated at $4-6 billion
- Operating budgets consumed by facility maintenance, leaving less for research
- Workforce recruitment and retention increasingly difficult
- Construction project management under intense Congressional scrutiny
- Managing the portfolio balance between weapons/defense and civilian research

**Power level**: High. National laboratories have strong Congressional champions in their host states and districts, and their management contractors (Battelle, the University of California system, etc.) are politically connected.

### Federal Funding Agencies

**Interest**: Adequate budgets to fulfill their statutory missions and maintain their infrastructure portfolios.

| Agency | Infrastructure Interest | Political Dynamics |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| DOE Office of Science | Largest facility portfolio; must balance construction, operations, and research | Strong Congressional support from lab-hosting states |
| NSF | MREFC projects; university infrastructure; mid-scale programs | Broad but shallow political support |
| NIH | Intramural campus maintenance; extramural construction grants | Very strong constituency (patient advocacy groups) |
| NASA | Space missions and research centers | Public enthusiasm but budget-constrained |
| DOD/DARPA | Defense research facilities and computing | Strong Congressional support tied to national security |
| NIST | Standards laboratories and measurement facilities | Smaller constituency but bipartisan support |

---

## Political Stakeholders

### Congress

**Interest**: Directing infrastructure investment to their states and districts; demonstrating fiscal responsibility; responding to national security concerns.

**Key dynamics:**

- Members from states hosting national laboratories strongly support facility funding
- Appropriations committee members have outsized influence over which projects move forward
- Authorizing committees (Senate Commerce, House Science) set policy but cannot guarantee funding
- Earmarks for university infrastructure have returned as a Congressional tool
- Budget hawks target large-scale projects as examples of wasteful spending

**Key committees:**

| Committee | Jurisdiction |
|-----------|-------------|
| Senate Appropriations, Energy and Water Development | DOE national lab funding |
| Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation | NSF authorization; science policy |
| House Appropriations, Energy and Water Development | DOE funding |
| House Science, Space, and Technology | NSF, NASA, DOE authorization |
| Senate/House Armed Services | DOD research facility funding |

### Executive Branch (OSTP, OMB)

**Interest**: Aligning research infrastructure investment with presidential priorities; controlling costs.

- **OSTP**: Coordinates interagency science policy but has limited budget authority
- **OMB**: Controls agency budget submissions; frequently cuts agency infrastructure requests before they reach Congress
- **National Science and Technology Council**: Provides interagency coordination on research infrastructure priorities

### State and Local Governments

**Interest**: Economic development, jobs, and prestige associated with hosting research facilities.

- States compete aggressively to host new facilities (e.g., competition for DOE projects)
- Local governments benefit from property taxes, employment, and associated economic activity
- State governments provide matching funds for some university infrastructure
- Community opposition can emerge over environmental, safety, or land-use concerns

## Industry Stakeholders

### Technology and Defense Companies

**Interest**: Access to advanced research facilities for proprietary research; workforce pipeline; technology transfer.

- Major technology companies use DOE light sources and computing facilities for materials research and product development
- Defense contractors rely on national laboratory capabilities for weapons simulation and materials testing
- Pharmaceutical companies use synchrotron beamlines for drug discovery (structural biology)
- Semiconductor companies benefit from nanoscience centers and characterization facilities

**Power level**: High. Industry has significant lobbying power and can frame infrastructure investment as economic competitiveness.

### Facility Construction and Equipment Contractors

**Interest**: Contracts for building, equipping, and maintaining research facilities.

- Engineering and construction firms (Bechtel, Jacobs, AECOM) compete for large facility projects
- Scientific equipment manufacturers (Bruker, Thermo Fisher, JEOL) supply instruments
- Computing companies (HPE/Cray, Intel, AMD, NVIDIA) compete for supercomputer contracts
- These firms lobby for sustained infrastructure investment

**Power level**: Moderate to high. Contractors are organized and politically active, particularly in states where projects are located.

| Research!America | Health research | Patient-focused advocacy for NIH funding including facilities |
| The Science Coalition | University research | University presidents advocating for federal research investment |
| Coalition for National Science Funding | NSF budget | Broad coalition supporting NSF including MREFC |
| Universities Research Association (URA) | National lab management | Consortium managing Fermilab; advocates for high-energy physics infrastructure |

### General Public and Taxpayers

**Interest**: Return on investment from public research infrastructure; economic benefits; national prestige.

- Public generally supports science but has limited awareness of research infrastructure specifics
- Taxpayer watchdog groups scrutinize cost overruns and project management failures
- Communities hosting facilities generally support them for economic reasons
- Public engagement increases during high-visibility events (telescope discoveries, computing milestones)

**Power level**: Diffuse but significant during elections and budget debates.

## Underrepresented Stakeholders

### Researchers at Minority-Serving Institutions

Researchers at HBCUs, HSIs, Tribal Colleges, and other MSIs face systematic barriers to accessing research infrastructure. They are underrepresented in:

- User facility allocation committees
- Federal advisory boards that set infrastructure priorities
- The proposal review process for facility access
- The political advocacy ecosystem around research infrastructure

### Early-Career Researchers

Junior faculty, postdocs, and graduate students depend heavily on shared research infrastructure but have minimal voice in decisions about facility priorities, access policies, or construction timelines.

### Rural and Geographically Isolated Researchers

Scientists at institutions far from major facilities face travel costs, logistical barriers, and network disadvantages that reduce their access to shared infrastructure. Remote access capabilities and distributed user programs help but do not fully address the gap.

### Facility Decommissioning Communities

Communities that host facilities facing closure or decommissioning face economic dislocation but are rarely included in planning processes. The closure of the Tevatron at Fermilab, the collapse of Arecibo, and the potential future decommissioning of aging facilities all carry significant community impact.
