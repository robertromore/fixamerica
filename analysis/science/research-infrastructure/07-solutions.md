# Research Infrastructure: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the research infrastructure crisis requires action across multiple dimensions: establishing dedicated funding mechanisms, reforming governance and planning, expanding equitable access, and investing strategically in next-generation facilities. The solutions below are organized from most to least achievable in the near term, though all are necessary for a comprehensive response.

## Funding Reform

### Establish a Federal Research Infrastructure Capital Account

**Problem**: Research infrastructure construction competes directly with research grants within agency operating budgets, creating a zero-sum dynamic that undermines both.

**Solution**: Create a separate federal capital budget account for research infrastructure construction and major renovation projects, analogous to the capital budgets used by corporations, state governments, and international research organizations.

**Key elements:**

- Separate capital account within each major science agency (DOE, NSF, NIH, NASA)
- Capital projects funded through multi-year appropriations commitments rather than annual discretionary competition
- Maintenance and operations for existing facilities funded from operating budgets with mandatory minimum thresholds
- Capital account subject to independent cost estimation and project management oversight

**Expected impact**: Eliminates the false choice between infrastructure and research grants; provides funding stability for multi-year construction projects; reduces cost overruns caused by stop-start funding.

### Create a Research Infrastructure Trust Fund

**Problem**: Research infrastructure investment depends entirely on annual appropriations, which are volatile and politically vulnerable.

**Solution**: Establish a Research Infrastructure Trust Fund capitalized by a dedicated revenue stream and managed by an independent board, similar to the Highway Trust Fund.

**Potential revenue sources:**

| Source | Estimated Annual Revenue | Political Feasibility |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Technology sector assessment (0.1% of revenue for companies over $10B) | $5-8 billion | Low-moderate |
| Patent and licensing fee surcharge | $500 million - $1 billion | Moderate |
| Spectrum auction proceeds dedicated portion | $1-3 billion (variable) | Moderate |
| Federal R&D tax credit reduction offset | $2-4 billion | Low |
| General appropriations with mandatory spending designation | $5-10 billion | Moderate |

**Expected impact**: Provides stable, predictable funding insulated from annual budget politics; enables long-term planning for facility construction and maintenance.

### Mandatory Maintenance Funding Floors

**Problem**: Agencies consistently underfund maintenance to redirect money to higher-priority research and construction.

**Solution**: Require agencies to spend a minimum percentage of facility replacement value on annual maintenance, similar to requirements imposed by some states on their transportation infrastructure.

**Recommended minimum**: 2-4% of facility replacement value annually for routine maintenance, with a separate capital renewal account for major systems replacement.

**Expected impact**: Prevents further growth of the deferred maintenance backlog; extends facility lifetimes; reduces total lifecycle costs.

## Governance Reform

### Establish a National Research Infrastructure Coordinating Board

**Problem**: No entity has visibility into the full portfolio of U.S. research infrastructure or the authority to coordinate investment across agencies.

**Solution**: Create an interagency coordinating board, housed at OSTP or as an independent entity, with responsibility for:

- Maintaining a comprehensive inventory of federally funded research infrastructure
- Conducting periodic condition assessments across the portfolio
- Identifying gaps, redundancies, and emerging needs
- Advising Congress and the President on infrastructure investment priorities
- Coordinating with international partners on shared facility development

**Composition**: Representatives from DOE, NSF, NIH, NASA, DOD, USDA, NIST, OMB, and OSTP, plus outside experts from academia, industry, and national laboratories.

**Expected impact**: Provides strategic coherence to a fragmented system; enables portfolio-level optimization; improves Congressional decision-making.

### Reform Cost Estimation and Project Management

**Problem**: Cost overruns and schedule delays erode confidence in research infrastructure investment.

**Solution**: Implement rigorous, independent cost estimation and project management reforms:

- Require independent cost estimates (ICE) for all projects over $100 million before Congressional authorization
- Establish a Research Infrastructure Project Management Office within OSTP with authority to set standards across agencies
- Require earned value management (EVM) reporting for all major projects
- Create a "red team" review process for projects exceeding cost or schedule thresholds
- Publish annual performance reports comparing planned vs. actual costs and schedules

**Model**: DOE's Office of Project Management has improved DOE project outcomes; extend this approach government-wide.

**Expected impact**: Reduces cost overruns; builds Congressional confidence; provides early warning of troubled projects.

### Streamline Environmental Review Without Sacrificing Protection

**Problem**: Environmental review processes add years to project timelines without proportionate environmental benefit for projects with minimal environmental impact.

**Solution**: Create a categorical exclusion process for research infrastructure projects that:

- Are built on existing federal or university property
- Do not involve radioactive materials or significant hazardous waste
- Do not affect protected species or cultural resources
- Fall below defined size and disturbance thresholds

Projects exceeding these criteria would still undergo full NEPA review. The goal is faster processing for routine upgrades and equipment installations, not exemption from environmental law.

**Expected impact**: Reduces project timelines by 1-2 years for qualifying projects; maintains environmental protection for larger or more impactful construction.

## Access and Equity

### National Research Infrastructure Access Program

**Problem**: Researchers at under-resourced institutions face barriers to accessing major facilities, perpetuating inequality in scientific capability.

**Solution**: Create a comprehensive access program that includes:

- **Travel grants**: Funded travel to user facilities for researchers and students at under-resourced institutions, HBCUs, HSIs, Tribal Colleges, and institutions in EPSCoR states
- **Remote access capabilities**: Invest in telepresence, remote instrument control, and data streaming so that researchers can conduct experiments at national facilities from their home institutions
- **Mentored access**: Pair first-time facility users with experienced mentors who can help navigate proposal processes and experimental design
- **Dedicated beamtime and computing allocations**: Reserve a percentage of facility capacity for researchers from under-resourced institutions
- **Equipment loan programs**: Circulate portable instrumentation to institutions that cannot afford to purchase it

**Expected impact**: Broadens the research workforce; brings new perspectives and expertise to national facilities; addresses historic underinvestment in minority-serving institutions.

### Regional Research Infrastructure Hubs

**Problem**: Research infrastructure is geographically concentrated, creating access barriers and limiting the economic benefits of research investment.

**Solution**: Establish 10-15 regional research infrastructure hubs across the country, each providing:

- Mid-scale instrumentation (electron microscopes, mass spectrometers, NMR systems)
- Regional high-performance computing clusters
- Shared fabrication and characterization facilities
- Training programs for facility operation and experimental techniques
- Connections to national user facilities through high-speed networks

**Siting criteria**: Priority for regions currently underserved by research infrastructure, including EPSCoR states, rural areas, and regions with significant MSI presence.

**Model**: European Union's distributed research infrastructure networks; NSF's National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI).

**Expected impact**: Democratizes access to research capabilities; creates regional innovation ecosystems; distributes economic benefits of infrastructure investment.

## Strategic Investment

### Next-Generation Facility Roadmap

**Problem**: The U.S. lacks a comprehensive, cross-agency roadmap for research infrastructure investment over the next 20-30 years.

**Solution**: Commission a government-wide Research Infrastructure Decadal Plan that:

- Surveys the condition of existing infrastructure across all agencies
- Identifies facilities approaching end of life and plans for replacement or decommissioning
- Prioritizes new facility construction based on scientific opportunity, economic impact, and national security needs
- Coordinates with international partners to identify shared facility opportunities
- Provides cost estimates and funding scenarios for the full plan
- Is updated every five years

**Model**: The astronomy and astrophysics decadal survey (managed by the National Academies) has successfully guided investment priorities for decades. Extend this model to all research infrastructure.

**Expected impact**: Provides strategic direction for infrastructure investment; enables long-term planning; improves coordination across agencies and with international partners.

### Priority Investments

Based on current gaps and opportunities, the following investments should receive priority:
