# Research Infrastructure: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Sustaining U.S. leadership in science requires a legislative framework that provides stable, long-term funding for research infrastructure; addresses the massive deferred maintenance backlog at universities and national laboratories; and ensures equitable access to facilities for researchers at all types of institutions. This document provides draft text for two federal bills: the Research Infrastructure Modernization Act (establishing a capital account and mandatory maintenance funding) and the Research Infrastructure Equity Act (investing in under-resourced institutions and creating regional infrastructure hubs). Together, these bills address the structural funding and access problems identified in the analysis.

## Federal Legislation

### Research Infrastructure Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Establish a dedicated federal capital account for research infrastructure construction and major renovation, require mandatory maintenance funding floors, reform project management, and create a coordinating board to provide strategic oversight of the national research infrastructure portfolio.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Research Infrastructure Modernization
Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The United States maintains approximately 28 Department of
    Energy user facilities, dozens of National Science Foundation
    major research equipment projects, and research infrastructure
    at more than 3,000 colleges and universities.
(2) Federal investment in research facilities and equipment has
    declined as a share of GDP since the 1960s, even as the
    complexity and cost of frontier science have increased.
(3) The deferred maintenance backlog at Department of Energy
    national laboratories is estimated at $4,000,000,000 to
    $6,000,000,000, and at universities at $15,000,000,000 to
    $25,000,000,000.
(4) Competitor nations, including the People's Republic of China
    and European Union member states, are investing aggressively in
    next-generation research infrastructure.
(5) Research infrastructure construction projects that compete for
    funding with research grants within agency operating budgets
    experience stop-start funding patterns that increase total
    costs and delay scientific capability.
(6) A dedicated capital account and mandatory maintenance funding
    would provide the stability necessary for efficient planning,
    construction, and stewardship of research infrastructure.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4**: The capital account is the core reform. By separating infrastructure construction from research operating budgets, agencies can plan multi-year projects without competing against grant programs. The no-rescission provision prevents accumulated funds from being clawed back, which is essential for projects that span multiple fiscal years.

- **Section 5**: The Coordinating Board fills the current governance gap. No existing entity has portfolio-wide visibility or cross-agency coordination authority. The Board is advisory but its reporting requirements create transparency and accountability.

- **Section 6**: Mandatory maintenance floors are modeled on best practices in facilities management. The 2-3% range is widely cited as the minimum necessary to prevent backlog growth. The escalating target forces agencies to ramp up gradually.

- **Section 7**: Project management reform addresses the cost overrun problem that erodes Congressional confidence. Independent cost estimates and earned value management are proven techniques used successfully by DOE's Office of Project Management.

- **Section 8**: The emergency appropriation addresses the immediate crisis while structural reforms take effect.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Cost (total authorization ~$9B/year plus emergency) | Phased implementation; economic competitiveness justification; ROI evidence |
| Congressional resistance to capital budgets | Capital accounts within existing agencies, not a new budget structure |
| Agency resistance to maintenance floors | Floors set at achievable levels; phased increase; reporting transparency |
| OMB opposition to multi-year authority | Precedent exists (military construction, highway trust fund) |
| Coordinating Board seen as redundant | Explicitly cross-agency mandate fills existing gap |

**Refinements**:

- **Phased version**: Begin capital accounts at DOE and NSF only; expand to other agencies after 3 years
- **Stronger version**: Make maintenance floors mandatory spending rather than discretionary targets
- **Fallback version**: Implement Coordinating Board and project management reforms without capital accounts

### Research Infrastructure Equity Act

**Purpose**: Address the historic underinvestment in research infrastructure at minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, and geographically underserved regions by creating dedicated funding programs and establishing regional research infrastructure hubs.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Research Infrastructure Equity Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving
    Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and other
    minority-serving institutions have received disproportionately
    less Federal research infrastructure investment relative to
    their enrollment and research potential.
(2) Researchers at institutions without major research
    infrastructure face significant barriers to conducting
    competitive research, including limited access to shared
    user facilities, insufficient laboratory space and
    equipment, and inadequate computing resources.
(3) Geographic concentration of research infrastructure limits
    the economic benefits of Federal research investment and
    excludes talented researchers based on location rather
    than merit.
(4) Distributed regional research infrastructure can complement
    centralized national facilities by providing local access
    to mid-scale capabilities and serving as training grounds
    for the next generation of researchers.
(5) Equitable access to research infrastructure is essential for
    developing a diverse scientific workforce that reflects the
    full talent of the Nation.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4**: The Development Grants program directly addresses the infrastructure deficit at MSIs and under-resourced institutions. The set-asides ensure that funds reach the institutions with the greatest need. The matching requirement is low (20%) and waivable, recognizing that these institutions have limited resources.

- **Section 5**: Regional Hubs distribute research capability geographically, creating mid-scale alternatives to the concentrated national facility model. The consortium governance model ensures broad institutional participation. The minimum equipment list guarantees meaningful capability at each hub.

- **Section 6**: The National Facility Access Program addresses the immediate access barriers that prevent researchers at under-resourced institutions from using existing national facilities. The 10% reserved allocation is a significant commitment but ensures that facility investment benefits a broader community.

- **Section 7**: The workforce provisions address both the pipeline for facility-critical disciplines and the deployment of technical expertise to institutions that need it. The Service Corps model is inspired by successful programs like the National Health Service Corps.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Cost ($5B+ total over 10 years) | Investment in human capital and institutional capacity; ROI through expanded research workforce |
| Resistance from R1 institutions | R1 institutions benefit from broader collaborator pool and reduced oversubscription at facilities |
| Sustainability of hubs after federal funding | Operations funding authorized indefinitely; user fees supplement; state matching encouraged |
| Set-aside constitutionality | Set-asides for MSIs have precedent in federal law (Higher Education Act); serve compelling interest |
| Defining "under-resourced" | Definition based on objective criteria (federal expenditure threshold, EPSCoR eligibility, MSI designation) |

**Refinements**:

- **Phased version**: Begin with 5 Regional Hubs and expand based on evaluation; implement Access Program immediately
- **Stronger version**: Increase set-asides; require 15% facility time reservation; add mandatory state matching
- **Fallback version**: Focus solely on the Access Program and Development Grants, deferring Regional Hubs

## Regulatory Framework

### DOE User Facility Access Regulations

**Existing Authority**: DOE operates user facilities under the authority of 42 U.S.C. ch. 84 and agency directives. The Secretary has broad authority to establish access policies.

**Draft Regulation**:

```text
PART 605—USER FACILITY ACCESS AND EQUITY

§ 605.1 Purpose.

This part establishes standards for equitable access to Department
of Energy user facilities, with particular emphasis on ensuring
access for researchers at under-resourced institutions.

§ 605.2 Definitions.

(a) "User facility" means any DOE-funded facility designated for
    use by external researchers on a merit-reviewed basis.
(b) "Under-resourced institution" has the meaning given in
    section 3(2) of the Research Infrastructure Equity Act.

§ 605.3 Access requirements.

(a) Each user facility shall reserve not less than 10 percent of
    available research time for researchers from under-resourced
    institutions.
(b) Proposals from under-resourced institution researchers shall
    be evaluated on scientific merit using the same criteria
    applied to all proposals, but the reserved allocation shall
    ensure that meritorious proposals from these institutions
    receive access.
(c) Each user facility shall provide a streamlined proposal
    process for first-time users.

§ 605.4 Remote access.

(a) Each user facility shall develop and maintain capabilities
    for remote participation in experiments, to the extent
    technically feasible.
(b) Not later than 3 years after the effective date of this part,
    each user facility shall publish a remote access plan and
    report annually on utilization.

§ 605.5 Reporting.

Each user facility shall report annually to the Office of Science
on the demographic and institutional distribution of its user
population, including the number and percentage of users from
under-resourced institutions.
```

**Explanation**: These regulations implement the equity provisions of the proposed legislation at the operational level. The 10% reservation and reporting requirements create accountability for broadening access.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1)**: Congress has broad authority to spend for the general welfare, which clearly encompasses research infrastructure investment. The capital account structure and trust fund mechanism are well within Congressional spending power.

**Commerce Clause**: Federal regulation of research infrastructure access policies at federally funded institutions is a valid exercise of Commerce Clause authority, as research activities have substantial effects on interstate commerce.

**Tenth Amendment**: The legislation does not mandate state action; it creates federal programs and conditions federal funding. States participate voluntarily.

### Preemption Questions

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| State procurement laws | Federal projects follow federal procurement; state projects follow state law |
| State environmental review | Federal projects subject to NEPA; state projects subject to state law |
| State labor laws | Davis-Bacon applies to federal construction; state laws apply to state-funded projects |
| University governance | Federal programs operate through grants and cooperative agreements; do not preempt institutional autonomy |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Provision | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Capital account restrictions | GAO audit; OMB oversight; Congressional reporting |
| Maintenance funding floors | Annual budget justification reporting; Coordinating Board oversight |
| User facility access reservations | DOE Office of Science oversight; annual reporting |
| MSI set-asides | NSF Inspector General audit; reporting to Congress |
| Project management standards | Coordinating Board review; red team process |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Regional Hub program evaluated after 5 years with Congressional report
- Coordinating Board reauthorized every 10 years
- Capital account authorization subject to periodic reauthorization
- Project management standards reviewed and updated every 5 years
- Access reservation percentages reviewed after 5 years based on participation data

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Research Infrastructure Modernization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Capital account manipulation | Agencies could reclassify operating expenses as "major renovation" to tap capital account funds | High |
| Maintenance floor gaming | Agencies could inflate replacement value estimates to make maintenance spending percentages appear adequate | Medium |
| Cost estimate shopping | Agencies could commission multiple independent cost estimates and use the lowest one | Medium |
| Coordinating Board capture | Industry representatives or specific lab interests could dominate the Board | Medium |
| Emergency reclassification | Agencies could defer maintenance until it qualifies as "emergency" capital construction | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Authorization without guaranteed appropriation | Capital accounts may be underfunded despite statutory authorization | Congressional appropriations process |
| No mandatory spending | All provisions remain discretionary and subject to annual politics | Political resistance to new mandatory programs |
| Limited private sector involvement | Does not address how to leverage private infrastructure or cloud computing | Scope limitation |
| No international facility provisions | Does not address U.S. contributions to international facilities | Complexity of international agreements |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Establish clear definitions of "construction," "major renovation," and "maintenance" with objective thresholds reviewed by OMB and GAO
2. Require independent validation of replacement value estimates by qualified facility assessment firms
3. Mandate that independent cost estimates be conducted by organizations selected from a pre-approved roster maintained by the Coordinating Board
4. Implement conflict-of-interest screening for Board members with regular rotation
5. Create an inspector general function within the Board to investigate potential abuse

### Research Infrastructure Equity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| MSI designation gaming | Institutions could manipulate enrollment to qualify for MSI set-asides | Low |
| Hub governance capture | One dominant institution could control a Regional Hub consortium despite multi-institution requirement | Medium |
| Reserved allocation underuse | If under-resourced institution proposals do not fill the 10% reservation, time could go unused | Medium |
| Grant spending diversion | Institutions could use infrastructure grants for non-infrastructure purposes | Medium |
| Sustainability failure | Hubs could become dependent on federal operations funding with no path to self-sufficiency | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Set-asides may not reach the neediest institutions | Larger MSIs may capture most funding | Competition within categories |
| Regional Hubs may duplicate existing infrastructure | Some regions already have adequate mid-scale facilities | Insufficient needs assessment |
| 10% facility reservation may be insufficient | Under-resourced institutions may need more than 10% | Conservative initial target |
| Workforce provisions may not attract enough candidates | Student loan forgiveness alone may not compete with private sector | Compensation gap |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Within MSI set-asides, establish sub-tiers prioritizing institutions with the least existing research infrastructure
2. Require Regional Hub proposals to include comprehensive gap analyses demonstrating that proposed capabilities do not duplicate existing regional assets
3. Review the 10% reservation level after 3 years and adjust based on demand data; authorize increase to 15% if warranted
4. Enhance workforce incentives to include housing assistance, relocation support, and guaranteed advancement pathways
5. Require Regional Hubs to develop sustainability plans that include user fee revenue, state matching, and industry partnerships

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Political vulnerability to future administrations | Embed key provisions in authorizing statute rather than executive action; build bipartisan support |
| Appropriations shortfall risk | Build constituency support; connect infrastructure investment to jobs and competitiveness |
| Interagency coordination failure | Give Coordinating Board meaningful authority including budget recommendation power |
| Data gaps for portfolio management | Fund comprehensive condition assessment as first Board action |
| Procurement delays | Use existing DOE and NSF contracting vehicles for hub construction; leverage cooperative agreements |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- All programs subject to GAO performance audits every 3 years
- Coordinating Board publishes biennial assessment with recommendations for legislative adjustment
- Regional Hub program subject to 5-year evaluation with continuation contingent on demonstrated impact
- Capital account authorization reviewed every 5 years with adjustment for inflation and portfolio changes
- Reserved facility allocations reviewed every 3 years with adjustment based on participation data
