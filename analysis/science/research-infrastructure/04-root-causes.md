# Research Infrastructure: Root Causes

## Overview

The deterioration of U.S. research infrastructure is not the result of a single policy failure but of multiple, reinforcing structural problems in how the nation plans, funds, builds, and maintains its research facilities. These root causes operate at the federal, institutional, and systemic levels.

## Structural Budget Problems

### The Authorization-Appropriation Gap

The most immediate cause of underfunding is the persistent gap between what Congress authorizes and what it actually appropriates. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorized $81 billion for NSF over five years, but annual appropriations have provided only a fraction of that amount.

| Fiscal Year | NSF Authorized (CHIPS) | NSF Appropriated | Gap |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----|
| FY 2023 | $15.6B | $9.9B | $5.7B (37%) |
| FY 2024 | $18.4B | $9.9B | $8.5B (46%) |

This pattern repeats across agencies. Authorization bills create expectations that appropriations bills do not fulfill, leaving planned infrastructure investments perpetually underfunded.

### Discretionary Budget Competition

Research infrastructure funding comes from the discretionary budget, which faces intense competition from defense, homeland security, veterans affairs, and other priorities. As mandatory spending (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on debt) consumes a growing share of the federal budget, discretionary spending is squeezed, and research infrastructure -- lacking a powerful domestic constituency -- is particularly vulnerable.

### Continuing Resolutions and Shutdowns

The federal government has operated under continuing resolutions (CRs) for significant portions of most recent fiscal years. CRs are devastating for research infrastructure because they:

- Prevent new project starts
- Hold spending at prior-year levels regardless of project needs
- Create uncertainty that delays procurement and hiring
- Force project managers to make conservative spending decisions that increase overall costs
- Sometimes last for the entire fiscal year, effectively canceling planned increases

### Capital vs. Operating Budget Confusion

The federal government does not distinguish between capital and operating budgets in the way that corporations and many state governments do. Research infrastructure construction competes directly with research grants, facility operations, and agency overhead within the same discretionary accounts. This creates an inherent tension between building new facilities and maintaining existing ones, or between investing in infrastructure and funding research.

## Institutional and Governance Failures

### Fragmented Responsibility

No single agency or office is responsible for the overall health of U.S. research infrastructure. Responsibility is distributed across:

- **DOE Office of Science**: Manages the largest portfolio of physical science facilities
- **NSF**: Funds university infrastructure and MREFC projects
- **NIH**: Supports biomedical research facilities through grants and intramural construction
- **NASA**: Builds and operates space-based research infrastructure
- **DOD**: Maintains defense research facilities
- **USDA**: Operates agricultural research stations
- **OSTP**: Provides coordination but has limited authority over agency budgets

This fragmentation means that no one has visibility into or accountability for the total research infrastructure portfolio. Gaps between agency jurisdictions go unaddressed, and duplication is difficult to identify and eliminate.

### Short Political Time Horizons

Research infrastructure projects typically require 10-15 years from conception through construction and commissioning. This timeline spans multiple presidential administrations and Congressional sessions, each of which may have different priorities. The resulting instability leads to:

- **Stop-start funding**: Projects receive inconsistent annual funding, stretching timelines and increasing total costs
- **Cost escalation**: Delays caused by funding instability drive cost growth, which then becomes a justification for further cuts
- **Planning paralysis**: Agencies hesitate to propose ambitious new facilities because they cannot guarantee sustained funding
- **Strategic incoherence**: Each administration may adjust priorities, leaving long-term infrastructure plans in limbo

### Inadequate Planning and Prioritization Processes

While some agencies have well-established processes for prioritizing infrastructure investments (DOE's Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee, the astronomy decadal survey), there is no government-wide process for:

- Assessing the overall state of the research infrastructure portfolio
- Prioritizing investments across agency boundaries
- Evaluating the lifecycle costs of proposed facilities
- Planning for facility decommissioning and replacement
- Coordinating with international partners on shared facilities

### Cost Estimation Failures

Large-scale research facilities frequently experience significant cost overruns:

| Project | Initial Estimate | Final Cost | Overrun |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| Superconducting Super Collider | $4.4B (1987) | Canceled at $2B spent (est. $12B) | 173% |
| National Ignition Facility | $1.1B (1997) | $3.5B | 218% |
| James Webb Space Telescope | $1B (1997) | $10B | 900% |
| Spallation Neutron Source | $1.3B (1996) | $1.4B | 8% |
| Vera C. Rubin Observatory | $473M (2014) | ~$473M | ~0% |

Cost overruns erode Congressional and public confidence in research infrastructure investments, making future projects harder to fund. While some projects (SNS, Rubin) have demonstrated that accurate cost estimation is possible with rigorous project management, the high-profile failures dominate political memory.

## Systemic Problems

### The Deferred Maintenance Doom Loop

Deferred maintenance creates a self-reinforcing cycle:

1. Operating budgets are insufficient to cover full maintenance costs
2. Maintenance is deferred to keep facilities operating in the short term
3. Deferred maintenance accumulates, requiring increasingly expensive repairs
4. The growing backlog makes full remediation appear unaffordable
5. Agencies request less than what is needed, knowing Congress will fund even less
6. The cycle continues until emergency repairs or premature decommissioning become necessary

The National Research Council has documented this pattern at DOE national laboratories, where the deferred maintenance backlog has grown to an estimated $4-6 billion. At universities, the backlog is estimated at $15-25 billion.

### Bias Toward New Construction Over Maintenance

Political incentives strongly favor building new facilities over maintaining existing ones:

- **Ribbon-cutting appeal**: New facilities generate positive media coverage and allow politicians to claim credit; maintenance does not
- **Constituency building**: New facilities create construction jobs and economic activity in specific districts; maintenance is invisible
- **Agency incentives**: New facilities expand agency missions and budgets; maintenance merely preserves the status quo
- **Researcher preferences**: Scientists prefer new, state-of-the-art facilities over upgraded existing ones

This bias means that the nation continually builds new facilities without adequately funding the long-term maintenance costs those facilities create.

### Geographic Concentration and the Equity Gap

Research infrastructure is heavily concentrated in a small number of states and metropolitan areas:

- The ten states with the most DOE national laboratory infrastructure receive the vast majority of facility funding
- Major research universities in a handful of states dominate NSF and NIH infrastructure grants
- Minority-serving institutions, institutions in rural areas, and institutions in states without national laboratories face systematic disadvantages in accessing research infrastructure

This concentration creates a feedback loop: institutions with existing infrastructure win more grants, which funds more infrastructure, which makes them more competitive for future grants. Institutions without infrastructure cannot compete and fall further behind.

### Workforce Pipeline Failure

Operating complex research facilities requires highly specialized technical staff. Several workforce factors contribute to infrastructure problems:

- **Retirement wave**: Many facility operators and engineers hired during the 1960s-1980s are retiring, taking irreplaceable institutional knowledge
- **Private sector competition**: Technology companies, semiconductor manufacturers, and defense contractors offer higher salaries for similar skills
- **Training gaps**: Few universities offer specialized training in accelerator science, cryogenics, telescope operations, or other facility-specific disciplines
- **Immigration barriers**: Restrictions on visas for foreign-born technical workers limit the talent pool

### Procurement and Construction Challenges

Federal procurement rules add cost and time to research infrastructure projects:

- **Buy American provisions**: Restrict sourcing of specialized components, sometimes from the only qualified international suppliers
- **Davis-Bacon wage requirements**: Increase construction costs (though they protect workers)
- **Environmental review requirements**: NEPA reviews add 1-3 years to project timelines
- **Contract structures**: Cost-plus contracts reduce contractor incentive to control costs
- **Change order culture**: Design changes during construction cascade through schedules and budgets

### Inadequate Data and Assessment

The federal government lacks comprehensive, current data on the state of research infrastructure:

- NSF's Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities has historically been conducted infrequently
- There is no real-time database of facility condition, utilization, or maintenance status
- Deferred maintenance estimates vary widely because there is no standardized assessment methodology
- Cost-benefit analyses of infrastructure investments are rarely conducted or published

## Why These Problems Persist

The root causes of research infrastructure decline are difficult to address because they are embedded in the structure of American governance:

| Root Cause | Structural Barrier to Reform |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Authorization-appropriation gap | Fundamental feature of Congressional budget process |
| Discretionary budget squeeze | Mandatory spending growth is legally automatic |
| Fragmented responsibility | Each agency defends its jurisdiction |
| Short political horizons | Electoral incentives favor short-term visible spending |
| New-over-maintenance bias | Rational behavior for individual politicians |
| Geographic concentration | States with existing infrastructure have political power to maintain it |
| Workforce challenges | Requires long-term investment in training with no immediate political payoff |

These structural barriers explain why the problem has persisted across administrations of both parties and despite widespread agreement among scientists, engineers, and policy experts that action is needed.
