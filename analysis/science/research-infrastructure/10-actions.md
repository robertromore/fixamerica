# Research Infrastructure: Actions

## Overview

Citizens, researchers, students, and organizations can all take concrete actions to support research infrastructure investment. This document outlines steps at different levels of engagement, from personal awareness to sustained advocacy.

## For All Citizens

### Learn and Share

- **Visit a national laboratory or user facility**: Many DOE labs, NSF observatories, and university facilities offer public tours and open houses. Seeing these facilities firsthand makes the abstract tangible.
- **Follow science policy news**: Subscribe to resources like *FYI: Science Policy News* (<https://www.aip.org/fyi>), the AAAS R&D Budget Program, and *Issues in Science and Technology* to stay informed about infrastructure debates.
- **Understand the local impact**: Research which federally funded facilities operate in your state or region, how many jobs they create, and what economic impact they generate. The DOE, NSF, and NASA publish state-level impact reports.
- **Share facility success stories**: When research facilities produce breakthroughs (new materials, medical discoveries, computing milestones), share these stories on social media and in conversations to build public awareness.

### Contact Elected Officials

- **Call or write your members of Congress**: Express support for research infrastructure investment, particularly during budget and appropriations season (typically February through September). Mention specific facilities or programs that matter to your state.
- **Ask specific questions**: Request your representative's position on the CHIPS and Science Act appropriations, DOE national laboratory budgets, and NSF MREFC funding. Specific questions generate more substantive responses than general statements.
- **Attend town halls**: When members of Congress hold town halls or listening sessions, raise research infrastructure as a topic. Frame it in terms of jobs, competitiveness, and national security -- not just science for its own sake.
- **Support candidates who support science**: Research candidates' positions on federal R&D investment and make this a factor in voting decisions.

### Support Advocacy Organizations

- **Join or donate to organizations** that advocate for research investment: Research!America, the Task Force on American Innovation, the Coalition for National Science Funding, or discipline-specific societies like the American Physical Society or American Astronomical Society.
- **Participate in advocacy days**: Many scientific societies organize Congressional visits days where members meet with legislators to discuss research priorities. These visits are effective because they connect real researchers with real decision-makers.

## For Researchers and Scientists

### Advocate Within Your Profession

- **Participate in decadal surveys and community planning**: Respond to calls for input from the National Academies, agency advisory committees, and professional societies. These processes directly shape infrastructure priorities.
- **Serve on facility advisory committees**: Volunteer for user advisory committees at DOE, NSF, and other agency facilities. These committees influence facility operations, upgrades, and access policies.
- **Testify before Congress**: If invited (or proactively offer through your institution's government relations office), provide expert testimony on infrastructure needs. Personal stories about how facility access (or lack thereof) affects research are particularly compelling.
- **Write policy briefs and op-eds**: Translate technical infrastructure needs into language that policymakers and the public can understand. Focus on outcomes and applications, not technical specifications.

### Strengthen Access and Equity

- **Mentor researchers from under-resourced institutions**: If you have experience at major facilities, offer to mentor first-time users, particularly those from HBCUs, HSIs, Tribal Colleges, and other MSIs.
- **Support remote access development**: Advocate within your facility for investment in telepresence, remote instrument control, and data streaming capabilities that broaden access.
- **Include students in facility visits**: When conducting research at user facilities, bring graduate and undergraduate students to expose them to national-scale infrastructure.
- **Document access barriers**: If you experience or observe barriers to facility access (geographic, financial, bureaucratic, cultural), report them to facility management and advocate for solutions.

### Support Good Project Management

- **Provide honest cost and schedule input**: When participating in facility planning, resist the temptation to underestimate costs to make projects look more fundable. Realistic estimates build credibility.
- **Report project concerns early**: If you observe cost, schedule, or technical problems with facility projects, raise them through appropriate channels rather than allowing problems to compound.
- **Participate in peer review**: Serve as a reviewer for facility proposals and user program applications. High-quality peer review ensures that limited infrastructure resources go to the most impactful projects.

## For University Administrators

### Prioritize Infrastructure Investment

- **Conduct comprehensive facility condition assessments**: Many universities lack current, detailed assessments of their research infrastructure. Completing these assessments is the first step toward making the case for investment.
- **Develop strategic infrastructure plans**: Create long-term (10-20 year) plans for laboratory renovation, core facility development, and equipment replacement. Align these plans with institutional research priorities.
- **Advocate for federal infrastructure programs**: Work with your institution's government relations office and higher education associations (AAU, APLU, ACE) to advocate for federal programs that support university infrastructure.
- **Invest institutional resources**: While federal support is essential, universities must also commit their own resources (endowment income, capital campaigns, indirect cost recovery) to infrastructure maintenance and renewal.

### Address Equity

- **Share facilities with under-resourced neighbors**: R1 universities can partner with nearby community colleges, PUIs, and MSIs to share access to core facilities, instrumentation, and computing resources.
- **Support regional research infrastructure hub proposals**: If an NSF Regional Hub program is created, participate as a lead or partner institution and ensure equitable access for all partner institutions.
- **Invest in MSI partnerships**: Create pipeline programs, joint user agreements, and shared positions that give MSI researchers meaningful access to research infrastructure.

## For Students

### Get Involved

- **Apply for user facility time**: Many facilities have programs specifically for students, including rapid-access proposals and educational allocations. Your advisor can help navigate the process, but you can also contact facility user offices directly.
- **Attend facility workshops and schools**: DOE labs and NSF facilities regularly offer training workshops and summer schools on experimental techniques. These build skills and networks.
- **Join science policy groups**: Organizations like the National Science Policy Network, student chapters of AAAS, and university science policy clubs provide training and advocacy opportunities.
- **Contact your representatives**: Student voices are powerful. Write letters, make phone calls, and attend town halls to advocate for research infrastructure. Explain how facility access affects your education and career.
- **Vote**: Support candidates who champion investment in science and infrastructure. Student turnout in elections directly affects the political calculus of research funding decisions.

## For Industry

### Support the Ecosystem

- **Advocate for public infrastructure investment**: Companies that benefit from publicly funded research facilities should actively support federal infrastructure budgets, not just passively benefit from them.
- **Partner on facility construction**: Provide in-kind contributions, technical expertise, or co-investment for facility projects that serve both public and private research needs.
- **Fund research at user facilities**: Support graduate students, postdocs, and collaborative research projects at national user facilities.
- **Hire and train facility staff**: Partner with national laboratories and universities on workforce development programs that prepare technical staff for facility operations.
- **Share proprietary facility capabilities**: Where feasible, make corporate research infrastructure (clean rooms, characterization tools, computing clusters) available to academic researchers on a cost-recovery basis.
