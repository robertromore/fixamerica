# Research Infrastructure: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes research infrastructure policy through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

Research infrastructure is an unusual policy area in that it generates less partisan heat than most topics in this project. Nearly all perspectives agree that the United States should maintain scientific capabilities; the disagreements center on *how much* to spend, *who* should pay, *where* to build, and *how* to govern. This creates genuine opportunities for cross-ideological coalition-building, though significant differences remain regarding the role of government, equity mandates, and the appropriate scale of investment.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Moderate alignment: genuine concern about fiscal responsibility, but willingness to fund defense-adjacent research infrastructure (national labs, HPC) contradicts blanket opposition to government spending |
| Principle consistency | Mixed: supports infrastructure investment when framed as national security or competitiveness, but opposes similar spending framed as equity or government expansion |
| Goalpost stability | Moderately stable: fiscal arguments are consistent, but the threshold for "acceptable" spending shifts based on political context |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: research infrastructure is not a high-salience partisan issue; genuine negotiation is possible |

**Justification:** Conservatives have genuine fiscal concerns about large-scale infrastructure spending, but their positions are inconsistent. Many conservative members of Congress enthusiastically support national laboratories and supercomputing centers in their districts while opposing similar investments elsewhere. The national security framing effectively bypasses fiscal objections for defense-relevant facilities, revealing that the opposition is selective rather than principled.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Republican support for DOE national laboratory budgets has been consistently strong in states like Tennessee (Oak Ridge), New Mexico (Sandia, Los Alamos), and Idaho (INL)
- The CHIPS and Science Act received significant Republican support when framed as China competition
- Conservative members have supported exascale computing investments as national security imperatives while opposing NSF budget increases
- Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute have published reports supporting targeted research infrastructure investment while opposing broader government expansion

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Agree that infrastructure is aging and faces competition, but skeptical of claimed crisis severity and uncomfortable with equity framing* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | *Agree on bureaucratic inefficiency and procurement problems, but reject structural funding arguments; blame agencies for poor management rather than insufficient funding* |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation, "Innovation and the Federal Role in Research" (2023)
- American Enterprise Institute, "Maintaining American Technological Leadership" (2024)
- Republican Study Committee budget proposals (various years)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Capital budget account | 5/10 | *Interesting reform but concerned about spending increase* | *Fear that capital accounts become a mechanism for more total spending* |
| Trust fund | 3/10 | *Oppose new revenue streams and mandatory spending* | *Genuine opposition to new taxes; concern about lock-in* |
| Maintenance floors | 6/10 | *Good management practice in principle* | *Prefer agency discretion over Congressional mandates* |
| Regional hubs | 4/10 | *Skeptical of distributed infrastructure model* | *Concern about pork-barrel politics; prefer concentrated investment* |
| MSI investment program | 3/10 | *Oppose set-asides and race-based allocation* | *Genuine philosophical objection to race-based programs; political opposition to equity framing* |
| Coordinating board | 5/10 | *Reasonable oversight if it reduces waste* | *Concern about adding another bureaucratic layer* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Infrastructure Modernization Act | 5/10 | *Support project management reform; skeptical of spending levels* | *Cost is primary concern; management reform provisions are genuinely appealing* |
| Research Infrastructure Equity Act | 3/10 | *Oppose race-based set-asides and regional distribution mandates* | *Philosophical opposition to equity mandates; prefer merit-only allocation* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Focus infrastructure investment on national security-relevant facilities (HPC, nuclear, materials)
- Increase private sector role through public-private partnerships and expanded proprietary user access
- Reform procurement and project management without increasing spending levels
- Leverage commercial cloud computing instead of building government supercomputers
- Eliminate race-based set-asides in favor of merit-only competition

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Centrist, Libertarian (on procurement reform), Populist (on competitiveness)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on national security framing and project management reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on equity mandates and spending levels)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment: genuine commitment to public investment in science and equity of access |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent: supports government investment in research infrastructure across administrations; occasionally prioritizes other spending over science |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: positions on research infrastructure have been consistent for decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: willing to work across party lines on science funding |

**Justification:** Liberals have been the most consistent advocates for federal research infrastructure investment. Their support spans both the scientific capability argument and the equity argument, and they have generally backed bipartisan science bills. The main inconsistency is that when budget choices must be made, science infrastructure sometimes loses to social programs, revealing that infrastructure is a priority but not the top priority.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic support for NSF and DOE budgets has been consistently strong
- Liberal members championed the CHIPS and Science Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
- Democratic platforms consistently call for increased science investment
- AAAS R&D budget analyses show that Democratic budget proposals consistently include higher science funding than Republican proposals

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement with analysis of aging infrastructure, deferred maintenance, and competitive challenges; particularly resonant on equity gaps* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | *Agree on structural funding problems, geographic concentration, and institutional inequality; may place less emphasis on procurement reform* |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress, "Investing in America's Scientific Future" (2024)
- Brookings Institution, "The Case for Federal Research Infrastructure" (2023)
- Democratic caucus science policy statements (various)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Capital budget account | 8/10 | *Strong support for separating infrastructure from operating budgets* | *Want to ensure it leads to net spending increase, not reshuffling* |
| Trust fund | 7/10 | *Support dedicated revenue for research* | *Sensitive to revenue source; prefer technology sector assessment* |
| Maintenance floors | 8/10 | *Essential for protecting existing investment* | *Want floors high enough to actually reduce backlog* |
| Regional hubs | 9/10 | *Enthusiastic support for democratizing research access* | *Want to ensure hubs serve diverse communities* |
| MSI investment program | 10/10 | *Full support for addressing historic underinvestment* | *May push for higher set-aside percentages* |
| Coordinating board | 7/10 | *Support better coordination and planning* | *Concerned about political appointees undermining scientific judgment* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Infrastructure Modernization Act | 8/10 | *Strong support; would push for higher authorization levels* | *Want mandatory spending rather than discretionary authorization* |
| Research Infrastructure Equity Act | 9/10 | *Enthusiastic support; core priority* | *Would push for higher set-aside percentages and stronger enforcement* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Convert research infrastructure funding to mandatory spending (like Medicare)
- Tie infrastructure investment to climate and clean energy goals
- Require community benefit agreements for major facility construction
- Expand equity provisions to include gender and disability access metrics
- Link infrastructure funding to open science and data sharing requirements

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Centrist
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on national security framing), Populist (on domestic manufacturing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on scale of government investment)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment: genuine commitment to equity, public investment, and challenging concentrated power |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent: supports public infrastructure investment as a matter of principle; applies equity lens uniformly |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: progressive positions on public investment have been consistent |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low on infrastructure investment; potentially higher if debate becomes about equity mandates |

**Justification:** Progressives view research infrastructure through the lens of public goods, equity, and challenging the concentration of resources at elite institutions. Their positions are principled and consistent. The main risk is that insistence on maximalist equity provisions could complicate coalition-building with moderates and conservatives, though this reflects genuine values rather than strategic positioning.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Progressive caucus members have consistently supported science funding increases
- Strong advocacy for MSI investment, EPSCoR expansion, and geographic equity
- Support for public ownership and open access to publicly funded infrastructure
- Congressional Progressive Caucus budget proposals include substantial research infrastructure investment

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement, particularly on equity gaps, geographic concentration, and the consequences of privatization trends* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | *Strong agreement on structural causes including budget politics, institutional inequality, and the bias toward elite institutions* |

**Source references:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus budget proposals (various years)
- Roosevelt Institute, "Public Investment and Scientific Progress" (2024)
- Union of Concerned Scientists, infrastructure equity reports

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Capital budget account | 7/10 | *Support if it leads to net increase; concerned about accounting gimmicks* | *Want to ensure capital accounts supplement rather than replace operating funding* |
| Trust fund | 8/10 | *Strong support; prefer progressive revenue source* | *Want technology sector or wealth-based funding mechanism* |
| Maintenance floors | 8/10 | *Support as protection against austerity* | *Want floors to be mandatory, not aspirational* |
| Regional hubs | 10/10 | *Core priority; see as transformative for equity* | *Want community governance and local hiring provisions* |
| MSI investment program | 10/10 | *Core priority; would strengthen provisions* | *Push for higher percentages, longer commitments, reparative framing* |
| Coordinating board | 6/10 | *Cautious support; concerned about industry capture* | *Want strong representation of MSIs and community voices on board* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Infrastructure Modernization Act | 7/10 | *Support framework; push for stronger provisions* | *Want mandatory spending, higher floors, stronger Board authority* |
| Research Infrastructure Equity Act | 9/10 | *Strong support with enhancements* | *Push for higher set-asides, community governance, labor standards* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Establish research infrastructure as a public utility with guaranteed access
- Require prevailing wage and project labor agreements for all construction
- Include community benefit and local hiring requirements
- Create a "reparative infrastructure" program specifically targeting historically excluded communities
- Mandate open access to all data and results from publicly funded facilities
- Require environmental justice assessments for facility siting

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist, Liberal
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on domestic jobs), Centrist (on practical reforms)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Libertarian, Religious Right

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment: genuine philosophical commitment to limited government and private sector primacy |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent: applies skepticism of government spending uniformly, including to defense-adjacent research |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: libertarian think tanks have consistently argued for reducing the federal role in research |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: libertarians engage substantively on policy design rather than opposing based on political dynamics |

**Justification:** Libertarians are the most philosophically consistent opponents of expanded government research infrastructure. Unlike conservatives, who selectively support defense-relevant facilities, libertarians apply their skepticism of government spending broadly. Their positions are principled and predictable, even when they are in the minority. Engagement is intellectually honest even when disagreement is fundamental.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute has consistently argued for reducing federal R&D spending and increasing private sector role
- Reason Foundation has proposed privatization of national laboratories
- Libertarian positions on research funding are consistent regardless of which party is in power
- Support for procurement reform and deregulation is genuine and aligns with broader libertarian agenda

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | *Agree that infrastructure has problems but attribute them to government inefficiency rather than underfunding; skeptical of crisis framing* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | *Disagree with analysis that the solution is more government spending; argue that the root cause is government involvement itself* |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute, "Federal R&D Spending" (various years)
- Reason Foundation, "Privatizing Government Services" (various)
- Mercatus Center research on government project management

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Capital budget account | 3/10 | *Accounting reform is fine but will increase total spending* | *Any new budget mechanism becomes a vehicle for spending growth* |
| Trust fund | 1/10 | *Oppose new taxes and mandatory spending* | *Fundamental opposition to dedicated revenue streams for government programs* |
| Maintenance floors | 4/10 | *Good management practice but should not be mandated by law* | *Prefer agency discretion and competitive pressure* |
| Regional hubs | 2/10 | *Government-built facilities are inefficient; use private sector* | *Prefer tax credits for private research infrastructure* |
| MSI investment program | 2/10 | *Oppose race-based allocation and government infrastructure building* | *Fundamental opposition to group-based preferences and government construction* |
| Coordinating board | 3/10 | *Another layer of bureaucracy* | *If it helps eliminate waste, acceptable; but likely to grow and empire-build* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Infrastructure Modernization Act | 3/10 | *Support project management reform; oppose spending increases* | *Would strip spending provisions and keep management reform only* |
| Research Infrastructure Equity Act | 2/10 | *Oppose government infrastructure building and set-asides* | *Would prefer tax credits and private sector approaches* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Privatize national laboratory management and reduce federal ownership
- Replace government supercomputing with commercial cloud computing contracts
- Provide R&D tax credits for private research infrastructure investment
- Eliminate procurement regulations that add cost to facility construction
- Allow universities to use indirect cost recovery more flexibly for infrastructure
- Replace government facility construction with voucher programs for facility access

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on fiscal restraint and procurement reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on efficiency and deregulation)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Liberal (on scale of government investment)

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment: genuine concern about enumerated powers and federal overreach |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent: applies federalism concerns to research infrastructure as to other policy areas |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: constitutional arguments do not shift based on political context |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: engages substantively on constitutional questions |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists raise legitimate questions about the federal role in research infrastructure. The Constitution does not explicitly authorize research facility construction, though the General Welfare Clause, Commerce Clause, and Necessary and Proper Clause provide ample legal basis. Constitutionalist positions are principled and consistent, though they sometimes serve as intellectual cover for fiscal conservatism.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Federalist Society scholarship on the scope of the Spending Clause
- Heritage Foundation legal analyses of federal science authority
- Consistent position that states should bear more responsibility for university infrastructure
- Support for national defense-related research infrastructure under the defense powers

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Accept factual claims about aging infrastructure but question whether federal responsibility extends to university facilities and regional hubs* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Argue that federal overreach is itself a root cause; states and universities should manage their own infrastructure* |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society, scholarship on Spending Clause and Commerce Clause limitations
- Heritage Foundation, "The Role of the Federal Government in Science" (various)
- Constitutional debates over NSF authorization and DOE organization

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Capital budget account | 5/10 | *Acceptable if limited to constitutionally authorized activities* | *Want to ensure it does not expand federal role beyond enumerated powers* |
| Trust fund | 3/10 | *Skeptical of new federal revenue mechanisms* | *Constitutional concern about earmarking revenue* |
| Maintenance floors | 5/10 | *Reasonable for federally owned facilities; not for university grants* | *Distinction between federal property and grants to non-federal entities* |
| Regional hubs | 3/10 | *Federal government should not build facilities for state institutions* | *States should fund their own research infrastructure* |
| MSI investment program | 3/10 | *Federal set-asides for specific institution types raise constitutional concerns* | *Equal protection questions about race-based allocations* |
| Coordinating board | 4/10 | *Acceptable advisory role; should not have binding authority* | *Separation of powers concerns if board influences appropriations* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Infrastructure Modernization Act | 5/10 | *Support for federally owned facilities; skeptical of broader scope* | *Want to narrow scope to DOE, NASA, and defense-relevant infrastructure* |
| Research Infrastructure Equity Act | 3/10 | *Federal grants to universities for facilities stretch constitutional authority* | *Prefer block grants to states for maximum federalism flexibility* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Limit federal infrastructure investment to facilities directly serving enumerated federal powers (defense, commerce regulation)
- Devolve university infrastructure funding to states through block grants
- Strengthen state EPSCoR-like programs rather than federal equity mandates
- Use interstate compacts for shared regional infrastructure rather than federal construction
- Narrow the Coordinating Board to an advisory role with no policy authority

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Libertarian
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on local control), Centrist (on practical federalism)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Liberal

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Moderate alignment: genuine concern about jobs and competitiveness, but positions shift based on geographic and partisan dynamics |
| Principle consistency | Mixed: supports infrastructure spending that creates domestic jobs; inconsistent on whether to expand or cut government |
| Goalpost stability | Moderately unstable: positions on research spending shift based on which party is proposing it and where facilities are located |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate: tendency to frame research infrastructure as elite vs. working-class |

**Justification:** Populists have genuinely mixed views on research infrastructure. They support domestic manufacturing, jobs, and competitiveness but are suspicious of elite institutions, international collaboration, and spending that primarily benefits scientists at wealthy universities. The "China competition" framing resonates strongly, but specific spending proposals are evaluated through a "who benefits" lens that can shift based on political dynamics.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan support for CHIPS and Science Act when framed as anti-China competition
- Skepticism of NSF and university-focused spending from populist-aligned members
- Strong support for national laboratory jobs and facilities in home states
- Ambivalence about international scientific collaboration and foreign researcher access

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | *Agree on competition from China and infrastructure aging; skeptical of equity framing; want focus on jobs and domestic capability* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | *Agree on bureaucratic dysfunction; add "elite capture" and international dependencies as root causes not fully addressed in analysis* |

**Source references:**

- Congressional statements during CHIPS and Science Act debate
- Populist-aligned media coverage of national laboratory funding
- Marco Rubio, "American Industrial Policy and the Rise of China" (various)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Capital budget account | 6/10 | *Support if it means more domestic construction jobs* | *Want Buy American provisions strengthened* |
| Trust fund | 5/10 | *Support if revenue comes from tech companies, not workers* | *Want technology sector to pay, not broad-based taxes* |
| Maintenance floors | 6/10 | *Support maintaining domestic facilities and jobs* | *Want to ensure maintenance work goes to American workers* |
| Regional hubs | 7/10 | *Support bringing infrastructure to underserved communities* | *Want hubs in working-class areas, not just near universities* |
| MSI investment program | 5/10 | *Mixed: support investment in underserved communities but suspicious of racial set-asides* | *Prefer economic need criteria over race-based allocation* |
| Coordinating board | 4/10 | *Suspicious of elite technocratic boards* | *Want working-class and community representation* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Infrastructure Modernization Act | 6/10 | *Support domestic construction and maintenance; want stronger Buy American* | *Would add prevailing wage, domestic sourcing, and anti-outsourcing provisions* |
| Research Infrastructure Equity Act | 5/10 | *Support for under-resourced communities; mixed on racial set-asides* | *Would reframe around economic disadvantage rather than race* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Mandate that all facility construction use domestic materials and labor
- Restrict facility access for researchers from competitor nations (China, Russia)
- Prioritize facilities that directly support domestic manufacturing and industrial competitiveness
- Replace race-based set-asides with economic need-based allocation
- Require community impact assessments showing job creation for local workers
- Add anti-outsourcing provisions for facility operations and maintenance

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on competitiveness and Buy American), Progressive (on domestic jobs)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on investment scale), Centrist (on practical compromise)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on government role), Constitutionalist (on federal authority)

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment: genuine commitment to evidence-based policy, bipartisan compromise, and practical outcomes |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent: applies cost-benefit analysis and pragmatic evaluation to research infrastructure as to other issues |
| Goalpost stability | Very stable: centrist positions on research investment have been remarkably consistent over decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low: actively seeks compromise and coalition-building |

**Justification:** Centrists are the most reliable coalition partners on research infrastructure because their support is based on evidence and pragmatism rather than ideology. They have consistently supported bipartisan science funding bills and are willing to compromise on both spending levels and equity provisions. Their consistency makes them predictable and trustworthy negotiating partners.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center reports consistently supporting research infrastructure investment
- Centrist members of Congress were key votes for the CHIPS and Science Act, America COMPETES Act, and ARRA research provisions
- Problem Solvers Caucus has engaged substantively on science policy
- Centrist think tanks (Brookings, Third Way) produce detailed, evidence-based research infrastructure proposals

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | *Strong agreement with factual analysis; appreciate evidence-based approach; may want more cost-benefit data* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | *Agree on most structural causes; may place more emphasis on management reform and less on equity framing* |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center, "Federal Research Infrastructure: Challenges and Opportunities" (2024)
- Brookings Institution, "The Case for Federal Research Infrastructure" (2023)
- Third Way, "Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda" (2025)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Capital budget account | 8/10 | *Strong support as good governance reform* | *Want rigorous implementation to prevent abuse* |
| Trust fund | 6/10 | *Interesting but politically difficult; prefer appropriations reform* | *Pragmatic concern about feasibility rather than principled opposition* |
| Maintenance floors | 8/10 | *Essential for responsible stewardship* | *Want realistic, evidence-based floor percentages* |
| Regional hubs | 7/10 | *Support with strong evaluation metrics* | *Want clear performance criteria and willingness to close underperforming hubs* |
| MSI investment program | 7/10 | *Support with modifications* | *Prefer need-based rather than race-based criteria, with race as one factor* |
| Coordinating board | 8/10 | *Strong support for better coordination and data* | *Want genuinely independent board, not political appointments* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Infrastructure Modernization Act | 8/10 | *Strong support; core of bipartisan approach* | *Would seek to calibrate spending levels to gain conservative support* |
| Research Infrastructure Equity Act | 7/10 | *Support with pragmatic modifications* | *Would adjust set-aside structure to be more need-based for broader coalition* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Phase in capital accounts at DOE and NSF first; expand based on demonstrated success
- Use competitive merit review for MSI infrastructure grants rather than rigid set-asides
- Include sunset provisions and mandatory evaluation for all new programs
- Tie Regional Hub locations to demonstrable gaps in existing infrastructure
- Create bipartisan oversight commission rather than executive-branch Coordinating Board
- Pursue incremental reforms that can pass with bipartisan support

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Conservative (on management reform)
- **Potential bridges:** All perspectives (centrists are the natural bridge-builders)
- **Unlikely partners:** None (centrists can work with all perspectives on some provisions)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Moderate alignment: generally follows conservative fiscal positions on science spending; specific research infrastructure is not a salient issue |
| Principle consistency | Mixed: no strong principled position on research infrastructure specifically; positions follow broader conservative coalition |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate: positions stable because they are derivative of conservative movement positions |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low on infrastructure specifically; higher if debates touch religious university inclusion |

**Justification:** The Religious Right does not have strong independent positions on research infrastructure. Their engagement is largely derivative of the broader conservative movement, with specific interest in ensuring that faith-based institutions are eligible for federal infrastructure programs and that facilities do not conduct research they consider morally objectionable (embryonic stem cell research, certain biological research). Engagement is relatively consistent because positions are inherited rather than independently developed.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Religious right organizations rarely take positions on research infrastructure bills
- When they engage, it is typically to ensure faith-based institution eligibility or to oppose specific research areas
- Council for Christian Colleges & Universities has advocated for equitable access to federal science programs
- Family Research Council has not published significant policy on research infrastructure

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Generally accept factual claims; not deeply engaged with infrastructure data; concern about which institutions and research types benefit* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Follow conservative analysis on fiscal and management issues; add concern about secular bias in facility allocation* |

**Source references:**

- Council for Christian Colleges & Universities policy positions
- Family Research Council, general federal spending positions
- Religious right alignment with Heritage Foundation fiscal positions

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Capital budget account | 5/10 | *Follow conservative position; no strong independent view* | *Concern about total spending level* |
| Trust fund | 3/10 | *Follow conservative opposition to new revenue* | *No specific objection beyond general fiscal conservatism* |
| Maintenance floors | 5/10 | *Reasonable stewardship* | *Support responsible management of existing resources* |
| Regional hubs | 5/10 | *Neutral; want faith-based institutions included* | *Want to ensure religious colleges are eligible consortium partners* |
| MSI investment program | 4/10 | *Mixed: support faith-based institution access; skeptical of racial set-asides* | *Want faith-based colleges explicitly eligible; oppose race-based allocation* |
| Coordinating board | 4/10 | *Neutral; follow conservative position* | *Want to ensure board does not discriminate against faith-based research institutions* |

|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Infrastructure Modernization Act | 5/10 | *Moderate support following conservative coalition* | *Would seek amendments ensuring faith-based institution eligibility* |
| Research Infrastructure Equity Act | 4/10 | *Support for under-resourced institutions if faith-based schools included* | *Want explicit inclusion of religious colleges; concerned about secular bias in allocation* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Ensure faith-based colleges and universities are explicitly eligible for all infrastructure programs
- Include conscience protections for facilities that decline to support certain types of research
- Add religious institutions to the definition of under-resourced institutions where applicable
- Require Coordinating Board to include representation from faith-based academic institutions

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Constitutionalist
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on practical infrastructure investment), Populist (on community values)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (on equity mandates), Democratic Socialist (on public ownership)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment: genuine commitment to public ownership, democratic control, and equitable access to scientific resources |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent: applies public goods and equity principles to research infrastructure as to other policy areas |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: positions on public investment and equity have been consistent |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low on infrastructure; moderate on debates about private sector role and elite institution privilege |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists view research infrastructure as a quintessential public good that should be publicly owned, democratically governed, and universally accessible. Their positions are principled and consistent, driven by a coherent ideology of public investment and equity. The main risk is that maximalist demands for public ownership and worker governance may complicate pragmatic coalition-building.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bernie Sanders and progressive caucus members have consistently supported increased science funding
- Democratic Socialists of America policy platforms emphasize public investment in science and education
- Support for open science, public ownership, and equitable access is consistent with broader DSA positions
- Advocacy for prevailing wages and labor protections at research facilities aligns with broader labor platform

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strong agreement on infrastructure decline, equity gaps, and competitive challenges; would emphasize privatization and corporate capture as additional problems* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | *Strong agreement on structural causes; add neoliberal austerity and corporate influence as root causes* |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Capital budget account | 7/10 | *Support but insufficient without massive funding increase* | *Want spending levels much higher than proposed* |
| Trust fund | 9/10 | *Strong support; want progressive revenue source* | *Prefer wealth tax or financial transaction tax as funding mechanism* |
| Maintenance floors | 8/10 | *Essential; would set floors higher* | *4% minimum more appropriate than 2%* |
| Regional hubs | 10/10 | *Core priority; would expand scope and democratic governance* | *Want community governance boards with worker and public representation* |
| MSI investment program | 10/10 | *Core priority; would expand and strengthen* | *Push for reparative framing and higher funding levels* |
| Coordinating board | 6/10 | *Support public oversight; concerned about corporate representation* | *Want board to include workers, community members, and MSI representatives; exclude industry* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Research Infrastructure Modernization Act | 7/10 | *Support framework; would dramatically increase funding levels* | *Authorization levels too low; want mandatory spending and progressive funding* |
| Research Infrastructure Equity Act | 9/10 | *Strong support; would strengthen and expand* | *Would increase set-asides, add labor provisions, require public ownership* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Fund research infrastructure through a financial transaction tax or wealth tax
- Require all publicly funded facilities to be fully open access with no proprietary use
- Mandate worker governance at all federal facilities with employee representation on management boards
- Establish a national research infrastructure public utility with guaranteed universal access
- Eliminate corporate membership on advisory boards; replace with community and worker representatives
- Require project labor agreements and prevailing wages for all facility construction and operations
- Triple the proposed funding levels for MSI investment and Regional Hubs

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Liberal
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on domestic jobs and anti-corporate provisions)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Libertarian, Religious Right, Constitutionalist

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Capital budget account | Con, Lib, Prog, Const, Pop, Cent, RelR, DemSoc | Libt | None |
| Maintenance floors | Con, Lib, Prog, Const, Pop, Cent, RelR, DemSoc | Libt | None |
| Project management reform | Con, Lib, Prog, Libt, Const, Pop, Cent, RelR, DemSoc | None | None |
| Regional hubs | Lib, Prog, Pop, Cent, RelR, DemSoc | Con | Libt, Const |
| MSI investment | Lib, Prog, Pop, Cent, DemSoc | Con, RelR | Libt, Const |
| Trust fund | Lib, Prog, Pop, Cent, DemSoc | Con, Const, RelR | Libt |
| Coordinating board | Con, Lib, Prog, Cent, DemSoc | Libt, Const, Pop, RelR | None |

**Key insight:** Project management reform and maintenance floors have near-universal support and represent the strongest foundation for bipartisan legislation. The capital budget account also has broad support. MSI investment and the trust fund are more divisive but can be advanced through separate legislative vehicles.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Research Infrastructure Stewardship and Competitiveness Act*

**Bridges:** *Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist + Religious Right*

**Core Agreement:** All five perspectives agree that (a) existing research infrastructure should be properly maintained, (b) project management should be improved, and (c) the U.S. must remain competitive with China. This provides sufficient common ground for a significant bipartisan bill.

**Policy Description:**

A bill combining the capital budget account, mandatory maintenance floors, project management reform, and the Coordinating Board from the Modernization Act -- but without the trust fund, without equity set-asides, and with authorization levels calibrated to attract conservative support. Includes strengthened Buy American provisions and explicit faith-based institution eligibility.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | *Focuses on management reform and competitiveness; no new taxes; reasonable spending levels* |
| Liberal | *Establishes capital accounts and maintenance floors -- structural reforms with lasting impact* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based, bipartisan, incremental approach with evaluation requirements* |
| Populist | *Buy American provisions; domestic jobs; competitiveness framing* |
| Religious Right | *Faith-based institution eligibility; no race-based set-asides* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | *Accept increased infrastructure spending levels* |
| Liberal | *Defer equity provisions and trust fund to separate legislation* |
| Centrist | *Accept lower spending than economically optimal to build coalition* |
| Populist | *Accept some international collaboration provisions* |
| Religious Right | *Accept expanded federal role in infrastructure* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Centrist + 3 at mixed)
- **Durability:** *Moderate-high. Management reform and maintenance floors are policy mechanics that do not generate ongoing partisan conflict. Capital accounts, once established, create constituencies for their continuation.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Introduced as bipartisan bill in Senate Commerce or Energy Committee; marked up through regular order; attached to annual DOE/NSF authorization or appropriations vehicle if necessary.*

---

### Compromise 2: *Research Infrastructure Access and Opportunity Act*

**Bridges:** *Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Populist + Democratic Socialist*

**Core Agreement:** All five perspectives agree that research infrastructure should be accessible to a broader range of institutions and communities, and that geographic concentration perpetuates inequality. Disagreements center on the mechanism (race-based set-asides vs. economic need criteria) rather than the goal.

**Policy Description:**

A bill combining the Regional Hub program and the National Facility Access Program from the Equity Act, with allocation criteria based on institutional research expenditure levels and geographic underservice rather than racial classification. Includes workforce development provisions with prevailing wage and local hiring requirements.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | *Broadens access; invests in under-resourced institutions; addresses geographic inequality* |
| Progressive | *Regional hubs with community engagement; labor standards; equity of access* |
| Centrist | *Need-based criteria; performance evaluation; practical design* |
| Populist | *Jobs in underserved communities; domestic workforce; no elite-only benefits* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Public facilities; democratic governance; worker protections* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | *Accept need-based rather than race-based allocation criteria* |
| Progressive | *Accept less than full public utility model; no explicit reparative framing* |
| Centrist | *Accept higher spending than preferred; prevailing wage requirements* |
| Populist | *Accept some international researcher access at hubs* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Accept private sector participation in hub governance; lower funding than preferred* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *High. Need-based infrastructure investment is politically durable because it creates tangible local benefits. Once hubs are built and operating, they create constituencies for continued funding.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Introduced as separate equity-focused legislation; pursued through NSF authorization or standalone bill. Could be combined with Compromise 1 in a comprehensive package.*

### Compromise 3: *National Research Computing Modernization Act*

**Bridges:** *Conservative + Liberal + Progressive + Populist + Centrist + Democratic Socialist*

**Core Agreement:** Computing infrastructure has the broadest cross-ideological appeal because it connects to national security (Conservative), scientific progress (Liberal, Progressive), domestic technology competitiveness (Populist), practical problem-solving (Centrist), and public capability (Democratic Socialist). Even Libertarians and Constitutionalists are more supportive of computing investment because it can leverage commercial partnerships.

**Policy Description:**

A focused bill authorizing next-generation supercomputing procurement, expanding computing access programs, investing in data infrastructure, and creating computing workforce training programs. Includes provisions for leveraging commercial cloud computing partnerships alongside government-owned systems.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | *National security applications; China competition; leverages private sector* |
| Liberal | *Expands computing access; supports scientific progress across fields* |
| Progressive | *Invests in public computing capability; broadens access* |
| Populist | *Domestic technology jobs; competitiveness with China* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based; bipartisan; clearly defined scope* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Public computing infrastructure as public good* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | *Accept significant federal spending on computing infrastructure* |
| Liberal | *Accept commercial cloud partnerships alongside government systems* |
| Progressive | *Accept less comprehensive equity provisions* |
| Populist | *Accept international collaboration on standards* |
| Centrist | *Accept funding levels higher than minimum needed* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Accept private sector role in delivering computing services* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *Very high. Computing capability is a politically uncontroversial investment with clear national security, economic, and scientific benefits. Both parties have supported HPC investment historically.*
- **Implementation Path:** *Introduced as DOE and NSF authorization; strong bipartisan prospects. Could be included in defense authorization as alternative pathway.*

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable near-term coalition is the Conservative-Liberal-Centrist-Populist alignment on project management reform, maintenance floors, and the capital budget account (Compromise 1). This coalition benefits from:

- Broad political spectrum coverage
- Focus on management and governance rather than ideology
- National security and competitiveness framing that resonates across perspectives
- Concrete, measurable outcomes that build confidence for future investment

### Key Obstacles

- **Appropriations vs. authorization gap**: Even if legislation passes, actual funding depends on annual appropriations decisions
- **Equity vs. merit debate**: The sharpest ideological divide is between perspectives that prioritize equity-based allocation and those that insist on merit-only criteria
- **Scale of investment**: Progressives and Democratic Socialists want dramatically more spending than conservatives will accept; centrists must calibrate compromise amounts
- **Private vs. public role**: Libertarians and some conservatives prefer private sector approaches; progressives and democratic socialists prefer public ownership

### Low Consistency Partners

Conservative and Populist perspectives (both rated 3/5) are the least predictable coalition partners. For infrastructure policy:

- Conservatives can be engaged through national security framing and project management reform; avoid equity and spending-increase framing
- Populists can be engaged through domestic jobs, Buy American provisions, and competitiveness arguments; avoid elite institution and international collaboration framing
- Both perspectives' positions may shift based on which party controls the White House, requiring ongoing relationship maintenance

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with management reform**: Project management, maintenance floors, and the capital budget account have the broadest support. Pass these first to build credibility and infrastructure.
2. **Pursue computing separately**: National research computing has the broadest coalition and can be passed through defense or competitiveness vehicles.
3. **Build equity coalition incrementally**: Start with the National Facility Access Program (broadening access to existing facilities), which is less controversial than Regional Hubs or MSI set-asides. Demonstrate results, then expand.
4. **Use national security framing strategically**: Frame infrastructure investment as a China competition response to bring conservatives and populists on board for higher spending levels.
5. **Engage centrists as brokers**: Centrists are the most consistent and the natural bridge between left and right on this issue. Give them ownership of compromise design.
