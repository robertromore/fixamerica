# Research Infrastructure: History

## Overview

The history of American research infrastructure is a story of transformative public investment driven by national crises -- World War II and the Cold War -- followed by decades of uneven commitment. Understanding this history is essential for recognizing that the current infrastructure landscape is the product of deliberate policy choices, not inevitable forces.

## Pre-World War II Era (Before 1940)

### Early Research Facilities

Before World War II, research infrastructure in the United States was overwhelmingly private and university-based. The federal government played a minimal role:

- **University laboratories**: Institutions like MIT, Caltech, the University of Chicago, and Johns Hopkins built research laboratories with private endowments and philanthropic gifts
- **Private observatories**: The Yerkes, Lick, and Mount Wilson observatories were funded by private benefactors
- **Industrial research labs**: Bell Labs (1925), General Electric Research Laboratory (1900), and DuPont Experimental Station (1903) represented corporate investment in basic research
- **Federal role**: Limited to the Bureau of Standards (1901), agricultural experiment stations under the Hatch Act (1887), and military arsenals

### Key Pre-War Infrastructure

| Facility | Year | Funder | Significance |
|----------|------|--------|--------------|
| Mount Wilson Observatory | 1904 | Carnegie Institution | 100-inch telescope enabled Hubble's discoveries |
| Radiation Laboratory (Berkeley) | 1931 | University of California | First cyclotron; birthplace of nuclear science |
| Palomar Observatory | 1928-1948 | Rockefeller Foundation | 200-inch telescope dominated astronomy for decades |
| MIT Radiation Laboratory | 1940 | Federal (OSRD) | Radar development; prototype for federal lab model |

The concentration of research infrastructure at elite institutions established a pattern of geographic and institutional inequality that persists today.

## World War II and the Birth of Federal Infrastructure (1940-1950)

### Wartime Mobilization

World War II fundamentally transformed the relationship between the federal government and research infrastructure:

- **Manhattan Project**: The largest research infrastructure project in history at that time, creating entire cities (Oak Ridge, Hanford, Los Alamos) and facilities for uranium enrichment, plutonium production, and weapons design at a cost exceeding $2 billion ($30 billion in 2024 dollars)
- **Radiation Laboratory at MIT**: Developed radar technology; employed 4,000 people at peak
- **Applied Physics Laboratory (Johns Hopkins)**: Developed the proximity fuze and other ordnance
- **War Production Board facilities**: Government-funded laboratories and testing facilities across multiple universities

### The Bush Report and Postwar Vision

Vannevar Bush's 1945 report *Science -- The Endless Frontier* argued that the federal government had a permanent responsibility to support basic research, including the infrastructure required to conduct it. Key recommendations:

- Federal funding for university research facilities
- Creation of a national research foundation
- Government-owned national laboratories as shared resources
- Long-term investment in scientific infrastructure as a national asset

### National Laboratory System Created

The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 transferred wartime facilities to civilian control and established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which inherited and expanded the national laboratory system:

| Laboratory | Origin | Established |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Los Alamos National Laboratory | Manhattan Project Site Y | 1943 |
| Oak Ridge National Laboratory | Manhattan Project X-10 | 1943 |
| Argonne National Laboratory | Manhattan Project Metallurgical Lab | 1946 |
| Brookhaven National Laboratory | New postwar laboratory | 1947 |
| Sandia National Laboratories | Manhattan Project Z Division | 1949 |
| Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | New weapons laboratory | 1952 |
| Idaho National Laboratory | Nuclear reactor testing station | 1949 |

---

## The Cold War Golden Age (1950-1970)

### Sputnik and the Space Race

The Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 triggered a massive expansion of U.S. research infrastructure:

- **National Defense Education Act (1958)**: Funded university science facilities and equipment
- **NASA created (1958)**: Built research centers, launch facilities, tracking stations, and space telescopes
- **NSF budget expansion**: From $3.5 million (1952) to $500 million (1968), including significant infrastructure investment
- **AEC facility expansion**: New accelerators, reactors, and research facilities at national laboratories

### Major Facility Construction

This era saw the construction of many facilities that remain in operation today:

| Facility | Year | Cost (original) | Significance |
|----------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) | 1962-1966 | $114M | 2-mile linear accelerator; 3 Nobel Prizes |
| Fermilab | 1967-1972 | $250M | World's highest-energy accelerator for decades |
| Kitt Peak National Observatory | 1958-1973 | Various | First national optical observatory |
| National Radio Astronomy Observatory (Green Bank, VLA) | 1956- | Various | Radio astronomy facilities |
| High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) | 1961-1966 | $32M | Neutron source still operating today |
| NCAR Mesa Laboratory | 1961-1967 | $4.5M | Atmospheric research center |

### University Infrastructure Boom

Federal agencies funded substantial university infrastructure during this period:

- NIH construction grants built research buildings at medical schools nationwide
- NSF Institutional Development Program supported facilities at developing universities
- AEC funded university reactor programs
- DOD funded laboratories at universities conducting defense research
- The Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 provided construction grants for university buildings

### Research Vessel Fleet Expansion

The U.S. academic research fleet expanded significantly during the Cold War, driven by naval interest in oceanography:

- Office of Naval Research funded construction of research vessels
- Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and other institutions received new ships
- UNOLS established in 1971 to coordinate fleet operations

---

## Retrenchment and Transition (1970-1990)

### Budget Pressures

The end of the Apollo program, the Vietnam War, and economic stagflation led to declining research infrastructure investment:

- **Nixon administration**: Reduced federal R&D spending; terminated several major projects
- **Mansfield Amendment (1969)**: Required DOD research to have direct military relevance, reducing university infrastructure funding
- **Energy crises**: Redirected some research infrastructure toward energy topics but overall investment declined
- **Inflation**: Eroded the purchasing power of maintenance budgets, seeding the deferred maintenance crisis

### DOE Created (1977)

The Department of Energy was established by consolidating the AEC's successors (ERDA), the Federal Energy Administration, and other agencies. DOE inherited the national laboratory system and its research infrastructure portfolio.

### Superconducting Super Collider

The rise and fall of the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) illustrates the political dynamics of large-scale research infrastructure:

- **1987**: SSC approved by Reagan administration; 54-mile circumference proton collider in Texas
- **1989-1993**: Construction began; cost estimates escalated from $4.4 billion to $12 billion
- **1993**: Congress canceled the SSC after spending $2 billion; cited cost overruns and management problems
- **Consequence**: The U.S. ceded leadership in high-energy physics to CERN and the Large Hadron Collider

The SSC cancellation remains a cautionary tale about cost escalation, political vulnerability, and the consequences of losing public support for large-scale research infrastructure.

### Deferred Maintenance Begins to Accumulate

During this period, the practice of deferring maintenance on existing facilities became entrenched:

- Operating budgets prioritized research over maintenance
- Capital renewal was consistently underfunded
- Facilities built in the 1950s-1960s began requiring major renovations
- The National Research Council warned in 1988 that deferred maintenance at federal laboratories was approaching a crisis

## Selective Investment and Growing Gaps (1990-2008)

### New Facilities amid Overall Stagnation

Federal investment in research infrastructure during this period was characterized by selective construction of new flagship facilities while allowing the broader portfolio to deteriorate:

**Major projects completed or initiated:**

| Facility | Timeline | Cost | Significance |
|----------|----------|------|--------------|
| Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) | 1996-2006 | $1.4B | World's most powerful pulsed neutron source |
| National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) | 2005-2014 | $912M | Replaced NSLS at Brookhaven |
| Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA, U.S. share) | 1997-2013 | ~$500M | International radio telescope in Chile |
| Gemini Observatory | 1991-2000 | $184M | International optical telescopes |
| Chandra X-ray Observatory | Launched 1999 | $1.65B | Space-based X-ray telescope |

### Computing Revolution

High-performance computing underwent a transformation:

- **ASCI program (1995)**: DOE launched the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative to replace nuclear testing with simulation; drove development of terascale and then petascale computers
- **NSF supercomputing centers**: TeraGrid (2001) and later XSEDE (2011) provided shared computing infrastructure
- **Japan's Earth Simulator (2002)**: Briefly held the world's fastest supercomputer title, alarming U.S. policymakers
- **Roadrunner at Los Alamos (2008)**: First petascale system; demonstrated U.S. leadership could be maintained with investment

### University Infrastructure Crisis Recognized

Multiple reports documented the growing crisis in university research infrastructure:

- National Research Council, *Allocating Federal Funds for Science and Technology* (1995)
- Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable warnings about deferred maintenance
- NSF Academic Research Infrastructure program created (1991) but chronically underfunded
- Congressional earmarks for university buildings became a common (and controversial) mechanism

## The ARRA Era and Sequestration (2009-2016)

### American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009)

The 2009 stimulus bill provided a one-time surge in research infrastructure funding:

- **DOE Office of Science**: $1.6 billion, including accelerated facility construction
- **NSF**: $400 million for Major Research Instrumentation and facilities
- **NIH**: $1 billion for extramural construction and instrumentation, $500 million for buildings and facilities
- **NIST**: $600 million for construction and equipment

ARRA demonstrated the impact of concentrated infrastructure investment but also revealed the fragility of relying on emergency spending rather than sustained investment.

### Sequestration (2013)

The Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent sequestration imposed across-the-board cuts that severely impacted research infrastructure:

- Facility operations budgets reduced, forcing shortened operating schedules
- Construction projects delayed or stretched out
- Maintenance backlogs grew
- User facility access time reduced, turning away meritorious researchers
- NSF MREFC projects slowed

### Facility Closures and Near-Closures

Budget pressure forced difficult decisions about aging facilities:

- **Tevatron at Fermilab**: Shut down in 2011 after 28 years; U.S. no longer had a high-energy collider
- **Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)**: Faced potential closure; funding restructured
- **Green Bank Observatory**: NSF proposed divestment; saved by Congressional intervention
- **Arecibo Observatory**: NSF reduced funding; catastrophic structural failure destroyed telescope in 2020

## Recent Developments (2017-Present)

### Exascale Computing Initiative

The DOE Exascale Computing Project, initiated in 2016 with an estimated $1.8 billion budget, delivered on its goal of producing exascale supercomputers:

- **Frontier** at Oak Ridge (2022): First system to exceed one exaflop; world's most powerful computer
- **Aurora** at Argonne (2024): Second exascale system, using Intel architecture
- **El Capitan** at Lawrence Livermore (2024): Third exascale system, focused on nuclear security

### CHIPS and Science Act (2022)

The CHIPS and Science Act represented the most significant authorization of research infrastructure investment in decades:

- Authorized $81 billion for NSF over five years, including substantial infrastructure
- Created the NSF Directorate for Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships
- Authorized expansion of DOE research facilities
- Authorized Regional Innovation Engines and translation infrastructure
- **However**: Actual appropriations have fallen far short of authorized levels

### Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021)

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included provisions relevant to research infrastructure:

- DOE demonstration projects for clean energy technologies
- National laboratory modernization funding
- Weather and climate observation infrastructure
- Broadband infrastructure benefiting research institutions

### Major Upgrades and New Projects

| Project | Agency | Status | Estimated Cost |
|---------|--------|--------|---------------|
| APS Upgrade | DOE | Completed 2024 | $815M |
| LCLS-II | DOE | Operational | $1.1B |
| SNS Second Target Station | DOE | Under construction | ~$3B |
| ALS Upgrade | DOE | Under construction | $590M |
| PIP-II (Fermilab) | DOE | Under construction | $1.2B |
| Vera C. Rubin Observatory | NSF | Near completion | $473M |
| AIMS (Antarctic) | NSF | Under construction | $410M |

## Key Themes Across History

### Cyclical Investment Pattern

Research infrastructure investment in the United States has followed a boom-bust cycle driven by perceived crises rather than sustained strategic planning:

| Trigger | Response | Duration |
|---------|----------|----------|
| World War II | Manhattan Project, national lab creation | 1940-1950 |
| Sputnik | Massive facility expansion | 1957-1970 |
| Japanese competition | Strategic Computing Initiative | 1983-1995 |
| Great Recession | ARRA stimulus | 2009-2011 |
| China competition | CHIPS and Science Act | 2022-present |

### The Deferred Maintenance Trap

A consistent pattern has been to fund construction of new facilities while underfunding the maintenance and operation of existing ones. This creates a growing backlog of deferred maintenance that eventually requires costly emergency repairs or premature decommissioning.

### Concentration and Inequality

Research infrastructure has historically been concentrated at a small number of elite institutions and national laboratories, creating barriers to participation for researchers at smaller, under-resourced, and minority-serving institutions.

### Political Vulnerability

Large-scale research infrastructure projects are politically vulnerable because they require sustained multi-year commitments that span electoral cycles. The SSC cancellation, recurring threats to close observatories, and the persistent gap between authorization and appropriation all reflect this structural challenge.
