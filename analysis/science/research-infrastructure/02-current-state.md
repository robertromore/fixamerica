# Research Infrastructure: Current State

## Overview

The United States maintains an extensive but aging portfolio of research infrastructure spanning supercomputers, particle accelerators, synchrotron light sources, telescopes, research vessels, and university laboratories. While the nation still operates several world-leading facilities, the overall trajectory is one of declining relative advantage. Competitor nations -- particularly China and the European Union -- are investing aggressively in next-generation research infrastructure while the U.S. struggles with deferred maintenance, construction delays, and fragmented funding.

## High-Performance Computing and Exascale

### Current U.S. Supercomputing Capability

The United States achieved a major milestone with the deployment of exascale supercomputers, but faces intensifying competition:

| System | Location | Performance | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Frontier | Oak Ridge National Lab | 1.194 exaflops (Linpack) | Operational since 2022; world's first exascale system |
| Aurora | Argonne National Lab | 1.012 exaflops | Operational 2024; Intel-based architecture |
| El Capitan | Lawrence Livermore National Lab | ~2 exaflops (projected) | Operational 2024; classified and open science |
| Perlmutter | NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley | 79 petaflops | Operational; workhorse for general science |

### Global Competition

China has invested heavily in supercomputing and operates at least two exascale-class systems. The global ranking of top supercomputers has shifted significantly:

| Country | Top 500 Systems (Nov 2024) | Share |
|---------|---------------------------|-------|
| United States | ~150 | ~30% |
| China | ~105 | ~21% |
| Germany | ~36 | ~7% |
| Japan | ~32 | ~6% |
| Rest of world | ~177 | ~36% |

China's share may be understated, as Chinese institutions have stopped submitting some systems to the Top500 list. Independent assessments suggest China operates additional exascale-capable systems not publicly benchmarked.

### Computing Access Challenges

- **Oversubscription**: DOE leadership computing facilities are oversubscribed by approximately 3:1 to 5:1, meaning the majority of meritorious proposals cannot receive allocations
- **Queue times**: Researchers report wait times of weeks to months for large-scale computing jobs
- **Access inequality**: Researchers at institutions without their own HPC centers face disproportionate barriers to accessing national resources
- **Data infrastructure**: Data transfer, storage, and management infrastructure has not kept pace with computing power
- **Cloud computing gap**: No coherent federal policy for leveraging commercial cloud computing for research

## Synchrotron Light Sources and Neutron Facilities

### Light Source Status

U.S. synchrotron light sources serve tens of thousands of researchers annually across biology, chemistry, materials science, environmental science, and engineering:

| Facility | Location | Generation | Status |
|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| Advanced Photon Source (APS-U) | Argonne, IL | 4th gen (upgraded) | Major upgrade completed 2024; 100x brightness improvement |
| NSLS-II | Brookhaven, NY | 3rd gen | Operational 2014; continuing beamline expansion |
| LCLS / LCLS-II | SLAC, CA | X-ray free-electron laser | LCLS-II operational; million-pulses-per-second capability |
| ALS-U | Berkeley, CA | 4th gen (upgrade) | Under construction; completion ~2027 |
| SSRL | SLAC, CA | 3rd gen | Operational; aging infrastructure |
| CHESS | Cornell, NY | 2nd gen | Operational; university-managed |

The APS upgrade represents a $815 million investment that will make the facility the brightest hard X-ray light source in the Western Hemisphere. However, the upgrade required a year-long shutdown that disrupted thousands of research programs.

### Neutron Source Status

The U.S. operates two major neutron sources, but faces a critical gap:

- **Spallation Neutron Source (SNS)**: Operational at Oak Ridge; Second Target Station (STS) project under construction ($3 billion estimated), which will provide transformational capabilities for soft matter, quantum materials, and structural biology
- **High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR)**: Operating since 1966; aging infrastructure requires significant investment to continue operations; produces critical isotopes for medicine and industry
- **Neutron gap risk**: If HFIR is decommissioned before STS is operational, the U.S. will lose essential neutron scattering capabilities

Globally, the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden is under construction and, when fully operational, will become the world's most powerful neutron source.

## Telescopes and Observatories

### Ground-Based Astronomy

| Facility | Location | Status | Key Capability |
|----------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Vera C. Rubin Observatory | Chile | Near first light | Wide-field survey; 10-year sky survey (LSST) |
| Gemini Observatory (North and South) | Hawaii, Chile | Operational | 8.1m telescopes; international partnership |
| National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab) facilities | Various | Operational | Suite of telescopes; mid-scale facilities |
| Green Bank Observatory | West Virginia | Operational; recurring funding uncertainty | 100m radio telescope; unique low-frequency capabilities |
| Very Large Array (VLA) / ngVLA | New Mexico | VLA operational; ngVLA in planning | Next Generation VLA would be transformational |
| Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) | Chile | Operational | Millimeter/submillimeter interferometry |

**Key concerns:**

- The Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is the astronomy community's top-priority ground-based facility but faces a projected cost of $2.5 billion and has not yet entered MREFC
- Green Bank Observatory has experienced recurring funding crises and near-closure
- U.S. participation in the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is essential but faces funding and siting challenges
- Light pollution and radio frequency interference increasingly threaten ground-based observations

### Space-Based Observatories

| Mission | Status | Wavelength |
|---------|--------|------------|
| James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) | Operational since 2022 | Infrared |
| Hubble Space Telescope | Operational since 1990; aging | Optical/UV |
| Chandra X-ray Observatory | Operational since 1999; aging | X-ray |
| Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope | Under construction; launch ~2027 | Infrared wide-field |
| Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) | Recommended by Astro2020 Decadal; pre-formulation | Optical/UV/IR |

NASA's space-based observatory fleet faces a looming gap as Hubble and Chandra approach end of life before their successors are operational.

## Research Vessels and Field Stations

### Academic Research Fleet

The U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF), managed under the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), operates approximately 18 research vessels. The fleet faces critical aging challenges:

- **Average vessel age**: Over 25 years for many ships in the fleet
- **Regional Class Research Vessels**: Three new vessels under construction ($365 million) to replace aging ships, but delivery has been delayed
- **Deep submergence assets**: The human-occupied vehicle *Alvin* received a major upgrade expanding its depth capability to 6,500 meters
- **Icebreaker gap**: The U.S. Coast Guard operates only two polar icebreakers (*Healy* and the aging *Polar Star*) compared to Russia's fleet of dozens; new Polar Security Cutter program underway but behind schedule

### Field Stations and Marine Laboratories

- NSF supports approximately 40 biological field stations and marine laboratories through the Field Stations and Marine Laboratories (FSML) program
- Many field stations operate on budgets under $1 million annually
- Long-term ecological research (LTER) sites provide irreplaceable decades-long data sets but face funding instability
- Climate change is threatening the physical infrastructure of coastal and polar field stations

## University Research Infrastructure

### Scale of the Problem

University research infrastructure represents the largest and most distributed component of the U.S. research system, and it faces the most severe underfunding:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total research space at U.S. universities | ~260 million net assignable square feet | NSF HERD Survey |
| Space rated as "needs major renovation or replacement" | ~25% | NSF Facilities Survey |
| Estimated deferred maintenance backlog | $15-25 billion (conservative) | APPA/NRC estimates |
| Average age of university research buildings | 30-40 years | Institutional surveys |
| Annual federal investment in university facilities | ~$3 billion | NSF/NIH/DOE budgets |
| Annual investment needed to maintain condition | ~$8-10 billion | Engineering estimates |

### Disparities in Infrastructure Quality

Infrastructure quality varies dramatically across institution types:

| Institution Type | Lab Condition | Equipment Access | HPC Access |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| R1 research universities (top tier) | Generally adequate to good | Strong core facilities | Institutional HPC plus national access |
| R2 research universities | Mixed; significant deferred maintenance | Limited core facilities | Primarily national access |
| Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) | Often poor; historic underinvestment | Minimal | Very limited |
| Primarily undergraduate institutions | Variable; teaching labs often outdated | Minimal research equipment | Rare |
| Community colleges | Not designed for research | None | None |

The gap between well-resourced R1 universities and under-resourced institutions perpetuates inequities in who can participate in cutting-edge research. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges receive disproportionately less federal infrastructure funding relative to their enrollment and research potential.

## Funding Landscape

### Federal Infrastructure Investment Trends

Federal investment in research infrastructure has fluctuated significantly:

| Period | Trend | Key Driver |
|--------|-------|------------|
| 1950s-1960s | Rapid expansion | Cold War competition; Sputnik response |
| 1970s-1980s | Decline | Budget pressures; Vietnam; energy crises |
| 1990s-2000s | Selective investment | Targeted facility construction (SNS, NSLS-II) |
| 2009-2010 | Surge | American Recovery and Reinvestment Act |
| 2011-2020 | Stagnation | Sequestration; continuing resolutions |
| 2021-2025 | Significant increase | CHIPS and Science Act; Inflation Reduction Act; Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act |

The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorized major increases in NSF and DOE research infrastructure spending, but actual appropriations have consistently fallen short of authorized levels. The gap between authorization and appropriation is one of the most persistent challenges in U.S. science policy.

### Current Funding Agencies and Roles

| Agency | Infrastructure Role | FY 2024 Approx. Spending |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| DOE Office of Science | National lab facilities, user facilities, HPC | ~$3.5 billion (construction + operations) |
| NSF | MREFC, university facilities, mid-scale infrastructure | ~$900 million |
| NIH | Intramural facilities, extramural construction grants | ~$600 million |
| NASA | Space-based observatories, research centers | ~$4 billion (science missions with infrastructure) |
| DOD | Defense research facilities | ~$2 billion (research-related) |
| USDA | Agricultural research stations | ~$400 million |

## Emerging Challenges

### Workforce for Facility Operations

Operating complex research facilities requires specialized technical staff -- accelerator physicists, cryogenics engineers, telescope operators, ship crews, and facility managers. Competition from the private sector for these skills is intensifying, and many facilities report difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified staff.

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

Major research facilities depend on specialized components -- superconducting magnets, ultra-high-vacuum systems, precision optics, cryogenic equipment -- with limited domestic suppliers. Supply chain disruptions and dependence on foreign manufacturers (particularly for rare earth materials and specialized electronics) represent growing risks.

### Climate Adaptation

Research facilities face increasing physical risks from climate change:

- Coastal laboratories threatened by sea level rise and storm surge
- Western facilities facing wildfire risk
- Polar research stations affected by ice melt and permafrost thaw
- Extreme heat events straining cooling systems at computing centers

### Cybersecurity

Research infrastructure is increasingly networked and digitally controlled, creating cybersecurity vulnerabilities. High-performance computing centers are particularly attractive targets for state-sponsored cyber operations.

## International Comparison

| Capability | United States | China | Europe | Japan |
|-----------|---------------|-------|--------|-------|
| Exascale computing | 3 systems (world-leading) | 2+ systems (competitive) | Pre-exascale; EuroHPC program | Fugaku (pre-exascale) |
| Synchrotron light sources | 5 major (APS-U world-class) | HEPS under construction (4th gen) | ESRF-EBS (world-class 4th gen) | SPring-8 (3rd gen, upgrade planned) |
| Neutron sources | SNS + HFIR (strong but aging) | CSNS operational (expanding) | ESS under construction (will be world-leading) | J-PARC (competitive) |
| Gravitational wave detectors | LIGO (pioneering) | Planned detector | Virgo (operational) | KAGRA (operational) |
| Particle physics | Fermilab (neutrino focus) | CEPC proposed (Higgs factory) | CERN LHC (world-leading) | SuperKEKB (operational) |
| Research vessels | ~18 (aging fleet) | Rapidly expanding fleet | Moderate fleet | Modern fleet |

The U.S. retains leadership in exascale computing and X-ray free-electron lasers but faces growing competition in nearly every other category. China's rapid infrastructure buildout is particularly notable, with new facilities coming online across all research domains.

---

## Summary

The United States maintains world-class research infrastructure in several categories but faces systemic challenges: an aging portfolio of university laboratories, a deferred maintenance backlog measured in tens of billions of dollars, a widening gap between authorized and appropriated infrastructure funding, growing international competition, and inequitable access that excludes researchers at under-resourced institutions. Without sustained and strategic investment, the nation risks losing the infrastructure foundation that has underpinned its scientific and economic leadership for decades.
