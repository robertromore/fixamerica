# Research Infrastructure: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's scientific leadership depends on physical infrastructure that most citizens never see: particle accelerators, synchrotron light sources, supercomputers, research telescopes, oceanographic vessels, and thousands of university laboratories where discoveries are made. This infrastructure is the foundation upon which every breakthrough in medicine, energy, materials science, and national defense is built. Yet much of it is aging, underfunded, and increasingly outpaced by facilities in China, Europe, and other competitor nations.

The United States operates approximately 28 Department of Energy user facilities, dozens of National Science Foundation Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) projects, and research infrastructure spread across more than 3,000 universities and colleges. Federal investment in research facilities and equipment has declined as a share of GDP since the 1960s, even as the complexity and cost of frontier science have grown dramatically. The result is a growing gap between what researchers need and what the nation provides.

Research infrastructure is not merely a science policy issue -- it is an economic competitiveness and national security imperative. The semiconductor chips, advanced materials, pharmaceutical compounds, and energy technologies that drive the modern economy all trace back to discoveries made at shared research facilities. When these facilities deteriorate or fail to keep pace with global competitors, the consequences ripple across the entire innovation ecosystem.

## Scope

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **User facility** | A federally funded research facility open to outside researchers based on merit review of proposals |
| **MREFC** | Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction, NSF's account for large-scale research infrastructure projects |
| **Exascale computing** | Supercomputers capable of at least one exaflop (10^18 floating-point operations per second) |
| **Synchrotron light source** | A particle accelerator that produces intense beams of X-rays and other radiation for materials analysis |
| **Neutron source** | A facility that generates neutron beams for probing the structure and dynamics of materials |
| **Deferred maintenance** | Necessary repairs and upgrades postponed due to insufficient funding |
| **Beamline** | An experimental station at a synchrotron or neutron source where researchers conduct experiments |
| **Core facility** | A shared university laboratory providing specialized equipment and expertise to multiple research groups |

## Key Questions

1. **How does U.S. research infrastructure compare globally?** Where has America maintained leadership, and where has it fallen behind?

2. **What is the scale of deferred maintenance?** How much investment is needed to bring existing facilities to adequate condition?

3. **How are access and equity distributed?** Do researchers at all institutions have fair access to major facilities, or does geography and prestige create barriers?

4. **What is the pipeline for next-generation facilities?** Are planning and construction timelines adequate to maintain competitiveness?

5. **How should the federal government balance investment in new facilities versus maintaining existing ones?** What frameworks guide these decisions?

## Why This Matters

Research infrastructure is the physical foundation of the American innovation economy:

| Infrastructure Gap | Consequence |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Aging university labs | Researchers unable to conduct cutting-edge experiments |
| Insufficient computing capacity | Loss of leadership in AI, climate modeling, drug discovery |
| Outdated light sources | Materials science breakthroughs happen abroad instead |
| Decommissioned research vessels | Gaps in ocean and climate data collection |
| Delayed facility construction | Multi-year setbacks in scientific programs |
| Inequitable access | Talent wasted at under-resourced institutions |

Research infrastructure investments have long time horizons. A synchrotron light source takes a decade to plan and build, operates for 30-40 years, and enables discoveries that may not reach commercial application for another decade beyond that. Underinvestment today compounds over generations.

## The Opportunity

Strategic investment in research infrastructure can yield transformative returns:

- **Economic multiplier**: Every dollar invested in research infrastructure generates $3-5 in economic activity through supply chains, workforce development, and innovation spillovers
- **Global talent magnet**: World-class facilities attract the best researchers from around the world
- **Regional development**: Major facilities anchor innovation ecosystems and create skilled employment in their host communities
- **Cross-disciplinary breakthroughs**: Modern facilities serve users across dozens of scientific disciplines
- **National security applications**: Advanced computing, materials science, and nuclear physics capabilities serve both civilian and defense needs
