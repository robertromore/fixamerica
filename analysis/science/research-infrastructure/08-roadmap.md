- A dedicated, stable funding mechanism that insulates infrastructure investment from annual budget politics
- A diverse, well-trained workforce operating state-of-the-art facilities
- Strategic partnerships with international collaborators for the most ambitious projects
- A planning and governance system that anticipates future needs and manages the facility lifecycle from conception through decommissioning

## Critical Path Dependencies

The roadmap depends on several critical decisions and conditions:

1. **Political commitment**: Sustained bipartisan support for research infrastructure investment through multiple administrations and Congressional sessions
2. **Stable funding mechanism**: Establishing a trust fund or capital account that survives political transitions
3. **Project management credibility**: Successful cost and schedule performance on near-term projects builds confidence for larger future investments
4. **International cooperation**: Key projects (HWO, particle physics) require international partnership to be affordable
5. **Workforce pipeline**: Investments in training must begin immediately to produce workers for facilities coming online in 5-10 years
6. **Technology readiness**: Some projects depend on R&D breakthroughs (quantum computing, advanced detectors) that cannot be scheduled with certainty

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Appropriations fail to match authorizations | High | Very high | Trust fund; bipartisan coalition; public engagement |
| Major project cost overrun erodes support | Moderate | High | Independent cost estimates; project management reform |
| Political transition disrupts continuity | High | High | Bipartisan legislative framework; career staff continuity |
| Workforce shortages delay facility operations | Moderate | Moderate | Aggressive recruitment; training programs; immigration reform |
| International partners withdraw | Low-moderate | Moderate | Maintain domestic capability; diversify partnerships |
| Technology changes make planned facilities obsolete | Low | Moderate | Built-in flexibility; regular plan updates; modular design |
