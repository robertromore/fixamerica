# Science Policy: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes science policy through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints. Science policy is notable for having historically enjoyed broader bipartisan support than most policy domains, though this consensus has eroded significantly since the mid-2010s, particularly around climate science and pandemic-era public health.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of 2026-02-05)

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *States support for science but often prioritizes industry interests or opposes findings that conflict with policy goals (e.g., climate science)* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies fiscal restraint principle to science funding but not to defense R&D; supports "applied" but not "basic" research inconsistently* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions on science funding shift depending on which party controls the White House; supported NIH doubling but later endorsed sequestration cuts* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Sometimes treats science as a partisan issue when it need not be, particularly around climate and public health* |

**Justification:** Conservatives have a genuine tradition of supporting science for economic competitiveness and national security (the CHIPS Act had bipartisan support), but this support is inconsistently applied. Positions on climate science, public health, and specific agency budgets shift based on political dynamics rather than principled analysis.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Heritage Foundation alternately supports and opposes science funding depending on administration*
- *Republican members supported the NIH budget doubling (1998-2003) but later endorsed sequestration*
- *CHIPS and Science Act received bipartisan support, demonstrating that competitiveness framing can unite*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Agrees U.S. faces competition from China but disputes framing of federal underinvestment; emphasizes private sector R&D success* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Agrees on bureaucratic inefficiency and grant system waste but rejects claims about politicization being primarily from the right; does not see underfunding as core problem* |

**Source references:**

- *Heritage Foundation, "Blueprint for Balance" budget proposals (annual)*
- *American Enterprise Institute science policy publications*
- *Republican Study Committee budget proposals*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Multi-year research appropriations* | 5/10 | *Some support for stability but wary of reducing congressional oversight* | *Protecting appropriations committee power; concern about spending autopilot* |
| *Increase R&D to 1% GDP* | 3/10 | *Oppose arbitrary spending targets; prefer market-driven investment* | *Genuine fiscal concerns; skepticism about government efficiency* |
| *Grant system reform* | 7/10 | *Support reducing bureaucracy and administrative burden* | *Want to ensure reforms do not add new mandates (e.g., diversity requirements)* |
| *Open science mandates* | 5/10 | *Mixed; some support transparency, others protect IP rights* | *Concern about undermining publisher business models; some support taxpayer access* |
| *Workforce reform (postdoc pay)* | 4/10 | *Prefer market solutions to mandated wages* | *Oppose federal wage mandates in general; worry about cost to research programs* |
| *Scientific integrity protections* | 4/10 | *View as aimed at constraining conservative administrations* | *Believe integrity policies can be used to limit political appointees' legitimate authority* |
| *CHIPS Act full funding* | 6/10 | *Supported authorization; mixed on full appropriations* | *National security framing resonates; fiscal concerns limit enthusiasm for full funding* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stability Act* | 4/10 | *Oppose multi-year appropriations as power grab; support some grant reforms* | *Appropriations prerogatives; oppose indirect cost caps as government overreach into universities* |
| *Scientific Integrity Act* | 3/10 | *View as partisan legislation targeting Republican administrations* | *Constrains political appointees; open access threatens publishers; whistleblower provisions could be weaponized* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Increase R&D tax credit rather than federal spending
- Focus federal funding on defense, energy, and competitiveness rather than basic research
- Reduce regulatory burden on research rather than adding new mandates
- Promote public-private partnerships over direct federal funding increases
- Strengthen IP protections to encourage private investment

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (reducing regulation), Centrist (pragmatic reforms)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (China competition framing), Liberal (specific programs with bipartisan appeal like NIH)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (oppose spending mandates), Democratic Socialist (fundamentally different views on government role)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Generally consistent support for science funding and integrity; positions align with stated values* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies pro-science principles broadly, though sometimes prioritizes equity goals over scientific merit in ways that create tension* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions on science funding have been stable for decades; consistently support increased investment* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Occasionally frames science debates in partisan terms that may alienate potential conservative allies* |

**Justification:** Liberals have been the most consistent supporters of federal science investment and scientific integrity protections. Their positions are principled and stable, though occasional overemphasis on partisan framing can undermine the bipartisan coalitions that science funding requires.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Consistent Democratic platform support for NIH, NSF, and DOE funding increases*
- *Obama administration established first government-wide scientific integrity policies*
- *Biden administration issued Nelson Memo and scientific integrity framework*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Consistently applies equity and structural reform principles to science policy* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies worker rights principles to postdocs and grad students consistently; may prioritize equity metrics over research quality concerns* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions are stable and principled; unlikely to accept half-measures* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Can frame debates in ways that alienate researchers who do not share structural critique* |

**Justification:** Progressives bring a consistent structural analysis to science policy, emphasizing workforce exploitation, inequitable access, and the influence of corporate interests. Their positions are principled and predictable, though their insistence on comprehensive reform can slow progress on achievable incremental changes.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Sanders and Warren proposals for research funding and workforce reform*
- *Progressive caucus budget proposals consistently increase science funding*
- *Support for open access and data sharing as public goods*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | *Agrees with analysis; would emphasize corporate capture of R&D, geographic inequality, and workforce exploitation more strongly* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | *Strongly agrees with structural and economic root causes; sees them as part of broader neoliberal policy failures* |

**Source references:**

- *Senator Sanders's science and technology policy proposals*
- *Economic Policy Institute research workforce analyses*
- *Progressive think tank publications on innovation and inequality*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Multi-year research appropriations* | 7/10 | *Support stability but want it paired with significant funding increases* | *Concern that stability at current levels just stabilizes underfunding* |
| *Increase R&D to 1% GDP* | 8/10 | *Support as minimum; advocate for higher target with equity conditions* | *Want funding increases to restructure the system, not just expand it* |
| *Grant system reform* | 9/10 | *Strong support, especially for people-based funding and equity measures* | *Want to fundamentally restructure how science is organized and who benefits* |
| *Open science mandates* | 10/10 | *View open science as essential public good; oppose publisher profit model* | *See scholarly publishing as extractive industry that should be transformed* |

| *Scientific integrity protections* | 8/10 | *Support; also want protections against corporate influence, not just political* | *Want integrity protections to cover industry-funded research as well* |
| *CHIPS Act full funding* | 7/10 | *Support with conditions on corporate behavior and community benefit* | *Skeptical of subsidizing profitable corporations without strict accountability* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stability Act* | 7/10 | *Support most provisions but want stronger worker protections and equity mandates* | *45% indirect cost cap may not go far enough; postdoc minimum should be higher* |
| *Scientific Integrity Act* | 8/10 | *Support; want to extend to corporate influence on publicly funded research* | *APC cap is good but would prefer eliminating APCs entirely for publicly funded work* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Create a publicly funded open access publishing platform to replace commercial publishers
- Guarantee minimum funding for all accredited research institutions
- Establish researcher unions with collective bargaining rights
- Tie corporate R&D tax credits to worker treatment standards

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (worker protections, anti-corporate sentiment), Centrist (pragmatic reform elements)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (fundamental disagreements on spending), Libertarian (oppose mandates)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Consistently applies limited government principles to science policy* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies skepticism of government funding broadly across agencies; does not exempt popular programs* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions are stable and principle-based; opposition to government funding is consistent* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Minimal; engages substantively with arguments for public funding even while disagreeing* |

**Justification:** Libertarians are the most consistent ideological opponents of federal science funding, applying their principles of limited government and free markets uniformly. This makes them predictable but difficult coalition partners for funding increases. However, they are strong allies on reducing regulation and administrative burden.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Cato Institute publications consistently argue for private-sector-led R&D*
- *Reason Foundation analyses of government science spending efficiency*
- *Consistent opposition to new government programs and mandates*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | *Agrees on bureaucratic dysfunction but disagrees that the solution is more federal investment; emphasizes private sector success* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | *Agrees that government inefficiency and perverse incentives are problems but sees the root cause as too much government involvement, not too little* |

**Source references:**

- *Cato Institute science and technology policy publications*
- *Reason Foundation analyses of federal R&D spending*
- *Libertarian Party platform on science and technology*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Multi-year appropriations* | 3/10 | *Oppose expanding government spending commitments* | *Any mechanism that makes it harder to cut spending is unwelcome* |
| *Increase R&D to 1% GDP* | 2/10 | *Strongly oppose; government should shrink, not grow* | *Genuine principle: private sector allocates resources more efficiently* |
| *Grant system reform* | 6/10 | *Support reducing bureaucracy and administrative burden* | *Would prefer to eliminate most grant programs rather than reform them* |
| *Open science mandates* | 5/10 | *Mixed; support open access in principle but oppose government mandates* | *Prefer voluntary open access driven by market forces and researcher preferences* |
| *Workforce reform* | 2/10 | *Oppose federal wage mandates and benefit requirements* | *Universities and researchers should negotiate compensation through markets* |
| *Scientific integrity protections* | 4/10 | *Support protecting individuals from government coercion but oppose new bureaucratic apparatus* | *Prefer First Amendment protections over statutory integrity offices* |
| *CHIPS Act full funding* | 2/10 | *Oppose; view as corporate welfare* | *Government should not subsidize private industry or pick winners* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stability Act* | 2/10 | *Oppose as expansion of government spending authority* | *Multi-year appropriations, wage mandates, and new funds all increase government* |
| *Scientific Integrity Act* | 3/10 | *Support some protections for individual scientists but oppose new regulatory apparatus* | *Prefer market-based and constitutional solutions over new legislation* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Transition federal research funding to private foundations and endowments
- Expand R&D tax credits and eliminate regulatory barriers to private research
- Phase out federal funding for research that the private sector would fund anyway
- Protect research freedom through First Amendment litigation rather than new legislation

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (fiscal restraint), Constitutionalist (limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (open science, anti-corporate monopoly in publishing), Centrist (administrative reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal (fundamental disagreement on government role), Democratic Socialist (opposite views on public investment)

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Applies constitutional principles to science policy consistently* |
| Principle consistency | *Generally consistent in demanding constitutional authority for federal programs; accepts Spending Clause basis for research funding* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions are stable; focused on structural/procedural questions rather than policy outcomes* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Minimal; engages on constitutional merits rather than partisan advantage* |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists bring a principled focus on enumerated powers and proper institutional design. They generally accept the constitutional basis for federal research funding under the Spending Clause but scrutinize new programs and mandates for proper authority. Their process-focused concerns can be addressed in legislative drafting.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Federalist Society discussions on science policy and constitutional authority*
- *Congressional constitutionalist caucus positions on spending authority*
- *Consistent focus on proper legislative process and delegation questions*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | *Agrees with some problems but focuses on structural/constitutional issues rather than funding levels* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | *Agrees on congressional dysfunction and executive overreach; less concerned with funding amounts* |

**Source references:**

- *Federalist Society publications on administrative law and science policy*
- *Congressional Budget Office analyses of appropriations authority*
- *Heritage Foundation constitutional analysis of federal research programs*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Multi-year appropriations* | 4/10 | *Constitutional concerns about binding future Congresses* | *Appropriations power is fundamental congressional prerogative* |
| *Increase R&D to 1% GDP* | 4/10 | *Non-binding targets are acceptable; binding mandates are not* | *Congress cannot constitutionally bind future spending decisions* |
| *Grant system reform* | 6/10 | *Support proper delegation with clear standards* | *Concerned about excessive executive discretion in implementation* |
| *Open science mandates* | 5/10 | *Accept Spending Clause authority for conditions on grants* | *Want to ensure mandates are within congressional authority* |
| *Workforce reform* | 4/10 | *Question federal authority to set wages at private universities* | *Spending Clause allows conditions on grants, but mandates raise questions* |
| *Scientific integrity protections* | 5/10 | *Support protecting government employees; concerned about for-cause removal provisions* | *Unitary executive questions about limiting presidential removal power* |
| *CHIPS Act full funding* | 5/10 | *Authorized through proper legislative process; appropriations are Congress's decision* | *Distinguish between authorization and obligation to appropriate* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stability Act* | 4/10 | *Multi-year appropriations raise separation of powers concerns; Stabilization Fund needs clear limits* | *Prefer traditional appropriations process with reform of continuing resolution practice* |
| *Scientific Integrity Act* | 5/10 | *Support scientific integrity in principle; concerned about for-cause removal limiting executive power* | *Want careful drafting to respect separation of powers and avoid unconstitutional delegation* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Reform the annual appropriations process rather than creating workarounds
- Address funding instability through procedural reforms (budget deadlines, consequences for failure)
- Protect scientific integrity through existing civil service protections rather than new statutory frameworks
- Ensure all science policy reform respects the proper role of each branch of government

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (limited government), Libertarian (constitutional limits)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (process reform), Liberal (integrity protections if properly structured)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (scope of government action), Democratic Socialist (expansive government programs)

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Claims to support "real" science for working people but positions often driven by anti-elite sentiment or industry-specific interests* |
| Principle consistency | *Supports some science (agriculture, manufacturing) while opposing other science (climate, public health) based on cultural affiliation rather than evidence* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions shift based on which elites are being challenged; support for science fluctuates with political dynamics* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Often frames science debates as elite vs. ordinary people, creating unnecessary opposition* |

**Justification:** Populists have an inconsistent relationship with science policy, supporting research that benefits their constituencies (agricultural research, manufacturing technology) while opposing research perceived as serving elite interests or threatening traditional industries. The anti-elite framing of science skepticism makes populist positions unpredictable and difficult to address through policy design alone.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Support for agricultural research and rural broadband alongside opposition to climate science*
- *Skepticism of university elites coexists with support for applied technology programs*
- *Pandemic-era opposition to public health measures despite earlier support for medical research*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | *Agrees that science benefits are unevenly distributed (geographic concentration); disagrees with trust-in-science framing* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | *Agrees on elite capture of funding and geographic inequality; rejects narrative that anti-science sentiment is the problem* |

**Source references:**

- *American Compass publications on innovation and industrial policy*
- *Populist congressional caucus positions on CHIPS Act and research funding*
- *Survey data on public attitudes toward science by education and geography*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Multi-year appropriations* | 5/10 | *Neutral; neither strongly support nor oppose* | *Want to ensure funding goes to "real" research, not ivory tower projects* |
| *Increase R&D to 1% GDP* | 4/10 | *Support applied research increases; oppose open-ended spending* | *Want funding directed to manufacturing, agriculture, and working-class communities* |
| *Grant system reform* | 6/10 | *Support reducing elite institutional concentration* | *Want geographic distribution requirements and applied research emphasis* |
| *Open science mandates* | 6/10 | *Support taxpayer access to research they funded* | *Genuine populist appeal of "you paid for it, you should be able to see it"* |
| *Workforce reform* | 5/10 | *Mixed; support better pay but skeptical of expanding academic elite* | *Want research workforce to serve practical needs, not just academic careers* |
| *Scientific integrity protections* | 3/10 | *View as protecting liberal scientists from accountability* | *Skeptical of "integrity" framing that they see as shielding elites from political oversight* |
| *CHIPS Act full funding* | 7/10 | *Support manufacturing and technology sovereignty* | *Strong support when framed as competing with China and creating American jobs* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stability Act* | 5/10 | *Support some provisions (geographic distribution, applied research) but oppose others (open-ended spending)* | *Want to see more emphasis on practical outcomes and working-class communities* |
| *Scientific Integrity Act* | 3/10 | *Oppose; view as protecting elite scientists from democratic accountability* | *See integrity protections as insulating unelected experts from popular oversight* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Direct more research funding to applied technology and manufacturing innovation
- Require geographic distribution of research funding (minimum per-state allocation)
- Create community advisory boards for federally funded research to ensure local benefit
- Focus on technology transfer and commercialization that creates jobs

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on some issues), Religious Right (cultural skepticism of experts)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (worker protections, anti-corporate sentiment), Liberal (CHIPS Act, applied research)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (disagree on industrial policy), Centrist (disagree on expertise and institutions)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Consistently supports evidence-based science policy; positions track stated pragmatic values* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies pragmatism and bipartisanship uniformly; willing to compromise on details to advance core goals* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions are stable and predictable; anchored in evidence and institutional effectiveness* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Actively seeks win-win solutions; avoids partisan framing of science issues* |

**Justification:** Centrists are the most reliable and consistent advocates for science policy reform. Their pragmatic orientation, commitment to evidence, and willingness to compromise make them ideal coalition anchors. Science policy is one of the few domains where centrism has clear substantive content rather than merely splitting the difference between positions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center science and innovation reports*
- *Centrist Senate caucus support for CHIPS Act and research funding*
- *ITIF (centrist think tank) consistent advocacy for increased R&D investment*

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | *Strongly agrees with evidence-based analysis of current conditions and challenges* |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | *Agrees with most root causes; may place less emphasis on structural/systemic critique and more on practical reform* |

**Source references:**

- *Bipartisan Policy Center science and innovation publications*
- *Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) reports*
- *Niskanen Center science policy analyses*

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Multi-year appropriations* | 8/10 | *Strong support; recognize funding instability as core problem* | *Want to design mechanism that maintains congressional flexibility while providing stability* |
| *Increase R&D to 1% GDP* | 8/10 | *Support as evidence-based target* | *Prefer gradual increase with accountability measures* |
| *Grant system reform* | 9/10 | *Enthusiastic support for evidence-based reform* | *Want reforms piloted and evaluated before full implementation* |
| *Open science mandates* | 8/10 | *Support as good policy with strong evidence base* | *Want managed transition that does not destabilize existing infrastructure* |
| *Workforce reform* | 8/10 | *Support as necessary and overdue* | *Want reforms sized appropriately and funded adequately* |
| *Scientific integrity protections* | 8/10 | *Support as institutional strengthening rather than partisan measure* | *Want protections designed to survive changes in administration* |
| *CHIPS Act full funding* | 9/10 | *Strong support for competitiveness investment* | *Want effective implementation with measurable outcomes* |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| *Federal Research Stability Act* | 8/10 | *Support most provisions; may want to adjust indirect cost cap level* | *Want evidence-based calibration of specific provisions (cap level, postdoc minimum, etc.)* |
| *Scientific Integrity Act* | 8/10 | *Support; would emphasize bipartisan framing and institutional design* | *Want to ensure provisions work regardless of which party controls the White House* |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Create a bipartisan National Commission on the Future of American Science to build consensus
- Pilot reforms at willing agencies before mandating government-wide
- Develop metrics-based accountability frameworks for all proposed reforms
- Build public support through economic impact studies and competitiveness analysis

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (shared support for science), Conservative (on competitiveness)
- **Potential bridges:** All perspectives (centrists serve as natural bridge-builders)
- **Unlikely partners:** None specifically, though extreme positions on either end may be unreachable

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Engages selectively with science; genuine support for medical research coexists with opposition to research that conflicts with moral positions* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies faith-based values consistently within their framework but selectively engages with scientific evidence* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions on specific issues (stem cells, evolution) are stable but overall engagement with science fluctuates* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Sometimes frames science as threatening to faith, creating unnecessary opposition to scientific enterprise broadly* |

**Justification:** The Religious Right has a complex relationship with science. Many faith communities strongly support medical research (particularly for diseases affecting their communities) while opposing specific research areas on moral grounds (embryonic stem cells, certain reproductive technologies). Their engagement is principled within their moral framework but inconsistent when viewed from a scientific policy perspective.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Strong evangelical support for NIH funding, particularly cancer and rare disease research*
- *Consistent opposition to embryonic stem cell research on moral grounds*

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | *Consistently applies public goods and worker rights principles to science policy* |
| Principle consistency | *Applies democratic control and worker rights principles uniformly across science policy issues* |
| Goalpost stability | *Positions are stable; may insist on comprehensive reform that delays achievable progress* |
| Zero-sum behavior | *Can frame debates as public vs. private in ways that alienate industry partners needed for implementation* |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists bring a coherent framework emphasizing science as a public good, worker rights for researchers, and democratic accountability for the scientific enterprise. Their positions are principled and predictable, making them reliable coalition partners on funding and workforce issues, though their comprehensive vision may slow incremental progress.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *DSA platform on public investment in research and education*
- *Bernie Sanders proposals for NIH drug development and pricing*
- *Consistent advocacy for researcher unionization and improved working conditions*

#### Position Scores

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *Bipartisan Research Competitiveness and Efficiency Act*

**Bridges:** *Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist*

**Core Agreement:** All four perspectives agree that the U.S. must maintain its competitive edge in research and that the current grant system wastes researcher time. By focusing on efficiency, competitiveness, and geographic equity rather than spending targets, this compromise attracts the widest coalition.

**Policy Description:**

A bill that reforms the grant system to reduce waste, improves geographic distribution of research funding, and streamlines administrative processes -- without mandating specific spending levels. Key provisions: two-stage grant applications, standardized forms across agencies, expanded EPSCoR program for underserved states, pilot of people-based funding at NIH and NSF, and a competitive research infrastructure fund prioritizing institutions in states with below-average federal R&D per capita.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | *Reduces government waste and bureaucratic burden; does not mandate spending levels* |
| Liberal | *Improves system efficiency, expands access, supports equity goals through geographic distribution* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based reforms piloted before scaling; pragmatic and achievable* |
| Populist | *Distributes research benefits more broadly; reduces elite institutional dominance* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | *Accepts some expansion of federal research infrastructure programs* |
| Liberal | *Defers spending targets and workforce mandates for separate legislation* |
| Centrist | *Accepts geographic distribution requirements that may not optimize purely for merit* |
| Populist | *Accepts that most funding still goes through merit-based peer review* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives (all except Libertarian strong opposition)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *High -- efficiency and competitiveness framing is durable across administrations*
- **Implementation Path:** *Could be introduced as amendments to annual appropriations bills or as standalone bipartisan legislation*

---

### Compromise 2: *Taxpayer Access to Publicly Funded Research Act*

**Bridges:** *Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Populist + Democratic Socialist*

**Core Agreement:** A broad coalition agrees that the public should have free access to research it funded. Even perspectives skeptical of government spending can support the principle that taxpayer-funded work should be taxpayer-accessible.

**Policy Description:**

A focused bill codifying and strengthening the Nelson Memo's open access requirements. All federally funded publications must be freely available immediately upon publication in designated repositories. Data sharing within 12 months with FAIR compliance. APC costs are allowable grant expenses with a cap. No new spending is required -- this is a conditions-on-existing-grants measure.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | *Public access to publicly funded research is a core value* |
| Progressive | *Challenges publisher profit model; advances knowledge as public good* |
| Centrist | *Evidence-based policy with strong international precedent (Plan S)* |
| Populist | *"You paid for it, you should see it" resonates strongly* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Advances vision of knowledge as commons; challenges privatization* |
| Conservative | *Taxpayer accountability and transparency are conservative values* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | *Defers broader scientific integrity protections* |
| Progressive | *Accepts APC model rather than publicly funded publishing* |
| Conservative | *Accepts government mandate on grant conditions* |
| Populist | *Accepts that implementation details remain with agencies* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 8/9 perspectives (broad support; only Libertarian hesitant on mandate)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 6/8 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *Very high -- once open access is implemented, reversal is politically difficult*
- **Implementation Path:** *Could pass as standalone legislation or be attached to annual appropriations language*

---

### Compromise 3: *Science for America's Future Act (Workforce and Training)*

**Bridges:** *Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Democratic Socialist + Conservative (partial)*

**Core Agreement:** Multiple perspectives agree that the STEM workforce pipeline needs reform, that postdocs are underpaid, and that the U.S. must attract and retain international talent. By framing this as workforce development and competitiveness rather than labor regulation, the coalition broadens.

**Policy Description:**

A bill raising the NRSA postdoc minimum to $65,000 (phased in over 2 years), requiring health insurance and parental leave for all federally funded postdocs, creating 5,000 "staff scientist" positions at universities and national labs, expanding bridge programs for underrepresented students, and streamlining visa processing for STEM researchers.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | *Addresses workforce exploitation and supports diversity* |
| Progressive | *Improves worker conditions and creates alternative career paths* |
| Centrist | *Pragmatic workforce investment with measurable outcomes* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Advances labor rights and worker dignity* |
| Conservative | *Competitiveness framing: attracting talent to beat China* |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | *Lower initial salary target ($65K vs. $70K) to broaden support* |
| Progressive | *Does not include full unionization rights or $80K minimum* |
| Conservative | *Accepts some federal role in setting research worker compensation* |
| Democratic Socialist | *Incremental reform rather than comprehensive restructuring* |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** *Moderate-high -- once salary increases are implemented, they become the new baseline*
- **Implementation Path:** *Could be paired with CHIPS Act reauthorization or standalone STEM workforce bill*

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable coalition for science policy reform is **Liberal + Centrist + Conservative (selective)**, joined by specific allies depending on the issue. Grant system reform and open science have the broadest support. Workforce reform and integrity protections command majority support but face more ideological division. The key strategic insight is that different reforms require different coalitions, and pursuing them as separate bills rather than a single omnibus increases the odds of passage.

### Key Obstacles

- **Partisan polarization of science**: The 37-percentage-point trust gap makes it difficult to frame science as nonpartisan
- **Appropriations committee resistance**: Multi-year funding proposals threaten committee power
- **Publisher lobbying**: Well-funded opposition to open access mandates
- **University lobbying**: Strong resistance to indirect cost reform
- **Populist anti-expert sentiment**: Difficult to address through policy design alone

### Low Consistency Partners

- **Populists (2/5)**: Engage through economic benefit framing (jobs, manufacturing) and geographic equity; avoid framing that reinforces elite/ordinary divide
- **Conservative/Religious Right (3/5 each)**: Engage on specific programs (medical research, competitiveness) rather than comprehensive reform; respect moral concerns on specific research areas

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with grant reform and open science** -- these have the broadest coalitions and least ideological resistance
2. **Frame funding increases as competitiveness investment** -- this resonates across Conservative, Centrist, and Populist perspectives
3. **Pursue workforce reform as workforce development** -- framing as career development rather than labor regulation broadens appeal
4. **Build bipartisan integrity protections** -- emphasize institutional design that protects science regardless of which party is in power
5. **Avoid omnibus legislation** -- separate bills for separate coalitions maximize chances of passage
