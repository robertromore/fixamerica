## File Structure

Each topic uses a 12-file structure:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 01-overview.md | Executive summary and scope |
| 02-current-state.md | Present-day conditions |
| 03-history.md | Historical context |
| 04-root-causes.md | Systemic analysis |
| 05-stakeholders.md | Who is affected |
| 06-opposition.md | Who opposes reform |
| 07-solutions.md | Proposed reforms |
| 08-roadmap.md | Implementation timeline |
| 09-resources.md | Further reading |
| 10-actions.md | What citizens can do |
| 11-legislation.md | Draft legal text |
| 12-perspectives.md | Political perspectives analysis |

---

## Perspectives Analysis (12-perspectives.md)

The 12-perspectives.md file evaluates each topic through 9 political viewpoints:

- Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian
- Constitutionalist, Populist, Centrist
- Religious Right, Democratic Socialist

Each perspective is scored on:

- **Engagement Consistency (1-5)**: How reliably stated positions align with principles
- **Position Scores (1-10)**: Agreement with analysis, root causes, solutions, legislation
- **Coalition Potential**: Natural allies and bridges

Generate with: `/analyze-perspectives <domain>/<subtopic>`
