# Water Resources: Overview

America faces a water crisis spanning quality, quantity, and infrastructure. Aging pipes contaminate drinking water, aquifers are being depleted faster than replenished, climate change disrupts traditional water patterns, and decades of underinvestment have left systems failing. Meanwhile, water allocation frameworks based on 19th-century assumptions cannot adapt to 21st-century realities. Solving America's water challenges requires massive infrastructure investment, reformed water rights, ecosystem restoration, and equitable access to this fundamental resource.
