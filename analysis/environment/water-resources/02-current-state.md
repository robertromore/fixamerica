# Water Resources: Current State

## Overview

America's water infrastructure and resources are under severe stress. Decades of underinvestment have degraded drinking water systems, climate change is altering water availability, groundwater is being depleted unsustainably, and millions lack access to safe, affordable water. Recent federal investments represent a significant down payment but fall short of comprehensive needs.

| **Combined sewer overflow** | 772 communities affected |
| **Sanitary sewer overflow** | Thousands annually |
| **Septic systems** | 20%+ of U.S. population |

### Funding Gap

| Category | Need |
|----------|------|
| **Water infrastructure** | $625+ billion over 20 years |
| **Wastewater** | $271+ billion needed |
| **Stormwater** | $48+ billion needed |
| **Annual gap** | $30+ billion shortfall |

## Affordability
