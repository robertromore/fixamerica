# Water Resources: History

## Overview

American water policy evolved from local improvisation to complex federal-state-local governance. Early infrastructure development focused on expansion, the Progressive Era established public health standards, major federal water projects transformed the West, environmental laws of the 1970s addressed pollution, and recent decades have confronted infrastructure decline and climate-driven scarcity.

## Early Development (Pre-1900)

| **Source protection** | Watershed focus |
| **Small system assistance** | Capacity building |

### Paradigm Shift

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| **Development** | Environmental protection |
| **Structural solutions** | Non-structural alternatives |
| **New projects** | Existing system management |
| **Federal construction** | State/local responsibility |

## Infrastructure Decline (1990-2020)

### Investment Decline

| Trend | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Federal share decline** | 3-4% of capital |
