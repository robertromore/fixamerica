# Water Resources: Overview

## Executive Summary

America faces a water crisis spanning quality, quantity, and infrastructure. Aging pipes contaminate drinking water, aquifers are being depleted faster than replenished, climate change disrupts traditional water patterns, and decades of underinvestment have left systems failing. Meanwhile, water allocation frameworks based on 19th-century assumptions cannot adapt to 21st-century realities. Solving America's water challenges requires massive infrastructure investment, reformed water rights, ecosystem restoration, and equitable access to this fundamental resource.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Drinking water**: Quality, safety, infrastructure
- **Water supply**: Availability, allocation, scarcity
- **Groundwater**: Aquifer depletion, sustainability
- **Surface water**: Rivers, lakes, reservoirs
- **Infrastructure**: Treatment, distribution, wastewater
- **Water quality**: Pollution, contamination
- **Water rights**: Allocation, interstate, tribal
- **Climate impacts**: Drought, flooding, variability

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lead service lines | 6-10 million nationwide |
| Water main breaks | 240,000+ annually |
| Drinking water violations | 30+ million people affected |
| Aquifer overdraft | Major aquifers declining |
| Infrastructure funding gap | $625+ billion over 20 years |
| PFAS contamination | 200+ million people exposed |

## Core Problems

### Infrastructure Crisis

| Problem | Scale |
|---------|-------|
| **Aging pipes** | Many 80-100+ years old |
| **Lead contamination** | Millions of service lines |
| **Treatment plants** | Many need major upgrades |
| **Water loss** | 6+ billion gallons daily |
| **Funding** | Chronic underinvestment |

### Water Scarcity

| Challenge | Region |
|-----------|--------|
| **Colorado River** | 40 million depend on declining supply |
| **Ogallala Aquifer** | Central U.S. agriculture at risk |
| **California** | Chronic drought, groundwater overdraft |
| **Southwest** | Population growth vs. limited supply |
| **Tribal nations** | 48+ lack adequate access |

### Water Quality

| Contaminant | Scope |
|-------------|-------|
| **Lead** | Millions exposed through pipes |
| **PFAS** | Widespread contamination |
| **Nitrates** | Agricultural runoff |
| **Industrial chemicals** | Legacy contamination |
| **Emerging contaminants** | Inadequate regulation |

## Historical Context

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-1900** | Local systems, early federal role |
| **1914** | First federal drinking water standards |
| **1972** | Clean Water Act |
| **1974** | Safe Drinking Water Act |
| **1980s-1990s** | Standards development |
| **2000s-present** | Infrastructure crisis emerges |
| **2021** | Bipartisan Infrastructure Law |

## Governance Structure

### Federal Role

| Agency | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **EPA** | Drinking water standards, Clean Water Act |
| **Bureau of Reclamation** | Western water infrastructure |
| **Army Corps of Engineers** | Flood control, navigation |
| **USDA** | Rural water systems |
| **DOI** | Water rights, tribal water |

### State Role

| Function | Authority |
|----------|-----------|
| **Primacy** | Implement drinking water standards |
| **Water rights** | Allocation systems |
| **Planning** | State water plans |
| **Permitting** | Discharge permits |

### Local Role

| Function | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| **Water utilities** | Operation, maintenance |
| **Capital investment** | Infrastructure |
| **Rate-setting** | Cost recovery |
| **Customer service** | Delivery |

## Stakeholder Landscape

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| **Ratepayers** | Affordable, safe water |
| **Utilities** | Sustainable operations |
| **Agriculture** | Water access for irrigation |
| **Industry** | Process water, discharge |
| **Environmental groups** | Ecosystem protection |
| **Tribal nations** | Water rights, access |

## Reform Landscape

### Recent Developments

| Development | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| **Bipartisan Infrastructure Law** | $55+ billion for water |
| **Lead pipe replacement** | Accelerated programs |
| **PFAS regulation** | Standards established |
| **Colorado River compact** | Renegotiation ongoing |
| **Groundwater regulation** | States acting |

### Key Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Funding** | Continuing investment needs |
| **Climate adaptation** | Changing water patterns |
| **Water rights reform** | Entrenched interests |
| **Affordability** | Rate increases burden poor |
| **Political will** | Long-term commitment needed |

## Path Forward

Addressing water challenges requires:

1. **Massive infrastructure investment** in systems
2. **Lead pipe replacement** nationwide
3. **Contaminant regulation** for emerging threats
4. **Water allocation reform** for sustainability
5. **Groundwater management** to prevent depletion
6. **Climate adaptation** in water planning
7. **Affordability programs** for low-income households
8. **Ecosystem restoration** for water quality
