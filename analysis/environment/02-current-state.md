| Air quality | B- | Stable with emerging threats |
| Water quality | C | Declining infrastructure |
| Land/biodiversity | C- | Continued loss |
| Waste/toxics | D+ | Inadequate regulation |
| Environmental justice | D | Recognition growing, action lagging |
| Energy transition | C+ | Accelerating but uneven |

The U.S. is taking more climate action than ever before, but still falls far short of what science requires. Environmental protection gains from the 1970s are eroding. Environmental injustice persists. The gap between scientific knowledge and policy action remains enormous.
