# Environment: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

This document provides draft legal text for comprehensive environmental reform. Given the breadth of environmental law, it focuses on priority areas: climate action, wetland restoration (responding to *Sackett*), environmental justice, and chemical safety reform. Environmental law is primarily statutory, making legislative reform the key pathway, though constitutional amendments could strengthen long-term protection.

## Constitutional Amendments

### Environmental Rights Amendment

**Purpose**: Establish constitutional protection for environmental quality and the rights of future generations.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. The people shall have the right to clean air, pure water, and
a healthy environment, including a stable climate.

Section 2. The federal government and each State shall serve as trustee
of the environment for the benefit of present and future generations and
shall conserve, protect, and maintain natural resources for the common
benefit of all people.

Section 3. Any person may enforce the rights recognized in this article
against any government or private actor in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The burden of proving that government action or inaction
does not violate this article shall rest with the government.

Section 4. This article shall not be construed to limit other rights or
to limit the authority of Congress or any State to enact stronger
environmental protections.

Section 5. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by
appropriate legislation.

Section 6. This article shall take effect two years after ratification.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 1: Establishes substantive environmental rights, including climate
- Section 2: Creates public trust duty for government
- Section 3: Provides private right of action with burden shift
- Section 4: Non-regression clause; allows stronger state action
- Section 5: Congressional enforcement authority
- Section 6: Implementation delay for transition

**Potential Challenges**:

- "Healthy environment" may be considered vague
- Courts may struggle with climate standing
- Industry opposition will be intense
- Supermajority requirement for amendments

**Refinements**:

- More specific environmental quality metrics could be added
- Scientific standards could be incorporated by reference
- State constitutional amendments could proceed in parallel

### Intergenerational Equity Amendment

**Purpose**: Require consideration of future generations in major government decisions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. The federal government shall not take any action that
substantially burdens future generations without explicit consideration
of alternatives that would not impose such burdens.

Section 2. For purposes of this article, burdens on future generations
include, but are not limited to:
(a) degradation of the environment or climate;
(b) depletion of non-renewable natural resources;
(c) accumulation of debt not matched by durable investments;
(d) creation of long-lived hazardous materials or conditions.

Section 3. Congress shall establish procedures for assessing
intergenerational impacts and shall designate or create an independent
office responsible for representing future generations in government
proceedings.

Section 4. Any person may bring suit to enforce this article.

Section 5. This article shall take effect three years after ratification.
```

**Explanation**:

Creates constitutional duty to consider future generations in major decisions, with institutional support and citizen enforcement.

### Wetland Restoration Act of 2025

**Purpose**: Restore Clean Water Act protections eliminated by *Sackett v. EPA*.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Wetland Restoration Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) wetlands provide essential ecological functions including flood
        control, water filtration, and wildlife habitat;
    (2) the Supreme Court's decision in Sackett v. EPA, 598 U.S. ___
        (2023), eliminated federal protection for the majority of
        wetlands in the United States;
    (3) absent federal protection, wetland loss will accelerate; and
    (4) Congress has authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate
        waters that affect interstate commerce.

SEC. 3. WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES.

Section 502(7) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C.
1362(7)) is amended to read as follows:

"(7) NAVIGABLE WATERS.—
    (A) IN GENERAL.—The term 'navigable waters' means the waters of
        the United States, including the territorial seas, and includes—
        (i) waters which are currently used, were used in the past, or
            may be susceptible to use in interstate or foreign commerce;
        (ii) interstate waters, including interstate wetlands;
        (iii) the territorial seas;
        (iv) all impoundments of waters identified in clauses (i)
             through (iii);
        (v) all tributaries of waters identified in clauses (i)
            through (iv);
        (vi) all waters adjacent to waters identified in clauses (i)
             through (v), including wetlands, ponds, lakes, oxbows,
             impoundments, and similar waters;
        (vii) all waters with a significant nexus to waters identified
              in clauses (i) through (iii); and
        (viii) all wetlands, regardless of proximity to other waters,
               where destruction or degradation could affect the
               chemical, physical, or biological integrity of waters
               identified in clauses (i) through (iii).
    (B) SIGNIFICANT NEXUS.—For purposes of this paragraph, a water
        has a significant nexus if, either alone or in combination
        with other similarly situated waters, it significantly affects
        the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of waters
        identified in subparagraph (A)(i) through (iii).
    (C) EXCLUSIONS.—The term 'navigable waters' does not include—
        (i) waste treatment systems, including treatment ponds or
            lagoons designed to meet the requirements of this Act;
        (ii) prior converted cropland; and
        (iii) artificially irrigated areas that would revert to dry land
              if irrigation ceased.".

SEC. 4. WETLAND PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS.

(a) NO NET LOSS.—It shall be the policy of the United States to achieve
no net loss of wetlands.

(b) MITIGATION.—Any person who receives a permit under section 404 of
the Federal Water Pollution Control Act shall be required to mitigate
wetland impacts at a ratio of not less than—
    (1) 3 to 1 for wetlands in environmental justice communities;
    (2) 2 to 1 for wetlands with high ecological value; and
    (3) 1.5 to 1 for all other wetlands.

SEC. 5. STATE ASSUMPTION.

Section 404(g) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended
to provide that no State program shall be approved unless it—
    (1) provides protections at least as stringent as this Act;
    (2) includes adequate resources for enforcement; and
    (3) provides for meaningful public participation.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after enactment.
```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause**

- Clean Water Act authority derives from Commerce Clause
- *Sackett* narrowed but did not eliminate this authority
- Wetland legislation must establish connection to interstate commerce
- Congressional findings strengthen constitutional foundation

**Major Questions Doctrine**

- *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) requires clear congressional authorization
- Climate Action Act provides explicit statutory authority
- Detailed congressional findings address "major questions"
- Specific standards reduce agency discretion concerns

**Takings**

- Environmental regulations may face takings challenges
- *Penn Central* balancing test applies
- Regulations addressing nuisance or public trust less vulnerable
- Compensation provisions can address legitimate concerns

### Preemption

**Federal Floor, Not Ceiling**

- All proposed legislation includes savings clauses
- States may adopt more stringent standards
- Local authority preserved unless specifically preempted
- California waiver authority maintained

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Citizen Suits**

- All proposed legislation includes citizen suit provisions
- Attorney fee provisions encourage private enforcement
- Notice requirements balance with expedited action for urgent harms

**Agency Enforcement**

- Civil penalties substantial enough to deter
- Criminal penalties for knowing violations
- Permit revocation authority
- Compliance orders with daily penalties

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Definition gaming** | Industries may argue facilities don't meet definitions | Medium |
| **Grandfather provisions** | Existing facilities may seek exemptions | High |
| **State implementation** | Weak state programs may undermine federal goals | Medium |
| **Carbon capture credits** | May incentivize continued fossil fuel use | Medium |
| **Border adjustment evasion** | Complex supply chains may evade | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Enforcement resources** | Laws may be under-enforced | Budget constraints |
| **Scientific uncertainty** | Standards may be outdated | Slow regulatory process |
| **Political vulnerability** | Future Congresses may weaken | Partisan polarization |
| **International coordination** | Unilateral action insufficient | Global commons problem |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Automatic standard updates**: Require periodic review and updating of standards based on latest science
2. **Adequate funding**: Dedicated funding streams not subject to appropriations
3. **Independent enforcement**: Citizen suit provisions supplement agency enforcement
4. **Anti-rollback provisions**: Require supermajority to weaken standards
5. **International agreements**: Coordinate with trading partners on carbon pricing
