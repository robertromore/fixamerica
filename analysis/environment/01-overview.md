# Environment: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States faces an environmental crisis spanning climate change, air and water pollution, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion. Despite having the scientific knowledge and technological capability to address these challenges, America has largely failed to act at the scale and speed required. The U.S. remains the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, responsible for the largest cumulative historical emissions. Environmental burdens fall disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color. Market failures, political obstruction, regulatory capture, and short-term thinking have prevented the systemic changes needed to protect public health, ecosystems, and future generations.

## The Problem in Numbers

### Climate Change

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| U.S. emissions (2023) | ~5.0 billion metric tons CO₂e | 14% of global emissions |
| Historical emissions | ~400 billion metric tons | 25% of cumulative global total |
| Temperature rise (U.S.) | +1.2°C since pre-industrial | Faster than global average |
| Sea level rise | 8-12 inches since 1900 | Accelerating |
| Extreme weather costs | $165 billion (2022) | Record year |

### Air Quality

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Deaths from air pollution | ~100,000-200,000/year | Comparable to COVID-19 annual deaths |
| Counties not meeting standards | 100+ million people | Ozone, particulates |
| Asthma prevalence | 25 million Americans | Higher in polluted areas |
| Wildfire smoke exposure | Growing annually | New health emergency |

### Water

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Americans with unsafe water | 45+ million | Lead, PFAS, other contaminants |
| Water infrastructure gap | $600+ billion | 20-year investment need |
| Rivers impaired | 46% | Don't meet quality standards |
| Groundwater depletion | Accelerating | Ogallala, California aquifers |

### Biodiversity and Land

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Species at risk | 1,600+ | ESA listed species |
| Wetlands lost | 50%+ | Since colonial era |
| Forest loss | Varies by region | Fire, development, disease |
| Protected lands | 12% (permanent) | Below 30x30 goal |

## Key Questions

This analysis addresses:

1. **Why has the U.S. failed to address climate change** despite decades of warnings?
2. **Who bears the burden** of environmental degradation and who benefits from inaction?
3. **What policies could achieve** meaningful emissions reductions and environmental protection?
4. **How can environmental justice** be integrated into all policy approaches?
5. **What are the economic costs** of action versus inaction?
6. **How do powerful interests** block environmental progress?
7. **What successful models** exist domestically and internationally?

## Why This Matters

### Public Health

| Impact | Scale |
|--------|-------|
| Air pollution deaths | 100,000-200,000 annually |
| Heat-related illness | Growing rapidly |
| Vector-borne disease | Expanding range |
| Mental health impacts | Climate anxiety, disaster trauma |
| Cancer clusters | Near industrial facilities |

### Economic Costs

| Category | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| Climate disasters | $100+ billion/year (rising) |
| Health costs from pollution | $800+ billion |
| Agricultural losses | Billions annually |
| Infrastructure damage | Tens of billions |
| Lost productivity | Heat, disasters, illness |

### National Security

- Climate-driven migration and instability
- Competition for resources
- Infrastructure vulnerability
- Military installation threats
- Supply chain disruption

### Intergenerational Equity

Current choices impose costs on future generations who have no voice in present decisions. Each year of delayed action increases future costs and closes off options.

## Political Context

### Partisan Divide

| Dimension | Democratic Position | Republican Position |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Climate science | Accept consensus | Ranges from acceptance to denial |
| Federal role | Strong regulation | State-led, market solutions |
| Energy policy | Rapid transition | "All of the above," fossil fuel support |
| Carbon pricing | Generally supportive | Generally opposed |
| Environmental regulation | Strengthen | Reduce "burden" |

### Key Fault Lines

- **Climate change existence/urgency**: Fundamental disagreement on facts
- **Economic tradeoffs**: Jobs vs. environment framing
- **Federal vs. state authority**: Constitutional tensions
- **Property rights**: Regulatory "takings" concerns
- **Energy independence**: Fossil fuels as security

### Cross-Partisan Opportunities

| Area | Potential Agreement |
|------|---------------------|
| Conservation | Hunters, outdoor recreation coalition |
| Clean water | Local pollution impacts all communities |
| Nuclear power | Some support across spectrum |
| Innovation | Technology investment |
| Local air quality | Health concerns transcend partisanship |

## Framework for Analysis

This analysis examines environmental policy through multiple lenses:

### Market Failure Analysis

Environmental problems often stem from:

- **Externalities**: Pollution costs not borne by polluters
- **Public goods**: Clean air/water benefit all, leading to free-riding
- **Tragedy of commons**: Overuse of shared resources
- **Information asymmetries**: Unknown chemical risks
- **Discounting the future**: Short-term thinking

### Environmental Justice Framework

Who is harmed and who benefits:

- **Procedural justice**: Meaningful participation in decisions
- **Distributive justice**: Fair distribution of burdens and benefits
- **Corrective justice**: Addressing historical harms
- **Recognition justice**: Acknowledging community knowledge and rights

### Political Economy Analysis

Why policy fails despite public support:

- Industry capture of regulatory agencies
- Campaign finance and lobbying power
- Revolving door between industry and government
- Geographic concentration of fossil fuel interests
- Federalism constraints on national action

## Key Themes

Several themes recur throughout this analysis:

1. **Science-policy disconnect**: Clear scientific consensus exists on many issues, but policy doesn't follow
2. **Environmental injustice**: Pollution and climate impacts concentrate in marginalized communities
3. **Regulatory capture**: Agencies meant to protect the public often serve industry
4. **Cost externalization**: Polluters profit while society bears the burden
5. **Intergenerational theft**: Current generations imposing costs on future ones
6. **Technological optimism vs. systemic change**: Debate over solutions approach
7. **Federal-state tensions**: Preemption, enforcement, cooperative federalism challenges
