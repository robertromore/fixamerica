# Climate Policy: Overview

## Executive Summary

Climate change represents an existential threat requiring unprecedented policy transformation across energy, transportation, industry, agriculture, and land use. Despite scientific consensus on the urgency, U.S. climate policy has been marked by partisan division, policy reversals, and inadequate action relative to the scale of the challenge. The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) marked the largest federal climate investment in history, yet emissions reductions remain insufficient to meet Paris Agreement commitments. Effective climate policy requires accelerating decarbonization, building resilience, ensuring equity, and navigating complex political and economic trade-offs.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Mitigation policy** reducing greenhouse gas emissions
- **Adaptation and resilience** preparing for climate impacts
- **International commitments** and diplomacy
- **Federal, state, and local** climate action
- **Economic transition** and just transition
- **Climate science** and policy interface
- **Regulatory frameworks** and market mechanisms

## Key Statistics

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| US share of global emissions | ~13% (2nd largest) | EPA |
| US emissions (2023) | ~5.0 billion metric tons CO2e | EPA |
| Reduction from 2005 peak | ~17% | EPA |
| Paris Agreement target | 50-52% below 2005 by 2030 | White House |
| Current trajectory | ~40% reduction by 2030 | Various |
| IRA climate spending | ~$370 billion over 10 years | CBO |
| Clean energy jobs | 3.3 million | E2 |
| Climate disaster costs (2023) | $93 billion | NOAA |

## Why This Matters

### Environmental Impact

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Temperature rise** | 1.2°C above pre-industrial |
| **Extreme weather** | More frequent, severe events |
| **Sea level rise** | Coastal flooding, erosion |
| **Ecosystems** | Species loss, habitat destruction |
| **Water** | Drought, flooding, supply disruption |

### Economic Impact

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Disaster costs** | $150+ billion annually |
| **Infrastructure** | Damage to roads, buildings |
| **Agriculture** | Crop failures, yield changes |
| **Health costs** | Heat illness, air quality |
| **Energy** | Grid stress, fuel costs |

### Social Impact

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Health** | Heat deaths, disease spread |
| **Displacement** | Climate migration |
| **Inequality** | Disproportionate impacts |
| **National security** | Instability, resource conflicts |
| **Future generations** | Inherited burden |

## Core Problems

### Inadequate Ambition

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Emissions gap** | Policies insufficient for targets |
| **Delayed action** | Decades of insufficient response |
| **Locked-in infrastructure** | Long-lived fossil fuel investments |
| **International shortfall** | Global action inadequate |

### Political Obstacles

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Partisan division** | Climate as culture war issue |
| **Policy instability** | Reversals with administrations |
| **Fossil fuel influence** | Industry lobbying |
| **Short-term focus** | Electoral vs. climate timescales |

### Implementation Challenges

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Permitting delays** | Slow clean energy deployment |
| **Grid constraints** | Transmission bottlenecks |
| **Workforce gaps** | Skills for energy transition |
| **Supply chains** | Critical mineral dependencies |

## Policy Framework

### Federal Authority

| Tool | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Clean Air Act** | EPA emissions regulation |
| **Tax code** | Clean energy incentives |
| **Spending** | Infrastructure investment |
| **Procurement** | Federal clean energy purchasing |
| **Land management** | Public lands emissions |

### State and Local Action

| Level | Tools |
|-------|-------|
| **States** | RPS, cap-and-trade, building codes |
| **Cities** | Zoning, transportation, buildings |
| **Regions** | Multi-state compacts |

### International Engagement

| Framework | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Paris Agreement** | Rejoined 2021 |
| **NDC** | Enhanced 2021 |
| **Climate finance** | Commitments made |
| **Bilateral deals** | China, others |

## Stakeholder Landscape

| Stakeholder | Position |
|-------------|----------|
| **Fossil fuel industry** | Resist rapid transition |
| **Clean energy industry** | Support climate action |
| **Environmental groups** | Push stronger action |
| **Labor unions** | Mixed (jobs concerns) |
| **Businesses** | Increasingly supportive |
| **Youth activists** | Demand urgent action |
| **Frontline communities** | Prioritize justice |

## Reform Approaches

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Carbon pricing** | Tax or cap-and-trade |
| **Clean energy standards** | Mandate clean electricity |
| **Direct regulation** | EPA emissions rules |
| **Industrial policy** | Manufacturing incentives |
| **Research investment** | Technology development |
| **Adaptation planning** | Resilience investment |

## Political Complexity

| Issue | Challenge |
|-------|-----------|
| **Partisan polarization** | Republican opposition |
| **Regional impacts** | Fossil fuel state concerns |
| **Cost distribution** | Who pays for transition |
| **International equity** | Historical responsibility |
| **Technological uncertainty** | Pathway debates |
