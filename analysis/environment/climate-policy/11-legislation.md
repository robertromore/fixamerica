# Climate Policy: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Effective climate legislation must establish durable emissions reduction requirements, enable clean energy deployment, support affected workers and communities, and build resilience. This document provides draft legislation addressing key gaps in current law.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Offsets quality** | Low-quality offsets undermine targets | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Political durability** | Future rollback | Partisan division |
| **International scope** | US action alone insufficient | Global commons |
| **Technology uncertainty** | Some sectors hard to decarbonize | Technical limits |
| **Enforcement** | Monitoring, verification challenges | Complexity |
| **Speed** | Deployment pace may lag | Implementation |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strict offset protocols** with additionality, permanence, verification
2. **Biomass sustainability criteria** with lifecycle analysis
3. **CCS monitoring requirements** with liability for leakage
4. **Declining alternative compliance payments** over time
5. **Limited banking/borrowing** with caps
6. **Clear eligibility criteria** with regular review
7. **Sunset provisions requiring reauthorization** for durability
8. **International linkage mechanisms** for global coordination
9. **Technology-specific pathways** for hard-to-decarbonize sectors
10. **Strong enforcement** with citizen suit provisions

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Regulatory capture** | Independent oversight |
| **Judicial challenge** | Strong legal foundation |
| **State variation** | Floor, not ceiling |
| **Industry gaming** | Robust monitoring |
| **Equity impacts** | Justice provisions |
