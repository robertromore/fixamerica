# Climate Policy: Root Causes

## Overview

The inadequacy of U.S. climate policy stems from structural political obstacles, economic interests, cognitive and cultural factors, and institutional limitations. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective strategies to accelerate climate action.

## Political Economy
