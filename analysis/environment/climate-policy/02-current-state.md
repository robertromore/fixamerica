# Climate Policy: Current State

## Overview

U.S. climate policy is at a pivotal moment following passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (2022), the largest federal climate investment in history. Combined with the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and executive actions, federal policy has shifted significantly toward decarbonization. However, emissions reductions remain insufficient to meet stated targets, and political uncertainty threatens policy durability.
