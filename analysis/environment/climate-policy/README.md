# Climate Policy: Overview

Climate change represents an existential threat requiring unprecedented policy transformation across energy, transportation, industry, agriculture, and land use. Despite scientific consensus on the urgency, U.S. climate policy has been marked by partisan division, policy reversals, and inadequate action relative to the scale of the challenge. The Inflation Reduction Act (2022) marked the largest federal climate investment in history, yet emissions reductions remain insufficient to meet Paris Agreement commitments. Effective climate policy requires accelerating decarbonization, building resilience, ensuring equity, and navigating complex political and economic trade-offs.
