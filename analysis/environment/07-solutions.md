## Alternative Approaches

### Market-Based

| Approach | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Carbon tax only** | Necessary but not sufficient |
| **Cap-and-trade only** | Needs complementary policies |
| **Voluntary corporate action** | Insufficient without mandates |
| **Innovation investment only** | Takes too long without deployment policy |

**Verdict**: Market mechanisms valuable but must be part of comprehensive approach with standards, investment, and equity provisions.

### Command-and-Control

| Approach | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Technology mandates** | Effective but may not be cost-optimal |
| **Emission standards** | Clear, enforceable |
| **Bans (e.g., coal phase-out)** | Provides certainty |
| **Performance standards** | Flexibility within requirements |

**Verdict**: Standards provide certainty and enforce minimums; combine with market flexibility.

### Public Investment

| Approach | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Green New Deal** | Comprehensive but politically challenging |
| **Infrastructure investment** | Broad support; insufficient alone |
| **Federal green bank** | Leverage private capital |
| **Public ownership** | Some clean energy could be public |

**Verdict**: Significant public investment necessary to drive transition at scale.

### Litigation-Led

| Approach | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **State AG suits** | Promising, slow, uncertain |
| **Constitutional claims** | Important but not sufficient |
| **Private nuisance** | Accountability mechanism |
| **Securities enforcement** | Disclosure and accountability |

**Verdict**: Litigation important for accountability; cannot substitute for policy.

### Recommended Comprehensive Approach

Combine all mechanisms:

1. **Carbon pricing** to correct market failure
2. **Standards** to ensure minimums
3. **Public investment** to accelerate transition
4. **Environmental justice** at center of all policies
5. **Litigation** for accountability
6. **Political reform** to enable action
