# Clean Energy: History

## Overview

The history of clean energy in America reflects cycles of interest driven by energy crises, environmental concerns, and technological breakthroughs, punctuated by periods of neglect when fossil fuels seemed adequate. Recent decades have seen accelerating progress as costs declined and climate urgency increased.
