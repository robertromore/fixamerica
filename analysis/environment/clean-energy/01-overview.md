# Clean Energy: Overview

## Executive Summary

The transition to clean energy is essential for addressing climate change, enhancing energy security, and creating economic opportunity. The United States has made significant progress in deploying renewable energy, but the pace must accelerate dramatically to meet climate targets. The Inflation Reduction Act provides unprecedented incentives, yet barriers persist in permitting, transmission, supply chains, and workforce development. A comprehensive clean energy strategy must address technology deployment, grid modernization, market design, and ensuring equitable benefits.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Renewable energy** (solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower)
- **Nuclear energy** (existing and advanced)
- **Energy storage** (batteries, other technologies)
- **Grid modernization** and transmission
- **Energy efficiency**
- **Market design** and policy mechanisms
- **Manufacturing** and supply chains
- **Workforce development**
