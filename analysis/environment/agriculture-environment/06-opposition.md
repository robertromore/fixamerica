# Agriculture and Environment: Opposition

## Overview

Agricultural environmental reforms face opposition from agribusiness, farm organizations defending current systems, and political forces aligned with conventional agriculture. Opposition ranges from outright rejection of environmental concerns to acceptance of voluntary-only approaches that maintain the status quo. Understanding opposition dynamics is essential for developing effective strategies.
