# Agriculture and Environment: Overview

American agriculture is both a significant contributor to environmental degradation and a potential solution for climate change and ecological restoration. Industrial farming depletes soil, pollutes waterways, generates greenhouse gases, and threatens biodiversity, while consuming vast quantities of water and driving habitat loss. Yet agriculture can also sequester carbon, protect watersheds, maintain wildlife habitat, and build ecosystem resilience. Transitioning to sustainable agriculture requires reforming farm policy, supporting conservation practices, reducing chemical inputs, and integrating environmental outcomes into the food system.
