# Agriculture and Environment: Current State

## Overview

American agriculture continues to generate significant environmental impacts despite decades of conservation programs. Industrial practices dominate, soil health declines in many areas, water pollution persists, and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions remain substantial. While conservation programs have expanded and sustainable practices are growing, they remain insufficient to address the scale of environmental challenges.

## Agricultural Pollution

### Nutrient Pollution

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Fertilizer runoff** | Nitrogen, phosphorus contamination |
| **Livestock waste** | Concentrated nutrients |

| **Chesapeake Bay** | Improving slowly |
| **Lake Erie** | Harmful algal blooms |
| **Many water bodies** | Impaired |

### Pesticide Contamination

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Pesticide use** | 1+ billion pounds annually |
| **Water contamination** | Widespread detection |
| **Groundwater** | Found in many aquifers |
| **Pollinators** | Neonicotinoid impacts |
| **Human exposure** | Farmworker, residential |

### Concentrated Animal Operations

| Issue | Scale |
|-------|-------|
| **CAFOs** | 20,000+ facilities |
| **Waste generation** | Billions of gallons annually |
| **Air pollution** | Ammonia, hydrogen sulfide |

| **Tillage erosion** | Contributes to loss |
| **Economic cost** | Billions annually |

### Soil Organic Matter

| Trend | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Historic loss** | 50-70% in many soils |

| **Carbon sequestration** | Potential not realized |
| **Soil biology** | Often degraded |

### Soil Health Practices

| Practice | Adoption |
|----------|----------|
| **No-till** | ~37% of cropland |
| **Cover crops** | ~6% of cropland |
| **Diverse rotations** | Limited |
| **Integration with livestock** | Rare |

## Water Resources

### Irrigation

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Irrigated acres** | 57+ million |
| **Water use** | 70%+ of freshwater |
| **Groundwater depletion** | Major in key regions |
| **Efficiency** | Improving but still waste |

### Groundwater Depletion

| Aquifer | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Ogallala** | Declining 1-3 feet annually in areas |
| **Central Valley** | Severe overdraft |
| **Mississippi Embayment** | Significant decline |
| **Southwest** | Critical depletion |

### Water Quality

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Nitrates** | Widespread drinking water issue |
| **Pesticides** | Groundwater, surface water |
| **Sediment** | Stream impairment |
| **Salinity** | Irrigation-related |

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions

### Emission Sources

| Source | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| **Livestock (enteric)** | ~27% of ag emissions |
| **Livestock (manure)** | ~14% of ag emissions |
| **Soil management** | ~49% (N2O from fertilizer) |
| **Rice cultivation** | ~3% |
| **Field burning** | ~3% |

### Total Contribution

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Total agricultural GHG** | ~10-12% of U.S. emissions |
| **Trend** | Relatively stable |
| **Offset potential** | Significant through soil |
| **Methane reduction** | Opportunities exist |

## Biodiversity

### Habitat Loss

| Ecosystem | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Grasslands** | 99%+ native prairie lost |
| **Wetlands** | Half of historic wetlands lost |
| **Riparian areas** | Significant degradation |
| **Hedgerows/field margins** | Largely removed |

### Pollinator Decline

| Species | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Honey bees** | Colony losses 30-40% annually |
| **Native bees** | Many species declining |
| **Monarchs** | Dramatic decline |
| **Other pollinators** | Widespread concern |

### Wildlife Impacts

| Impact | Cause |
|--------|-------|
| **Habitat loss** | Conversion, intensification |
| **Pesticide exposure** | Direct and indirect |
| **Monoculture** | Reduced diversity |
| **Farm practices** | Nesting destruction |

## Conservation Programs

### Program Participation

| Program | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **CRP** | ~22 million acres enrolled |
| **EQIP** | $2+ billion annually |
| **CSP** | Major acreage enrolled |
| **ACEP** | Wetland, easement protection |

### Program Effectiveness

| Assessment | Finding |
|------------|---------|
| **CRP** | Significant wildlife, soil benefits |
| **EQIP** | Variable effectiveness |
| **CSP** | Enhanced conservation |
| **Overall** | Important but insufficient scale |

## Organic and Sustainable

### Organic Agriculture

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Certified organic** | ~3% of cropland |
| **Market growth** | Strong demand |
| **Transition** | Barriers remain |
| **Premium** | Supports transition |

### Sustainable Practices

| Practice | Adoption |
|----------|----------|
