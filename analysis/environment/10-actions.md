5. **Have one climate conversation** with family or friends

### Intermediate Actions

## What Works Best

Research on effective climate action suggests:

| High Impact | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Political action** | Systemic change multiplies individual impact |
| **Talking about climate** | Normalizes concern, spreads information |
| **Collective action** | Power comes from organization |
| **Focus on policy** | Regulations and incentives change behavior at scale |
| **Coalition building** | Diverse coalitions are stronger |

| Lower Impact (But Still Worth Doing) |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Individual lifestyle changes (unless they free up resources for political action) |
| Consumer choices (unless they lead to corporate change) |
| Social media alone (unless it drives action) |

The most effective individual action is almost always joining with others to demand systemic change.
