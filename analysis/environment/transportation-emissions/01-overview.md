# Transportation Emissions: Overview

## Executive Summary

Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, accounting for 29% of total emissions. The sector's reliance on petroleum-based fuels contributes to climate change, air pollution, and public health impacts. Transforming transportation requires electrification, improved efficiency, mode shift to transit and active transportation, and land use changes that reduce vehicle miles traveled. This transformation presents challenges but also opportunities for economic development, improved mobility, and better public health outcomes.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Vehicle emissions**: Light-duty vehicles, trucks, buses
- **Aviation**: Domestic and international flights
- **Rail**: Freight and passenger
- **Marine**: Shipping and waterborne transport
- **Fuels**: Gasoline, diesel, alternative fuels, electricity
- **Infrastructure**: Charging networks, fuel distribution
- **Land use**: Transportation-related development patterns

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Transportation share** | 29% of US GHG | Largest sector since 2017 |
| **Light-duty vehicles** | 58% of transport emissions | Cars and light trucks |
| **Medium/heavy trucks** | 24% of transport emissions | Freight movement |
| **Aviation** | 10% of transport emissions | Growing rapidly |
| **Vehicle miles traveled** | 3.2 trillion/year | Pre-pandemic peak |
| **EV market share** | ~8% of new sales | Growing rapidly |
| **Transit ridership** | Down 30% from 2019 | Post-pandemic impact |

## Scale of the Challenge

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Emissions trajectory** | Declining but insufficient |
| **Vehicle fleet** | 280+ million vehicles to transform |
| **Infrastructure** | Massive charging/fueling needs |
| **Equity** | Access, affordability concerns |
| **Economic stakes** | $2+ trillion annual industry |

## Problem Statement

The transportation sector faces multiple interconnected challenges:

1. **Climate impact**: Largest and growing emissions source
2. **Air pollution**: Health impacts from tailpipe emissions
3. **Oil dependence**: Economic and security vulnerability
4. **Infrastructure**: Inadequate for transition
5. **Equity**: Burdens fall on low-income communities
6. **Land use**: Sprawl locks in driving
7. **Market failures**: External costs not priced

## Root Causes Summary

| Cause | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Fossil fuel subsidies** | Market distortions |
| **Unpaid externalities** | No carbon price |
| **Infrastructure lock-in** | Highway-centric investment |
| **Land use patterns** | Sprawl requires driving |
| **Vehicle preferences** | Consumer demand for SUVs |
| **Policy fragmentation** | Split federal/state authority |

## Solution Directions

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Electrification** | Zero-emission vehicles |
| **Efficiency standards** | Fuel economy requirements |
| **Carbon pricing** | Internalize external costs |
| **Transit investment** | Modal alternatives |
| **Land use reform** | Reduce VMT needs |
| **Active transportation** | Walking, biking infrastructure |
| **Freight efficiency** | Optimize goods movement |

## Stakeholder Landscape

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| **Auto industry** | Transition investment |
| **Oil industry** | Existing fuel markets |
| **Utilities** | Grid loading from EVs |
| **Transit agencies** | Funding, ridership |
| **Environmental groups** | Emissions reduction |
| **Labor unions** | Job transition concerns |
| **Low-income communities** | Affordability, access |
| **Rural areas** | Limited alternatives to driving |

## Why This Matters

| Impact | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Climate** | Major emissions source |
| **Health** | Air pollution mortality |
| **Economy** | Energy costs, trade deficit |
| **Equity** | Transportation burden disparity |
| **Security** | Oil dependence risks |
| **Development** | Land use patterns |
