# Transportation Emissions: Root Causes

## Overview

High transportation emissions result from systemic factors including market failures that don't price pollution, infrastructure investments that favor driving, land use patterns that require car travel, and policy choices that subsidize fossil fuels. Addressing emissions requires understanding these interconnected causes and intervening at multiple levels simultaneously.

## Market Failures

### Unpriced Externalities

| Externality | Annual Cost | Status |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Climate damage** | $100+ billion | Not priced |
| **Air pollution health** | $70+ billion | Not priced |
| **Traffic congestion** | $87 billion | Not priced |
| **Oil dependence** | $100+ billion | Not priced |
| **Noise pollution** | $10+ billion | Not priced |

### Price Signal Failures

| Issue | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **No carbon price** | CO2 emitted freely |
| **Low gas taxes** | Below full cost |
| **No VMT charges** | Driving underpriced |
| **Parking subsidies** | Free parking norm |
| **Highway tolling rare** | Road use not priced |

### Fossil Fuel Subsidies

| Subsidy Type | Annual Value |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Direct subsidies** | $20+ billion |
| **Tax preferences** | $15+ billion |
| **Implicit subsidies** | $200+ billion |
| **State/local** | Additional billions |

## Infrastructure Lock-In

### Highway-Centric Investment

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Highway Trust Fund** | Dedicated highway revenue |
| **80/20 federal match** | Highways vs. transit (historically) |
| **State DOT priorities** | Road expansion bias |
| **Induced demand** | More roads → more driving |
| **Maintenance burden** | Locks in road network |

### Transit Underfunding

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| **Capital shortfall** | $176 billion backlog |
| **Operating support** | Inconsistent funding |
| **Fare dependence** | Service quality tradeoffs |
| **Expansion barriers** | Limited new systems |
| **Service quality** | Declining ridership |

### Charging Infrastructure Gap

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **Public charger density** | Below optimal |
| **Fast charging** | Limited network |
| **Apartment charging** | Major barrier |
| **Rural coverage** | Inadequate |
| **Reliability** | Uptime issues |

## Land Use Patterns

### Sprawl Development

| Pattern | Transportation Impact |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Low density** | Transit not viable |
| **Separated uses** | Car trips required |
| **Cul-de-sac streets** | Walking/biking difficult |
| **Large lot zoning** | Long distances |
| **Parking requirements** | Car storage mandated |

### Zoning and Regulation

| Requirement | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **Single-family zoning** | Enforces low density |
| **Parking minimums** | Subsidizes driving |
| **Setback requirements** | Pedestrian-hostile |
| **Road standards** | Wide, fast streets |
| **Use separation** | Mandates driving |

### Development Location

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Greenfield preference** | Sprawl expansion |
| **Suburban incentives** | Tax abatements |
| **Urban disinvestment** | Hollowed cities |
| **Highway accessibility** | Development follows roads |
| **School quality** | Suburban migration driver |

## Consumer and Industry Factors

### Vehicle Preferences

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **SUV/truck demand** | Lower efficiency |
| **Vehicle size growth** | Weight increase |
| **Feature creep** | Technology adds weight |
| **Marketing** | Larger = safer perception |
| **Status signaling** | Size as prestige |

### Industry Incentives

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Profit margins** | Higher on larger vehicles |
| **Fleet average** | Cross-subsidization |
| **Product cycle** | Long development times |
| **Dealer resistance** | EV sales resistance |
| **Supply chain** | ICE component interests |

### EV Adoption Barriers

| Barrier | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Purchase price** | Higher upfront cost |
| **Range anxiety** | Perceived limitation |
| **Charging access** | Infrastructure gaps |
| **Model availability** | Limited choices (improving) |
| **Used EV market** | Limited supply |

## Policy and Regulatory Factors

### Regulatory Gaps

| Gap | Consequence |
|-----|-------------|
| **Light truck loophole** | SUV lower standards |
| **Credit trading** | Compliance flexibility |
| **Attribute-based standards** | Size increases allowed |
| **Enforcement gaps** | Testing vs. real-world |
| **Non-CO2 emissions** | Incomplete coverage |

### Fragmented Authority

| Level | Authority |
|-------|-----------|
| **Federal** | CAFE, EPA standards |
| **State** | Can follow CA or federal |
| **Local** | Limited vehicle authority |
| **Regional** | Planning fragmentation |

### Aviation and Freight Gaps

| Sector | Gap |
|--------|-----|
| **Aviation** | No domestic CO2 regulation |
| **International aviation** | CORSIA weak |
| **Heavy trucks** | Standards lag cars |
| **Shipping** | IMO slow progress |
| **Rail** | Not electrified |

## Political Economy

### Industry Influence

| Actor | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Auto manufacturers** | Lobbying, campaign contributions |
| **Oil industry** | Policy opposition |
| **Dealers** | State-level influence |
| **Fuel retailers** | Local opposition |
| **Trucking** | Freight policy influence |

### Geographic Politics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Auto state influence** | Michigan, others |
| **Oil state resistance** | Texas, Louisiana |
| **Rural representation** | Anti-transit bias |
| **Suburban voters** | Car-dependent constituency |

### Path Dependence

| Factor | Lock-In Effect |
|--------|----------------|
| **Sunk infrastructure** | Roads, refineries |
| **Workforce skills** | ICE manufacturing |
| **Consumer habits** | Driving culture |
| **Business models** | Gas stations, service |
| **Urban form** | Sprawl built |

## Equity Dimensions

### Mobility Burden

| Group | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Low-income** | Higher transport cost share |
| **Urban poor** | Poor transit access |
| **Rural** | Car dependency |
| **Elderly** | Mobility limitations |
| **Disabled** | Accessibility gaps |

### Pollution Exposure

| Factor | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| **Highway proximity** | Low-income, minority |
| **Freight corridors** | Concentrated burden |
| **Diesel pollution** | Urban hotspots |
| **Cumulative impacts** | Multiple exposures |

## Structural Summary
