### Rectification Procedures

1. **Eliminate light truck loophole** with unified standards
2. **Reform attribute-based system** to remove size incentives
3. **Align test cycles** with real-world driving
4. **Accelerate heavy-duty standards** with technology support
5. **Address aviation** through SAF mandates and R&D
6. **Integrate land use** through federal incentives
7. **Require equity** in all programs
8. **Strengthen enforcement** with compliance verification
9. **Limit credit trading** to ensure actual fleet improvement
10. **Close fleet exemptions** for consistent requirements

### General Implementation Concerns

|---------|------------|
| **Industry resistance** | Phase-in, flexibility |
| **Consumer acceptance** | Incentives, education |
| **Grid capacity** | Coordinated planning |
| **Supply chain** | Domestic investment |
| **Workforce transition** | Training, support |
| **Rural access** | Targeted infrastructure |
