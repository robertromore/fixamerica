# Transportation Emissions: History

## Overview

America's transportation system evolved from a diverse network of rail, streetcars, and waterways into overwhelming automobile dependence. Federal policies, industry lobbying, and suburban development patterns created a transportation monoculture that locked in high emissions. Understanding this history reveals how policy choices—not inevitable market outcomes—created today's challenges and can inform transformative solutions.
