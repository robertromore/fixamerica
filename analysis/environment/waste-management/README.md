# Waste Management: Overview

America generates more waste per capita than almost any other nation, with inadequate systems for reduction, reuse, recycling, and disposal. Landfills leak toxins into groundwater, plastics accumulate in ecosystems, hazardous waste threatens communities, and recycling systems struggle with contamination and market failures. Meanwhile, the burden of waste facilities falls disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color. Transforming waste management requires a shift from end-of-pipe disposal toward circular economy principles emphasizing waste prevention, material recovery, and producer responsibility.
