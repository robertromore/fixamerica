# Waste Management: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Transforming waste management toward a circular economy requires phased action on producer responsibility, plastic reduction, recycling infrastructure, and organic waste diversion. This roadmap outlines realistic implementation pathways at federal, state, and local levels, recognizing that states will likely lead before federal action.

|--------|----------|------|
| Performance targets met | Year 5-7 | PROs |
| Material design improved | Year 5-7 | Producers |
| Consumer behavior shift | Year 4-7 | All |
| Environmental justice | Year 4-7 | States |

## Key Milestones

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Year 1 | 5 states with EPR laws |
| Year 2 | Major PROs operational |
| Year 3 | 10+ states with EPR |
