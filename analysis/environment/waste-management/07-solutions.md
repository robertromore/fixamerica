# Waste Management: Solutions

## Overview

Transforming waste management requires shifting from end-of-pipe disposal toward a circular economy emphasizing waste prevention, reuse, and material recovery. Solutions must address product design, producer responsibility, recycling infrastructure, organic waste, and environmental justice. This document outlines evidence-based solutions for comprehensive waste reform.
