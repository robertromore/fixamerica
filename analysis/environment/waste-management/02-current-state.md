# Waste Management: Current State

## Overview

America's waste management system struggles to handle the enormous volume of materials generated, with recycling rates stagnant, landfills facing capacity constraints, and plastics accumulating in the environment. The system designed for disposal rather than resource recovery fails to capture material value while creating environmental and health burdens concentrated in vulnerable communities.

| **Production growth** | Expected to triple by 2050 |

### Types and Recyclability

| Type | Common Uses | Recyclability |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **PET (#1)** | Bottles | Moderate |
| **HDPE (#2)** | Jugs, containers | Moderate |
| **PVC (#3)** | Pipes | Rarely recycled |
| **LDPE (#4)** | Bags, film | Limited |
| **PP (#5)** | Containers | Limited |
| **PS (#6)** | Foam | Rarely recycled |
| **Other (#7)** | Mixed | Not recycled |

### Environmental Impact

| Impact | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Ocean plastic** | 8+ million tons annually enter oceans |
| **Microplastics** | Ubiquitous in environment |
| **Wildlife** | Widespread harm |
| **Human health** | Concerns about exposure |
| **Persistence** | Hundreds of years |

## Organic Waste

### Food Waste

| Metric | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Food wasted** | 30-40% of food supply |
| **Landfill share** | 22% of MSW |
| **Methane impact** | Major source |
| **Composting rate** | Low (<10% of food waste) |
| **Anaerobic digestion** | Limited capacity |

### Yard Waste

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bans** | Many states ban yard waste from landfills |
| **Composting** | Established programs |
| **Mulching** | Common practice |
| **Recovery rate** | Higher than food waste |

## Hazardous Waste

### Generation

| Sector | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| **Chemical manufacturing** | Major generator |
| **Petroleum refining** | Significant |
| **Metal finishing** | Important source |
| **Electronics** | Growing concern |
| **Households** | Small but widespread |

### Management

| Element | Status |
