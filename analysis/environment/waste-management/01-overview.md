# Waste Management: Overview

## Executive Summary

America generates more waste per capita than almost any other nation, with inadequate systems for reduction, reuse, recycling, and disposal. Landfills leak toxins into groundwater, plastics accumulate in ecosystems, hazardous waste threatens communities, and recycling systems struggle with contamination and market failures. Meanwhile, the burden of waste facilities falls disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color. Transforming waste management requires a shift from end-of-pipe disposal toward circular economy principles emphasizing waste prevention, material recovery, and producer responsibility.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Municipal solid waste**: Household and commercial waste
- **Recycling**: Collection, processing, markets
- **Plastics**: Pollution, recycling challenges
- **Hazardous waste**: Toxic materials management
- **Electronic waste**: E-waste handling
- **Food waste**: Organic waste management
- **Industrial waste**: Manufacturing byproducts
- **Environmental justice**: Facility siting equity

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Municipal solid waste generated | 292 million tons annually |
| Per capita generation | 4.9 lbs/person/day |
| Recycling rate | 32% (including composting) |
| Landfilled | 50% of waste |
| Plastics recycled | <10% |
| Food waste | 30-40% of food supply |

## Core Problems

### Excessive Generation

| Issue | Scale |
|-------|-------|
| **Per capita waste** | Highest among large nations |
| **Single-use products** | Dominant consumption pattern |
| **Planned obsolescence** | Products designed to fail |
| **Packaging** | 30%+ of municipal waste |
| **Growth trajectory** | Increasing waste generation |

### Recycling Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Contamination** | 25%+ of recyclables rejected |
| **Market collapse** | China ban disrupted system |
| **Infrastructure gaps** | Processing capacity lacking |
| **Consumer confusion** | Inconsistent rules |
| **Economic viability** | Virgin materials often cheaper |

### Disposal Problems

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Landfill pollution** | Groundwater, air contamination |
| **Methane emissions** | Climate impact |
| **Capacity limits** | Regional shortages |
| **Environmental justice** | Facilities in poor communities |
| **Plastic persistence** | Environmental accumulation |

## Affected Communities

| Community | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Fence-line communities** | Near landfills, incinerators |
| **Low-income areas** | Disproportionate facility siting |
| **Communities of color** | Environmental racism in siting |
| **Rural communities** | Illegal dumping |
| **Coastal communities** | Marine debris |

## Historical Context

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-1960s** | Open dumps, burning common |
| **1965** | Solid Waste Disposal Act |
| **1976** | RCRA establishes framework |
| **1980s** | Recycling programs emerge |
| **1990s** | Landfill regulations strengthen |
| **2000s-2010s** | Recycling expansion, then crisis |
| **2018** | China import ban disrupts markets |
| **2020s** | Circular economy focus emerges |

## Governance Structure

### Federal Role

| Agency | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **EPA** | RCRA implementation, hazardous waste |
| **DOT** | Hazardous materials transport |
| **FDA** | Food contact materials |
| **FTC** | Recycling labeling |

### State Role

| Function | Authority |
|----------|-----------|
| **Solid waste planning** | State programs |
| **Permitting** | Facility authorization |
| **Recycling goals** | State mandates |
| **Extended producer responsibility** | State laws |

### Local Role

| Function | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| **Collection** | Curbside, drop-off |
| **Disposal** | Landfills, transfer stations |
| **Recycling programs** | Local implementation |
| **Enforcement** | Local ordinances |

## Reform Landscape

### Emerging Trends

| Trend | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Extended producer responsibility** | Spreading in states |
| **Plastic bans** | Increasing adoption |
| **Organic waste diversion** | Mandates emerging |
| **Circular economy** | Policy focus growing |
| **Chemical recycling** | Contested development |

### Key Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Federal inaction** | Limited national policy |
| **Market failures** | Externalities not priced |
| **Industry resistance** | Oppose producer responsibility |
| **Infrastructure needs** | Processing capacity |
| **Consumer behavior** | Waste reduction difficult |

## Path Forward

Transforming waste management requires:

1. **Extended producer responsibility** shifting costs to producers
2. **Plastic reduction** through bans and alternatives
3. **Recycling infrastructure** investment
4. **Organic waste diversion** requirements
5. **Right to repair** extending product life
6. **Standardization** of recycling rules
7. **Environmental justice** in facility siting
8. **Circular economy** policy framework
