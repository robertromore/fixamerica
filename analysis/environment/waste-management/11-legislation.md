| **Chemical recycling counting** | Not true recycling | High |
| **Eco-modulation weakness** | Insufficient differentiation | Medium |
| **Enforcement gaps** | Limited resources | Medium |
| **Definition gaming** | Recyclable claims | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Market development** | End markets needed | Economics |

2. **Define recycling strictly** excluding chemical processes
3. **Strong eco-modulation** with meaningful fee differentials
4. **Adequate enforcement** funding tied to fees
5. **Clear definitions** of recyclable, compostable
6. **End market development** through procurement, content requirements
7. **Consumer education** standardized nationally
8. **Infrastructure investment** from producer fees
9. **Federal minimum standards** with state flexibility
10. **Environmental justice requirements** in all siting

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Industry opposition** | Coalition building |
| **Cost pass-through** | Phase-in, assistance |
