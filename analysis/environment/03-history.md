# Environment: History

## Origins of American Environmentalism

### Pre-Colonial and Indigenous Land Management

Indigenous peoples practiced sustainable land management for millennia before European colonization:

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Controlled burns** | Forest management, habitat creation, fire prevention |
| **Sustainable harvesting** | Long-term resource availability |
| **Seasonal migration** | Prevent resource depletion |
| **Sacred site protection** | Preserve ecologically important areas |

European colonization disrupted these practices and imposed extractive approaches to land use.

### Colonial Era to Early Republic (1600s-1850s)

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **Land as commodity** | Property rights oriented toward extraction |
| **Forest clearing** | Massive deforestation for agriculture, fuel, timber |
| **Wildlife exploitation** | Beaver, buffalo, passenger pigeon near extinction |
| **Mining expansion** | Gold Rush, coal mining environmental destruction |
| **No environmental law** | No concept of environmental regulation |

### Conservation Era (1850s-1920s)

**Key Figures**

| Figure | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| **Henry David Thoreau** | *Walden* (1854); nature as spiritual value |
| **George Perkins Marsh** | *Man and Nature* (1864); documented human environmental impact |
| **John Muir** | Sierra Club founder; wilderness preservation |
| **Gifford Pinchot** | First U.S. Forester; "wise use" conservation |
| **Theodore Roosevelt** | Conservation president; public lands expansion |

**Preservationism vs. Conservation Debate**

| Philosophy | Advocate | Approach |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Preservation** | John Muir | Protect nature for intrinsic value |
| **Conservation** | Gifford Pinchot | Manage resources for sustainable use |

This tension continues today.

**Key Developments**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1872 | Yellowstone National Park (first) |
| 1891 | Forest Reserve Act |
| 1903 | First wildlife refuge (Pelican Island) |
| 1905 | U.S. Forest Service created |
| 1906 | Antiquities Act |
| 1916 | National Park Service created |

## The Environmental Awakening (1960s-1970s)

### Catalysts for Modern Environmentalism

**Rachel Carson and *Silent Spring* (1962)**

Carson documented pesticide harms, especially DDT, sparking public concern about chemical contamination. Industry viciously attacked her; she was vindicated by science.

**Visible Pollution Crises**

| Event | Year | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Donora, PA smog** | 1948 | 20 deaths; early air pollution awareness |

| **Santa Barbara oil spill** | 1969 | Galvanized coastal protection movement |
| **Love Canal** | 1978 | Toxic waste; led to Superfund |

### The Environmental Decade (1970s)

**Political Context**

| **Endangered Species Act** | 1973 | Species protection; habitat conservation |
| **Safe Drinking Water Act** | 1974 | Drinking water standards |
| **Toxic Substances Control Act** | 1976 | Chemical regulation |
| **Resource Conservation and Recovery Act** | 1976 | Hazardous waste management |
| **Superfund (CERCLA)** | 1980 | Hazardous waste cleanup |

**First Earth Day (April 22, 1970)**

- 20 million Americans participated
- Largest single-day protest in American history to that point
- Demonstrated mass public support for environmental protection
- Directly led to creation of EPA and passage of Clean Air Act

## Lessons from the Past

### What Worked

| Factor | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Visible crisis** | River fires, smog, oil spills catalyzed action |
| **Scientific consensus** | Clear evidence enabled policy |
| **Bipartisan support** | 1970s environmental laws had broad backing |
| **Public mobilization** | Earth Day demonstrated mass support |
| **Strong enforcement** | 1970s laws had teeth |
| **Economic instruments** | Acid rain cap-and-trade succeeded |
| **International cooperation** | Montreal Protocol worked |

### What Failed

| Factor | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Industry disinformation** | Climate denial delayed action decades |
| **Partisan polarization** | Environmental issues became culture war |
| **Regulatory capture** | Agencies serving industry, not public |
| **Incrementalism** | Small steps inadequate for climate scale |
| **"Jobs vs. environment"** | False choice framing |
| **Voluntary approaches** | Industry self-regulation failed |

### Patterns to Note

1. **Crisis drives action**: Major legislation follows visible disasters
2. **Industry fights back**: Every environmental victory faces counterattack
3. **Gains can be reversed**: No environmental protection is permanent
4. **Local action can lead**: States often pioneer approaches adopted nationally
5. **Science is necessary but insufficient**: Political will required
6. **Environmental justice is afterthought**: Burden distribution rarely prioritized
7. **Time matters**: Climate delay makes problem harder and more expensive

### Historical Parallels

| Past Challenge | Approach | Lesson for Climate |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Ozone depletion** | Montreal Protocol; industry alternatives | International cooperation can work |
| **Acid rain** | Cap-and-trade | Market mechanisms can reduce pollution |
| **Lead in gasoline** | Phase-out despite industry opposition | Public health can triumph over industry |
| **Tobacco** | Science, litigation, regulation | Expose industry knowledge and deception |
| **DDT** | Ban after scientific evidence | Science can overcome industry resistance |

### What History Suggests About Climate

The historical record suggests climate action will require:

- A visible crisis (increasingly occurring)
- Sustained public mobilization
- Industry accountability (litigation, disclosure)
- Political realignment or crisis-driven bipartisanship
- Strong federal action backed by states
- International coordination
- Environmental justice integration from the start

The question is whether action will come in time.
