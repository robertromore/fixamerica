# Pollution: Overview

Pollution remains a persistent threat to public health and environmental quality in the United States despite decades of progress under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. Air pollution still causes over 100,000 premature deaths annually, and toxic contamination disproportionately burdens low-income communities and communities of color. Emerging pollutants like PFAS present new challenges, while climate change exacerbates traditional pollution problems. Comprehensive reform requires strengthening standards, improving enforcement, addressing environmental justice, and tackling emerging contaminants.
