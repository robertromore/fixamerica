## Constitutional Considerations

### Federal Authority

| Basis | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Commerce Clause** | Interstate pollution |
| **Spending** | Conditional grants |
| **Treaty** | International agreements |

### State Authority

| Basis | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Police power** | Public health |
| **State constitutions** | Environmental rights |
| **Concurrent** | Not preempted |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Essential use exemptions** | Broad interpretation | Medium |
| **Small facility exemptions** | Below thresholds | Medium |
| **Nonpoint exclusion** | CWA gaps | High |
| **Permitting discretion** | Inconsistent EJ | Medium |
| **Monitoring gaps** | Limited detection | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Enforcement capacity** | Violations unpunished | Resources |
| **State variation** | Uneven protection | Federalism |
| **Emerging pollutants** | Regulatory lag | Science pace |
| **Nonpoint sources** | Continued pollution | CWA structure |
| **International** | Pollution imports | Trade |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Narrow essential use definitions** with sunset provisions
2. **Lower thresholds** or eliminate small facility exemptions
3. **Comprehensive nonpoint** programs with mandatory elements
4. **Binding EJ requirements** in permitting
5. **Expanded monitoring** with community involvement
6. **Adequate enforcement funding** tied to permit fees
7. **Federal floor** with state authority to exceed
8. **Expedited emerging pollutant** process
9. **Nonpoint regulation** expansion
10. **Trade policy integration** for pollution standards

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Political durability** | Build coalition |
| **Litigation** | Strong legal foundation |
| **State cooperation** | Incentives, oversight |
| **Industry resistance** | Public support |
| **Technical capacity** | Training, assistance |
