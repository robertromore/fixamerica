# Pollution: Current State

## Overview

Despite significant progress since the 1970s, pollution remains a major public health and environmental challenge in the United States. Air quality has improved but still harms millions, water pollution persists especially from nonpoint sources, and emerging contaminants like PFAS present new challenges.

## Air Quality

| **PM10** | Limited non-attainment | Generally improving |
| **NO2** | Near attainment | Improving |
| **SO2** | Near attainment | Significantly improved |
| **CO** | At attainment | Improving |
| **Lead** | At attainment | Significantly improved |

### Health Impacts
