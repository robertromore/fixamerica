# Pollution: Root Causes

## Overview

Persistent pollution problems stem from economic incentives that externalize costs, regulatory limitations, political obstacles, and structural factors that concentrate harms on vulnerable communities. Understanding these root causes is essential for effective solutions.

## Economic Factors

### Externalities

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Unpriced pollution** | Costs borne by society |
| **Profit motive** | Minimize compliance costs |
| **Short-term focus** | Discount future harms |
| **Transaction costs** | Bargaining failures |
| **Public goods** | Underinvestment in protection |

### Market Structure

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Concentrated industry** | Political power |
| **Supply chain** | Distributed responsibility |
| **Competition** | Race to bottom |
| **Globalization** | Pollution haven effects |
| **Consumer demand** | Price sensitivity |

### Cost-Benefit Dynamics

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Compliance costs** | Industry opposition |
| **Health costs** | Externalized |
| **Cleanup costs** | Public burden |
| **Discount rates** | Undervalue future |

## Regulatory Limitations

### Statutory Gaps

| Gap | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **TSCA weakness** | Inadequate chemical testing |
| **Nonpoint sources** | Limited CWA coverage |
| **Emerging pollutants** | Slow regulatory response |
| **Cumulative impacts** | Single-pollutant focus |
| **Private wells** | Unregulated |

### Regulatory Process

| Limitation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Rulemaking pace** | Years to set standards |
| **Litigation** | Challenges delay rules |
| **Cost-benefit** | May undervalue health |
| **Science lag** | Standards behind knowledge |
| **Review delays** | Outdated standards |

### Enforcement Constraints

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Resource limits** | Insufficient inspections |
| **Burden of proof** | Difficult to prosecute |
| **State variation** | Uneven enforcement |
| **Penalty limits** | Insufficient deterrence |
| **Self-reporting** | Limited verification |

## Political Factors

### Industry Influence

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Lobbying** | Weaken standards |
| **Campaign contributions** | Political influence |
| **Revolving door** | Regulatory capture |
| **Information control** | Expertise advantage |
| **Litigation** | Challenge regulations |

### Political Institutions

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Federalism** | Patchwork protection |
| **Appropriations** | Funding constraints |
| **Appointments** | Agency leadership |
| **Judicial review** | Limits agency action |
| **Congress** | Legislative gridlock |

### Political Economy

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Job concerns** | Environmental blackmail |
| **Local politics** | NIMBY and PIBBY |
| **Media coverage** | Issue attention cycles |
| **Public salience** | Varies over time |

## Environmental Justice Factors

### Structural Racism

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Zoning history** | Industrial siting |
| **Housing segregation** | Community exposure |
| **Political power** | Less representation |
| **Economic marginalization** | Limited options |
| **Infrastructure** | Underinvestment |

### Decision-Making

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Siting processes** | Community exclusion |
| **Permit decisions** | Inadequate review |
| **Cumulative impacts** | Not considered |
| **Enforcement priorities** | Unequal attention |
| **Benefits distribution** | Inequitable |

### Compounding Factors

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Multiple exposures** | Cumulative burden |
| **Health disparities** | Greater vulnerability |
| **Limited mobility** | Can't move away |
| **Economic constraints** | Fewer alternatives |
| **Information access** | Knowledge gaps |

## Technical Factors

### Pollution Complexity

| Factor | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| **Nonpoint sources** | Diffuse, hard to control |
| **Chemical complexity** | Many substances |
| **Transformation** | Secondary pollutants |
| **Transport** | Cross-boundary |
| **Persistence** | Long-lived pollutants |

### Detection and Monitoring

| Factor | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| **Monitoring gaps** | Incomplete coverage |
| **Detection limits** | Low-level pollutants |
| **Emerging pollutants** | Unknown presence |
| **Attribution** | Source identification |
| **Real-time data** | Limited availability |

### Technology Limits

| Factor | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| **Control costs** | Economic constraints |
| **Technical feasibility** | Not always available |
| **Unintended consequences** | Trade-offs |
| **Legacy pollution** | Difficult remediation |

## Behavioral Factors

### Individual

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Consumption** | Demand for products |
| **Transportation** | Vehicle choices |
| **Awareness** | Limited knowledge |
| **Convenience** | Trade-offs |

### Organizational

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Corporate culture** | Compliance minimization |
| **Risk management** | Legal vs. environmental |
| **Supply chain** | Responsibility diffusion |
| **Incentives** | Profit over environment |

## Systemic Interactions

### Reinforcing Dynamics

| Dynamic | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Wealth → Power** | Industry influence |
| **Poverty → Exposure** | Vulnerable communities |
| **Weak enforcement → Violation** | Compliance incentives |
| **Low salience → Low priority** | Political attention |

### Climate Interactions

| Interaction | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **Wildfires** | Air quality degradation |
| **Extreme weather** | Contamination spread |
| **Temperature** | Pollution formation |
| **Sea level rise** | Coastal contamination |
