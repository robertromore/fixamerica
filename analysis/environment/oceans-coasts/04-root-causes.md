# Oceans and Coasts: Root Causes

## Overview

Ocean and coastal problems stem from interconnected global and local factors. Climate change driven by greenhouse gas emissions causes ocean warming, acidification, and sea level rise. Land-based pollution flows downstream to coasts and oceans. Fragmented governance fails to address the connected nature of marine systems. Economic pressures drive overfishing and coastal overdevelopment. Understanding these root causes is essential for effective solutions.

## Climate Change

### Greenhouse Gas Emissions

| Source | Ocean Impact |
|--------|--------------|
| **Fossil fuels** | Warming, acidification |
| **Deforestation** | Carbon release |
| **Industrial processes** | Multiple gases |
| **Agriculture** | Nitrous oxide, methane |

### Ocean-Climate Connection

| Impact | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Heat absorption** | Ocean absorbs 90%+ of excess heat |
| **Carbon absorption** | 30% of CO2, causes acidification |
| **Ice melt** | Thermal expansion + ice loss = sea rise |
| **Circulation changes** | Ecosystem disruption |

### Feedback Loops

| Feedback | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Ice-albedo** | Less ice, more warming |
| **Permafrost methane** | Additional warming |
| **Ocean carbon capacity** | Decreasing absorption |

## Marine Pollution

### Land-Based Sources

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Agricultural runoff** | Nutrient pollution, dead zones |
| **Urban runoff** | Toxics, trash, pathogens |
| **Wastewater** | Nutrients, pathogens |
| **Industrial discharge** | Chemicals, heavy metals |
| **Stormwater** | Multiple pollutants |

### Plastic Pollution

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Production growth** | Exponential increase |
| **Single-use culture** | Disposable products |
| **Waste management failure** | Inadequate systems |
| **Durability** | Persistence in environment |
| **Fragmentation** | Microplastics |

### Air-Sea Transfer

| Pollutant | Pathway |
|-----------|---------|
| **Mercury** | Atmospheric deposition |
| **Nitrogen** | Air pollution to water |
| **Plastic particles** | Atmospheric transport |

## Governance Failures

### Fragmentation

| Level | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| **Federal** | Multiple agencies, poor coordination |
| **State-federal** | Jurisdictional gaps |
| **International** | Commons governance challenge |
| **Regional** | Inconsistent approaches |

### Regulatory Gaps

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **High seas** | Limited governance |
| **Cumulative impacts** | Not addressed |
| **Emerging issues** | Slow response |
| **Enforcement** | Limited capacity |

### International Challenges

| Challenge | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **UNCLOS** | U.S. not party |
| **Flag state** | Enforcement difficulties |
| **Subsidies** | Overcapacity continues |
| **Climate** | Insufficient global action |

## Economic Pressures

### Fisheries

| Pressure | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Overcapacity** | Too many boats |
| **Subsidies** | Encourage overfishing |
| **Short-term focus** | Discount future value |
| **Illegal fishing** | Undermines management |

### Coastal Development

| Driver | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Property values** | Incentivize waterfront development |
| **Tourism** | Development pressure |
| **Population growth** | Coastal migration |
| **Insurance subsidies** | Encourage risk |

### Externalities

| Externality | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **Pollution costs** | Not borne by polluters |
| **Climate costs** | Socialized globally |
| **Ecosystem services** | Undervalued |
| **Future impacts** | Discounted |

## Coastal Vulnerability

### Development Patterns

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| **Coastal settlement** | 40% of population |
| **Infrastructure location** | Critical assets at risk |
| **Hardened shorelines** | Prevent natural adaptation |
| **Wetland loss** | Reduced natural protection |

### Risk Incentives

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Flood insurance** | Subsidizes risky locations |
| **Disaster relief** | Reduces individual risk |
| **Property values** | Ignore long-term risk |
| **Short-term politics** | Avoid difficult decisions |

## Knowledge Gaps

### Scientific Limitations

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **Ocean data** | Vast, undersampled |
| **Climate projections** | Uncertainty in specifics |
| **Ecosystem interactions** | Complex, poorly understood |
| **Cumulative impacts** | Difficult to assess |

### Management Information

| Gap | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| **Fish stock data** | Many species unassessed |
| **Pollution monitoring** | Incomplete |
| **Ecosystem baselines** | Shifting baselines |
| **Economic valuation** | Ecosystem services undervalued |
