# Oceans and Coasts: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's oceans and coasts face unprecedented challenges from climate change, pollution, overfishing, and coastal development. Rising seas threaten coastal communities, ocean acidification endangers marine ecosystems, plastic pollution accumulates in the marine environment, and fisheries struggle with sustainability. As a nation with vast ocean territory and coastlines, the United States has both significant vulnerabilities and substantial responsibilities for ocean health. Comprehensive reform requires addressing climate impacts, reducing pollution, ensuring sustainable fisheries, and protecting coastal communities while advancing marine conservation.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Ocean health**: Acidification, warming, deoxygenation
- **Marine ecosystems**: Fisheries, coral reefs, marine life
- **Coastal resilience**: Sea level rise, storms, flooding
- **Marine pollution**: Plastics, runoff, oil spills
- **Fisheries management**: Sustainability, regulation
- **Marine protected areas**: Conservation, blue economy
- **Coastal development**: Land use, infrastructure
- **Ocean governance**: International, domestic policy

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone | 3.4 million square miles |
| Coastal population | 40%+ of U.S. population |
| Economic activity | $373+ billion marine economy |
| Sea level rise (projected) | 1-4+ feet by 2100 |
| Ocean acidification | 30% increase since Industrial Revolution |
| Fisheries depleted/overfished | ~20% of assessed stocks |

## Core Problems

### Climate Impacts

| Impact | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ocean warming** | Ecosystem disruption, species shifts |
| **Sea level rise** | Coastal flooding, erosion |
| **Ocean acidification** | Shellfish, coral decline |
| **Deoxygenation** | Dead zones expanding |
| **Extreme storms** | Intensified hurricanes |

### Marine Pollution

| Source | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Plastic debris** | 8+ million tons enter annually |
| **Nutrient runoff** | Dead zones, algal blooms |
| **Chemical pollution** | Persistent toxins |
| **Oil pollution** | Spills, chronic discharge |
| **Noise pollution** | Marine mammal harm |

### Ecosystem Decline

| Ecosystem | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Coral reefs** | 70% threatened globally |
| **Fisheries** | Many overfished or at limit |
| **Coastal wetlands** | Significant loss |
| **Kelp forests** | Declining in many areas |
| **Marine mammals** | Multiple species threatened |

## Affected Communities

| Community | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Coastal residents** | Flooding, erosion, storms |
| **Fishing communities** | Livelihood threats |
| **Low-lying areas** | Existential sea level threat |
| **Indigenous communities** | Traditional resource access |
| **Environmental justice** | Pollution exposure |

## Historical Context

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-1970s** | Minimal ocean protection |
| **1972** | Coastal Zone Management Act |
| **1976** | Magnuson-Stevens Act |
| **1990s** | Marine Sanctuary expansion |
| **2000s** | Ocean policy attention |
| **2010** | BP oil spill |
| **2010s-present** | Climate impacts accelerate |

## Governance Structure

### Federal Agencies

| Agency | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **NOAA** | Ocean science, fisheries, coasts |
| **EPA** | Marine pollution |
| **Coast Guard** | Maritime safety, enforcement |
| **Interior** | Offshore energy, wildlife |
| **State Department** | International agreements |

### State Role

| Function | Authority |
|----------|-----------|
| **Coastal zone management** | State programs |
| **Fisheries** | State waters (0-3 miles) |
| **Land use** | Coastal development |
| **Environmental review** | State requirements |

### International

| Framework | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| **UNCLOS** | Law of the sea (U.S. not party) |
| **RFMOs** | Regional fisheries management |
| **IMO** | Shipping regulations |
| **Various treaties** | Species, pollution |

## Reform Landscape

### Current Initiatives

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **30x30** | Marine conservation target |
| **IRA investments** | Coastal resilience |
| **Fisheries reform** | Ongoing reauthorization |
| **Plastic pollution** | Growing attention |

### Key Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Climate acceleration** | Outpacing response |
| **Coordination** | Fragmented governance |
| **International** | Global action needed |
| **Funding** | Inadequate investment |
| **Political will** | Competing interests |

## Path Forward

Protecting oceans and coasts requires:

1. **Climate mitigation** reducing ocean impacts
2. **Marine conservation** expanding protected areas
3. **Pollution reduction** especially plastics
4. **Sustainable fisheries** science-based management
5. **Coastal resilience** adaptation investment
6. **International cooperation** global challenges
7. **Ocean science** expanded research
8. **Blue economy** sustainable development
