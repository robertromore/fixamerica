# Oceans and Coasts: History

## Overview

American ocean and coastal policy evolved from early resource exploitation through environmental awakening to contemporary challenges of climate adaptation. Early policies focused on fisheries access and maritime commerce, environmental laws of the 1970s addressed pollution and coastal management, and recent decades have grappled with climate change and global ocean challenges.

## Early Development (Pre-1970)

### Maritime Expansion
