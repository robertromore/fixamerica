# Oceans and Coasts: Current State

## Overview

America's oceans and coasts are under increasing stress from climate change, pollution, and human activity. Ocean temperatures and acidity are rising, sea levels are climbing, marine ecosystems are declining, and coastal communities face growing threats. While some fisheries have recovered and marine protected areas have expanded, overall ocean health continues to deteriorate.
