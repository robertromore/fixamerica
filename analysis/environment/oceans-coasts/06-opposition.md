# Oceans and Coasts: Opposition

## Overview

Ocean and coastal reforms face opposition from industries dependent on resource extraction, coastal development interests, and those skeptical of climate science. Fishing groups oppose catch limits, offshore energy resists new restrictions, coastal developers resist building limitations, and climate deniers obstruct adaptation measures. Understanding opposition dynamics is essential for developing effective strategies.
