# Oceans and Coasts: Overview

America's oceans and coasts face unprecedented challenges from climate change, pollution, overfishing, and coastal development. Rising seas threaten coastal communities, ocean acidification endangers marine ecosystems, plastic pollution accumulates in the marine environment, and fisheries struggle with sustainability. As a nation with vast ocean territory and coastlines, the United States has both significant vulnerabilities and substantial responsibilities for ocean health. Comprehensive reform requires addressing climate impacts, reducing pollution, ensuring sustainable fisheries, and protecting coastal communities while advancing marine conservation.
