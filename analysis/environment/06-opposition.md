## Summary: Defeating Opposition

Success requires:

1. **Building superior power** through coalition, mobilization, electoral
2. **Exposing deception** with documentation, publicity, accountability
3. **Changing the narrative** from jobs vs. environment to health, economy, justice
4. **Legal pressure** through litigation, enforcement, disclosure
5. **Dividing opponents** by exploiting internal contradictions
6. **State momentum** demonstrating alternatives work

The opposition is powerful but vulnerable. Their economic model is failing, their claims are false, and their political coalition is aging. The question is whether pro-environment forces can translate these advantages into policy change fast enough.
