# Environmental Justice: Root Causes

## Overview

Environmental injustice results from intersecting historical, economic, political, and institutional factors. Racial segregation created vulnerable communities, economic systems externalize costs onto the powerless, political structures amplify industry influence, and regulatory frameworks ignore cumulative burdens. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective solutions.

## Historical Racism and Segregation

### Spatial Segregation

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Redlining** | Concentrated minorities in undesirable areas |
| **Restrictive covenants** | Excluded minorities from better neighborhoods |
| **White flight** | Left minorities in industrializing areas |
| **Urban renewal** | Highways through minority neighborhoods |
| **Zoning** | Industrial zoning in minority areas |

### Wealth Extraction

| Pattern | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Property value depression** | Pollution reduces wealth accumulation |
| **Disinvestment** | Less maintenance, services |
| **Tax base erosion** | Fewer resources for protection |
| **Predatory practices** | Exploitation of vulnerability |

### Legacy Contamination

| Source | Ongoing Impact |
|--------|----------------|
| **Former industrial sites** | Brownfields in minority areas |
| **Lead paint** | Concentrated in older housing |
| **Aging infrastructure** | Lead pipes, sewage overflows |
| **Mine sites** | Native American lands contaminated |

## Economic Factors

### Cost Externalization

| Dynamic | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Pollution as cost savings** | Industry profits, communities bear costs |
| **Property values** | Polluters seek cheap land |
| **Political power** | Wealthy areas resist facilities |
| **Market logic** | Least resistance siting |

### Land Use Economics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Zoning decisions** | Industrial zones in poor areas |
| **Property values** | Low values attract polluters |
| **Economic development** | Jobs vs. health tradeoffs |
| **Tax incentives** | Attracting industry regardless of impact |

### Labor Market Dynamics

| Pattern | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Job dependency** | Communities fear losing employers |
| **Union weakness** | Less worker protection |
| **Immigrant labor** | Exploitation, fear of reporting |
| **Occupational exposure** | Added burden for workers |

## Political Structure

### Power Imbalance

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Wealth inequality** | Political influence disparity |
| **Campaign contributions** | Industry influence on officials |
| **Lobbying** | Industry access to decision-makers |
| **Voter suppression** | Reduced community voice |

### Decision-Making Exclusion

| Level | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| **Permitting** | Technical barriers, limited participation |
| **Planning** | Communities often excluded |
| **Enforcement** | No formal community role |
| **Rule-making** | Industry dominates comments |

### Federalism Challenges

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **State primacy** | Variable commitment to EJ |
| **Local control** | Zoning decisions often discriminatory |
| **Federal limits** | Can't mandate local action |
| **Race to bottom** | States compete for industry |

## Regulatory Failures

### Permitting Framework

| Flaw | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Single-source focus** | Ignores cumulative impacts |
| **Technical standards** | Doesn't consider community health |
| **Renewal automatic** | Limited review of existing permits |
| **Public participation** | Comment period inadequate |

### Enforcement Disparities

| Pattern | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| **Lower inspections** | Resource allocation bias |
| **Smaller penalties** | Less political pressure |
| **Slower cleanup** | Priority-setting bias |
| **Complaint dismissal** | Community concerns devalued |

### Standard-Setting

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Average exposure** | Ignores hotspots |
| **Single pollutant** | Misses interactions |
| **Adult focus** | Children more vulnerable |
| **Monitoring gaps** | Less data in poor areas |

## Institutional Factors

### Agency Culture

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Technical orientation** | Social factors ignored |
| **Industry relationships** | Regulatory capture risk |
| **Staff demographics** | Limited diversity historically |
| **Career incentives** | Not rewarded for EJ focus |

### Scientific Limitations

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **Cumulative effects** | Not well-studied |
| **Monitoring** | Less data in EJ communities |
| **Health studies** | Causation difficult to prove |
| **Community science** | Often not recognized |

### Legal Framework

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Sandoval decision** | No private Title VI suits |
| **Intent requirement** | Disparate impact insufficient |
| **Standing** | Difficult to establish |
| **Preemption** | Federal law limits state action |

## Continuing Patterns

### New Facility Siting

| Dynamic | Persistence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Path dependency** | Industrial areas expand |
| **NIMBY** | Wealthy areas resist |
| **Community opposition capacity** | Resource-dependent |
| **Economic incentives** | Location near existing industry |

### Climate and Energy Transition

| Issue | Concern |
|-------|---------|
| **Renewable siting** | New facilities in EJ areas |
| **Electric vehicle infrastructure** | Equitable access uncertain |
| **Clean energy jobs** | Access for affected workers |
| **Climate adaptation** | Investment disparities |

### Gentrification Dynamics

| Pattern | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Green gentrification** | Environmental improvements displace residents |
| **Investment benefits** | May not reach original residents |
| **Housing costs** | Rise with environmental quality |
| **Community voice** | Original residents displaced |

## Root Cause Categories

### Structural Racism

| Element | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Historical** | Segregation created vulnerability |
| **Economic** | Wealth inequality continues |
| **Political** | Power imbalance persists |
| **Institutional** | Agency practices perpetuate |

### Market Failures

| Failure | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Externalities** | Pollution costs not internalized |
| **Information** | Communities lack data |
| **Power asymmetry** | Industry dominates markets |
| **Public goods** | Environmental quality underprovided |

### Governance Failures

| Failure | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Regulatory design** | Ignores cumulative impacts |
| **Enforcement** | Disparate application |
| **Participation** | Meaningful input lacking |
| **Accountability** | Limited consequences |

### Knowledge Gaps

| Gap | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| **Data** | Monitoring disparities |
| **Research** | Cumulative effects understudied |
| **Recognition** | Traditional knowledge ignored |
| **Communication** | Technical information inaccessible |
