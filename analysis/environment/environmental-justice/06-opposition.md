# Environmental Justice: Opposition

## Overview

Environmental justice reforms face opposition from industry groups, some political actors, and those who benefit from existing systems. Opposition ranges from outright denial of environmental racism to procedural objections about regulatory burden. Understanding opposition arguments and tactics is essential for developing effective strategies.
