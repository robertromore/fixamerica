# Environmental Justice: Current State

## Overview

Environmental justice in America remains largely unrealized despite three decades of federal policy. Communities of color and low-income neighborhoods continue to bear disproportionate pollution burdens, face weaker enforcement, receive less investment, and have limited voice in decisions affecting their health and environment. Recent federal initiatives show promise but have not yet reversed entrenched patterns.

## Pollution Disparities

### Air Quality

| Pollutant | Disparity |
|-----------|-----------|
| **PM2.5** | 21% higher exposure for minorities |
| **NO2** | 17% higher for below poverty line |
| **SO2** | Concentrated near industrial areas |
| **Ozone** | Lower-income areas more affected |
| **Toxic air releases** | Higher near minority communities |

### Facility Siting

| Facility Type | Disparity |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Hazardous waste facilities** | 2x more likely near minorities |
| **Chemical plants** | Concentrated in "sacrifice zones" |
| **Refineries** | Gulf Coast communities heavily burdened |
| **Incinerators** | Disproportionately in low-income areas |
| **Power plants** | Older, dirtier plants in poor areas |

### Water Contamination

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Lead pipes** | Concentrated in older, minority neighborhoods |
| **Industrial discharge** | Near low-income communities |
| **PFAS contamination** | Near military bases, affecting diverse communities |
| **Agricultural runoff** | Rural communities, farmworker areas |
| **Drinking water violations** | Higher in disadvantaged areas |

## Health Outcomes

### Disease Burden

| Condition | Disparity |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Asthma** | 3x higher in Black children |
| **Cancer clusters** | Near industrial facilities |
| **Developmental impacts** | Lead exposure concentrated |
| **Respiratory disease** | Higher near highways, industry |
| **Heat-related illness** | 3x higher in low-income areas |

### Cumulative Impacts

| Factor | Compounding Effect |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Multiple pollution sources** | Synergistic health effects |
| **Healthcare access** | Limited in affected communities |
| **Occupational exposure** | Additional burden on workers |
| **Housing quality** | Indoor air quality issues |
| **Food access** | Nutrition affects vulnerability |

## Climate Vulnerability

### Exposure

| Hazard | Disparity |
|--------|-----------|
| **Extreme heat** | Urban heat islands in poor areas |
| **Flooding** | Low-lying areas often low-income |
| **Sea level rise** | Coastal communities affected |
| **Wildfire smoke** | Outdoor workers most exposed |
| **Hurricane impacts** | Slower recovery in poor areas |

### Adaptation Gaps

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **Green space** | Less cooling vegetation |
| **Infrastructure** | Aging systems in poor areas |
| **Emergency services** | Slower response |
| **Insurance** | Less coverage |
| **Relocation** | Fewer options for displacement |

## Regulatory Landscape

### Federal Framework

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Executive Order 12898 (1994)** | Limited enforcement historically |
| **EPA Office of Environmental Justice** | Enhanced under Biden |
| **Title VI enforcement** | Historically weak |
| **NEPA environmental justice** | Inconsistent application |
| **Permitting requirements** | No cumulative impact mandate |

### Justice40 Initiative

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Coverage** | 40% of benefits to disadvantaged |
| **Screening tool** | CEJST available |
| **Agency implementation** | Varies by agency |
| **Monitoring** | Developing |
| **Funding** | Significant through IRA/BIL |

### State Programs

| State | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| **California** | Cumulative impact requirements, AB 617 |
| **New Jersey** | Overburdened community protections |
| **New York** | Environmental justice screening |
| **Massachusetts** | EJ policy, enhanced review |
| **Most states** | Limited or no requirements |

## Enforcement Disparities

### EPA Enforcement

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Inspection frequency** | Lower in minority areas |
| **Penalty amounts** | Often lower for violations affecting minorities |
| **Cleanup timeline** | Slower at sites near minorities |
| **Complaint response** | Less thorough in disadvantaged areas |
| **Criminal referrals** | Rare for environmental racism cases |

### State Enforcement

| Pattern | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Variable commitment** | Wide state-by-state variation |
| **Resource constraints** | Limited capacity |
| **Industry influence** | Permitting favoritism |
| **Community complaints** | Often dismissed |

## Community Participation

### Barriers

| Barrier | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Language access** | Limited translation services |
| **Meeting timing** | During work hours |
| **Technical complexity** | Inaccessible information |
| **Power imbalance** | Industry resources dominant |
| **Retaliation fear** | Job concerns, immigration status |

### Participation Gaps

| Process | Community Role |
|---------|----------------|
| **Permitting** | Comment period only |
| **Planning** | Often excluded |
| **Enforcement** | No formal role |
| **Remediation** | Limited input on cleanup |
| **Monitoring** | Community science undervalued |

## Investment Patterns

### Infrastructure

| System | Disparity |
|--------|-----------|
| **Water systems** | Less investment in poor areas |
| **Sewage** | Older systems in minority areas |
| **Stormwater** | Less flood control |
| **Transit** | Service gaps in EJ communities |
| **Green space** | Parks funding disparities |

### Federal Funding

| Program | EJ Focus |
|---------|----------|
| **IRA clean energy** | Justice40 requirements |
| **Bipartisan Infrastructure Law** | Some EJ provisions |
| **Superfund** | Cleanup priority questions |
| **State revolving funds** | Variable EJ targeting |

## Emerging Issues

### Issues

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Renewable energy siting** | New facilities in EJ communities |
| **Electric vehicle infrastructure** | Equitable access concerns |
| **Climate adaptation** | Who benefits from investment |
| **Pollution trading** | Hotspot concerns |
| **Green gentrification** | Displacement from improvements |

## Key Metrics

| Indicator | Current Status |
|-----------|----------------|
