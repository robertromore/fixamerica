# Environmental Justice: History

## Overview

The environmental justice movement emerged from the convergence of civil rights activism and environmental concern in the 1980s. While environmental racism has existed since the nation's founding, organized resistance and formal policy recognition developed over recent decades. Understanding this history reveals both progress achieved and persistent challenges.

## Pre-Movement Era (Before 1980)
