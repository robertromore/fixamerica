| **Environmental** | State environmental programs |
| **Local government** | Delegation to localities |

### Civil Rights Framework

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Disparate impact** | Congressional power to authorize |
| **Intent requirement** | Equal protection doctrine |
| **Private action** | Congressional authority |
| **Standing** | Injury, causation, redressability |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|

### Rectification Procedures

4. **Prevention priority** over mitigation offsets
5. **Monitoring mandate** with community science recognition
6. **Remove economic exemptions** for public health protection
7. **Adequate enforcement funding** tied to permit fees
8. **Sustained technical assistance** for community participation
9. **Private right of action** restoration for civil rights

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Political reversal** | Statutory protection |
