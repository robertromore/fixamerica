# Environmental Justice: Overview

## Executive Summary

Environmental justice addresses the disproportionate environmental burdens borne by low-income communities and communities of color. These populations face higher exposure to pollution, toxic facilities, and climate impacts while receiving fewer environmental protections and benefits. Despite decades of executive orders and advocacy, environmental racism persists across virtually every metric—from air quality to hazardous waste siting to flood vulnerability. Achieving environmental justice requires fundamental changes to permitting, enforcement, investment, and decision-making processes.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Distributional justice**: Unequal environmental burdens
- **Procedural justice**: Meaningful participation in decisions
- **Recognition justice**: Acknowledging affected communities
- **Restorative justice**: Remedying past harms
- **Climate justice**: Equitable climate impacts and solutions
- **Cumulative impacts**: Multiple, overlapping burdens
- **Federal, state, and local dimensions**

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| People living in cancer risk zones | 71% are people of color |
| Proximity to hazardous waste | 2x higher for minorities |
| Air pollution exposure | 28% higher for Black Americans |
| Flood zone residents | 74% more likely to be low-income |
| Superfund sites near schools | 1 in 4 schools within 0.5 miles |
| Heat-related illness | 3x higher in low-income areas |

## Core Problems

### Disproportionate Burden

| Burden | Disparity |
|--------|-----------|
| **Air pollution** | 21% higher PM2.5 for minorities |
| **Toxic facilities** | Concentrated in minority communities |
| **Lead exposure** | 5x higher for Black children |
| **Contaminated sites** | Slower cleanup in poor areas |
| **Climate impacts** | Greater vulnerability |
| **Industrial siting** | Pattern of discrimination |

### Systemic Failures

| Failure | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Permitting** | Ignores cumulative impacts |
| **Enforcement** | Weaker in minority areas |
| **Investment** | Less infrastructure funding |
| **Participation** | Limited community voice |
| **Science** | Data gaps in affected areas |

## Affected Populations

| Population | Burden |
|------------|--------|
| **Low-income communities** | Multiple exposures |
| **Black communities** | Air pollution, lead, flooding |
| **Latino communities** | Pesticides, industrial facilities |
| **Native American communities** | Extraction, contamination |
| **Asian American communities** | Specific regional impacts |
| **Immigrant communities** | Fear of reporting, exploitation |

## Historical Context

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-1960s** | Segregation creates vulnerability |
| **1960s-1970s** | Environmental laws enacted |
| **1982** | Warren County protests |
| **1991** | First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit |
| **1994** | Executive Order 12898 |
| **2000s-2010s** | Limited enforcement |
| **2021** | Justice40 initiative |
| **2023-present** | Expanded federal focus |

## Reform Landscape

### Current Initiatives

| Initiative | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Justice40** | 40% of benefits to disadvantaged |
| **EPA environmental justice office** | Enhanced authority |
| **EJScreen** | Screening tool available |
| **IRA investments** | Significant new funding |
| **State programs** | California leading |

### Key Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Cumulative impacts** | No federal requirement |
| **Permitting** | Limited community role |
| **Enforcement disparity** | Persistent gaps |
| **Data limitations** | Incomplete monitoring |
| **Political opposition** | Industry resistance |

## Stakeholder Landscape

| Stakeholder | Position |
|-------------|----------|
| **EJ communities** | Demand meaningful protection |
| **EJ organizations** | Advocacy, litigation |
| **Industry** | Resist additional requirements |
| **Regulators** | Varying commitment |
| **States** | Wide variation |
| **Environmental groups** | Generally supportive |

## Path Forward

Achieving environmental justice requires:

1. **Cumulative impact requirements** in permitting
2. **Enforcement equity** with measurable goals
3. **Community participation** in all decisions
4. **Targeted investment** in overburdened areas
5. **Data collection** on disparities
6. **Legal tools** for affected communities
7. **Climate justice** integration
8. **Remediation** of historical harms
