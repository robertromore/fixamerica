# Environment: Overview

The United States faces an environmental crisis spanning climate change, air and water pollution, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion. Despite having the scientific knowledge and technological capability to address these challenges, America has largely failed to act at the scale and speed required. The U.S. remains the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, responsible for the largest cumulative historical emissions. Environmental burdens fall disproportionately on low-income communities and communities of color. Market failures, political obstruction, regulatory capture, and short-term thinking have prevented the systemic changes needed to protect public health, ecosystems, and future generations.
