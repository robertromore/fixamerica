Conservation Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) habitat fragmentation threatens wildlife;
    (2) climate change requires species to move;
    (3) connectivity is essential for viable populations;

## Constitutional Considerations

### Federal Authority

| **Spending** | Conservation programs |

### State Authority

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| **Economic exclusion** | Critical habitat limits | High |
| **Delisting pressure** | Political interference | Medium |
| **Enforcement gaps** | Limited resources | Medium |
| **Private land** | Voluntary only | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Funding** | Inadequate implementation | Appropriations |
| **Climate integration** | Slow adaptation | Science, policy |
| **Connectivity** | Fragmentation continues | Land use |
| **Political interference** | Science compromised | Partisanship |
| **Private land gaps** | Incomplete protection | Property rights |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen consultation requirements** limiting exemptions
2. **Narrow economic exclusion** with science basis
3. **Insulate listing decisions** from political interference
4. **Adequate enforcement funding** tied to listings
5. **Expand private land incentives** with mandatory elements
6. **Dedicated funding sources** outside appropriations
7. **Climate mandate** in all conservation decisions
8. **Corridor protection** requirements
9. **Science-based decisions** with judicial review
10. **Performance metrics** with accountability

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Political reversal** | Durable statutory protection |
| **Funding adequacy** | Dedicated sources |
| **State cooperation** | Incentives, partnership |
| **Climate uncertainty** | Adaptive management |
| **Private land** | Voluntary with incentives |
