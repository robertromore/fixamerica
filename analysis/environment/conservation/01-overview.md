# Conservation: Overview

## Executive Summary

Conservation of America's natural heritage—public lands, wildlife, biodiversity, and ecosystems—faces mounting pressures from development, climate change, and inadequate funding. The United States manages one of the world's largest public land systems but struggles to balance conservation with resource extraction, recreation, and development. Biodiversity loss accelerates as habitats fragment, invasive species spread, and climate change disrupts ecosystems. Effective conservation requires expanded protections, adequate funding, science-based management, and addressing climate change as an existential threat to natural systems.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Public lands** (federal, state, local)
- **Wildlife and biodiversity** conservation
- **Endangered species** protection
- **National parks and monuments**
- **Wilderness and wild lands**
- **Ecosystem restoration**
- **Conservation funding**
- **Private land conservation**
