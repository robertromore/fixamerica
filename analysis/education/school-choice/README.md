# School Choice: Overview

School choice encompasses a range of mechanisms that allow families to select educational options beyond their assigned neighborhood public school. These include charter schools, voucher programs, education savings accounts (ESAs), magnet schools, open enrollment policies, and virtual schools. Proponents argue that choice introduces competition, innovation, and parental empowerment into a rigid system. Critics contend that choice mechanisms drain resources from traditional public schools, increase segregation, and provide insufficient accountability while benefiting private and for-profit interests.
