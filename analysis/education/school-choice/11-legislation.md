# School Choice: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

School choice policy is primarily governed by state law, with federal law playing a supporting role through funding programs, civil rights requirements, and constitutional interpretation. This document provides model legislation addressing accountability gaps, segregation concerns, and funding issues while respecting existing constitutional constraints.

## Constitutional Framework

### Federal Constitutional Provisions

| Provision | Application to School Choice |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Establishment Clause | Cannot advance religion, but neutral programs allowed (*Zelman*) |
| Free Exercise Clause | Cannot exclude religious schools from neutral programs (*Espinoza*, *Carson*) |
| Equal Protection | Applies to all public action; discrimination prohibited |
| Due Process | Procedural protections for students, schools |

### Key Supreme Court Decisions

| Case | Year | Holding | Impact |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| *Zelman v. Simmons-Harris* | 2002 | Vouchers to religious schools constitutional if neutral | Enabled religious school vouchers |
| *Espinoza v. Montana* | 2020 | Cannot exclude religious schools from scholarship programs | Weakened Blaine Amendments |
| *Carson v. Makin* | 2022 | Must include religious schools in tuition programs | Extended *Espinoza* |
| *Davey v. Locke* | 2004 | May exclude devotional training from scholarships | Limited carve-out |

### State Constitutional Provisions

| Provision Type | Effect | Status Post-*Espinoza* |
|----------------|--------|------------------------|
| Blaine Amendments | Prohibited aid to religious schools | Significantly weakened |
| Education clauses | Require "thorough and efficient" education | Still applicable |
| Compelled support clauses | Prohibit forced religious support | Unclear application |
| Uniformity clauses | Require uniform system | May limit choice |

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4**: Requires testing so parents can compare school quality
- **Section 5**: Extends civil rights protections while accommodating religious schools
- **Section 6**: Ensures taxpayers know how funds are used
- **Section 7**: Protects special education students from losing IDEA rights
- **Section 8**: Creates meaningful enforcement through funding leverage

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| State sovereignty | Conditions on federal funds are constitutional (*South Dakota v. Dole*) |

**Equal Protection**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Funding conditions | Withhold funds for non-compliance |
| Civil litigation | Enforce civil rights provisions |
| Administrative action | License revocation, probation |
