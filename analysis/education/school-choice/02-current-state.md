# School Choice: Current State

## The Problem Today

### A Fragmented Landscape

American education has evolved from a system of geographically assigned public schools to an increasingly complex marketplace of options. This transformation has occurred unevenly across states and communities, creating a patchwork of policies that vary dramatically in scope, accountability, and effect.

The fundamental challenge is that school choice policies have expanded rapidly—often driven by ideological commitment and political opportunity—while evidence about their effects remains contested and accountability mechanisms remain underdeveloped. Families face a confusing array of options with inadequate information, school districts struggle with enrollment volatility and funding unpredictability, and the public interest in quality education for all students is increasingly difficult to define or protect.

### The Scale of Choice

| Sector | Number of Schools | Students Enrolled | Share of K-12 |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Traditional public | 91,000 | 45.4 million | 82% |
| Charter schools | 7,800 | 3.7 million | 7% |
| Private (voucher-eligible) | 5,000+ | 900,000+ (voucher) | 2% (voucher) |
| Private (total) | 30,000 | 5.7 million | 10% |
| Full-time virtual | 500+ | 500,000+ | 1% |
