# School Choice: Opposition

## Overview

Opposition to school choice comes from diverse quarters: teacher unions concerned about jobs and working conditions, civil rights advocates worried about segregation, public school defenders focused on democratic accountability, fiscal conservatives alarmed by program costs, and local communities fighting to preserve neighborhood schools.

## Key Arguments Against Choice

### Academic Performance

**Evidence Summary**

|--------------|------------------|
| Vouchers | Louisiana: -0.4 SD math; Indiana: -0.15 SD math; DC: null |
| Charters (average) | Near zero effect nationally |
| Virtual schools | Consistently negative outcomes |
| ESAs | Limited research; concerning early results |

**Critique of Positive Studies**

| Study Type | Critique |
|------------|----------|
| Parent satisfaction | Doesn't measure learning |
| Graduation rates | Selection effects; different standards |
| College enrollment | Short-term effect; may fade |
| High-performing networks | Not representative; cream-skimming |

### Accountability Gaps

**Comparative Accountability**

| Requirement | TPS | Charter | Voucher |
|-------------|-----|---------|---------|
| State testing | Yes | Usually | Often no |
| Public meetings | Yes | Sometimes | No |
| Public records | Yes | Sometimes | No |
| Financial audits | Annual | Usually | Varies |
| Teacher certification | Yes | Sometimes | No |
| Background checks | Yes | Yes | Usually |
| Board elections | Yes | No | No |
| Performance consequences | Yes | Sometimes | Rarely |

**Fraud and Abuse Examples**

| Case | Type | Amount | Location |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| ECOT | Virtual charter | $80 million | Ohio |
| Concept Schools | Network | $40 million | Multiple |
| Various | Voucher schools | Millions | Multiple states |
| A3 Education | Management | $5 million | Michigan |

### Segregation Effects

**Research Summary**

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Frankenberg et al. (2011) | 70% of Black charter students in 90%+ minority schools |
| Reardon & Yun (2002) | Charters more racially isolated than TPS |
| Bifulco & Ladd (2007) | Durham charters increased segregation |
| GAO (2016) | 16% of charters were high-poverty, high-minority |
| Jacobs (2013) | Milwaukee vouchers increased white-minority isolation |

**Mechanisms**

| Mechanism | How It Increases Segregation |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Location | Schools open in segregated neighborhoods |
| Marketing | Target specific demographic groups |
| Transportation | No busing excludes distant families |
| Curriculum focus | Theme schools attract homogeneous groups |
| Application barriers | Complex processes screen out less-resourced |
| Counseling out | Informal exclusion of challenging students |

### Funding Diversion

**The Math of Per-Pupil Funding**

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Student leaves for choice school | ~90% of funding follows |
| Fixed costs remain | Buildings, admin, debt, transportation |
| Variable costs slow to adjust | Teacher contracts, program commitments |
| Result | District loses more revenue than cost savings |

**District Fiscal Impacts**

| City | Enrollment Loss | Estimated Annual Impact |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Philadelphia | 70,000 to charters | -$900 million |
| Detroit | 50% to charters | -$500 million |
| Cleveland | 30,000 to charters/vouchers | -$300 million |
| Milwaukee | 40,000 to vouchers/charters | -$400 million |
