# School Choice: History

## Origins

### The Intellectual Foundation (1950s-1960s)

The modern school choice movement traces its intellectual origins to economist Milton Friedman's 1955 essay "The Role of Government in Education." Friedman argued that government should fund education but not necessarily provide it directly. He proposed vouchers—government-funded scholarships that parents could use at any approved school, public or private.

Friedman's core arguments:

- **Competition improves quality**: Schools competing for students would innovate and improve
- **Parental sovereignty**: Parents, not bureaucrats, should decide where children attend school
- **Efficiency**: Market mechanisms would reduce waste and improve resource allocation
- **Pluralism**: Different schools could reflect different values and approaches

Friedman's ideas remained largely academic for decades, though they influenced conservative thinking about education policy.

### The Segregation Academy Era (1950s-1970s)

The other strand of early "school choice" was explicitly tied to resistance to desegregation. Following *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954), Southern states created mechanisms to avoid integration:

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Tuition grants | Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana provided public funds for private school tuition |
| School closures | Prince Edward County, VA closed public schools entirely (1959-1964) |
| "Freedom of choice" | Theoretically open enrollment that maintained segregation through social pressure |
| Private academy growth | Hundreds of "segregation academies" founded 1954-1975 |

**Key Legal Developments**

| Case | Year | Outcome |
|------|------|---------|
| *Griffin v. County School Board* | 1964 | Virginia tuition grants unconstitutional |
| *Green v. County School Board* | 1968 | "Freedom of choice" insufficient for desegregation |
| *Runyon v. McCrary* | 1976 | Private schools cannot discriminate on race (42 U.S.C. 1981) |

This history created lasting suspicion of "school choice" as a mechanism for segregation—suspicion that persists in policy debates today.

### Magnet Schools as Integration Tool (1970s-1980s)

A different form of choice emerged from court-ordered desegregation: magnet schools designed to attract diverse student bodies voluntarily.

**Key Developments**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1968 | First magnet school: McCarver Elementary (Tacoma, WA) |
| 1975 | Magnet Schools Assistance Program created |
| 1976 | Boston court order creates magnet schools |
| 1980s | Houston, Cincinnati, St. Louis develop extensive magnet programs |

**Magnet School Design Principles**

| Principle | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Specialized curriculum | Attract families across neighborhood lines |
| Diversity requirements | Ensure integration, often through controlled choice |
| Quality investment | Higher funding to attract families from higher-income areas |
| Transportation | Busing to enable diverse enrollment |

## Key Turning Points

### Milwaukee Voucher Program (1990)

The first modern voucher program emerged from an unlikely alliance between Black Democrats and conservative Republicans in Wisconsin.

**Key Actors**

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| Polly Williams | Black Democratic legislator; primary sponsor |
| Tommy Thompson | Republican Governor; signed into law |
| Howard Fuller | Milwaukee superintendent; advocate |
| Clint Bolick | Conservative lawyer; legal defender |

**Program Design**

| Feature | Original Design (1990) |
|---------|----------------------|
| Eligibility | Low-income Milwaukee families |
| Schools | Secular private only |
| Funding | $2,500 per student |
| Enrollment cap | 1% of Milwaukee Public Schools enrollment |
| Accountability | Minimal |

**Evolution**

| Year | Change |
|------|--------|
| 1995 | Expanded to religious schools (after court challenge) |
| 1998 | Enrollment cap raised |
| 2006 | Cap increased to 22,500 students |
| 2011 | Expanded statewide for low-income families |
| 2024 | 30,000+ students in Milwaukee alone |

### Charter School Movement Launch (1991-1992)

Minnesota passed the first charter school law in 1991, creating a new category of public school.

**Key Actors**

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| Ted Kolderie | Policy analyst; intellectual architect |
| Joe Nathan | Educator; advocate |
| Ember Reichgott Junge | State Senator; primary sponsor |
| Al Shanker | AFT President; early (later withdrawn) supporter |

**Original Charter Concept**

| Feature | Intent |
|---------|--------|
| Autonomy | Freedom from district regulations |
| Accountability | Performance contracts with measurable goals |
| Innovation | Laboratory for new approaches |
| Choice | Parents choose; schools must attract students |
| Public | Publicly funded, open enrollment, no tuition |

**Rapid Spread**

| Year | States with Charter Laws |
|------|-------------------------|
| 1991 | 1 (Minnesota) |
| 1995 | 19 |
| 2000 | 37 |
| 2005 | 40 |
| 2010 | 41 |
| 2024 | 44 + DC |

### Court Decisions Enabling Religious School Funding (2000s-2020s)

A series of Supreme Court decisions gradually opened the door to public funding of religious schools.

| Case | Year | Holding |
|------|------|---------|
| *Agostini v. Felton* | 1997 | Public employees can provide services in religious schools |
| *Zelman v. Simmons-Harris* | 2002 | Vouchers to religious schools constitutional if program is neutral |
| *Espinoza v. Montana* | 2020 | States cannot exclude religious schools from neutral aid programs |
| *Carson v. Makin* | 2022 | Maine must include religious schools in rural tuition program |

**Implications**

The *Zelman* decision (2002) was the most significant, holding that Cleveland's voucher program did not violate the Establishment Clause because:

- Program was neutral toward religion
- Aid flowed through parental choice
- Religious schools were among many options
- Program had secular purpose

This opened the floodgates for voucher program expansion.

### Race to the Top and Charter Acceleration (2009-2016)

The Obama administration's Race to the Top program incentivized charter school expansion.

**Race to the Top Requirements**

| Requirement | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Lift charter caps | States removed limits to compete for funds |
| Charter-friendly laws | Authorization and funding reforms |
| Data systems | Comparable data across sectors |
| Turnaround options | Charters as intervention for failing schools |

**Resulting Growth**

| Metric | 2009 | 2016 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Charter enrollment | 1.7 million | 3.0 million | +76% |
| States with caps lifted | 20 | 35 | +75% |
| Federal charter funding | $256 million | $440 million | +72% |

### Universal ESA Movement (2021-Present)

The COVID-19 pandemic and conservative political momentum produced a wave of universal school choice programs.

**The Shift**

| Era | Approach |
|-----|----------|
| 1990-2010 | Targeted programs for low-income, failing schools |
| 2011-2020 | Expanded eligibility, but still income-limited |
| 2021-Present | Universal eligibility; all families can participate |

**State Actions (2021-2024)**

| State | Year | Program | Scope |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| West Virginia | 2021 | Hope Scholarship | Universal ESA |
| Arizona | 2022 | Empowerment Scholarship (expanded) | Universal ESA |
| Arkansas | 2023 | LEARNS Act | Universal voucher |
| Florida | 2023 | Expanded voucher | Universal |
| Iowa | 2023 | Students First | Universal ESA |
| Utah | 2023 | Utah Fits All | Universal ESA |
| Ohio | 2024 | EdChoice (expanded) | Universal voucher |

| High-performing networks exist | KIPP, Success Academy, Uncommon show large gains |
| Average effect is modest | CREDO studies show small positive effect in urban areas |
| Quality varies enormously | Distribution is wide; many charters underperform |
| Accountability matters | Strong authorizers produce better outcomes |
| For-profit performance | Generally weaker than nonprofit |

**Voucher Programs**

| Finding | Evidence Base |
|---------|---------------|
| Academic effects neutral to negative | Louisiana, Indiana, DC studies show null or negative |
| Parent satisfaction higher | Consistent across programs |
| Graduation effects positive | DC study shows higher graduation rates |
| Long-term effects unclear | Limited longitudinal data |
| Accountability correlates with quality | Programs with testing show better outcomes |

### Recurring Patterns

**Political Coalitions**

| Coalition | Motivation | Era |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| Segregationists + states' rights | Resist integration | 1950s-1970s |
| Black parents + conservatives | Escape failing urban schools | 1990s |
| Reform Democrats + Republicans | Competition + accountability | 2000s |
| Religious conservatives + libertarians | Religious schools + market ideology | 2010s-Present |

**Implementation Challenges**

| Challenge | Historical Examples |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Accountability gaps | Early Milwaukee, current ESA programs |
| Fraud and mismanagement | Ohio ECOT ($80M fraud), numerous charter closures |
| Segregation effects | Multiple studies showing increased stratification |
| Funding instability | District budget crises in choice-heavy markets |
| Information asymmetries | Parents struggle to evaluate quality |

### Unresolved Tensions

| Tension | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Public accountability vs. private operation | Still contested; accountability often weak |
| Integration vs. choice | Choice mechanisms tend to increase segregation |
| Innovation vs. quality control | Many "innovations" are ineffective or harmful |
| Parent rights vs. child welfare | Some voucher schools provide poor education |
| Competition vs. cooperation | Districts and charters rarely collaborate effectively |

## The Ideological Divide

### Pro-Choice Framework

| Principle | Argument |
|-----------|----------|
| Parental rights | Education is parent's responsibility; state should enable choice |
| Market efficiency | Competition produces innovation and quality |
| Pluralism | Different families need different schools |
| Equity through access | Low-income families deserve options wealthy have |
| Government failure | Public schools are bureaucratic, unresponsive |

### Pro-Public School Framework

| Principle | Argument |
|-----------|----------|
| Common good | Education is a public good requiring public oversight |
| Democratic accountability | Public schools answer to voters; private don't |
| Integration | Public schools bring diverse communities together |
| Equity through investment | All schools should be excellent, not just some |
| Market failure | Education is not suited to market mechanisms |
