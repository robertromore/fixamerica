# School Choice: Root Causes

## Why Choice Expanded

The rapid expansion of school choice in America stems from multiple interconnected causes: genuine dissatisfaction with public school performance, ideological commitments to markets and parental rights, strategic political calculations, and the influence of well-funded advocacy organizations. Understanding these drivers is essential to crafting effective policy responses.

## Cause 1: Urban School Failure

### The Reality

Many urban public schools have genuinely failed to serve students, particularly low-income students of color. This failure created authentic demand for alternatives.

**Performance Gaps**

| Metric | High-Poverty Urban | State Average | Gap |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|-----|
| 8th grade math proficiency | 15% | 35% | -20 pts |
| Graduation rates | 65% | 87% | -22 pts |
| College readiness | 10% | 25% | -15 pts |
| Chronic absenteeism | 30% | 15% | +15 pts |

**Contributing Factors**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Concentrated poverty | Resources stretched; social challenges intensified |
| Teacher turnover | Less experienced teachers in highest-need schools |
| Facility conditions | Crumbling buildings, inadequate technology |
| Curriculum tracking | Low expectations, remedial focus |
| Safety concerns | Violence, disorder in some schools |
| Bureaucratic rigidity | Slow response to problems, innovation stifled |

### Why This Mattered

When parents see failing schools and lack alternatives, they become receptive to choice messaging. The failures were real, and the frustration was legitimate.

| Parent Concern | Choice Appeal |
|----------------|---------------|
| "My child isn't learning" | "Try a different school" |
| "School is unsafe" | "Choose a safer environment" |
| "Teachers don't care" | "Find a school that fits" |
| "No one listens to me" | "Vote with your feet" |

## Cause 2: Ideological Commitment to Markets

### The Intellectual Movement

School choice draws on broader conservative and libertarian beliefs about markets, limited government, and individual liberty.

**Core Beliefs**

| Belief | Application to Education |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Markets are efficient | Competition among schools will improve quality |
| Government is inefficient | Public school bureaucracies waste resources |
| Individual choice is paramount | Parents, not government, should decide |
| Incentives matter | Schools should face consequences for failure |
| Monopolies are harmful | District school systems are monopolies |

**Key Thinkers and Organizations**

| Thinker/Organization | Contribution |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Milton Friedman | Original voucher proposal (1955) |
| James Buchanan | Public choice theory; bureaucratic self-interest |
| Cato Institute | Libertarian advocacy for vouchers |
| Heritage Foundation | Conservative policy development |
| Hoover Institution | Academic support for choice |

### Why This Mattered

Ideological conviction provides sustained energy for policy change, even when evidence is mixed. True believers in markets view education as just another sector where market principles should apply.

## Cause 3: Religious Motivations

### The Faith Factor

Many school choice advocates are motivated by desire for religious education and concerns about secular public schooling.

**Religious Motivations**

| Motivation | Manifestation |
|------------|---------------|
| Religious instruction | Desire for faith-integrated curriculum |
| Moral formation | Concerns about public school values |
| Cultural preservation | Religious community schooling |
| Conscience rights | Objections to curriculum content |
| Parental authority | Religious belief that education is parents' domain |

**Legal Evolution**

| Era | Status of Religious School Funding |
|-----|-----------------------------------|
| Pre-2002 | Generally prohibited under state Blaine Amendments |
| 2002-2020 | Permitted if program is neutral (Zelman) |
| Post-2020 | States cannot exclude religious schools (Espinoza, Carson) |

### Why This Mattered

Religious voters are a powerful political constituency. The prospect of public funding for religious schools motivates political action and funding for choice advocacy.

## Cause 4: Philanthropic Influence

### The Funders

Wealthy foundations and individuals have invested billions in promoting school choice.

**Major Funders**

| Funder | Approach | Investment |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Walton Family Foundation | Charters + vouchers | $500+ million over 20 years |
| Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation | Charters, reform | $700+ million (education) |
| Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation | Charter management, leadership | $500+ million |
| DeVos Family | Vouchers, charters, political advocacy | $200+ million (estimated) |
| Michael Bloomberg | Portfolio model, charters | $300+ million |
| Reed Hastings | Charters, especially CA | $100+ million |

**Funding Strategies**

| Strategy | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Charter management organization support | Build high-performing networks |
| Policy advocacy | Change state laws |
| Research funding | Generate favorable evidence |
| Political contributions | Elect pro-choice candidates |
| Grassroots organizing | Mobilize parent support |
| Media investment | Shape public narrative |

### Why This Mattered

Philanthropic resources enabled sustained advocacy, rapid charter expansion, and electoral campaigns that shifted the political landscape. Without this funding, the choice movement would have developed far more slowly.

## Cause 5: Political Calculation

### The Strategic Logic

Both Democrats and Republicans found strategic reasons to support school choice at various points.

**Republican Calculus**

| Factor | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Base enthusiasm | Religious conservatives, libertarians want choice |
| Teacher union opposition | Unions are Democratic constituency |
| Racial politics | Choice appeals to Black parents, potential outreach |
| Limited government frame | Choice fits small-government ideology |
| Business donor support | Corporate interests favor market approaches |

**Democratic Calculus (Historical)**

| Factor | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| Urban constituent demand | Black and Latino parents want options |
| Reform credentials | Support for innovation, accountability |
| Philanthropic support | Reform-oriented donors fund campaigns |
| Results focus | Outcome-based rather than input-based |
| Differentiation | Distinguish from "status quo" Democrats |

### Why This Mattered

Bipartisan support in the 2000s accelerated charter growth. The alignment of some Democrats with charter expansion provided political cover and enabled legislation.

## Cause 6: Civil Rights Framing

### The Equity Argument

Choice advocates successfully framed school choice as a civil rights issue.

**The Argument**

| Claim | Logic |
|-------|-------|
| Zip code determines destiny | Assignment by neighborhood perpetuates inequality |
| Public schools have failed minorities | Historical discrimination, current achievement gaps |
| Wealthy already have choice | They buy homes in good districts or pay private tuition |
| Choice equalizes access | Give poor families options the rich have |
| Waiting is unacceptable | Can't wait for system reform; children's lives at stake |

**Key Figures**

| Figure | Role |
|--------|------|
| Howard Fuller | Black superintendent; voucher advocate |
| Cory Booker | Democratic mayor; charter supporter |
| Kevin Chavous | DC Council; voucher champion |
| Eva Moskowitz | Success Academy founder; provocateur |
| Geoffrey Canada | Harlem Children's Zone; integration of services |

### Why This Mattered

Civil rights framing gave choice political legitimacy beyond conservative circles. It created cognitive dissonance for liberals who valued both public schools and educational equity.

## Cause 7: Interest Group Dynamics

### Who Gains from Choice

Various interest groups benefit from choice expansion and lobby accordingly.

**Beneficiaries**

| Interest Group | Benefit from Choice |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Charter management organizations | Revenue, growth opportunities |
| For-profit education companies | Market access, profits |
| Real estate developers | Charter facility development |
| Private schools | Voucher revenue |
| Testing companies | Assessment contracts |
| Education consultants | Advisory fees |
| Choice advocacy organizations | Philanthropic funding, influence |

**Campaign Contributions**

| Sector | Spending (Annual) | Orientation |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Education management | $10+ million | Pro-choice |
| Teacher unions | $30+ million | Anti-voucher, skeptical on charters |
| Tech/education companies | $15+ million | Mixed, generally pro-reform |

### Why This Mattered

Choice created a business sector with interest in its expansion. These interests lobby for favorable laws, contribute to campaigns, and fund advocacy.

## Cause 8: Media and Cultural Narratives

### The Dominant Story

Choice advocates benefited from cultural narratives about public school failure and market success.

**Influential Media**

| Work | Impact |
|------|--------|
| *Waiting for Superman* (2010) | Dramatized charter success, public school failure |
| *The Cartel* (2009) | Documentary attacking public schools |
| *Won't Back Down* (2012) | Pro-trigger law film |
| KIPP success stories | Media coverage of high-performing charters |
| *The Prize* (2015) | Critical examination of Newark reforms |

**Narrative Frames**

| Frame | Message |
|-------|---------|
| Crisis | Public schools are failing catastrophically |
| Heroes | Reform leaders fighting the establishment |
| Villains | Teacher unions protecting bad teachers |
| Victims | Children trapped in failing schools |
| Solutions | Choice, competition, accountability |

### Why This Mattered

Media narratives shape public perception and political possibility. The "failing schools" narrative, while partially accurate, created receptivity to choice as solution.

## Cause 9: Technological Change

### New Possibilities

Technology enabled new forms of schooling that expanded choice options.

**Technological Enablers**

| Technology | Choice Application |
|------------|-------------------|
| Internet | Virtual schools, online curricula |
| Learning management systems | Personalized learning, competency-based |
| Video conferencing | Remote instruction |
| Mobile devices | Learning pods, hybrid models |
| Assessment platforms | Real-time data, standardized evaluation |

**COVID Acceleration**

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Familiarity with remote | Families learned online schooling is possible |
| Enrollment disruption | Movement away from assigned schools |
| Pod formation | Wealthy families created private options |
| Homeschool growth | Significant increase in home education |
| Political mobilization | School closure controversies energized choice advocates |

### Why This Mattered

Technology reduced barriers to non-traditional schooling and enabled rapid expansion during and after COVID.

## Cause 10: Public School Resistance to Reform

### Institutional Inertia

Public school systems often resisted changes that might have reduced demand for alternatives.

**Points of Resistance**

| Issue | District Response |
|-------|------------------|
| Longer school day/year | Contractual barriers, cost concerns |
| Performance-based pay | Union opposition |
| Principal autonomy | Central office control |
| School closures | Political backlash |
| Curriculum innovation | Standardization pressure |
| Parent engagement | Defensive posture |

**Perception Problems**

| Perception | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Bureaucratic | Often true; large central offices |
| Unresponsive | Mixed; some districts improved, others didn't |
| Status quo oriented | Many reform efforts; inconsistent results |
| Union dominated | Collective bargaining is real constraint |
| Resistant to accountability | Varied widely by district |

### Why This Mattered

When public schools appeared unable or unwilling to change, families and policymakers turned to alternatives. District resistance to reform strengthened choice advocates' arguments.

## Implications for Reform

Understanding root causes suggests several implications:

1. **Address genuine school quality issues**: Choice demand partly reflects real failures that must be fixed
2. **Recognize ideological commitment**: Pure policy arguments won't persuade true believers
3. **Follow the money**: Philanthropic and political spending shapes the landscape
4. **Acknowledge parent perspectives**: Dismissing parent concerns alienates potential allies
5. **Counter narratives with evidence**: Challenge misleading claims with facts
6. **Build coalitions**: Find common ground where possible
7. **Strengthen public systems**: The best argument for public schools is excellent public schools
