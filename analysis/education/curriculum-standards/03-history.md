# Curriculum Standards: History

## Early American Education (1600s-1890s)

### Colonial and Early Republic Period

In colonial America, curriculum was locally determined and varied by region:

**New England**:

- Puritan emphasis on literacy for Bible reading
- Latin grammar schools for college preparation
- Dame schools for basic reading
- Massachusetts Law of 1647 required towns to establish schools

**Middle Colonies**:

- Religious diversity led to varied curricula
- Quaker and German schools with different emphases
- More practical, commercial orientation

**Southern Colonies**:

- Plantation tutoring for wealthy
- Limited common schooling
- Classical education for elites

**Early Republic Curriculum Debates**:

The founders debated educational purposes:

| Founder | View on Curriculum |
|---------|-------------------|
| Thomas Jefferson | Reading, writing, arithmetic; history for citizenship |
| Benjamin Rush | National curriculum for American identity |
| Noah Webster | American language and values, not British |

Webster's American Dictionary (1828) and his Blue-Backed Speller explicitly sought to create distinctly American content.

### The Common School Movement (1830s-1860s)

Horace Mann's common school movement established the first widespread curriculum expectations:

**Key Curriculum Principles**:

- Common, non-sectarian content for all students
- Moral education without specific religious doctrine
- Preparation for republican citizenship
- Basic literacy and numeracy

**McGuffey Readers**:

- First standardized reading curriculum (1836)
- Over 120 million copies sold by 1890
- Protestant moral values embedded in content
- Defined reading instruction for decades

**Controversy**:

- Catholics objected to Protestant content, establishing parochial schools
- Southern states resisted Northern curricula
- Tension between common content and local control emerged

### Post-Civil War (1865-1890)

**Reconstruction Education**:

- Freedmen's Bureau established schools throughout South
- Curriculum included literacy, citizenship, and practical skills
- White resistance to Black education was violent and persistent

**Committee of Ten (1892)**:

The NEA's Committee of Ten, chaired by Harvard President Charles Eliot, standardized high school curriculum:

**Recommended Subjects**:

- Latin and Greek (classical languages)
- English literature and composition
- Mathematics (algebra, geometry)
- Natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biology)
- History and civil government
- Modern foreign languages

This college-preparatory curriculum became the high school standard, though most students did not attend high school.

## Progressive Era Reforms (1890-1945)

### The Cardinal Principles (1918)

The NEA's Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education shifted curriculum focus:

**The Seven Cardinal Principles**:

1. Health
2. Command of fundamental processes
3. Worthy home membership
4. Vocation
5. Civic education
6. Worthy use of leisure
7. Ethical character

This represented a move from classical academic content toward practical life skills and social adjustment.

### Curriculum Battles of the 1920s-1930s

**The Scopes Trial (1925)**:

- Tennessee prohibited teaching evolution
- John Scopes convicted (later overturned on technicality)
- Set template for future science curriculum battles
- Most states avoided evolution in textbooks for decades

**Progressive Education Association**:

- John Dewey's influence on curriculum
- "Learning by doing" and experiential approaches
- Child-centered rather than content-centered
- The Eight-Year Study (1933-1941) tested progressive methods

**Rugg Social Studies Controversy (1930s-1940s)**:

- Harold Rugg's social studies textbooks emphasized critical thinking
- Attacked as socialist, un-American
- Sales declined from 5 million to 21,000 copies
- Set pattern for textbook censorship campaigns

### Post-War Curriculum (1945-1957)

**Life Adjustment Education**:

- Curriculum focused on practical skills for "average" students
- Criticized as anti-intellectual, watered-down
- Only 20% of students seen as college-bound
- Arthur Bestor's *Educational Wastelands* (1953) attacked this approach

**Red Scare and Curriculum**:

- Loyalty oaths for teachers
- Communist content purged from textbooks
- Social studies emphasis on American exceptionalism
- UNESCO materials removed from schools

## The Standards Era Begins (1957-1983)

### Sputnik and Curriculum Reform

The Soviet launch of Sputnik (1957) triggered massive curriculum intervention:

**National Defense Education Act (1958)**:

- Federal funding for science, math, and foreign language
- First major federal curriculum role
- $1 billion invested over four years

**"New Math" Movement**:

- Set theory and mathematical structure emphasized
- Developed by university mathematicians
- Poorly understood by teachers and parents
- Largely abandoned by 1970s
- Demonstrated risks of top-down curriculum reform

**Curriculum Development Projects**:

| Project | Subject | Approach |
|---------|---------|----------|
| PSSC Physics | Physics | Inquiry-based, lab-centered |
| BSCS Biology | Biology | Evolution-based, multiple versions |
| SMSG | Mathematics | Structural, abstract |
| MACOS | Social Studies | Anthropological, comparative |

MACOS (Man: A Course of Study) faced backlash for teaching about Inuit culture, including practices conservatives found objectionable. Congress defunded it in 1975.

### The Civil Rights Era and Curriculum

**Brown v. Board of Education (1954)** and subsequent integration battles affected curriculum:

**Textbook Desegregation**:

- Black students largely absent from textbooks
- Civil rights movement demanded inclusive content
- Publishers slowly revised materials in 1960s-1970s
- "Multicultural education" movement emerged

**Ethnic Studies**:

- Black Studies programs at universities (1968+)
- Chicano Studies, Asian American Studies followed
- K-12 ethnic studies emerged in some districts
- Resistance from traditionalists

**Kanawha County Textbook War (1974)**:

- West Virginia parents protested new textbooks
- Objected to Black authors, questioning of authority
- Schools bombed, violence erupted
- Foreshadowed modern curriculum wars

## A Nation at Risk Era (1983-2001)

### The 1983 Report

"A Nation at Risk" warned of "rising tide of mediocrity":

**Curriculum Recommendations**:

- Four years of English
- Three years of mathematics
- Three years of science
- Three years of social studies
- Half year of computer science

The report blamed curriculum for economic competitiveness concerns and launched the modern standards movement.

### State Standards Development (1980s-1990s)

States began developing explicit academic standards:

**Timeline**:

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1983 | California develops model curriculum standards |
| 1989 | Charlottesville Education Summit sets national goals |
| 1991 | National Council of Teachers of Mathematics releases standards |
| 1994 | Goals 2000 encourages state standards development |
| 1996 | National History Standards controversy |
| 2001 | No Child Left Behind requires state standards and testing |

**National History Standards Controversy (1994-1996)**:

UCLA's National Center for History developed voluntary national history standards:

**Conservative Objections**:

- Too much emphasis on diversity, oppression
- Not enough on traditional heroes (Washington, Edison)
- Lynne Cheney called them "politicized history"
- Senate voted 99-1 to condemn standards

The standards were revised, but the controversy demonstrated curriculum's political toxicity.

### Subject-Specific Standards

Professional organizations developed content standards:

| Organization | Subject | Year | Key Feature |
|--------------|---------|------|-------------|
| NCTM | Mathematics | 1989 | Problem-solving emphasis |
| NRC | Science | 1996 | Scientific inquiry focus |
| NCTE/IRA | English | 1996 | Process-based literacy |
| NCSS | Social Studies | 1994 | Thematic strands |

These standards influenced state standards but had no enforcement mechanism.

## No Child Left Behind Era (2001-2009)

### The NCLB Framework

No Child Left Behind (2001) federalized standards-based accountability:

**Requirements**:

- States must have standards in reading and math
- Annual testing in grades 3-8 and once in high school
- "Adequate Yearly Progress" requirements
- 100% proficiency goal by 2014

**Curriculum Effects**:

- Narrowing to tested subjects (reading, math)
- Reduced time for science, social studies, arts
- Test preparation dominated instruction
- "Teaching to the test" concerns

### State Standards Variation

Without national standards, states set their own bars:

**Proficiency Standard Variation**:

| State | NAEP Proficiency Equivalent of State Standard |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| Massachusetts | Advanced |
| Texas | Basic |
| Mississippi | Below Basic |

A "proficient" student in one state might be "below basic" by another state's standards. This created pressure for common standards.

## Common Core Era (2009-Present)

### Origins and Development

**Precursors**:

- Achieve, Inc. formed by governors (1996)
- American Diploma Project (2004)
- Benchmarking for Success report (2008)

**Development Process (2009-2010)**:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2009 | NGA and CCSSO announce initiative |
| 2009 | Work groups and feedback groups formed |
| 2010 | Final standards released |
| 2010-2011 | Rapid state adoption (Race to the Top incentives) |
| 2011 | 46 states plus DC adopted |

**Funding**:

- Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided ~$200 million
- Funded development, advocacy, and implementation
- Later acknowledged as problematic approach

### Common Core Features

**English Language Arts**:

- Text complexity requirements (increasingly challenging texts)
- Close reading emphasis
- Evidence-based argumentation
- Informational text balance (50/50 by high school)
- Reading standards for history, science, technical subjects

**Mathematics**:

- Fewer topics with greater depth
- Focus on understanding, not just procedures
- Mathematical practices (reasoning, modeling)
- Coherent progression across grades
- Algebra in 8th grade pathway

### The Backlash (2012-2016)

**Conservative Opposition**:

- Federal overreach concerns
- Loss of local control
- Obama administration association
- Conspiracy theories (UN Agenda 21)

**Progressive Concerns**:

- Over-testing
- Gates Foundation influence
- Narrow, skills-based approach
- Developmentally inappropriate expectations

**Tea Party and Grassroots Organizing**:

- Local groups formed to oppose Common Core
- Republican primaries featured anti-Common Core pledges
- State legislatures passed withdrawal bills

**State Withdrawals**:

| State | Year Withdrawn | Replacement |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Indiana | 2014 | State-developed (similar to Common Core) |
| Oklahoma | 2014 | State-developed |
| South Carolina | 2015 | State-developed (similar) |
| Arizona | 2015 | Rebranded |
| Louisiana | 2016 | Modified |

Most withdrawing states adopted standards very similar to Common Core under different names.

### Current Era (2016-Present)

**Trump Administration**:

- Rhetorical opposition to Common Core
- No federal Common Core requirements (never were any)
- Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) prohibited federal curriculum mandates

**State Rebranding**:

| State | Original Name | New Name |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Arizona | Common Core | Arizona's College and Career Ready Standards |
| Florida | Common Core | Florida Standards |
| Georgia | Common Core | Georgia Standards of Excellence |
| North Carolina | Common Core | North Carolina Standard Course of Study |

**New Curriculum Wars (2020-Present)**:

Post-2020, curriculum battles shifted to:

- Critical Race Theory (mischaracterized)
- 1619 Project and teaching slavery
- LGBTQ+ content and gender identity
- Book bans and library access
- Parental rights legislation

These represent a new phase of curriculum conflict, often more intense than Common Core debates.

## Key Patterns in Curriculum History

### Recurring Themes

1. **Local vs. National Control**: Tension between local curricular authority and efforts to standardize

2. **Academic vs. Practical**: Debates over whether curriculum should be college-prep or vocational

3. **Traditional vs. Progressive**: Content knowledge versus skills and critical thinking

4. **Who Decides?**: Experts, parents, communities, states, federal government

5. **Culture War Proxy**: Curriculum as battleground for broader social conflicts

6. **Implementation Gaps**: Good standards rarely translate cleanly to classroom practice

### Lessons from History

**Failed Reforms Often Share Characteristics**:

- Top-down imposition without teacher buy-in
- Unclear or unrealistic implementation expectations
- Insufficient professional development
- Overreach that triggers backlash

**Successful Elements**:

- Broad stakeholder involvement
- Clear, specific expectations
- Sustained support for implementation
- Flexibility within framework
