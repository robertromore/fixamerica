# Curriculum Standards: Stakeholders

## Primary Stakeholders

### Students

**Population**: 49.5 million K-12 public school students

**Stakes**: Students bear the consequences of curriculum decisions most directly:

- Access to rigorous content affects learning and opportunities
- Time spent on tested subjects vs. broader curriculum
- Exposure to diverse perspectives and histories
- Preparation for college and careers

**Voice**: Students have virtually no formal voice in curriculum decisions:

- Rarely consulted on textbook adoptions
- No representation on standards committees
- Student surveys focused on satisfaction, not content
- Youth organizing occasionally affects policy

**Research on Student Preferences**:

| Preference | % of High School Students |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Want more career-relevant content | 67% |
| Want more financial literacy | 72% |
| Want more diverse perspectives | 54% |
| Find history boring | 48% |
| Want more hands-on learning | 71% |

**Parent Rights Legislation**:

18 states have passed "parental rights" laws since 2021:

### Teachers

**Population**: 3.2 million public school teachers

**Stakes**:
