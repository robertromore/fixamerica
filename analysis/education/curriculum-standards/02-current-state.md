# Curriculum Standards: Current State

## The Standards Landscape

### State Standards Status (2024)

States maintain distinct approaches to academic standards:

**Common Core Alignment**:

| Category | States | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Fully aligned to Common Core | 19 | Original standards with minor updates |
| Substantially aligned (rebranded) | 22 | Same content, different name |
| Significantly modified | 4 | Retained core but substantial changes |
| Never adopted | 5 | Texas, Virginia, Alaska, Nebraska, (partial) Minnesota |

**Standards Quality by Subject** (based on independent reviews):

| Subject | States with Strong Standards | States with Weak Standards |
|---------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| English Language Arts | 35 | 8 |
| Mathematics | 38 | 7 |
| Science | 32 | 12 |
| Social Studies/History | 15 | 22 |
| Civics | 8 | 28 |

Social studies and civics consistently receive the weakest ratings, with many state standards lacking specificity or rigor.

### Science Standards

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), released in 2013, have been adopted by 44 states and the District of Columbia in some form:

**NGSS Adoption Status**:

| Status | States |
|--------|--------|
| Full NGSS adoption | 20 |
| Standards "based on" NGSS | 24 |
| Independent standards | 6 |

Key NGSS features include:

- Integration of three dimensions: science practices, crosscutting concepts, disciplinary core ideas
- Explicit inclusion of climate change and evolution
- Engineering and design thinking throughout
- Emphasis on scientific argumentation

**Contested Science Content**:

| Topic | States with Restrictions | Form of Restriction |
|-------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Evolution | 6 | "Academic freedom" laws, teach controversy |
| Climate change | 4 | Balance requirements, controversy framing |
| Human sexuality | 12 | Abstinence requirements, opt-out provisions |

### Social Studies Standards

Social studies standards are the most fragmented and politically contested:

**State Approaches**:

- **Traditional/Knowledge-based**: Emphasizes dates, facts, figures, "great men" history
- **Skills-based**: Emphasizes historical thinking, inquiry, argumentation
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combine content knowledge with skills

**Recent Legislative Interventions** (2021-2024):

18 states have passed laws restricting how race and history are taught:

| State | Law | Key Provisions |
|-------|-----|----------------|
| Florida | HB 7 (2022) | Prohibits teaching that makes students feel "guilt" based on race |
| Texas | HB 3979 (2021) | Teachers cannot require discussion of "controversial issues" |
| Tennessee | HB 580 (2021) | Prohibits promoting "resentment" based on race or sex |
| Oklahoma | HB 1775 (2021) | Prohibits teaching that individuals are "inherently racist" |
| Iowa | HF 802 (2021) | Bans "divisive concepts" in training and curriculum |

These laws often use vague language ("divisive concepts," "discomfort," "resentment") that creates uncertainty about what can be taught.

## Textbook and Materials Market

### Market Structure

The K-12 instructional materials market is approximately $8 billion annually:

**Market Segments**:

| Segment | Size | Growth Rate |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Core curriculum (ELA, Math) | $4.2 billion | 2% |
| Supplemental materials | $1.8 billion | 5% |
| Digital/EdTech | $1.5 billion | 12% |
| Assessment materials | $0.5 billion | 3% |

**Publisher Consolidation**:

Three major publishers control approximately 75% of the core textbook market:

| Publisher | Market Share | Notable Acquisitions |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| McGraw Hill | 30% | Merged with Cengage (later dissolved) |
| Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | 25% | Acquired by Veritas Capital (2022) |
| Pearson | 20% | Sold K-12 courseware business (2019) |

This consolidation reduces competition and limits curriculum options for districts.

### Adoption Processes

States use three primary adoption models:

**State Adoption (21 states)**:

- State reviews and approves list of materials
- Districts must choose from approved list
- Provides quality control but limits local choice
- Major adoption states: Texas, California, Florida

**Local Adoption (24 states)**:

- Districts independently select materials
- No state review or approval process
- Maximum local control but quality varies
- May lack capacity for rigorous review

**Hybrid (5 states)**:

- State provides recommendations but not requirements
- Districts may use non-approved materials with waiver

### Quality of Widely-Used Materials

EdReports, an independent curriculum review organization, has evaluated hundreds of curricula:

**Curriculum Quality Ratings (% meeting expectations)**:

| Subject | Meets Expectations | Partially Meets | Does Not Meet |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| ELA (K-8) | 32% | 28% | 40% |
| Math (K-8) | 42% | 23% | 35% |
| ELA (High School) | 28% | 31% | 41% |
| Math (High School) | 45% | 22% | 33% |

Many of the most widely-used curricula do not meet quality standards. Districts often choose based on cost, familiarity, or publisher relationships rather than evidence.

**Usage vs. Quality**:

| Curriculum | Usage (Districts) | EdReports Rating |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| Houghton Mifflin Journeys | 15% | Does Not Meet |
| McGraw Hill Wonders | 12% | Partially Meets |
| Lucy Calkins Reading/Writing | 10% | Does Not Meet |
| Fountas & Pinnell | 8% | Does Not Meet |
| Core Knowledge Language Arts | 4% | Meets Expectations |

The most widely-used curricula are often not the highest quality, demonstrating market failure in educational materials.

### The "Science of Reading" Movement

A significant shift is underway in reading instruction:

**Traditional "Balanced Literacy" Approach**:

- Emphasis on context, pictures, and guessing
- Three-cueing systems (meaning, structure, visual)
- Limited explicit phonics instruction
- Leveled readers based on text features

**"Science of Reading" Approach**:

- Systematic, explicit phonics instruction
- Phonemic awareness and decoding emphasis
- Knowledge-building through read-alouds
- Decodable texts for practice

**Legislative Action**:

As of 2024, 37 states have passed laws requiring or encouraging science of reading approaches:

| Requirement | States |
|-------------|--------|
| Mandate phonics-based instruction | 32 |
| Require screening for dyslexia | 40 |
| Restrict three-cueing | 11 |
| Mandate teacher training | 28 |

This represents a rare area of bipartisan consensus on curriculum.

## Assessment Alignment

### State Assessment Consortia

Following Common Core adoption, two consortia developed aligned assessments:

**Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC)**:

- Currently used by: 13 states
- Computer-adaptive testing
- Performance tasks included
- Peak membership: 18 states

**Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC)**:

- Dissolved as consortium (2018)
- Some states use successor tests
- High bar proved politically untenable

**Current Assessment Landscape**:

| Assessment Approach | States |
|--------------------|--------|
| SBAC or SBAC-based | 13 |
| State-developed aligned to Common Core | 21 |
| State-developed independent standards | 11 |
| Other consortium tests | 5 |

### College Readiness Alignment

**SAT/ACT Alignment**:

Both major college entrance exams have been redesigned to align with Common Core standards:

| Exam | Changes | Implementation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| SAT | Evidence-based reading, calculator/no-calculator math | 2016 |
| ACT | Increased emphasis on close reading, evidence-based writing | 2015 |

**College Remediation Rates**:

Despite standards alignment efforts, remediation remains high:

| Subject | % Entering Students Needing Remediation |
|---------|----------------------------------------|
| Mathematics | 19% |
| English/Writing | 13% |
| Reading | 11% |

These rates suggest standards alone have not solved college readiness problems.

## Book Challenges and Bans

### Scale of Challenges

Book challenges have increased dramatically:

**ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom Data**:

| Year | Unique Titles Challenged | Demands to Remove |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| 2019 | 566 | 377 |
| 2020 | 273 | 156 |
| 2021 | 1,597 | 729 |
| 2022 | 2,571 | 1,269 |
| 2023 | 4,240 | 1,915 |

This represents a 650% increase since 2020.

### Most Challenged Books (2022-2023)

| Title | Author | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Gender Queer: A Memoir | Maia Kobabe | LGBTQ+ content, sexual imagery |
| All Boys Aren't Blue | George M. Johnson | LGBTQ+ content, sexual content |
| The Bluest Eye | Toni Morrison | Sexual content, racism depiction |
| Flamer | Mike Curato | LGBTQ+ content |
| The Perks of Being a Wallflower | Stephen Chbosky | Sexual content, drugs |
| Looking for Alaska | John Green | Sexual content |
| The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian | Sherman Alexie | Profanity, sexual references |
| This Book is Gay | Juno Dawson | LGBTQ+ content |
| Beyond Magenta | Susan Kuklin | LGBTQ+ content |
| Lawn Boy | Jonathan Evison | LGBTQ+ content, sexual content |

LGBTQ+ themes are present in 8 of the 10 most challenged titles.

### State-Level Restrictions

Several states have enacted laws affecting library access:

| State | Law | Effect |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Florida | HB 1069 (2023) | Removes sexually explicit materials, criminal liability for librarians |
| Texas | HB 900 (2023) | Vendors must rate books for sexual content |
| Missouri | SB 775 (2022) | Criminalizes providing explicit materials to minors |
| Utah | HB 374 (2022) | Three challenges removes book from all schools |
| Iowa | SF 496 (2023) | Removes books with "sexual conduct" descriptions |

These laws have resulted in thousands of books being removed, often preemptively.

## Curriculum Content Debates

### History and Social Studies

**1619 Project Controversy**:

The New York Times Magazine's 1619 Project, which centered slavery in American history, has been:

| Action | States/Entities |
|--------|-----------------|
| Explicitly banned in curriculum | 5 states |
| Cited in "divisive concepts" laws | 12 states |
| Used as curriculum supplement | Unknown (no comprehensive data) |
| Assigned at university level | 50+ universities |

**1776 Commission Response**:

The Trump administration's 1776 Commission (2021) released a report promoting "patriotic education":

- Criticized 1619 Project and critical race theory
- Emphasized founding principles and American exceptionalism
- Biden administration dissolved the commission
- Report used as model for some state legislation

**AP African American Studies**:

Florida blocked the College Board's Advanced Placement African American Studies course (2023):

- Initial framework included queer theory, intersectionality, Black Lives Matter movement
- Revised framework removed controversial elements
- Course now offered, but controversy demonstrated political constraints on curriculum

### Health Education

**Sex Education Approaches**:

| Approach | States | Characteristics |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Comprehensive | 13 | Age-appropriate, medically accurate, includes contraception |
| Abstinence-plus | 16 | Emphasizes abstinence, includes contraception |
| Abstinence-only | 9 | Abstinence as only option, limited contraception info |
| No requirement | 12 | Local discretion |

**LGBTQ+ Content Restrictions**:

| Restriction Type | States |
|-----------------|--------|
| "Don't Say Gay" laws | 8 |
| Parental notification requirements | 15 |
| Opt-in rather than opt-out | 7 |
| Prohibited through grade level | 6 (varies K-3 to K-8) |

Florida's Parental Rights in Education Act (2022) prohibits instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in grades K-3 and requires "age-appropriate" instruction in later grades.

### Religious Content

**Creationism and Intelligent Design**:

Since *Edwards v. Aguillard* (1987) and *Kitzmiller v. Dover* (2005), explicit creationism and intelligent design are unconstitutional in public schools. However:

| Approach | States | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| "Academic freedom" laws | 4 | Allow teachers to present "alternatives" |
| "Teach the controversy" | 3 | Frame evolution as disputed |
| Silent on origins | 6 | Standards avoid the topic |

**Bible Courses**:

| Type | States | Constitutional Status |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| Required Bible study availability | 10 | Legal if literary/historical |
| Optional Bible electives | 35+ | Legal if objective |
| "In God We Trust" displays | 8 | Legal (ceremonial deism) |
| Ten Commandments displays | 3 | Challenged in courts |

In 2024, Louisiana passed a law requiring Ten Commandments displays in every public school classroom, facing immediate legal challenge.

## Teacher Autonomy and Materials Use

### Mandated Curricula

**District-Mandated Adoption Rates**:

| Subject | % Districts with Mandated Curriculum |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
| ELA | 68% |
| Mathematics | 72% |
| Science | 45% |
| Social Studies | 38% |

Teachers in mandated-curriculum districts have limited ability to deviate from prescribed materials.

### Scripted Curricula

Some curricula are highly scripted, telling teachers exactly what to say and when:

**Characteristics of Scripted Curricula**:

- Word-for-word teacher scripts
- Timed lesson segments
- Specific gestures and signals
- Fidelity monitoring by administrators

**Teacher Perspectives on Scripted Curricula**:

| Response | % of Teachers |
|----------|---------------|
| Too scripted, limits effectiveness | 42% |
| Appropriate level of guidance | 31% |
| Helpful, especially for new teachers | 18% |
| Not scripted enough | 9% |

### Open Educational Resources (OER)

**OER Adoption**:

| OER Use | % of Districts |
|---------|---------------|
| Primary curriculum | 8% |
| Supplemental materials | 45% |
| No OER use | 47% |

OER adoption is growing but remains limited due to quality concerns, lack of support materials, and professional development needs.

## Assessment and Standards Alignment

### Alignment Research

Studies of instructional materials alignment to standards:

**RAND Corporation Study (2022)**:

- Only 55% of materials used in classrooms aligned to grade-level standards
- High-poverty schools more likely to use below-grade materials
- Teacher-created materials often not aligned

**Coherence Gap**:

| Element | % Aligned to State Standards |
|---------|----------------------------|
| State standards | 100% (by definition) |
| State assessments | 85% |
| District curriculum | 65% |
| Classroom materials | 55% |
| Teacher assessments | 45% |

Misalignment at each level compounds, reducing coherence.
