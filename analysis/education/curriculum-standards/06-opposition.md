# Curriculum Standards: Opposition

## Opposition to Curriculum Standards

### Common Core Opponents

**Conservative Opposition**:

Conservative opposition to Common Core coalesced around several themes:

| Concern | Argument | Validity |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Federal overreach | Common Core is federal takeover of education | Partially valid--Race to the Top created pressure, but standards were state-developed |
| Loss of local control | Standards eliminate community input | Partially valid--standards set expectations, but curriculum remains local |
| One-size-fits-all | Ignores student differences | Limited validity--standards allow differentiation in instruction |
| Developmentally inappropriate | Expectations too advanced for young children | Some validity--kindergarten standards criticized by child development experts |
| Progressive ideology | Standards push liberal values | Limited validity--standards are content-neutral, but implementation choices vary |

**Leading Conservative Critics**:

| Voice | Organization | Primary Argument |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| Emmett McGroarty | American Principles Project | Federal overreach, data privacy |
| Joy Pullmann | Heartland Institute | Federal control, Gates influence |
| Jane Robbins | American Principles Project | Constitutional concerns |
| State legislators | Various | Local control, parental rights |

**Tea Party Opposition**:

- Connected Common Core to other Tea Party grievances
- Organized at local and state levels
- Pressured Republican legislators
- Generated primary challenges for Common Core supporters

**Progressive Criticism**:

Some progressive educators also opposed Common Core:

| Concern | Argument | Validity |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Over-testing | Standards led to more standardized testing | Valid--aligned assessments increased testing |
| Narrowing curriculum | Focus on ELA and math excluded other subjects | Valid--tested subjects received more time |
| Corporate influence | Gates Foundation and publishers drove adoption | Valid--foundation influence was substantial |
| Equity concerns | Standards benefited advantaged students more | Contested--mixed evidence on equity effects |
| Teacher de-professionalization | Scripted curricula reduced teacher autonomy | Partially valid--some implementations very prescriptive |

**Leading Progressive Critics**:

| Voice | Affiliation | Primary Argument |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Diane Ravitch | NYU, former USED | Corporate reform, testing critique |
| Anthony Cody | Living in Dialogue | Teacher voice, testing |
| Nancy Carlsson-Paige | Lesley University | Developmentally inappropriate |
| Mercedes Schneider | Teacher/researcher | Gates influence, privatization |

### Response to Critics

**Addressing Federal Control Arguments**:

- Common Core was developed by NGA and CCSSO (state organizations)
- No federal law required adoption
- Race to the Top incentivized but did not mandate
- States remain free to withdraw (several have)

Counter-argument strength: Medium. While technically accurate, the federal incentive structure created pressure that felt coercive to critics.

**Addressing Quality Arguments**:

- Standards underwent extensive review
- Based on international benchmarking
- Professional organizations generally supportive
- Evidence on outcomes is mixed but not negative

Counter-argument strength: Medium. Standards may be high-quality, but implementation varied enormously.

**Addressing Equity Arguments**:

- Standards intended to ensure access to rigorous content
- Implementation, not standards, determines equity
- Some evidence of narrowed curriculum in high-poverty schools
- Standards alone cannot address resource inequities

Counter-argument strength: Limited. Standards advocates underestimated implementation challenges.

## Opposition to Curriculum Content

### "Critical Race Theory" Opposition

Since 2020, organized opposition has targeted what opponents call "Critical Race Theory" in K-12 schools:

**What Opponents Mean by CRT**:

| Term Used | Actual CRT (Academic) | What Opponents Object To |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Critical Race Theory | Graduate-level legal framework analyzing race and law | Any teaching about systemic racism |
| Divisive concepts | -- | Discussions of white privilege, systemic inequality |
| Anti-American | -- | Teaching about slavery, Jim Crow, ongoing discrimination |

The term "CRT" has become a catch-all for any curriculum content that opponents find objectionable regarding race.

**Key Organizations**:

| Organization | Activities | Funding Sources |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| Manhattan Institute | Research, model legislation, media | Conservative foundations |
| Heritage Foundation | Policy development, advocacy | Conservative donors |
| Parents Defending Education | Investigations, school board organizing | Conservative donors |
| Christopher Rufo (individual) | Media campaigns, strategic framing | Various conservative outlets |

**Christopher Rufo's Strategy**:

Rufo explicitly described his strategy in a 2021 tweet:
> "We have successfully frozen their brand--'critical race theory'--into the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions. We will eventually turn it toxic, as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category."

This represents a deliberate effort to expand the term's meaning for political effect.

**State Legislative Response**:

18 states have passed laws restricting how race and history are taught:

| State | Key Provisions | Penalties |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Florida | Cannot teach concepts that make students feel "guilt" | Loss of funding, teacher discipline |
| Texas | Cannot teach that individuals are "inherently racist" | Teacher termination |
| Tennessee | Prohibits promoting "resentment" based on race | $5M penalty to districts |
| Idaho | Prohibits compelling belief that any group is responsible for past actions | Funding cuts |

**Critique of Opponents**:

Critics argue this opposition:

- Misrepresents what is actually taught in schools
- Chills discussion of American history
- Violates academic freedom
- Makes teachers afraid to teach factual history
- Disproportionately affects students of color

**Legitimate Concerns**:

Some underlying concerns deserve attention:

- Parents should know what their children are learning
- Age-appropriate presentation matters
- Students should not be blamed for historical injustices
- Multiple perspectives should be respected
- Ideological indoctrination (of any kind) is inappropriate

### Book Ban Movement

**Scale**:

| Year | Books Challenged | Books Banned |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| 2020 | 273 | 156 |
| 2021 | 1,597 | 729 |
| 2022 | 2,571 | 1,269 |
| 2023 | 4,240 | 1,915+ |

**Characteristics**:

- Concentrated on LGBTQ+ content (37% of challenges)
- Race and diversity themes (32%)
- Sexual content (16%)
- Often target award-winning literature
- Organized campaigns, not individual parents

**Key Organizations**:

| Organization | Approach | Scale |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| Moms for Liberty | School board organizing, challenge campaigns | 300+ chapters |
| Citizens Defending Freedom | Legal support for challenges | National |
| No Left Turn in Education | Parent organizing | National |

**Legal Framework**:

Schools can remove materials if:

- Decision based on legitimate pedagogical concern
- Not based purely on disagreement with ideas
- Follows established process

*Pico v. Island Trees* (1982): School boards cannot remove books simply because they dislike ideas, but may remove pervasively vulgar or educationally unsuitable materials.

**Critique of Book Bans**:

| Argument | Counter-Argument |
|----------|------------------|
| Protecting children from inappropriate content | Most challenged books are age-appropriate for their intended audience |
| Parental rights | Individual parents can opt out; banning affects all students |
| Community standards | Organized minority imposing views on majority |
| Local control | Coordinated national campaigns, not local concern |

**Legitimate Concerns**:

- Some materials may be genuinely inappropriate for certain ages
- Parents have legitimate interest in knowing library content
- Selection policies should be clear and followed
- Opt-out mechanisms can address individual concerns

### Opposition to Evolution and Climate Science

**Evolution**:

Despite legal prohibition on teaching creationism:

- 6 states have "academic freedom" laws allowing alternatives
- 20% of biology teachers still present creationism as legitimate alternative
- Many teachers skip or minimize evolution

**Climate Change**:

| Teacher Response | % of Science Teachers |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Teach established science | 70% |
| Teach "both sides" | 17% |
| Avoid or minimize | 10% |
| Deny human causation | 3% |

**Opposition Arguments**:

| Argument | Scientific Response |
|----------|---------------------|
| Evolution is "just a theory" | Scientific theory = well-tested explanation; evolution is fact |
| Climate science is uncertain | Scientific consensus is overwhelming (97%+) |
| Academic freedom requires balance | False balance misrepresents scientific knowledge |
| Parents' religious beliefs | Religious belief does not override scientific fact in science class |

**Legal Landscape**:

| Case | Decision |
|------|----------|
| *Edwards v. Aguillard* (1987) | Creationism cannot be taught in public schools |
| *Kitzmiller v. Dover* (2005) | Intelligent design is creationism and cannot be taught |

## Opposition to Teacher Autonomy

### Scripted Curriculum Advocates

Some reformers argue teachers should have less curriculum discretion:

**Arguments for Scripted Curricula**:

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Teacher quality varies | True--but scripting affects all teachers |
| Ensures coverage | True--but at cost of responsiveness |
| Reduces inequity | Mixed--depends on script quality |
| Supports new teachers | Some evidence of benefit for novices |

**Counter-Arguments**:

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Reduces teaching to reading script | Professionals need discretion |
| Ignores student differences | Good teachers adapt to students |
| Demoralizes teachers | Contributes to attrition |
| May not fit context | One-size-fits-all fails |

### Standardization vs. Localization

**Standardization Advocates**:

- Ensure all students access rigorous content
- Reduce inequity from variable teacher quality
- Enable accountability and comparison
- Provide coherent progression

**Localization Advocates**:

- Respond to community values and needs
- Reflect local culture and history
- Enable teacher professionalism
- Adapt to student differences

**Evidence Base**:

Research suggests:

- High-quality curriculum matters more than autonomy level
- Implementation fidelity should be flexible within structure
- Teacher preparation affects how well autonomy is used
- Scripting may help weak teachers but constrain strong ones

## Opposition to Specific Content

### Sex Education Opposition

**Abstinence-Only Advocates**:

| Argument | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Abstinence is safest | True, but not realistic for all students |
| Comprehensive ed encourages sex | Research shows no increase in sexual activity |
| Parental values | Opt-out mechanisms available |
| Religious beliefs | Public schools must be secular |

**LGBTQ+ Content Opposition**:

| Argument | Counter-Argument |
|----------|------------------|
| Age-inappropriate | Age-appropriate recognition of LGBTQ+ families/people is appropriate |
| Religious objection | Public schools cannot impose religious views |
| Parental rights | LGBTQ+ students also have rights |
| Controversial | Recognition is not controversial to most Americans |

### Social-Emotional Learning Opposition

Some conservatives have targeted Social-Emotional Learning (SEL):

**Opposition Arguments**:

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Trojan horse for CRT | SEL predates CRT controversy; focuses on self-regulation, relationships |
| Replaces academics | Most SEL is supplementary, not replacement |
| Psychological manipulation | Evidence-based approaches to student wellbeing |
| Parents' role | Schools support, not replace, parental influence |

Research shows SEL programs improve academic outcomes and student wellbeing.

## Evaluating Opposition Claims

### Legitimate vs. Illegitimate Concerns

**Legitimate Concerns** (deserve engagement):

- Parents should have visibility into curriculum
- Age-appropriateness matters
- Standards should not be imposed without input
- Teacher autonomy should be balanced with accountability
- Implementation matters as much as standards

**Illegitimate Concerns** (based on misinformation):

- CRT is taught in K-12 (graduate framework, not K-12 content)
- Evolution is scientifically contested (it is not)
- Common Core was federal mandate (it was not)
- LGBTQ+ content "grooms" children (no evidence)

### Finding Common Ground

Possible areas of agreement:

- Transparency: Parents should know what is taught
- Quality: Curriculum should be rigorous and evidence-based
- Age-appropriateness: Content should match developmental level
- Respect: All students should feel respected in classrooms
- Process: Curriculum decisions should involve community input

Areas likely to remain contested:

- How to teach about race and inequality
- LGBTQ+ inclusion
- Religious perspectives in public schools
- Balance between local and state/national control
