# Education Governance: Current State

## The Problem Today

### The Fractured Landscape

American public education is governed through a Byzantine system of overlapping authorities, ambiguous responsibilities, and misaligned incentives. At any given moment:

- **13,500+ school districts** operate with varying degrees of autonomy
- **90,000+ school board members** make decisions affecting 50 million students
- **50 state education agencies** set different standards, testing regimes, and intervention frameworks
- **The federal government** provides roughly 8% of funding with limited control
- **7,000+ charter schools** operate under varied authorizer oversight
- **Hundreds of districts** are under some form of state intervention

The result is a governance system that is neither truly local nor effectively centralized, combining the worst elements of both: the parochialism of local control without its responsiveness, and the rigidity of state oversight without its consistency.

- Resource allocation decisions
- Teacher recruitment and retention
- Curriculum coherence
- School climate
- Community engagement

### On Equity

**Governance Inequities**

| Dimension | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| District boundaries | Segregate by race and class |
| Funding disparities | Local control perpetuates inequality |
| Board representation | Does not reflect student demographics |
| State intervention | Disproportionately in minority districts |
| Charter authorization | Uneven access to quality options |

### On System Efficiency

**Administrative Costs**

| District Size | Admin Cost per Pupil | Relative |
|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| <300 students | $3,000+ | Very high |
| 300-1,000 | $1,500-2,500 | High |
| 1,000-5,000 | $900-1,500 | Moderate |
| 5,000-25,000 | $700-1,000 | Efficient |
| >25,000 | $600-900 | Most efficient |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Fragmentation is the defining feature**: 13,500+ districts create massive inefficiency and inequity

2. **Board elections fail democracy**: Low turnout, uncontested races, and unrepresentative voters undermine legitimacy

3. **Superintendent churn disrupts improvement**: 3-5 year tenure prevents sustained reform

4. **State oversight is inconsistent**: Wide variation in intervention authority and willingness to use it

5. **Federal role is limited but important**: Civil rights enforcement and targeted funding matter

6. **Charter governance is often weaker**: Authorizer quality varies dramatically

7. **Recent years brought unprecedented upheaval**: Culture wars have destabilized governance

8. **No model consistently works**: Mayoral control, state intervention, and traditional boards all show mixed results

9. **The status quo harms vulnerable students**: Governance failures fall hardest on those with least power

10. **Reform requires political will**: Technical solutions exist but face entrenched opposition
