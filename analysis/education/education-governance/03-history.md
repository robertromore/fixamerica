# Education Governance: History

## Origins

### Colonial Foundations (1600s-1770s)

American education governance traces to colonial Massachusetts, where the 1647 "Old Deluder Satan Act" required towns to establish schools. This established the foundational principle that would shape American education for centuries: **local communities bear responsibility for educating their children**.

**Early Characteristics**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Town control | Schools governed by town meetings |
| Religious purpose | Education for religious literacy |
| Local funding | Property taxes and fees |
| Limited access | Primarily white male property owners' children |
| No state role | Colonies provided minimal oversight |

This hyper-local model reflected colonial realities: dispersed population, limited transportation, strong local identity, and suspicion of distant authority.

### Constitutional Silence (1787)

The Constitution makes no mention of education, leaving it to the states under the 10th Amendment. This silence was not accidental:

**Why Education Was Omitted**

- Education seen as local/family matter
- Fear of federal power
- States jealously guarded authority
- No perceived need for uniformity
- Religious diversity made consensus impossible

**Consequence**: Education became a state responsibility by default, with states largely delegating to localities. This created the foundation for 13,000+ independent districts.

## Key Turning Points

### The Common School Movement (1830s-1860s)

**Horace Mann and the Massachusetts Model**

Horace Mann, as Massachusetts Secretary of Education (1837-1848), pioneered state involvement in education:

| Innovation | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| State Board of Education | Oversight and standards |
| Normal schools | Teacher training |
| Compulsory attendance | Universal access |
| Standardized curriculum | Common learning |
| Professional administrators | School superintendents |

**Spread of the Model**

- By 1860, most Northern states had state boards
- Compulsory attendance laws spread
- Professional superintendents became common
- But local boards retained primary authority

**Tensions Established**

The Common School era established enduring tensions:

- State standards vs. local control
- Professional expertise vs. community governance
- Universal access vs. local preferences
- Secular curriculum vs. religious values

### Post-Civil War Expansion (1865-1900)

**Reconstruction and Federal Interest**

The Freedmen's Bureau (1865-1872) represented the first significant federal involvement in education, establishing schools for formerly enslaved people. This brief federal role was:

- Opposed by Southern whites
- Abandoned after Reconstruction
- Left Black education to hostile state governments
- Established precedent of federal interest in equity

**Compulsory Education**

| Decade | States with Compulsory Attendance |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| 1870 | 14 states |
| 1890 | 27 states |
| 1918 | All states |

**The Rise of School Districts**

This era saw the proliferation of school districts as population spread westward:

- Districts formed around every community
- One-room schoolhouses with local boards
- Minimal coordination between districts
- Extreme variation in quality and resources

### Progressive Era Reforms (1890s-1920s)

**The Professionalization Movement**

Progressive reformers sought to remove education from "politics" by:

| Reform | Goal | Result |
|--------|------|--------|
| Non-partisan elections | Remove party influence | Reduced turnout, accountability |
| At-large elections | Eliminate ward politics | Reduced minority representation |
| Smaller boards | Efficient decision-making | Less community voice |
| Professional superintendents | Expert management | Shifted power from boards |
| Off-cycle elections | Separate from "political" races | Dramatically lower turnout |

**Consolidation Begins**

| Year | Number of Districts |
|------|---------------------|
| 1900 | ~200,000 |
| 1920 | ~130,000 |
| 1940 | ~117,000 |
| 1960 | ~40,000 |
| 1980 | ~16,000 |
| 2000 | ~14,000 |
| 2020 | ~13,500 |

**The Irony of Progressive Reform**

Progressives succeeded in "depoliticizing" school governance by:

- Making elections low-information, low-turnout affairs
- Shifting power to professionals
- Reducing community voice
- Creating conditions for later capture by organized interests

These "reforms" created many problems we still face today.

### Desegregation Era (1954-1980)

**Brown v. Board of Education (1954)**

The Supreme Court's decision forced federal engagement with education governance:

| Development | Impact on Governance |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Court orders | Federal judges oversee districts |
| Busing | Governance of assignment |
| White flight | District fragmentation accelerates |
| Massive resistance | State-local conflicts |
| Federal enforcement | DOJ role in education |

**The Creation of Suburban Districts**

Desegregation orders accelerated the fragmentation of metropolitan education:

- White families fled to suburbs
- New suburban districts formed
- District boundaries became segregation tools
- *Milliken v. Bradley* (1974) limited cross-district remedies
- Metropolitan fragmentation locked in inequality

**Federal Role Expands**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1965 | Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) |
| 1965 | Title I created for disadvantaged students |
| 1972 | Title IX for gender equity |
| 1975 | IDEA for special education |
| 1979 | Department of Education established |

### Excellence and Accountability Movement (1983-2001)

**A Nation at Risk (1983)**

This report launched an era of state standards and accountability:

| Shift | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| State standards | States define what students should know |
| State testing | States measure achievement |
| School accountability | States rate schools |
| "Systemic reform" | Aligned standards, curriculum, assessment |

**Governors Take the Lead**

Education became a gubernatorial priority:

- 1989 Education Summit (Bush 41 + governors)
- Goals 2000 legislation
- State-level reform initiatives
- National standards debates

**This era shifted power toward states while largely preserving local governance structures.**

### No Child Left Behind Era (2002-2015)

**NCLB's Governance Impact**

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Annual testing mandate | Federal requirement on states |
| Adequate Yearly Progress | States must identify failing schools |
| Sanctions escalation | Required interventions |
| Highly qualified teachers | Federal teacher requirements |
| 100% proficiency goal | Unrealistic mandate |

**State Response**

- States created accountability systems
- Some states resisted federal requirements
- Gaming of the system common
- Growing backlash from left and right

**Alternative Governance Models Emerge**

| Model | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| State takeover | Newark (1995), Detroit (1999) |
| Mayoral control | Chicago (1995), NYC (2002) |
| Recovery districts | New Orleans (2003) |
| Charter expansion | National growth |
| Emergency managers | Michigan cities |

### The Modern Era (2009-Present)

**Race to the Top (2009)**

Obama-era competitive grants pushed governance reforms:

- State adoption of Common Core (later controversial)
- Teacher evaluation systems
- Charter authorization reforms
- Turnaround models for failing schools
- Limited direct governance changes

**State Takeovers and Their Limits**

| District | Years Under State Control | Outcome |
|----------|---------------------------|---------|
| Newark | 1995-2018 | Returned to local control |
| New Orleans | 2003-2018 | All-charter system, controversial |
| Detroit | 1999-2005, 2009-2016 | Multiple interventions, limited success |
| Camden | 2013-present | Ongoing |
| Gary, IN | 2017-present | Ongoing |

**ESSA and Federal Retreat (2015)**

Every Student Succeeds Act significantly reduced federal role:

- States design own accountability
- States choose interventions
- Reduced federal prescription
- Local control rhetoric ascendant

**The Culture War Turn (2020-Present)**

Recent years have seen governance transformed by:

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| COVID response | Board conflicts over masks, closures |
| "CRT" controversy | Ideological board campaigns |
| Book bans | Conservative board mobilization |
| LGBTQ+ issues | Highly contentious policies |
| Parent activism | "Parents' rights" legislation |

## Lessons from the Past

### What History Teaches Us

**1. Local Control Is Contingent, Not Constitutional**

Local control is a policy choice made by states, not a constitutional requirement. States have always had authority to restructure governance but have chosen not to exercise it due to political resistance.

**2. "Reform" Often Has Unintended Consequences**

Progressive-era reforms designed to "depoliticize" education:

- Reduced democratic participation
- Created conditions for interest group capture
- Shifted power away from communities
- Made governance less representative

**3. Federal Role Expands in Crisis**

Federal involvement grows when states fail to address major problems:

- Desegregation required federal intervention
- Educational equity required Title I
- Civil rights required federal enforcement
- But federal role is always contested

**4. Governance Structures Embed Inequality**

District boundaries created in the 19th century:

- Segregate students by race and class
- Lock in property tax inequalities
- Prevent metropolitan cooperation
- Are extremely resistant to change

**5. Professional vs. Democratic Control Is an Enduring Tension**

Every era has debated:

- Should experts or communities decide?
- What is the proper role of elected boards?
- How much autonomy should superintendents have?
- This tension has no permanent resolution

**6. Governance Follows Political Power**

Major governance changes happen when:

- Crises create political opportunity (desegregation, A Nation at Risk)
- Political coalitions align (mayoral control in cities)
- Courts mandate action (desegregation orders)
- Normal politics rarely produces structural change

**7. Consolidation Happened Once, Then Stopped**

The dramatic reduction from 200,000 to 14,000 districts (1900-1970) happened because:

- Transportation improvements enabled larger districts
- States mandated consolidation
- Communities accepted change

But consolidation largely stopped by the 1980s as:

- Remaining districts had political power
- Suburban districts resisted inclusion
- Local control ideology strengthened
- Rural communities fought to keep schools

### Patterns That Persist

**The Permanence of Fragmentation**

Despite decades of research showing fragmentation is inefficient and inequitable, the basic structure persists because:

- Beneficiaries of fragmentation are politically powerful
- Losers are diffuse and disorganized
- "Local control" rhetoric is compelling
- Alternative models lack clear success stories

**The Cycle of Reform and Retreat**

Education governance repeatedly cycles through:

1. Crisis identified
2. Reform momentum builds
3. Changes implemented
4. Resistance emerges
5. Reforms weakened or abandoned
6. Return to status quo
7. New crisis emerges

**The Failure of State Intervention**

Despite multiple attempts, state takeovers have generally failed to produce sustained improvement because:

- States lack capacity for direct operation
- Political will fades
- Local resentment undermines cooperation
- Turnaround is harder than oversight
