# Education Governance: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Education governance reform primarily occurs through state legislation, as states have constitutional authority over education and delegate governance to local districts. This document provides model legislation for the key reforms identified in this analysis: election reforms, governance structure changes, transparency requirements, and state intervention frameworks.

## State Model Legislation

### School Board Election Timing Act (Model)

**Purpose**: Require school board elections to be held concurrent with state or federal general elections to increase voter participation.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] School Board Election Timing Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:
(a) School board elections held separate from state and federal elections
    result in extremely low voter turnout, often below 10 percent of
    registered voters.
(b) Low turnout elections produce governing bodies that do not reflect
    the preferences of the broader community.
(c) Holding school board elections concurrent with general elections
    increases voter participation by 25 to 35 percentage points.
(d) Increased participation strengthens democratic accountability for
    public education.
(e) Concurrent elections reduce costs by sharing election infrastructure.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

For purposes of this Act:
(a) "General election" means the election held on the first Tuesday
    after the first Monday in November of even-numbered years.
(b) "School board" means the governing board of a school district,
    however designated.
(c) "School district" means any local educational agency established
    pursuant to state law.

SECTION 4. ELECTION TIMING REQUIREMENT.

(a) GENERAL REQUIREMENT.—Beginning with the [year] general election,
    all elections for school board members shall be held concurrent
    with the general election.

(b) TERM ADJUSTMENTS.—Current school board members shall have their
    terms adjusted as follows:
    (1) Terms scheduled to expire in odd-numbered years shall be
        extended to the following even-numbered year.
    (2) No term shall be shortened by this provision.

(c) SPECIAL ELECTIONS.—Special elections to fill vacancies may be
    held at times other than the general election, provided that:
    (1) The vacancy occurs less than 180 days before the next
        general election; and
    (2) The seat shall be filled by appointment until the next
        general election.

SECTION 5. BALLOT PLACEMENT.

(a) School board races shall be placed on the general election ballot
    in a manner that ensures visibility to voters.

(b) The [Secretary of State] shall promulgate rules ensuring
    consistent ballot placement across jurisdictions.

SECTION 6. FILING DEADLINES.

(a) Filing deadlines for school board candidates shall be aligned
    with filing deadlines for state and federal candidates.

(b) The [Secretary of State] shall establish uniform filing procedures.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act takes effect immediately and applies to all school board
elections occurring after [date].
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4**: Core requirement moving elections to November even years
- **Section 4(b)**: Transition mechanism that doesn't shorten existing terms
- **Section 5**: Ensures school board races are visible on ballot
- **Section 6**: Aligns administrative procedures

### School Board Ward Election Act (Model)

**Purpose**: Replace at-large school board elections with ward-based elections to improve representation.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] School Board Representation Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:
(a) At-large election systems often result in governing boards that
    do not reflect the diversity of the communities they serve.
(b) Ward-based elections increase representation of geographic
    communities and historically underrepresented groups.
(c) Ward-based elections reduce campaign costs, enabling a broader
    range of candidates to run.
(d) Improved representation strengthens democratic governance of
    public schools.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

For purposes of this Act:
(a) "Ward" means a geographic subdivision of a school district from
    which one school board member is elected.
(b) "At-large" means an election system in which all voters in a
    district vote for all board positions.

SECTION 4. WARD ELECTION REQUIREMENT.

(a) APPLICABILITY.—This section applies to school districts with
    enrollment exceeding [5,000] students.

(b) WARD REQUIREMENT.—Applicable districts shall elect school board
    members from wards, except that:
    (1) Up to two board positions may be elected at-large in
        districts with seven or more board members; and
    (2) The board chair position may be elected at-large.

(c) WARD DRAWING.—

        or, if none exists, by [designated authority].

        (A) Equal in population to the extent practicable;
        (B) Contiguous;
        (C) Reasonably compact;
        (D) Drawn to comply with the Voting Rights Act;
        (E) Respectful of communities of interest.
    (3) Wards shall not be drawn with the intent to favor or
        disfavor any political party, incumbent, or candidate.

(d) WARD REVISION.—Wards shall be redrawn following each decennial
    census.

SECTION 5. TRANSITION.

(a) Districts shall implement ward elections no later than the
    [second] election following enactment of this Act.

(b) Current at-large board members shall complete their terms and
    be assigned to wards based on residence for purposes of
    determining which seats are contested.

(c) Staggered terms shall be maintained by holding elections for
    different ward positions in different cycles.

SECTION 6. EXEMPTION.

(a) A district may apply to the [State Board of Education] for
    exemption from this requirement upon showing that:
    (1) An alternative system achieves equivalent representation; and
    (2) The alternative system has been approved by [vote/process].

(b) Exemptions shall be reviewed every [10] years.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act takes effect immediately.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4(a)**: Applies to larger districts where at-large most problematic

|-------|--------|------------|
| November crowding | Voters may skip board races on long ballots | Information overload |
| Partisan contamination | National politics may affect local races | On-cycle design |
| Reduced education focus | Board issues subsumed in larger election | Attention competition |
| Implementation complexity | Transition creates administrative burden | Change management |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Ballot placement standards**: Require board races appear in consistent, prominent location
2. **Term transition guidance**: Detailed regulations on term adjustments
3. **Special election limits**: Cap number of special elections per cycle
4. **Voter guide requirements**: Mandate candidate information in voter guides
5. **Transition support**: Fund administrative assistance for districts

### School Board Ward Election Act

#### Potential Loopholes

|----------|-------------|----------|
| Ward gerrymandering | Boundaries drawn to advantage incumbents or parties | Critical |
| Exemption abuse | Districts may seek exemptions to avoid compliance | High |
| Population deviation | Unequal wards dilute representation | Medium |
| Definition of "communities of interest" | Vague standard allows manipulation | Medium |

| Sustainability questions | Improvements may not persist post-intervention | Systemic issues |
| Teacher/staff morale | Intervention demoralizes workforce | Change management |

3. **Maximum intervention duration**: Hard cap with mandatory exit planning
4. **Administrator evaluation**: Annual independent assessment
5. **Community engagement mandate**: Specific requirements for community involvement
6. **Capacity building**: State investment in intervention support office
7. **Sustainability planning**: Exit plan development begins at intervention start

### Mayoral Control Authorization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

4. **Community engagement metrics**: Measurable engagement requirements
5. **Education priority commitment**: Mayor must make education commitment publicly
