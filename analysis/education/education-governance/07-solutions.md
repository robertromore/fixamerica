# Education Governance: Solutions

## Overview

Effective governance reform must address multiple root causes simultaneously: fragmentation, low participation, misaligned incentives, and lack of accountability. No single solution addresses all problems, but a combination of reforms can significantly improve how education decisions are made and who makes them.

## Election Reforms

### Move to On-Cycle Elections

**The Problem**

Off-cycle school board elections produce 5-10% turnout, enabling organized interests to dominate and making outcomes unrepresentative of the community.

**The Solution**

Mandate that school board elections be held concurrent with state or federal general elections.

**Evidence**

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| On-cycle elections increase turnout by 25-35 percentage points | Multiple studies |
| Higher turnout reduces union influence | Political science research |
| More representative electorate | Demographic studies |
| Minimal additional cost | Share election infrastructure |

**Implementation**

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| State legislation | Mandate on-cycle for all districts |
| Transition period | Phase in over 1-2 cycles |
| Term alignment | Adjust terms to match general election years |
| Ballot placement | Ensure board races visible on ballot |

**Expected Impact**

| Metric | Before | After (Projected) |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Turnout | 5-10% | 35-50%+ |
| Uncontested races | 40-50% | 20-30% |
| Voter demographics | Older, whiter | More representative |
| Interest group influence | High | Reduced |

### Replace At-Large with Ward Elections

**The Problem**

At-large elections allow majority groups to dominate all seats, diluting minority representation and reducing neighborhood voice.

**The Solution**

Divide districts into geographic wards, with each ward electing its own representative.

**Evidence**

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Ward elections increase minority representation | Voting rights research |
| More diverse candidates run | Electoral studies |
| Neighborhood issues get attention | Case studies |
| Increased engagement in ward | Local election research |

**Implementation**

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Ward design | Population-equal, compact, contiguous |
| Mixed systems | Consider hybrid (some ward, some at-large) |
| Transition | Phase in as terms expire |
| Boundary process | Independent commission for ward lines |

**Considerations**

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|-----------|--------------|
| Better minority representation | May increase parochialism |
| Clearer accountability | Districts focus on own ward |
| Lower campaign costs | May increase conflict on board |
| Neighborhood voice | Less system-wide thinking |

### Improve Candidate Quality

**The Problem**

Few qualified candidates run for school board; those who do often have narrow agendas or conflicts of interest.

**The Solution**

Create conditions that attract qualified, public-spirited candidates.

**Reforms**

| Reform | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Board compensation | Make service viable for working people |
| Campaign finance limits | Reduce wealth advantage |
| Public financing | Lower barriers to entry |
| Disclosure requirements | Expose conflicts of interest |
| Term limits | Create openings, prevent entrenchment |
| Training requirements | Ensure competence |

**Compensation Models**

| Model | Amount | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Volunteer | $0 | Limits who can serve |
| Stipend | $5,000-15,000/year | Modest recognition |
| Part-time salary | $25,000-50,000/year | Enables broader service |
| Per meeting | $100-500/meeting | Rewards participation |

### Ranked Choice Voting for Boards

**The Problem**

Plurality elections can elect candidates opposed by majority; multiple candidates split similar voter pools.

**The Solution**

Implement ranked choice voting (RCV) for school board elections.

**Benefits**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Majority support | Winners have broad backing |
| Reduced negative campaigning | Candidates seek second-choice votes |
| Better candidate quality | Incentivizes coalition-building |
| Representation | Multiple candidates don't split vote |

## Governance Structure Reforms

### Mayoral Control

**The Concept**

Transfer primary governance authority from elected school board to mayor, who appoints board members and/or directly selects superintendent.

**Models**

| Model | Cities | Structure |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Full mayoral control | NYC, Boston | Mayor appoints all board members |
| Partial control | Cleveland | Mayor appoints some, others elected |
| Integrated management | Various | Schools part of city government |

**Evidence on Mayoral Control**

| Finding | Context |
|---------|---------|
| Improved test scores | NYC, Boston, DC showed gains |
| More stability | Longer superintendent tenure |
| Better financial management | Professional city staff involved |
| Accountability clarity | One person responsible |
| Mixed civil rights record | Depends on mayor's priorities |

**Design Considerations**

| Element | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Board role | Advisory vs. approval authority |
| Superintendent selection | Mayor direct vs. board with mayor approval |
| Budget authority | Integrated vs. separate |
| Term alignment | Coincide with mayoral term or not |
| Reauthorization | Sunset requiring renewal |

**Arguments For**

1. Clear accountability (one person responsible)
2. Integration with city services
3. Professional management capacity
4. Longer superintendent tenure
5. Reduced political dysfunction

**Arguments Against**

1. Loss of direct democratic control
2. Education may not be priority
3. Concentrates power
4. Mixed track record
5. May reduce community voice

**When Mayoral Control May Work**

- Large cities with capable mayors
- Severe board dysfunction
- Clear public mandate for change
- Strong accountability mechanisms
- Civil rights protections in place

### Appointed/Hybrid Boards

**The Concept**

Replace fully elected boards with appointed members or hybrid elected/appointed structures.

**Models**

| Model | Structure | Examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Fully appointed | Governor or mayor appoints all | Some state takeovers |
| Hybrid | Mix of elected and appointed | Virginia localities |
| Nominating commission | Independent body screens candidates | Rare |
| Ex officio | Officials serve by virtue of position | Historical models |

**Design Elements**

| Element | Options |
|---------|---------|
| Appointing authority | Mayor, governor, council, commission |
| Qualifications | Education expertise, community representation |
| Terms | Staggered vs. simultaneous |
| Confirmation | Council approval required |
| Removal | Cause required vs. at will |

**Hybrid Board Design**

| Configuration | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|
| 5 elected, 4 appointed | Maintains democratic majority |
| 4 elected, 4 appointed, 1 neutral | Balance with tiebreaker |
| Ward elected + at-large appointed | Local + citywide perspectives |
| Parent elected + expert appointed | Stakeholder + expertise |

### Independent School Governance Boards

**The Concept**

Create independent boards focused solely on governance, separate from political structures.

**Models**

| Model | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Portfolio management | Board oversees multiple school types |
| Performance contract | Board sets goals, providers deliver |
| Regional education service agency | Multi-district governance |

## State-Level Reforms

### Strengthen State Intervention Authority

States have constitutional responsibility but often lack effective tools to address failing districts.

**The Solution**

Create graduated intervention frameworks with clear triggers and meaningful powers.

**Intervention Framework**

| Level | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Watch | Performance concerns | Enhanced monitoring |
| Warning | Continued decline | Corrective action plan |
| Probation | Plan failure | State oversight of operations |
| Intervention | Severe failure | State assumes some authority |
| Takeover | Persistent failure | State assumes full control |

**Design Principles**

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Clear triggers | Objective criteria, not political |
| Graduated response | Escalate based on progress |
| Capacity building | Support before takeover |
| Time limits | Intervention has exit plan |
| Local voice preserved | Community input continues |
| Academic focus | Student outcomes drive decisions |

### Improve State Takeover Effectiveness

**Why Takeovers Often Fail**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| State lacks operational capacity | Build capacity before assuming control |
| Political interference | Insulate from governor/legislature |
| Community alienation | Maintain community engagement |
| No exit strategy | Plan return to local control |
| Wrong interventions | Focus on instruction, not just governance |

**Better Takeover Design**

| Element | Improvement |
|---------|-------------|
| Duration | Time-limited with renewal option |
| Governance | Independent board, not state agency |
| Leadership | Recruit proven turnaround leaders |
| Resources | Additional funding during intervention |
| Accountability | Clear metrics for success/failure |
| Exit criteria | Defined conditions for return |

### District Consolidation

**The Problem**

13,500+ districts create massive inefficiency and prevent regional coordination.

**The Solution**

State-mandated or incentivized consolidation of small and fragmented districts.

**Models**

| Approach | States | Method |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Mandatory | Historical (most stopped) | State law requires merger |
| Incentivized | Various | Financial incentives for voluntary |
| Regional services | Many | Shared services without full merger |
| Minimum size | Some | Eliminate districts below threshold |

**Evidence on Consolidation**

| Finding | Context |
|---------|---------|
| Administrative savings | 10-15% in overhead |
| Service improvements | Better special programs |
| Mixed academic results | Depends on implementation |
| Community resistance | Often intense |
| Transportation costs | May increase |

**Implementation Principles**

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Community voice | Input on configuration |
| Transition support | Resources for merger |
| Employee protection | Gradual workforce adjustment |
| Local presence | Maintain community schools where viable |
| Accountability | Clear metrics for success |

| Authorizer standards | National quality expectations |
| Performance contracts | Clear outcome requirements |
| Closure authority | Close low-performers |
| Conflict prohibitions | No self-dealing |
| Financial oversight | Prevent fraud and waste |
| Authorizer accountability | Evaluate authorizer quality |

## Community Engagement Reforms
