# Education Governance: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Education governance reform requires a strategic, sequenced approach that builds momentum while managing opposition. This roadmap provides a realistic timeline for implementing reforms, recognizing that change will vary by state and local context. The key is to sequence reforms so that early wins create political capital and constituency for harder changes.

## Strategic Framework

### Sequencing Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Build from consensus | Start with reforms that have broader support |
| Create early wins | Quick victories build momentum |
| Develop constituencies | Each reform should create supporters for next |
| Address legitimate concerns | Respond to valid opposition |
| Plan for backlash | Anticipate and prepare for resistance |
| Institutional sustainability | Create structures that survive political change |

### Political Context Assessment

Before pursuing any reform, assess local conditions:

| Factor | Assessment Questions |
|--------|---------------------|
| Political leadership | Who supports reform? Governor, legislators, mayor? |
| Coalition potential | What groups could unite for change? |
| Opposition strength | How organized and powerful are opponents? |
| Public opinion | Is there demand for change? |
| Crisis opportunity | Is there a catalyst for action? |
| Legal landscape | What changes require legislation vs. local action? |
