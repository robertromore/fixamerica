# K-12 Public Education: Stakeholders

## Overview

Education policy affects more people directly than almost any other policy domain. Nearly 50 million students attend public schools, supported by 3.7 million teachers and staff, governed by thousands of school board members, regulated by 50 state education agencies, and funded by taxpayers in every community. Understanding who these stakeholders are, what they want, and how much power they have is essential for designing reforms that can actually be implemented.

## Power Analysis

| Wealthy suburbs | High | Political influence, exit option |
| Teacher unions | Medium-high | Numbers, organization, expertise |

### Power Imbalances

**Those Who Need Change Have Least Power**

- Students most affected, least powerful
- Low-income and minority families face barriers to participation
- Teachers have voice but limited policy influence

**Those Who Benefit from Status Quo Have Most Power**

- Wealthy communities protect advantages through political influence
- Industry benefits from existing testing and accountability regimes
- Those with exit options (choice, private school) less invested in public system

### Coalition Dynamics

**Traditional Coalition for Public Education**

- Teacher unions + Democrats + civil rights groups
- Supports: funding, integration, teacher voice
- Weakened by: reform movement, Republican gains, fragmentation

**Education Reform Coalition**

- Centrist Democrats + some Republicans + foundations + charters
- Supports: choice, accountability, teacher evaluation
- Weakened by: backlash, Trump era partisan realignment

**Conservative/Choice Coalition**

- Republicans + religious conservatives + libertarians
- Supports: vouchers, ESAs, parental rights, curriculum control
- Strengthened by: pandemic, culture wars, state-level gains

**Potential Equity Coalition** (not yet fully formed)

- Civil rights groups + progressive educators + community organizations
- Could support: equitable funding, integration, community schools
- Challenged by: fragmentation, competing priorities

## Key Takeaways

1. **Power is unequally distributed**: Those who most need change have least influence

2. **Students are stakeholders, not just recipients**: Their interests often overlooked in adult debates

3. **Parents are diverse, not monolithic**: "Parent voice" often means affluent parent voice

4. **Teacher interests align with students on resources, may diverge on accountability**

5. **Private sector has enormous influence**: Industry and philanthropy shape policy without democratic accountability

6. **Coalition-building is essential**: No single stakeholder can achieve reform alone

7. **Local control advantages privileged communities**: State and federal action needed for equity
