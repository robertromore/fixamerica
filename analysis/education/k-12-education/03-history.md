# K-12 Public Education: History

## Overview

American public education evolved from a decentralized, locally controlled patchwork into a vast system serving tens of millions, yet it retained the structural features of its origins: local funding, fragmented governance, and dramatic inequalities. Understanding this history illuminates why reforms have been so difficult and what patterns must be broken to achieve genuine equality of educational opportunity.

## Timeline of Key Developments

### Colonial Era to Common Schools (1600s-1850s)

**1647: Massachusetts Bay Colony**

- "Old Deluder Satan Act" requires towns of 50+ households to hire a schoolmaster
- First American law mandating public education
- Purpose: ensure children could read the Bible and resist Satan
- Reality: sporadic compliance, wide variation in quality

**Early 1800s: The Patchwork Era**

- No system of public education in most areas
- Wealthy families hired tutors or sent children to private academies
- Charity schools served some poor children
- Enslaved people legally prohibited from learning to read in most Southern states
- Education seen as family and church responsibility, not government's

**1837-1848: Horace Mann and the Common School Movement**

- Mann becomes first Secretary of Massachusetts Board of Education
- Argues for universal, free, publicly funded schools
- Goals: create common civic identity, assimilate immigrants, reduce crime
- Innovations: trained teachers (normal schools), graded classrooms, standardized curriculum
- Spread to other Northern states by 1860

**Key Features of Common Schools**

- Locally controlled and funded
- Primarily for white children
- Protestant religious instruction assumed
- Girls included but often with different curriculum
- One-room schoolhouses typical in rural areas

### Post-Civil War to Progressive Era (1865-1920)

**1865-1880: Reconstruction and Its Failure**

- Freedmen's Bureau establishes schools for formerly enslaved people
- Black communities sacrifice to build schools despite poverty
- 600,000+ Black students enrolled by 1870
- Reconstruction ends; Southern states systematically defund Black schools
- "Separate but equal" doctrine emerges (never actually equal)

**1868: Fourteenth Amendment**

- Equal protection clause later becomes basis for desegregation
- At the time, does not immediately affect education
- States retain near-total control over schools

**1896: *Plessy v. Ferguson***

- Supreme Court upholds "separate but equal"
- Legitimizes Jim Crow segregation for next 58 years
- Southern states spend 2-10x more on white students than Black students

**1890-1920: Progressive Era Reforms**

- Compulsory attendance laws enacted in all states
- High school movement expands secondary education
- Vocational education added (often tracking poor and immigrant students)
- Age-grading and standardized curricula spread
- Teaching becomes professionalized (still predominantly female, low-paid)

**1917: Smith-Hughes Act**

- Title III: Supplementary services
- Title VI: Research and development
- First major federal investment in K-12
- Structured to flow through states (respecting federalism)
- Still reauthorized as foundation of federal education law

### The Equity Era (1965-1980)

**1966: Coleman Report**

- Massive study of educational equality
- Controversial finding: family background matters more than school resources
- Often misinterpreted to mean "schools can't matter"
- Actually showed schools can compensate, but rarely do
- Sparked decades of debate about school effects

**1968: *Green v. County School Board***

- Supreme Court demands desegregation "now"
- Ends "freedom of choice" plans that maintained segregation
- Triggers actual integration in South

**1971: *Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg***

- Approves busing as desegregation remedy
- Peak of court-ordered integration
- White flight accelerates in affected districts

**1973: *San Antonio v. Rodriguez***

- Supreme Court rules property tax funding doesn't violate U.S. Constitution
- Education not a "fundamental right" under federal Constitution
- Forces equity litigation to state courts
- Perhaps most consequential education case after *Brown*

**1974: *Milliken v. Bradley***

- Prohibits inter-district desegregation remedies
- Allows suburban districts to remain segregated
- Effectively ends meaningful desegregation in metropolitan areas
- "Perhaps the greatest missed opportunity of that period" (Gary Orfield)

- Sparks standards-based reform movement
- Critics note selective use of data, Cold War framing

**1989: Charlottesville Education Summit**

- Governors and President Bush set national education goals
- "By 2000, American students will be first in the world in math and science"
- Goals not achieved, but process establishes standards framework

**1991: Minnesota Enacts First Charter School Law**

### No Child Left Behind Era (2001-2015)

**2002: No Child Left Behind (NCLB)**

- Bipartisan legislation (Ted Kennedy and George W. Bush)
- Requires annual testing in grades 3-8 and once in high school
- 100% proficiency goal by 2014 (impossible, never achieved)
- Disaggregated data by subgroups (race, income, disability)
- Schools failing to meet targets face escalating sanctions

**NCLB's Core Features**

| Feature | Intent | Reality |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Annual testing | Measure progress | Teaching to test, narrowed curriculum |
| Subgroup accountability | Expose gaps | Gaming through exclusions |
| Escalating sanctions | Force improvement | Labels without support |
| "Highly qualified teacher" | Improve instruction | Paperwork compliance |
| School choice provision | Exit failing schools | Few actually transferred |

**NCLB's Legacy**

- Made achievement gaps visible through data
- Created national expectation of standards and testing
- Pushed states toward more rigorous assessments
- Generated backlash against high-stakes testing
- Labeled thousands of schools as "failing"
- Did not close achievement gaps or reach proficiency goals

**2009: Race to the Top**

- Obama administration competitive grants ($4.35 billion)
- States competed by adopting reforms:
    - Common Core standards
    - Teacher evaluation tied to test scores
    - Charter school expansion
    - Data systems
- Drove rapid policy change in 46 states
- Created backlash against federal "coercion"

**2010: Common Core State Standards**

- Developed by states (National Governors Association, CCSSO)
- Initially adopted by 45+ states
- Math and English Language Arts standards
- Designed to be internationally benchmarked
- Became politically controversial; several states withdrew

### ESSA and Beyond (2015-Present)

**2015: Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)**

- Bipartisan reauthorization of ESEA
- Maintains testing requirements
- Returns accountability design to states
- Reduces federal intervention authority
- Multiple measures beyond test scores allowed
- Weakens consequences for low performance

**2017-2020: DeVos Era**

- Emphasis on school choice
- Reduced civil rights enforcement
- Proposed but failed to pass federal vouchers
- States continued pursuing varied approaches

**2020-2023: Pandemic and Recovery**

- School closures (varied by state/district from weeks to 18 months)
- $190 billion in federal relief
- Learning loss documented across all groups
- Chronic absenteeism doubled
- Teacher exodus accelerated
- Enrollment declined, especially in early grades

## Funding History

### The Property Tax Foundation

**How It Developed**

- Colonial schools funded by local taxes and tuition
- Common schools added state support but kept local base
- Property tax became dominant (60%+ of funding through 1970s)
- Wealthy communities could tax themselves at lower rates and raise more money
- Poor communities taxed at higher rates but raised less

**The Self-Reinforcing Cycle**

```text
High Property Values
        ↓
More Tax Revenue → Better Schools → Higher Property Values
        ↓
Attracts Wealthy Families → Higher Property Values (repeat)

Low Property Values
        ↓
Less Tax Revenue → Struggling Schools → Lower Property Values
        ↓
Families Leave → Lower Property Values (repeat)
```

### State Finance Reform Litigation

**Wave 1: Equity (1970s-1980s)**

- *Serrano v. Priest* (California, 1971): Property tax system violates state constitution
- Led to Proposition 13 (1978): Tax revolt that capped property taxes
- California went from top 10 in spending to bottom third
- Lesson: equity without adequacy can mean equally low funding

**Wave 2: Adequacy (1989-Present)**

- *Rose v. Council for Better Education* (Kentucky, 1989): Courts define what education must provide
- Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) - comprehensive state overhaul
- Shifted focus from equal inputs to sufficient outcomes
- 28 states have had adequacy rulings

**Current State of Finance Litigation**

| Era | Focus | Results |
|-----|-------|---------|
| Equity (1970s-80s) | Equal spending | Mixed; sometimes equalized down |
| Adequacy (1989-2010) | Sufficient funding | Major reforms in several states |
| Post-recession | Maintaining gains | Backsliding in many states |
| Current | Enforcement | Courts often can't compel compliance |

### Federal Funding Evolution

| Era | Federal Share | Primary Programs |
|-----|--------------|------------------|
| Pre-1965 | <3% | Vocational, impacted aid |
| 1965-1980 | 8-10% | Title I, special education |
| 1980-2000 | 6-8% | Reduced under Reagan |
| 2000-2020 | 8-10% | Title I, IDEA, competitive grants |
| 2020-2024 | 12-15% (temporary) | Pandemic relief funds |

## Desegregation and Re-segregation

### Integration's Rise and Fall

**Peak Integration (1988)**

- Southern schools most integrated in nation
- Black students in majority-white schools: 44% (South)
- Court orders and federal enforcement worked
- Academic gains documented for integrated students

**Re-segregation (1990s-Present)**

| Year | Black Students in Majority-White Schools (South) |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1968 | 23% |
| 1988 | 44% (peak) |
| 2000 | 31% |
| 2011 | 23% (back to 1968 levels) |
| 2020 | 20% |

**Causes of Re-segregation**

- *Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. Dowell* (1991): Districts can be released from court orders
- *Freeman v. Pitts* (1992): Partial unitary status allowed
- *Parents Involved v. Seattle* (2007): Limits voluntary integration programs
- White flight and demographic change
- Housing segregation (never addressed)
- Charter schools often more segregated than district schools

## Key Lessons from History

### Patterns That Persist

1. **Local control protects inequality**: The commitment to local funding and governance ensures that wealthy communities maintain advantages

2. **Federal intervention required for equity**: Every major equity advance (desegregation, Title I, IDEA) required federal action over state resistance

3. **Backlash follows progress**: Common school movement met nativist resistance; desegregation met massive resistance; standards movement met anti-testing backlash

4. **Courts can open doors but can't walk through them**: *Brown*, *Serrano*, *Rose* required political will for implementation that often didn't materialize

5. **Structural inequality outlasts programmatic fixes**: Title I has operated for 60 years without closing achievement gaps because funding gaps remain

### What Has Actually Worked

| Reform | Evidence of Success | Why It Worked |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Desegregation (when implemented) | Gains for Black students, no harm to white | Resources redistributed, expectations raised |
| Intensive early childhood | Long-term academic and life outcomes | Addresses gaps before they compound |
| School finance reform (adequacy-focused) | Gains in reformed states | More resources to high-need schools |
| High-dosage tutoring | Significant academic gains | Individualized, intensive support |
| Smaller class sizes (K-3) | Measurable gains, especially for disadvantaged | More attention per student |
