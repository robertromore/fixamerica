# K-12 Public Education: Overview

America's public K-12 education system serves approximately 50 million students across 13,000 school districts, yet produces outcomes that lag behind peer nations and perpetuate rather than reduce inequality. The system's fundamental flaw is structural: funding tied to local property taxes creates vast disparities between wealthy and poor communities, while governance fragmented across 50 states and thousands of districts ensures inconsistent standards and unequal opportunities.
