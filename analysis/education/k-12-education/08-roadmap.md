# K-12 Public Education: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Education reform requires sustained action across multiple levels of government over extended periods. Quick fixes and silver bullets don't work. This roadmap provides a realistic sequencing of reforms, identifying what can be done immediately, what requires building toward, and what depends on prior changes.

## Strategic Framework
