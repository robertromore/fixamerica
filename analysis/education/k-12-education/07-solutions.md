# K-12 Public Education: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Core Values

**Equity**

- Every student deserves an excellent education regardless of zip code
- Resources should follow need, not property wealth
- Concentrated disadvantage requires concentrated investment

**Adequacy**

- Funding must be sufficient to meet educational goals
- Standards without resources are empty promises
- Base funding plus weighted supplements for high-need students

**Quality**

- Inputs matter, but so does how resources are used
- Teacher quality is the most important in-school factor
- Accountability should drive improvement, not punishment

**Integration**

- Diverse schools benefit all students
- Concentrated poverty harms achievement
- Housing and school policy must align

### Criteria for Evaluating Solutions

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Evidence | Does research support effectiveness? |
| Equity | Does it reduce or exacerbate gaps? |
| Feasibility | Can it be implemented at scale? |
| Political viability | Can a coalition be built? |
| Sustainability | Will it last beyond initial push? |

## Funding Reform

### Weighted Student Funding

**How It Works**

- Base allocation per student (e.g., $12,000)
- Additional weights for high-need students
- Funds follow students, not schools
- State distributes based on student count and characteristics

**Weight Categories**

| Student Characteristic | Typical Weight | Rationale |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Low-income | +20-40% | Additional supports, smaller classes |
| English learner | +20-50% | Language instruction, translation |
| Student with disability | +50-200% | IEP implementation, specialists |
| Foster care | +15-25% | Stability services, counseling |
| Concentrated poverty | +10-25% | Whole-school interventions |

**Example: California's Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)**

- Base grant per student: ~$10,000
- Supplemental (low-income, EL, foster): +20%
- Concentration (>55% high-need): Additional +50% of base for high-need portion
- Result: High-need districts receive significantly more

**Evidence**

- Studies show additional funding improves outcomes
- Effects larger for low-income students
- Weighted funding more equitable than flat funding
- Implementation matters (must get to classrooms)

### State Funding Adequacy

**The Adequacy Standard**

- What does it cost to provide an education that meets state standards?
- Studies calculate costs using:
    - Professional judgment (what would experts recommend?)
    - Successful schools (what do effective schools spend?)
    - Evidence-based (what do proven interventions cost?)

**Current Underfunding**

| State | Adequacy Gap (Per Pupil) | Total Annual Gap |
|-------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Arizona | -$7,600 | $8 billion |
| North Carolina | -$5,400 | $8 billion |
| Pennsylvania | -$4,800 | $4.6 billion |
| Texas | -$4,100 | $22 billion |
| **National** | **-$2,300 average** | **$150 billion** |

**How to Increase State Funding**

- Increase progressive state income taxes
- Expand sales tax base (services)
- Reduce corporate tax loopholes
- Dedicated funding (lottery, marijuana taxes)
- State constitutional amendments

### Federal Investment

**Current Federal Role**

- 8% of K-12 funding
- Categorical programs (Title I, IDEA)
- No general aid, no equalization

**Proposed Expansion: Title I Tripling**

Current Title I: ~$18 billion
Proposed: ~$60 billion
Mechanism: Increase per-pupil allocation, better targeting

**New Federal Equity Grants**

- Match state investments in equity
- Reward states that equalize funding
- Target persistent funding gaps
- Supplement, not supplant state efforts

## Teacher Quality and Distribution

### Competitive Compensation

**The Pay Gap Problem**

- Teachers earn 20%+ less than comparable professionals
- Gap discourages talented candidates
- Hardest-to-staff positions pay the same as easiest

**Salary Solutions**

| Approach | Description | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Across-the-board raises | Increase all salaries | Improves recruitment, mixed retention effects |
| Differential pay | More for hard-to-staff subjects/schools | Can improve distribution if large enough |
| Career ladders | Higher pay for master teachers | Retains effective teachers in classroom |
| Housing assistance | Help with high-cost areas | Addresses cost of living barriers |

**Target**: Bring teacher salaries to parity with comparable professionals

### Teacher Preparation Reform

**Problems with Current Preparation**

- Quality varies wildly across programs
- Clinical experience often insufficient
- Theory-heavy, practice-light
- Weak connection to student outcomes

**Evidence-Based Improvements**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Rigorous entry requirements | Higher academic standards, selective admission |
| Extended clinical practice | Full year in schools before lead teaching |
| Co-teaching residencies | Learn alongside experienced mentor |
| Strong partnerships with districts | Programs embedded in high-need schools |
| Data on graduate effectiveness | Track outcomes, improve based on evidence |

**Model: Teacher Residency Programs**

- 1-year residency in high-need school
- Mentorship by expert teacher
- Coursework integrated with practice
- Commitment to serve in district
- Higher retention rates than traditional programs
- Examples: Boston, Denver, Memphis

### Teacher Distribution

**Why Great Teachers Avoid High-Need Schools**

- More challenging working conditions
- Same pay as easier assignments
- Less support and resources
- Higher stress, burnout risk
- Seniority transfer rules let veterans leave

**Solutions**

| Strategy | Description | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Large incentive pay | $10,000+ for high-need assignments | Can work if large enough |
| Grow-your-own programs | Recruit from community, train to return | Strong community connection |
| Working conditions improvements | Smaller classes, more support staff, better facilities | Addresses root cause |
| Limit transfer rights | Prevent displacement of newer teachers | Union opposition, but improves equity |
| Team teaching | Place in supportive teams, not alone | Reduces isolation, builds capacity |

### Teacher Development and Retention

**Why Teachers Leave**

- Low pay relative to alternatives
- Poor working conditions
- Lack of support and mentorship
- Student behavior challenges
- Political attacks and distrust

**Retention Strategies**

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Induction programs | Multi-year support for new teachers |
| Mentorship | Pairing with experienced colleagues |
| Collaboration time | Built-in planning with peers |
| Reduced class loads | Manageable student numbers |
| Career advancement | Leadership roles without leaving classroom |
| Respect and autonomy | Professional treatment |

## School and District Improvement

### Evidence-Based Instruction

**High-Impact Strategies**

| Strategy | Effect Size | Cost |
|----------|-------------|------|
| High-dosage tutoring | 0.37 SD | High |
| Feedback to students | 0.70 SD | Low |
| Direct instruction | 0.60 SD | Medium |
| Small class sizes (K-3) | 0.20 SD | High |
| Extended learning time | 0.10-0.20 SD | Medium |

**High-Dosage Tutoring**

- 3+ sessions per week, 30+ minutes each
- Small group (1:1 to 1:4)
- During school day (not optional)
- Trained tutors (need not be certified teachers)
- Strong evidence from multiple studies
- Cost: $2,000-$4,000 per student per year

**Structured Curriculum**

- High-quality curriculum materials
- Teacher training on implementation
- Consistency across classrooms
- Research shows curriculum matters more than often acknowledged

### Community Schools Model

**What Community Schools Provide**

| Component | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| Integrated student supports | Mental health, counseling, case management |
| Expanded learning time | Before/after school, summer programs |
| Family engagement | Parent education, family services |
| Collaborative leadership | Community partnership, shared decision-making |
| Health services | Clinics, dental, vision |
| Community partnerships | Nonprofits, businesses, universities |

**Evidence**

- Meta-analyses show positive effects on academics and attendance
- Particularly effective in high-poverty communities
- Addresses out-of-school factors
- Builds community capacity

**Model: Cincinnati Community Learning Centers**

- 50+ schools transformed
- Academic gains, especially for lowest performers
- Reduced chronic absenteeism
- Community hubs beyond school day

### School Turnaround

**What Doesn't Work**

- School closure (disrupts students, spreads problem)
- Replacing staff wholesale (loses institutional knowledge)
- Short-term interventions (improvement takes time)
- Punishment without support

**What Does Work**

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Strong principal | Effective leader with autonomy and support |
| Teacher team rebuilding | Gradual, strategic changes |
| Extended time | More learning time for students who need it |
| Intensive intervention | Additional supports, smaller groups |
| Sustained commitment | 5+ years of consistent effort |

**Improvement vs. Takeover**

- State takeovers often fail to improve outcomes
- District-led improvement with support more promising
- Requires investment, not just sanctions

## Accountability Reform

### Beyond Test-Based Accountability

**Problems with Current Approach**

- Narrow focus on tested subjects
- Teaching to test, narrowed curriculum
- Punishes schools for demographics
- Doesn't actually improve instruction

**Multiple Measures**

| Indicator | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| Academic growth | Progress, not just proficiency |
| Graduation rates | Completion |
| Chronic absenteeism | Engagement |
| School climate surveys | Safety, belonging |
| Access to opportunities | Courses, experiences |
| Post-secondary readiness | Career and college preparation |

**ESSA Dashboard Model**

- Multiple indicators, not single rating
- Transparent data without single "failing" label
- Focus on improvement over time
- Trigger support, not punishment

### Reciprocal Accountability

**The Concept**

- If state holds schools accountable, state must provide resources
- Accountability without adequacy is unjust
- States must meet their obligations too

**Implementation**

- Adequacy standard defines state obligation
- Schools accountable for effective use
- Both sides have responsibilities
- Courts can enforce

## School Integration

### Why Integration Matters

**Evidence of Benefits**

| Outcome | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Academic achievement (minority students) | Significant gains |
| Academic achievement (white students) | No harm, sometimes gains |
| Critical thinking | Improved |
| Workforce readiness | Better cross-racial skills |
| Civic participation | Increased |

### Integration Strategies

**Voluntary Choice Programs**

- Magnet schools with integration goals
- Controlled choice with diversity criteria
- Inter-district transfer programs
- Require transportation, outreach

**District Redesign**

- Redraw boundaries for diversity
- Attendance zones crossing neighborhoods
- Paired schools (students attend both)
- Consolidate small districts regionally

**Housing Policy**

- Inclusionary zoning for affordable housing
- Affirmatively furthering fair housing
- Break link between housing and school assignment

### Legal Constraints

**Current Limitations**

- *Parents Involved* limits race-conscious assignments
- Socioeconomic integration generally permissible
- *Milliken* prevents most inter-district remedies
- Voluntary programs can work within limits

## Technology Integration

### What Works

| Use | Evidence |
|-----|----------|
| Personalized practice | Modest positive effects |
| Teacher productivity tools | Saves time |
| Data systems for instruction | Can inform teaching |
| Access (closing device gap) | Essential equity |

### What Doesn't Work

| Use | Evidence |
|-----|----------|
| Replacing teachers with software | Negative |
| Unstructured computer time | Neutral to negative |
| Technology without training | Wasted investment |
| Online-only instruction | Inferior to in-person |

### Pandemic Technology Lessons

- Devices are necessary but not sufficient
- Connectivity remains an equity issue
- Teacher skill with technology matters
- Student engagement harder online
- Hybrid/online works for some students, not all

## Pandemic Recovery

### Learning Loss Response

**High-Dosage Tutoring at Scale**

- Evidence-based approach
- During school day, not optional
- Federal funding available (ESSER)
- Challenge: staffing at scale

**Extended Learning Time**

- Summer programs (if high-quality, not just more of same)
- Extended school day
- Intersession (breaks during year with enrichment)

**Accelerated instruction, not remediation**

- Provide support while teaching grade-level content
- Don't track students backward
- Just-in-time scaffolding

### Chronic Absenteeism Response

**Why Students Aren't Attending**

| Barrier | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Health issues | School-based health services |
| Mental health | Counseling, social-emotional support |
| Transportation | Reliable, free transportation |
| Disengagement | Engaging instruction, relationships |
| Family responsibilities | Support services, flexible scheduling |
| Housing instability | McKinney-Vento services |

**Evidence-Based Attendance Interventions**

- Personalized outreach (mentors, home visits)
- Addressing specific barriers for each student
- Positive reinforcement, not punishment
- School climate improvement
- Parent engagement
