# K-12 Public Education: Current State

## The Problem Today

### A System Designed for Inequality

America's K-12 education system operates as 13,000 separate systems, each with its own funding, governance, standards, and outcomes. This fragmentation is not accidental but reflects deliberate choices to prioritize local control over equal opportunity. The result is a system where a child's educational prospects depend more on their zip code than their potential.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated these inequalities. Affluent districts pivoted quickly to remote learning with devices and connectivity; poor districts struggled with spotty internet and no laptops. Two years later, the learning loss disproportionately affects low-income students and students of color, threatening to widen achievement gaps for a generation.

### National Assessment Results

**NAEP Scores (2022)**

The "Nation's Report Card" shows persistent mediocrity and inequality:

| Subject/Grade | Proficient or Above | Basic or Above | Below Basic |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 4th Grade Reading | 33% | 66% | 34% |
| 8th Grade Reading | 31% | 69% | 31% |
| 4th Grade Math | 36% | 72% | 28% |
| 8th Grade Math | 26% | 62% | 38% |

**Pandemic Decline (2019-2022)**

| Subject/Grade | Score Change | Years of Progress Lost |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 4th Grade Reading | -3 points | ~0.5 years |
| 8th Grade Reading | -3 points | ~0.5 years |
| 4th Grade Math | -5 points | ~0.8 years |
| 8th Grade Math | -8 points | ~1.2 years |

The math declines were the largest ever recorded on NAEP.

## Recent Developments

### Pandemic Response and Recovery

**Federal Relief Funding**

| Program | Amount | Timeline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| CARES Act (ESSER I) | $13.5 billion | 2020 |
| CRRSA (ESSER II) | $54 billion | 2021 |
| American Rescue Plan (ESSER III) | $122 billion | 2021-2024 |
| **Total** | **$190 billion** | Must spend by 2024 |

**How Districts Are Using Funds**

| Category | % of Spending |
|----------|---------------|
| Staffing (teachers, aides, counselors) | 35% |
| Facilities (HVAC, ventilation) | 20% |
| Technology | 15% |
| Academic interventions (tutoring, summer) | 15% |
| Social-emotional supports | 10% |
| Other | 5% |

**Concerns**

- Funds are one-time; commitments (staff) are ongoing
- "Fiscal cliff" looming as funds expire (September 2024)
- Much spending on short-term fixes rather than systemic change
- Learning recovery insufficient to close pandemic gaps

### Enrollment Decline

**Trends**

| Year | Public School Enrollment | Change |
|------|-------------------------|--------|
| 2019 | 50.8 million | -- |
| 2020 | 49.4 million | -1.4 million |
| 2021 | 49.5 million | Flat |
| 2022 | 49.6 million | +0.1 million |
| 2023 (est.) | 49.4 million | -0.2 million |

**Where Students Went**

| Alternative | Estimated Increase |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Homeschooling | +700,000 |
| Private schools | +200,000 |
| Charter schools | +200,000 |
| Dropped out / disengaged | +300,000 |

### Chronic Absenteeism Crisis

**Definition**: Missing 10% or more of school days (18+ days/year)

| Period | Chronically Absent |
|--------|-------------------|
| Pre-pandemic | 15% |
| 2020-21 | 28% |
| 2021-22 | 30% |
| 2022-23 | 26% |

Chronic absenteeism is now nearly double pre-pandemic levels and correlates strongly with learning loss.

### Curriculum and Culture Wars

**State Actions (2021-2023)**

| Type of Legislation | States Enacted | Bills Introduced |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Restricting "CRT" or race discussions | 18 | 200+ |
| Restricting LGBTQ+ content | 12 | 150+ |
| Book bans/challenges | 30+ | 2,500+ books challenged |
| "Parental rights" bills | 15 | 100+ |

**Impact on Teachers**

- Self-censorship to avoid controversy
- Confusion about what can be taught
- Some teachers leaving due to political climate
- Chilling effect on honest history and literature instruction

### School Safety

**Violence Trends**

| Year | School Shootings (K-12) | Deaths |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| 2019 | 24 | 8 |
| 2020 | 10 | 2 |
| 2021 | 34 | 9 |
| 2022 | 46 | 34 (including Uvalde) |
| 2023 | 38 | 12 |

**Response Measures**

- Increased school resource officers (controversial effectiveness)
- Active shooter drills (impact on student mental health debated)
- Hardening measures (limited evidence of effectiveness)
- Threat assessment programs (more promising evidence)

## State-by-State Variation

### High-Performing States

| State | NAEP 4th Math | Graduation Rate | Per-Pupil Spending | Key Factors |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Massachusetts | 248 | 90% | $18,000 | High standards, strong teacher prep |
| New Jersey | 247 | 91% | $21,000 | Equitable funding (Abbott districts) |
| Minnesota | 246 | 84% | $15,000 | Strong early childhood programs |
| Connecticut | 241 | 89% | $20,000 | High spending, persistent gaps |

### Low-Performing States

| State | NAEP 4th Math | Graduation Rate | Per-Pupil Spending | Key Factors |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| New Mexico | 221 | 77% | $12,000 | High poverty, funding inadequacy |
| Alabama | 229 | 92%* | $11,000 | Low spending, weak standards |
| Louisiana | 231 | 84% | $13,000 | Recovery from Katrina ongoing |
| Mississippi | 232 | 88% | $10,000 | Recent gains from reforms |

*Some states have inflated graduation rates due to weak standards.

### Notable Reform States

**Florida**

- Aggressive school choice expansion
- Strong accountability system
- Reading improvement gains
- Large gaps remain

**Texas**

- Large, diverse system (5.5 million students)
- Regressive funding system
- Teacher shortage crisis
- Some urban district gains

**California**

- Largest system (6 million students)
- Shifted to weighted funding (LCFF)
- Eliminated most testing sanctions
- Mixed results, persistent gaps

## Key Takeaways

1. **Spending matters, but so does how it's spent**: High-spending states generally outperform, but allocation and effective use are crucial

2. **Gaps are structural, not natural**: Achievement gaps reflect opportunity gaps in funding, teaching, and support

3. **Teacher crisis is real and worsening**: Shortages, turnover, and demoralization threaten instructional quality

4. **Pandemic set back progress by years**: Learning loss and disengagement especially severe for disadvantaged students

5. **Absenteeism is now chronic**: Nearly double pre-pandemic rates, undermining all other interventions

6. **Political conflicts distract from core mission**: Culture wars consume energy and drive away educators

7. **Federal relief is expiring**: $190 billion in one-time funds runs out in 2024, risking fiscal cliff

8. **Public confidence is declining**: Enrollment shifts, satisfaction drops, and polarization threaten public education's future
