# Special Education: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Reforming special education requires legislative action at federal and state levels, regulatory implementation, and potentially constitutional protection in states. This document provides model legislation, analysis of existing law, and identification of legal loopholes that undermine the promise of equal educational opportunity for students with disabilities.

## Constitutional Considerations

### Federal Constitution

**Current Status**

- Constitution does not mention education
- No federal constitutional right to education (*San Antonio v. Rodriguez*, 1973)
- 10th Amendment reserves education to states
- Equal protection applies but has limited reach for disability

**IDEA as Spending Clause Legislation**

- Congress cannot mandate special education directly
- IDEA operates through conditions on federal funding
- States voluntarily accept funds and conditions
- "Clear and unambiguous" condition requirement (*Pennhurst*, 1981)

**Civil Rights Framework**

- Section 504 of Rehabilitation Act (federal fund recipients)
- ADA Title II (state and local governments)
- 14th Amendment equal protection (limited application)
- Together provide floor below which districts cannot fall

### State Constitutions

**Education Clauses**

Every state constitution addresses education, creating potential basis for disability rights:

- Many require "thorough and efficient" education for all children
- Some courts have found this includes students with disabilities
- State equal protection may be stronger than federal
- Some states have explicit disability provisions

**Examples of State Constitutional Litigation**

- *Claremont School District v. Governor* (NH 1997): Education clause requires adequate funding
- *Rose v. Council for Better Education* (KY 1989): Adequacy includes all students
- *Abbott v. Burke* (NJ series): Multiple decisions requiring equity

## Federal Legislation

### IDEA Full Funding Act (Model)

**Purpose**: Fulfill the 40% funding promise made in 1975 by creating mandatory appropriation for full federal share.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "IDEA Full Funding Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(a) In 1975, Congress enacted the Education for All Handicapped
    Children Act, now known as the Individuals with Disabilities
    Education Act (IDEA), guaranteeing a free appropriate public
    education to all children with disabilities.
(b) Congress authorized federal funding at 40 percent of the
    national average per-pupil expenditure times the number of
    students with disabilities served.
(c) Federal funding has never approached 40 percent, currently
    providing approximately 13-15 percent of excess cost.
(d) This chronic underfunding shifts billions of dollars annually
    to states and local school districts, creating an unfunded
    mandate that undermines services to students with disabilities.
(e) Adequate funding is essential to providing the free appropriate
    public education that IDEA promises.

SEC. 3. MANDATORY APPROPRIATIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities
    Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) is amended by adding
    at the end the following:

    "SEC. 620. MANDATORY APPROPRIATIONS.

    "(a) IN GENERAL.—There are appropriated, out of any money
        in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums as
        are necessary to carry out sections 611 and 619 at the
        full authorized level.

    "(b) FULL AUTHORIZED LEVEL.—For purposes of this section,
        the full authorized level shall be an amount equal to
        40 percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in public
        elementary schools and secondary schools in the United
        States (as determined under section 611(b)(1)) multiplied
        by the number of children with disabilities in the State
        who are receiving special education and related services.

    "(c) PHASE-IN.—
        "(1) The Secretary shall phase in the full authorized
            level over a period of 7 fiscal years.
        "(2) Annual increases shall be equal amounts designed
            to reach the full authorized level by the seventh
            fiscal year.
        "(3) In no event shall annual appropriations be less
            than the prior fiscal year.

    "(d) INFLATION ADJUSTMENT.—Beginning in the fiscal year
        following full implementation, appropriations shall be
        adjusted annually for inflation as measured by the
        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers."

SEC. 4. MAINTENANCE OF STATE EFFORT.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 612(a)(18) of the Individuals with
    Disabilities Education Act is amended by adding at the end:

    "(D) ENHANCED MAINTENANCE.—
        "(i) IN GENERAL.—A State receiving additional funds
            resulting from the mandatory appropriations under
            section 620 may not reduce State or local
            expenditures for the education of children with
            disabilities below the level of such expenditures
            for the fiscal year preceding enactment of the
            IDEA Full Funding Act.
        "(ii) EXCEPTION.—The Secretary may waive the
            requirement of clause (i) if the State demonstrates
            that exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances
            such as a natural disaster or extreme and unforeseen
            economic downturn make compliance impossible."

SEC. 5. OUTCOME ACCOUNTABILITY.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 616 of the Individuals with Disabilities
    Education Act is amended to add:

    "(h) OUTCOME REQUIREMENTS.—
        "(1) States receiving funds at the full authorized level
            shall demonstrate improved outcomes for students with
            disabilities including:
            "(A) Increased graduation rates
            "(B) Improved post-secondary outcomes
            "(C) Increased inclusion in general education
            "(D) Reduced disproportionality
        "(2) States failing to demonstrate progress shall be
            subject to corrective action under subsection (e)."
```

**Explanation**

- **Section 3**: Makes appropriations mandatory (like Medicare, Social Security) rather than discretionary
- **Section 3(c)**: Phases in over 7 years to allow system adjustment
- **Section 4**: Prevents states from reducing their own effort
- **Section 5**: Ties funding to outcomes, not just compliance

**Challenges**

- Significant budget impact (~$30+ billion annually when fully implemented)
- Mandatory spending is difficult to enact
- Appropriations committees protect jurisdiction
- Political will for large education spending uncertain

            each child with a disability.
        "(C) DETERMINATION.—Removal from the general education
            environment may occur only when the nature or
            severity of the disability is such that education
            in general education classes with the use of
            supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved
            satisfactorily.
        "(D) DOCUMENTATION.—Before placing any child with a
            disability in a setting other than the general
            education classroom, the IEP team shall document:
            "(i) The supplementary aids and services considered

## Regulatory Framework

### Federal Regulations Needed

| Area | Regulatory Need |
|------|-----------------|
| LRE implementation | Standards for documenting placement decisions |
| Disproportionality | Standard methodology for determination |
| Restraint/seclusion | Federal standards if legislation fails |
| Transition | Stronger outcome requirements |
| Parent rights | Clearer procedural safeguard requirements |
| Endrew F. implementation | Guidance on "appropriate progress" standard |

### State Regulations Needed

| Area | Regulatory Need |
|------|-----------------|
| Caseload limits | Maximum students per special education teacher |
| Inclusion requirements | Standards for LRE implementation |
| Evaluation timelines | Specific deadlines and consequences |
| IEP quality | Standards beyond minimal compliance |
| Paraprofessional training | Minimum training requirements |
| Complaint investigation | Timelines and enforcement procedures |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Maintenance of effort waivers | States can request waivers reducing state funding | High |
| "Voluntary" funding | 40% authorization never appropriated; discretionary | High |
| LRE "appropriateness" escape | Broad discretion to determine general education "not appropriate" | High |
| Disproportionality methodology variation | States set own standards; can avoid identification | High |
| Parent exhaustion bypass | Districts can wait out parents who cannot afford due process | Medium |
| IEP procedural focus | Compliance with process even when outcomes poor | High |
| Caseload absence | No federal limits on teacher caseloads | Medium |
| Paraprofessional standards | Minimal federal requirements for training | Medium |
| Private placement disputes | Complex litigation advantages districts | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No mandatory funding | Chronic underfunding persists | Authorization vs. appropriation distinction |
| Weak enforcement | Violations rarely result in consequences | Political constraints on federal action |
| State variation | Wildly different experiences by geography | Federalism; state discretion |
| Due process barriers | Only wealthy families can enforce rights | Cost and complexity of process |
| Outcome accountability missing | Compliance focus over results | System designed around process |
| Inclusion not required | Segregation continues as default | Broad LRE language; lack of resources |
| Workforce crisis unaddressed | Teacher shortages harm students | No federal solution to compensation |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Make IDEA funding mandatory**: Remove from discretionary appropriations; guarantee 40% funding as entitlement similar to Medicaid

2. **Strengthen LRE presumption**: Create rebuttable presumption of general education placement; require documentation before removal; fund inclusion supports

3. **Standardize disproportionality**: Federal methodology all states must use; lower thresholds; meaningful consequences for failure to address

4. **Improve enforcement**: Actual funding consequences for noncompliance; more frequent monitoring; outcome-based accountability

5. **Reduce due process barriers**: Shift burden of proof to districts nationally; fund parent representation; streamline procedures

6. **Address workforce**: Federal compensation supplements; loan forgiveness expansion; residency program funding; caseload standards

7. **Mandate restraint/seclusion protections**: Federal legislation if states do not act; clear prohibitions and requirements

8. **Strengthen transition**: Earlier planning; outcome accountability; interagency coordination requirements

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|-----------|
| Political will for funding | Build coalition; demonstrate costs of not funding |
| State resistance | Phase in requirements; provide technical assistance |
| District capacity | Resources before accountability |
| Maintaining gains | Constitutional or statutory protections |
| Unintended consequences | Pilot programs; monitoring; adjustment |

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Federal**

- Spending power provides basis for IDEA conditions
- Cannot mandate directly; must tie to funding
- Clear statement required for conditions
- States can theoretically withdraw (but none have)

**State**

- State education clauses may require adequate special education
- State equal protection may be stronger than federal
- Some states have explicit disability protections
- Litigation can compel legislative action

### Preemption

| Federal Law | State Impact |
|-------------|--------------|
| IDEA | Sets floor; states can exceed |
| Section 504 | Applies regardless of IDEA acceptance |
| ADA | Independent obligations |
| Civil Rights Act | Applies to discrimination |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Strength | Weakness |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| IDEA funding conditions | Significant if enforced | Never actually withheld |
| Due process hearings | Individual remedy | Expensive, slow |
| State complaints | Less adversarial | Often weak remedies |
| OCR complaints | Federal investigation | Dependent on administration |
| Section 1983 litigation | Damages possible | Limited applicability |
| State court litigation | Can compel funding | Long timeline |
