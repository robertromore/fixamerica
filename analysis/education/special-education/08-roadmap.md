# Special Education: Roadmap

## Implementation Philosophy

Reforming special education requires action at multiple levels simultaneously, but sequencing matters. This roadmap prioritizes:

1. **Foundation first**: Funding and workforce are prerequisites for other reforms
2. **Leverage points**: Federal action can catalyze state and local change
3. **Building blocks**: Some reforms enable others to succeed
4. **Political feasibility**: Start with achievable wins to build momentum
5. **Sustained effort**: Recognize that systemic change takes time

## Critical Dependencies

### Funding First

Many reforms cannot succeed without adequate funding:

- Inclusion requires support staff and training
- Workforce improvements require compensation investment
- Reduced caseloads require more teachers
- Transition services require community partnerships

### Workforce as Foundation

Quality services depend on quality workforce:

- Teachers must be prepared for inclusive practice
- Competitive compensation needed to attract and retain
- Caseloads must allow individualization
- Professional development must be ongoing

### Systems Integration

Special education reform must connect to:

- General education improvement
- Early childhood education expansion
- Adult disability services
- Healthcare and mental health systems

### Political Sustainability

Reforms must survive political changes:

- Build bipartisan coalitions
- Demonstrate results to sustain support
- Embed reforms in structures and regulations
- Engage diverse stakeholders

## Risks and Mitigation

### Funding Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Appropriations fail | Build coalition for full funding; use litigation as backup |
| States supplant | Strong MOE requirements; monitoring |
| Economic downturn | Make case for counter-cyclical investment |

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Inclusion without support | Require resources before placement change |
| Compliance focus | Outcome-based accountability |
| Local resistance | Technical assistance; consequences |

### Political Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Administration change | Embed in regulation and statute |
| State variation | Federal standards with flexibility |
| Backlash | Build broad coalition; demonstrate results |

### Unintended Consequences

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Over-identification for funding | Census-based alternatives; outcome focus |
| Under-identification to reduce costs | Monitoring; parent rights enforcement |
| Inclusion without quality | Quality indicators in accountability |
