# Special Education: Current State

## Enrollment and Demographics

### Overall Numbers

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B serves approximately 7.5 million students ages 3-21, representing about 15% of total public school enrollment. This percentage has grown steadily over decades as identification practices have evolved and new categories have been added.

| Category | Number | Percentage of IDEA |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Specific Learning Disability | 2.5 million | 33% |
| Speech/Language Impairment | 1.4 million | 19% |
| Other Health Impairment | 1.2 million | 16% |
| Autism | 850,000 | 11% |
| Developmental Delay | 480,000 | 6% |
| Intellectual Disability | 400,000 | 5% |
| Emotional Disturbance | 350,000 | 5% |
| Multiple Disabilities | 130,000 | 2% |
| Hearing Impairment | 70,000 | 1% |
| Orthopedic Impairment | 35,000 | <1% |
| Visual Impairment | 27,000 | <1% |
| Traumatic Brain Injury | 25,000 | <1% |
| Deaf-Blindness | 1,500 | <1% |

### Demographic Patterns

**By Race/Ethnicity**

- White students: 14% identified for special education
- Black students: 17% identified (overrepresentation)
- Hispanic students: 14% identified
- Asian students: 8% identified (underrepresentation)
- American Indian/Alaska Native: 18% identified (overrepresentation)

**By Gender**

- Male students: 67% of special education population
- Female students: 33% of special education population
- Boys identified 2:1 across most disability categories
- Gap particularly large for autism (4:1) and emotional disturbance (3:1)

**By Income**

- Students from low-income families overrepresented in special education
- However, autism identification higher in affluent communities
- Access to evaluation and services correlates with family resources

### Part C Early Intervention

IDEA Part C serves approximately 400,000 infants and toddlers (birth to age 3) with developmental delays or established conditions. Key statistics:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Children served | 400,000+ |
| Percentage of population | 3.5% of infants/toddlers |
| Average age at identification | 20 months |
| Transition to Part B (age 3) | 70% continue to need services |
| Family participation | 85% in family-directed services |

## Funding

### Federal IDEA Funding

**Historical Appropriations**

| Fiscal Year | Part B Funding | Percentage of Excess Cost |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 1980 | $874 million | 12% |
| 1990 | $1.5 billion | 8% |
| 2000 | $5.0 billion | 13% |
| 2010 | $12.6 billion | 17% |
| 2020 | $13.0 billion | 13% |
| 2024 | $15.5 billion | 13-15% (est.) |

**The 40% Promise**

When Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (now IDEA) in 1975, it authorized funding at 40% of the national average per-pupil expenditure multiplied by the number of students with disabilities. This "excess cost" formula acknowledged that educating students with disabilities costs more than general education.

Congress has never appropriated anywhere near 40%:

- Peak funding reached approximately 17-18% during ARRA stimulus (2009-2011)
- Current funding hovers at 13-15%
- The gap between 40% promise and actual funding: ~$30-40 billion annually

**Where Federal Dollars Go**

IDEA Part B funds flow to states by formula, then to districts. Uses include:

- Personnel costs (largest share): special education teachers, paraprofessionals
- Related services: speech therapy, occupational therapy, counseling
- Evaluation and assessment
- Supplementary aids and services
- Administrative costs (capped at 15% at state level)

### State Funding

States provide the majority of special education funding (typically 40-60% of total). Approaches vary:

**Weighted Student Funding**

- Most common approach
- Base funding multiplied by disability-category weights
- Weights range from 1.5x to 3.0x depending on severity
- Example: Texas weights range from 1.1 (speech) to 5.0 (residential placement)

**Census-Based Funding**

- Assumes fixed percentage of students need special education
- Funds district based on total enrollment, not actual count
- Reduces incentive for over-identification
- Used in California, Montana, and others

**Reimbursement Systems**

- States reimburse actual costs (or percentage thereof)
- May create incentive for more expensive placements
- Used in some form by New Jersey, Massachusetts

### Local Funding

Districts cover remaining costs through:

- Local property taxes (primary source)
- Medicaid reimbursement for health-related services
- General fund diversions from other programs
- Local bonds for facilities

**The Local Burden**

Low-wealth districts face severe disadvantages:

- Cannot generate sufficient property tax revenue
- More likely to have high-need populations
- State aid formulas may not fully compensate
- Result: underfunded programs, high caseloads, inadequate services

## Placement and Settings

### Least Restrictive Environment Data

IDEA requires students be educated with non-disabled peers "to the maximum extent appropriate." Current placement patterns:

| Setting | Percentage of Students |
|---------|----------------------|
| 80%+ time in general education | 67% |
| 40-79% time in general education | 17% |
| Less than 40% time in general education | 13% |
| Separate school (public or private) | 4% |
| Residential facility | 0.4% |
| Homebound/hospital | 0.4% |

### Variation by State

Inclusion rates vary enormously:

| State | 80%+ in General Education |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Alabama | 79% |
| Texas | 71% |
| New York | 62% |
| California | 56% |
| New Jersey | 48% |
| Illinois | 54% |

**High-Inclusion States** (>70% in general education):

- Alabama, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, Kansas

**Low-Inclusion States** (<55% in general education):

- New Jersey, Hawaii, Illinois, Connecticut, New York

### Variation by Disability

- Black students with emotional disturbance: 35% in general education 80%+ time
- White students with emotional disturbance: 48% in general education 80%+ time

## Outcomes

### Graduation Rates

| Metric | Rate |
|--------|------|
| Students with disabilities graduating with regular diploma | 72% |
| General education students | 87% |
| Gap | 15 percentage points |

**By Disability Category**

| Category | Graduation Rate |
|----------|----------------|
| Speech/Language Impairment | 83% |
| Specific Learning Disability | 76% |
| Other Health Impairment | 75% |
| Autism | 72% |
| Emotional Disturbance | 55% |
| Intellectual Disability | 47% |

### Post-Secondary Outcomes

**Employment** (ages 16-64):

- Adults with disabilities: 22% employed full-time
- Adults without disabilities: 59% employed full-time
- Employment gap has not improved in decades

**Post-Secondary Education**:

- Students with disabilities enrolling in higher education: 19%
- General population: 67%
- Of those enrolled, only 41% complete degrees (vs. 51% general)

**Living Independently**:

- Adults with disabilities living independently: 38%
- Higher rates of poverty, housing instability, institutionalization

### Academic Achievement

National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data:

| Grade/Subject | Students with Disabilities "Proficient" | All Students "Proficient" |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 4th Grade Reading | 13% | 35% |
| 8th Grade Reading | 9% | 34% |
| 4th Grade Math | 15% | 41% |
| 8th Grade Math | 8% | 34% |

## Workforce

### Teacher Supply

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Special education teachers employed | 470,000 |
| Unfilled positions | 40,000+ |
| Vacancy rate | 8% (vs. 4% general education) |
| Emergency/temporary certificates | 12% of special education teachers |

### Turnover

- Special education teacher annual turnover: 13%
- General education teacher turnover: 8%
- 50% of special education teachers leave within 5 years
- Rural and high-poverty districts experience highest turnover

### Caseloads

Average caseloads vary by state and setting:

| Setting | Typical Caseload |
|---------|-----------------|
| Resource room | 20-30 students |
| Self-contained classroom | 8-15 students |
| Itinerant services | 40-60 students |
| Early childhood | 8-12 students |

Many states lack enforceable caseload limits, resulting in:

- Teachers managing 40+ IEPs
- Inadequate time for individualization
- Paperwork consuming planning time
- Burnout and exodus from field

### Paraprofessionals

Special education relies heavily on paraprofessionals (aides):

- 500,000+ paraprofessionals in special education
- Median pay: $15/hour
- High turnover (higher than teachers)
- Minimal required training in most states
- Often provide majority of direct instruction to students with significant disabilities

## Dispute Resolution

### Due Process

| Metric | Annual Volume |
|--------|---------------|
| Due process complaints filed | 17,000 |
| Complaints resulting in hearing | 2,500 |
| Hearings completed | 1,500 |
| Decisions favoring parents | 35% |
| Decisions favoring districts | 65% |

**Costs**

- Average cost of due process for families: $10,000-30,000
- Average cost for districts: $15,000-50,000
- Cases involving attorneys cost more and take longer

### Mediation

- 8,000+ mediation sessions annually
- 75% reach agreement
- Faster and less costly than due process
- But no precedent set; recurring issues may not be addressed

### State Complaints

- 10,000+ state complaints annually
- State educational agencies investigate
- Can result in corrective action
- Less adversarial than due process

### Disparities in Access

Parents with resources far more likely to pursue dispute resolution:

- 90% of due process filings in top income quintile districts
- Low-income families lack awareness, time, legal support
- Settlements often confidential, preventing systemic change
- "Haves" secure services while "have nots" accept inadequate IEPs

## Compliance and Enforcement

### State Performance Plans

Each state submits annual performance data on 17 indicators:

- Graduation rates
- Dropout rates
- Participation and performance on assessments
- LRE placement
- Preschool outcomes
- Parent involvement
- Disproportionality
- Timely evaluation and transition

### Determinations

Department of Education makes annual determinations:

| Determination | Percentage of States |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Meets Requirements | 30% |
| Needs Assistance | 50% |
| Needs Intervention | 15% |
| Needs Substantial Intervention | 5% |

**Consequences**

- "Needs Assistance" for two consecutive years: technical assistance required
- "Needs Intervention": may direct use of funds
- "Needs Substantial Intervention": may withhold funds

**Enforcement Reality**

- Funds have never been withheld from a state
- Consequences are primarily technical assistance
- System relies on good faith compliance
- Districts with persistent violations face minimal sanctions

## Current Policy Debates

### Full Funding

- Multiple bills introduced to fully fund IDEA
- Bipartisan support in principle, but appropriations never follow authorization
- COVID relief provided temporary boost, now declining

### Discipline and Restraint/Seclusion

- Growing attention to use of restraint, seclusion, and corporal punishment
- Students with disabilities disproportionately subjected to these practices
- No federal ban; state laws vary widely
- Pending legislation would establish federal standards

### Inclusion and LRE

- Renewed attention to segregated settings
- States with low inclusion rates under scrutiny
- Debate over role of specialized schools, especially for deaf students

### Teacher Shortages

- Growing use of emergency certificates and alternative routes
- Questions about preparation quality
- Proposals for loan forgiveness, salary supplements

### Post-Pandemic Recovery

- Students with disabilities experienced greater learning loss
- Compensatory services disputes increasing
- Remote learning revealed gaps in accessible technology
