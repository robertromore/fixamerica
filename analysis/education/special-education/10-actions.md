## Sample Letters and Scripts

### Requesting Evaluation

"Dear [Special Education Director],

I am writing to request that my child, [name], be evaluated for special education services. I am concerned about [specific concerns, e.g., reading difficulties, attention issues, social skills]. I understand that the district has 60 days from the date of my written consent to complete the evaluation.

Please send me the consent forms and procedural safeguards. Thank you."

### Requesting IEP Meeting

"Dear [Case Manager],

I am writing to request an IEP meeting to discuss [specific concern, e.g., my child's lack of progress, proposed placement change, transition planning]. Under IDEA, parents may request an IEP meeting at any time.

Please contact me to schedule this meeting at a mutually convenient time. Thank you."

### Contacting Elected Officials

"Dear [Representative/Senator],

As a constituent concerned about special education, I urge you to support full funding of IDEA. Congress promised to fund 40% of the excess cost of special education in 1975, but federal funding has never exceeded 18%.

The chronic underfunding forces our local schools to divert resources from other programs or provide inadequate services to students with disabilities. Full funding would [describe local impact].

Please support appropriations that move toward the 40% commitment. Thank you."
