# Special Education: History

## Era of Exclusion (Pre-1970)

### Institutionalization and Segregation

For most of American history, children with disabilities were excluded from public education entirely. The dominant approaches were:

**Institutionalization**

- Children with intellectual disabilities, mental illness, and significant physical disabilities were placed in state institutions
- Conditions were often horrific: overcrowding, abuse, neglect
- Education within institutions was minimal or absent
- Families were advised to "put them away and forget about them"
- By 1967, over 200,000 people with intellectual disabilities lived in state institutions

**Exclusion from Public Schools**

- State laws explicitly permitted or required exclusion of children with disabilities
- "Uneducable" children could be turned away at the schoolhouse door
- Many states had compulsory education laws with disability exceptions
- As late as 1970, one million children with disabilities received no education
- Another 3.5 million received inadequate services

**Segregated "Special Classes"**

- Some children with mild disabilities were placed in separate classrooms
- These classes were often dumping grounds for "difficult" students
- Curriculum was limited; expectations were low
- Little connection to general education
- Disproportionately included poor and minority students

### Early Advocacy

The seeds of change came from several sources:

**Parent Organizations**

- 1950: National Association for Retarded Children (now The Arc) founded
- Parents organized to demand education for their children
- Established private schools where public schools refused service
- Built political coalition for legislative change

**Civil Rights Movement**

- *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954) established separate is inherently unequal
- Disability advocates drew parallels to racial segregation
- Legal strategies developed in civil rights context applied to disability

**Deinstitutionalization Movement**

- Exposés revealed abuses in state institutions
- *Christmas in Purgatory* (1966): photographic documentation of conditions
- Growing consensus that institutionalization was inhumane and unnecessary

## The Legal Foundation (1970-1975)

### PARC v. Pennsylvania (1971)

The Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children (PARC) filed a class action challenging Pennsylvania's laws permitting exclusion of children with intellectual disabilities. The consent decree established:

- All children with intellectual disabilities are capable of benefiting from education
- Education cannot be denied based on disability
- Placement must be in the least restrictive environment possible
- Parents have due process rights in placement decisions

**Significance**: First major legal victory establishing educational rights for children with disabilities.

### Mills v. Board of Education (1972)

Parents of children with various disabilities challenged the District of Columbia's exclusion of 18,000 students with disabilities. The court ruled:

- All children, regardless of disability, are entitled to public education
- Inadequate funding is not a valid excuse for exclusion
- Due process protections must be provided before changes in placement
- Extended protections beyond intellectual disability to all disabilities

**Key Quote**: "The District of Columbia's interest in educating the excluded children clearly must outweigh its interest in preserving its financial resources."

### State Legislation

Following PARC and Mills, states began passing their own laws:

- By 1975, all 50 states had some special education legislation
- Quality and coverage varied enormously
- Many laws lacked enforcement mechanisms
- Federal legislation became necessary to establish national floor

## The Landmark Law: EAHCA (1975)

### Education for All Handicapped Children Act

On November 29, 1975, President Ford signed Public Law 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. Key provisions:

**Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)**

- Every eligible child entitled to publicly funded education
- "Appropriate" to meet individual needs
- At no cost to parents
- Covering ages 3-21 (later expanded)

**Individualized Education Program (IEP)**

- Written plan developed for each child
- Must include present levels, goals, services, placement
- Annual review required
- Team includes parents, teachers, specialists

**Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)**

- Students must be educated with non-disabled peers "to the maximum extent appropriate"
- Removal from general education only when education cannot be achieved satisfactorily with supplementary aids and services
- Continuum of placements must be available

**Procedural Safeguards**

- Parents must provide consent for evaluation and initial placement
- Access to educational records
- Right to independent educational evaluation
- Impartial due process hearing
- Right to appeal

**Nondiscrimination in Identification**

- Evaluation must be nondiscriminatory
- Tests must be valid for purpose used
- Multiple sources of information required
- No single measure can be sole criterion

### The 40% Funding Promise

Section 611 of the Act authorized federal funding at:

- 5% of average per-pupil expenditure in 1978
- Rising to 40% of average per-pupil expenditure by 1982

This was Congress's acknowledgment that educating students with disabilities costs more than general education. The "excess cost" formula was meant to incentivize states while protecting local budgets.

**The Promise Was Never Kept**

- 1980: Funding reached only 12%
- Reagan administration proposed eliminating IDEA entirely (failed)
- Funding remained below 15% through 1990s
- Brief spike during ARRA stimulus (2009-2011) to ~17-18%
- Current: approximately 13-15%

## Judicial Interpretation

### Board of Education v. Rowley (1982)

**Issue**: What level of educational benefit is required for FAPE?

**Holding**: FAPE requires personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally. Does not require maximizing potential or best possible education.

**Impact**: Established floor, not ceiling, for services. Led to debates about what "benefit" means.

### Irving Independent School District v. Tatro (1984)

**Issue**: Are clean intermittent catheterization services required?

**Holding**: Health services that enable a child to attend school are "related services" under IDEA, unless they must be performed by a physician.

**Impact**: Distinguished "school health services" (required) from "medical services" (not required).

### Burlington School Committee v. Department of Education (1985)

**Issue**: Can parents be reimbursed for private placement?

**Holding**: If a district fails to provide FAPE and parents unilaterally place child in private school, reimbursement may be ordered.

**Impact**: Established private school reimbursement remedy; later codified in 1997 amendments.

### Honig v. Doe (1988)

**Issue**: Can a student with disabilities be expelled for dangerous behavior?

**Holding**: "Stay-put" provision prohibits expulsion during dispute resolution. Schools may suspend for up to 10 days and seek injunctive relief for truly dangerous students.

**Impact**: Strong protection against discriminatory discipline; led to 1997 amendments.

### Endrew F. v. Douglas County (2017)

**Issue**: What standard of educational benefit is required?

**Holding**: IEP must be "reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstances." Mere "de minimis" benefit is insufficient.

**Impact**: Raised the floor for FAPE; rejected minimal benefit standard.

### Fry v. Napoleon Community Schools (2017)

**Issue**: Must parents exhaust IDEA administrative procedures before filing ADA/Section 504 claims?

**Holding**: Exhaustion required only when relief sought is also available under IDEA. If parents seek remedies beyond IDEA (damages, not educational services), exhaustion may not be required.

**Impact**: Clarified relationship between IDEA and other disability laws.

## Recent Developments (2010-Present)

### Endrew F. Standard Application

Following the 2017 decision, courts have applied the heightened standard:

- More IEPs found to deny FAPE
- Greater attention to individualization
- Outcomes more relevant to adequacy analysis

### Discipline and Restraint/Seclusion

Growing attention to:

- Disproportionate discipline of students with disabilities
- Use of restraint and seclusion, particularly for students with autism
- School-based arrests and referrals to law enforcement
- State legislation restricting practices; federal legislation pending

### COVID-19 Impact

The pandemic created unprecedented challenges:

- Remote learning often inaccessible to students with disabilities
- Related services disrupted or eliminated
- IEP meetings shifted to virtual format
- Compensatory services disputes proliferating
- IDEA flexibility granted, but concerns about lost services

### Full Funding Efforts

Multiple bills introduced to fully fund IDEA:

- IDEA Full Funding Act (various versions)
- Bipartisan support in Congress
- Appropriations have not matched authorizations
- COVID relief provided temporary increases

## Lessons from History

### Progress Made

- From total exclusion to guaranteed access
- From institutionalization to community inclusion
- From no rights to comprehensive procedural protections
- From "uneducable" labels to high expectations for many

### Persistent Failures

- Funding promise remains broken after 50 years
- Implementation varies enormously by geography and wealth
- Racial disparities in identification and placement persist
- Outcomes remain far below those of non-disabled peers
- Workforce crisis threatens service delivery

### The Unfinished Agenda

The history of special education law shows that:

- Legal rights are necessary but not sufficient
- Implementation requires resources and will
- Vigilance is required to maintain progress
- Exclusion and segregation remain default without active intervention
- The gap between law on the books and reality in schools persists
