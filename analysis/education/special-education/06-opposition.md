# Special Education: Opposition

## Opposition to Full Funding

### Fiscal Conservatives

**Position**: Federal spending should be reduced, not expanded. States and localities should bear responsibility for education.

**Arguments**

- Full funding would cost $30+ billion annually in new federal spending
- Creates dependency on federal funds
- Education is state responsibility under 10th Amendment
- Money does not automatically improve outcomes
- Unfunded mandate argument is excuse for poor performance

**Organizations**

- Heritage Foundation
- Cato Institute
- Various taxpayer advocacy groups
- Some Republican members of Congress

**Actual Motivations**

- Opposition to federal spending generally
- Preference for private/market solutions to education
- View education (including special education) as state matter
- Concern that more spending will not improve outcomes
- Political positioning against Democratic spending priorities

**Counter-Arguments**

- Congress made the 40% promise; breaking it shifts burden to states
- Other federal programs (Medicaid, highways) are adequately funded
- Evidence shows adequate funding improves outcomes
- Current underfunding creates inequities across districts
- Full funding would reduce property tax burden locally

### Budget Hawks in Both Parties

**Position**: In constrained budget environment, cannot fund all priorities at desired levels.

**Arguments**

- Competing budget priorities (defense, healthcare, infrastructure)
- Must make difficult choices
- Special education competes with general education
- Incremental increases more realistic than full funding
- Budget caps and pay-go rules constrain options

**Political Dynamics**

- Appropriators more constrained than authorizers
- Bipartisan support for "full funding" in principle
- But neither party has actually appropriated funds
- Special education lacks dedicated revenue stream
- No powerful lobby sustaining pressure for full funding

**Counter-Arguments**

- Other programs have dedicated funding mechanisms
- Tax cuts repeatedly prioritized over education funding
- Defense spending increased without similar scrutiny
- Cost of not funding (poor outcomes) also has price
- Promise made 50 years ago should eventually be kept

## Opposition to Inclusion

### Some Special Education Professionals

**Position**: Specialized settings provide better services for students with significant disabilities.

**Arguments**

- General education teachers not trained for complex needs
- Separate settings allow specialized instruction
- Students need to be with peers who understand them
- Inclusion can mean neglect in general classroom
- Some students require intensive intervention unavailable in general education

**Actual Concerns**

- Loss of specialized roles and jobs
- Belief in value of specialized expertise
- Concern for students with significant disabilities
- Fear that inclusion without support will harm students
- Protection of special education as distinct field

**Counter-Arguments**

- Evidence shows inclusion benefits most students when properly supported
- Segregation perpetuates low expectations
- Separate settings often have weak curriculum
- Inclusion requires training and support, not just placement
- Students can receive specialized services in general education settings

### Some General Education Stakeholders

**Position**: Students with significant disabilities disrupt general education classrooms and require resources that could serve other students.

**Arguments**

- Teachers not trained for inclusion
- Students with disabilities take disproportionate time and attention
- Behavior challenges disrupt learning for others
- Not enough support for teachers
- Some students simply cannot benefit from general curriculum

**Actual Concerns**

- Fear of being unprepared and unsupported
- Concern about liability if something goes wrong
- Resentment of special education "taking" resources
- Belief that separation serves everyone better
- Lack of training and resulting lack of confidence

**Counter-Arguments**

- Research shows all students can benefit from inclusive classrooms
- Inclusion requires support; problems arise from inadequate resources, not inclusion itself
- General education teachers can learn inclusive practices
- Diverse classrooms prepare all students for diverse world
- Separate is inherently unequal

### Specialized Schools and Programs

**Position**: Specialized settings serve an important role for some populations and should be preserved.

**Arguments**

- Schools for the deaf provide language and cultural community
- Some students with severe behavior needs require specialized settings
- Private specialized schools serve students districts cannot
- Specialized settings concentrate expertise
- Parent choice should include specialized options

**Organizations**

- National Association of the Deaf (on deaf education)
- Specialized private schools
- Some disability-specific organizations

**Counter-Arguments**

- Most specialized settings are not like deaf schools with cultural community
- Specialized setting often reflects district failure to include
- Cost of private placement diverts funds from district inclusion capacity
- "Choice" often reflects lack of appropriate district options
- Goal should be inclusion with appropriate support

## Opposition to Disproportionality Requirements

### Those Who Deny Disproportionality Is a Problem

**Position**: Racial disparities in identification reflect real differences in disability rates, not bias.

**Arguments**

- Poverty (which correlates with race) causes developmental delays
- Some populations have higher rates of certain disabilities
- Focusing on disproportionality may lead to under-identification
- Students of color need services even if disproportionately represented
- Disparities reflect referral patterns, not evaluation bias

**Actual Concerns**

- May believe in innate differences between racial groups
- Resistance to examining own potential biases
- Fear that reducing identification will deny needed services
- Preference for colorblind approach
- Concern about liability if disparities acknowledged

**Counter-Arguments**

- Disproportionality exists even controlling for poverty
- Pattern (overrepresentation in subjective categories, underrepresentation in autism) indicates bias
- Other developed nations do not show same racial patterns
- Implicit bias is well-documented in education generally
- Addressing disproportionality does not mean denying services

### Those Who Oppose Remedies

**Position**: Current disproportionality requirements create perverse incentives and do not solve the problem.

**Arguments**

- "Significant disproportionality" determination leads to set-aside funding
- Districts may manipulate data to avoid determination
- Under-identification of students of color may result
- Root cause analysis is process-heavy without results
- Focus should be on quality services, not racial numbers

**Actual Concerns**

- Compliance burden on districts
- Difficulty changing identification patterns
- Fear of litigation or sanctions
- Belief that problem is overstated
- Preference for local control over federal requirements

**Counter-Arguments**

- Disproportionality requirements have been weak and under-enforced
- Without accountability, bias continues unchecked
- Students of color deserve equitable access to services
- Addressing disproportionality should improve services for all
- Problem is inadequate enforcement, not requirements themselves

## Opposition to Procedural Protections

### Some Administrators and Educators

**Position**: Extensive procedural requirements waste time and money that could go to services.

**Arguments**

- IEP paperwork consumes teacher time
- Legal requirements drive IEP meetings rather than student needs
- Fear of litigation makes educators defensive
- Due process is expensive and adversarial
- Parents use procedural safeguards as weapons

**Examples of Concerns**

- 15-20 page IEPs mostly legal boilerplate
- Teachers spending 20%+ of time on paperwork
- IEP meetings focused on compliance rather than collaboration
- Due process costs tens of thousands of dollars
- Settlements divert funds from other students

**Counter-Arguments**

- Procedural protections exist because schools violated rights without them
- Problem is compliance mindset, not protections themselves
- Parents need protections because they have less power than schools
- Due process is last resort after other options fail
- Solution is better implementation, not weaker protections

### School Board Associations and Administrator Groups

**Position**: IDEA requirements are burdensome and should be streamlined.

**Organizations**

- American Association of School Administrators
- National School Boards Association
- Various state administrator and board associations

**Arguments**

- IDEA requirements exceed other federal education laws
- Compliance costs divert resources from services
- Litigation exposure is excessive
- Multi-year IEPs and reduced teams should be expanded
- States should have more flexibility

**Actual Concerns**

- Budget pressures from unfunded mandate
- Litigation costs and risks
- Staff time devoted to compliance
- Adversarial relationships with parents
- Federal oversight and monitoring

**Counter-Arguments**

- Protections were added in response to violations
- Compliance focus is district choice, not IDEA requirement
- Due process is small percentage of students
- Parents generally do not want to be adversarial
- Adequate funding would reduce many concerns

## Opposition to Teacher Workforce Reforms

### Those Who Oppose Increased Compensation

**Position**: Teacher pay should be determined locally; federal intervention inappropriate.

**Arguments**

- Education is state/local responsibility
- Salaries should reflect local labor markets
- More money does not automatically improve teaching
- Unions already negotiate pay
- Tax increases for teacher pay face local opposition

**Organizations**

- Some taxpayer groups
- Fiscal conservatives
- Anti-union organizations

**Counter-Arguments**

- Market-rate pay required to recruit and retain
- Special education faces specific shortage crisis
- Federal role in teacher incentives has bipartisan history
- Teacher shortages harm students with disabilities
- Investment in workforce is investment in outcomes

### Those Who Oppose Preparation Requirements

**Position**: Alternative certification should be expanded; traditional preparation is barrier to entry.

**Arguments**

- Traditional preparation programs too long
- Emergency certificates fill immediate shortages
- Some teachers can learn on the job
- Regulation reduces supply
- Content knowledge matters more than pedagogy

**Organizations**

- Some education reform organizations
- Alternative certification providers
- Some states with severe shortages

**Counter-Arguments**

- Special education requires specialized knowledge
- Underprepared teachers have highest turnover
- Students with disabilities need skilled instruction
- "Learning on the job" happens at students' expense
- Quality preparation improves retention

## Opposition to Enforcement

### States and Districts Facing Sanctions

**Position**: Federal enforcement is heavy-handed and ignores local context.

**Arguments**

- States making good faith efforts to comply
- Enforcement ignores resource constraints
- Federal government does not understand local needs
- Monitoring focuses on process over outcomes
- Sanctions would harm students, not help

**Actual Concerns**

- Fear of funding withholds
- Resistance to federal oversight
- Belief that they are doing their best
- Concern about public relations
- Political pressure to push back on feds

**Counter-Arguments**

- Funds have never actually been withheld
- "Good faith" without results is insufficient
- Students have rights regardless of local constraints
- Weak enforcement has not produced improvement
- Enforcement is rare and mild, not heavy-handed

### Political Opposition to Federal Role

**Position**: Education is state responsibility; federal enforcement exceeds appropriate role.

**Arguments**

- 10th Amendment reserves education to states
- IDEA conditions on funding, not direct mandate
- Federal government should set policy, not micromanage
- States know their students better
- One-size-fits-all approaches inappropriate

**Organizations**

- Some Republican legislators
- States' rights advocates
- Local control proponents

**Counter-Arguments**

- IDEA is voluntary; states accept conditions when accepting funds
- Civil rights require federal enforcement
- State variation produces inequities
- Students with disabilities need consistent protection
- Federal role has bipartisan history

## Opposition by Neglect

### Indifference

Many stakeholders do not actively oppose reforms but fail to prioritize special education:

**General Public**

- Unaware of special education issues
- Focused on other education concerns (test scores, funding generally)
- May see special education as separate issue
- Does not connect to personal experience

**Elected Officials**

- Many priorities compete for attention
- Special education advocacy not as organized as other interests
- Focus on general education issues
- Full funding supported rhetorically but not acted upon

**Media**

- Special education rarely covered
- When covered, often "heartwarming" stories rather than systemic analysis
- Investigative coverage of failures rare
- Issues complex and not easily reduced to headlines

**Education Reform Movement**

- Focus on general education issues (charters, testing, teacher evaluation)
- Special education often afterthought
- Some reformers see special education as obstacle to accountability
- Inclusion not central to reform agenda

### Consequences of Indifference

- Full funding never achieves priority status
- Systemic issues remain unaddressed
- Piecemeal reforms without coherent strategy
- Students with disabilities' concerns marginalized
- Status quo persists through inertia

## Strategies of Opposition

### Direct Opposition

- Lobbying against full funding appropriations
- Litigation challenging requirements
- Regulatory efforts to weaken rules
- Legislative amendments to reduce protections

### Indirect Opposition

- Emphasis on "flexibility" and "local control"
- Framing inclusion as impractical or harmful
- Highlighting costs without discussing benefits
- Portraying parents as adversaries

### Obstruction

- Slow-walking implementation
- Minimal compliance rather than genuine implementation
- Underfunding despite legal obligations
- Creating barriers to parent participation

### Co-optation

- Claiming to support "appropriate" education while resisting change
- Supporting "inclusion" rhetorically while maintaining segregated settings
- Endorsing "full funding" in principle while not appropriating funds
- Using disability rhetoric to support privatization

## Building Coalitions for Reform
