# Education Equity: Root Causes

## Overview

Educational inequity does not happen by accident. It results from interconnected systems of housing segregation, fragmented school governance, inequitable funding mechanisms, and policy choices that advantage some students over others. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective interventions that address structural barriers rather than merely their symptoms.

## Housing Segregation

### The Foundation of School Segregation

School segregation largely mirrors residential segregation. In a system where children attend neighborhood schools, segregated housing produces segregated schools.

**The Housing-Schools Connection**

| Factor | Mechanism | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Attendance zones | Schools serve defined geographic areas | Housing patterns become school composition |
| Property values | School quality affects home prices | Feedback loop reinforcing segregation |
| Information barriers | Families choose housing based on school reputation | Perpetuates patterns |
| Lending practices | Historical and ongoing discrimination | Concentrated poverty |

### Historical Causes of Housing Segregation

**Government-Created Segregation**

| Policy | Era | Effect |
|--------|-----|--------|
| FHA underwriting | 1934-1968 | Required segregation for mortgage insurance |
| Redlining | 1930s-1970s | Denied loans in minority neighborhoods |
| Public housing siting | 1940s-1970s | Concentrated in minority areas |
| Urban renewal | 1950s-1970s | Displaced minority communities |
| Highway construction | 1950s-1970s | Divided and destroyed minority neighborhoods |
| Exclusionary zoning | 1910s-present | Banned affordable housing in white areas |

**The FHA Legacy**

The Federal Housing Administration:

- Required racially restrictive covenants for loan approval
- Designated Black and integrated areas as high-risk ("redlined")
- Subsidized white suburbanization
- Denied wealth-building to Black families
- Created patterns that persist today

**Restrictive Covenants**

- Legally enforceable until *Shelley v. Kraemer* (1948)
- Common in most new suburban developments
- Prohibited sale or rental to Black families (and often Jews, Asians)
- Created homogeneous white suburbs
- Effects persist in neighborhood composition

### Ongoing Mechanisms

**Contemporary Discrimination**

| Type | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Steering | Real estate agents direct families by race |
| Lending discrimination | Audit studies show continued disparities |
| Appraisal bias | Black neighborhoods consistently undervalued |
| Rental discrimination | Testing shows ongoing illegal discrimination |
| Insurance redlining | Higher costs in minority neighborhoods |

**Exclusionary Zoning**

| Zoning Tool | Effect on Segregation |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Single-family-only zones | Excludes apartments affordable to lower-income families |
| Large lot minimums | Raises housing costs |
| Height restrictions | Limits density and affordability |
| Parking requirements | Increases construction costs |
| ADU prohibitions | Blocks affordable housing types |
| Design standards | Adds costs that price out affordable construction |

## District Fragmentation

### The American System of 13,000 Districts

**Unique Fragmentation**

| Country | School Districts | Governance |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| United States | ~13,000 | Highly fragmented |
| France | 1 (national) | Centralized |
| United Kingdom | ~150 LEAs | Moderate consolidation |
| Germany | ~16 state systems | Federal/regional |

**How Fragmentation Creates Inequity**

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Tax base sorting | Wealthy enclaves capture property tax for own schools |
| Regulatory boundaries | Districts control land use affecting housing |
| Exclusionary policies | Suburbs can zone out affordable housing |
| Political separation | Suburban voters don't share urban interests |
| Fiscal independence | No sharing of resources across district lines |

### The Suburban Secession

**White Flight and District Boundaries**

| Era | Pattern | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| 1950s-1970s | Whites flee to suburbs | Tax base follows |
| 1970s-1980s | New suburban districts form | Formal separation |
| 1980s-present | District lines become barriers | *Milliken* prevents crossing |

**The Milliken Effect**

*Milliken v. Bradley* (1974) made district boundaries nearly impermeable:

- Cannot combine districts without proving suburban intentional discrimination
- White flight to separate districts became legally protected
- Urban districts isolated with concentrated poverty
- Suburban districts protected from integration requirements

### Intra-District Boundaries

**Attendance Zones**

Even within districts, attendance zones create stratification:

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Neighborhood-based assignment | Mirrors residential segregation |
| Zone manipulation | Lines can be drawn to segregate |
| Grandfathering | Allows continued attendance at former schools |
| Transfer policies | Often favor advantaged families |

**Magnet and Specialty Schools**

| School Type | Equity Concern |
|-------------|----------------|
| Exam schools | Admission tests favor advantaged students |
| Audition-based schools | Cultural capital advantages |
| Magnet schools | Transportation barriers, information gaps |
| Specialized programs | Concentrated in certain neighborhoods |

## Funding Inequities

### The Property Tax Trap

**How School Funding Works**

| Level | Share of Funding | Equity Effect |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Local (property tax) | ~45% average | Highly inequitable |
| State | ~47% average | Varies by state formula |
| Federal | ~8% | Modestly equalizing |

**Property Tax Problems**

| Issue | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| Tax base inequality | Wealthy districts have more property value per pupil |
| Rate disparities | Poor districts may tax higher but raise less |
| Commercial vs. residential | Some districts benefit from commercial property |
| Tax base exodus | Poverty concentrates as wealth leaves |

**Concrete Example: Disparities in Same Metro**

| District Type | Property Value per Pupil | Tax Rate | Revenue per Pupil |
|---------------|--------------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Wealthy suburb | $500,000 | 1.0% | $5,000 |
| Poor urban | $100,000 | 2.5% | $2,500 |

The poor district taxes at 2.5x the rate but raises half the revenue.

### State Funding Failures

**Types of State Aid**

| Formula Type | How It Works | Equity Effect |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Foundation | Guarantees minimum per pupil | Depends on level set |
| Power equalizing | Matches local effort | Can equalize |
| Flat grant | Same amount per pupil | Regressive |
| Categorical | Targeted to specific needs | Depends on design |

**Common Problems**

| Problem | How It Undermines Equity |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Low foundation levels | Floor too low to be meaningful |
| Hold-harmless provisions | Protect wealthy district funding |
| No adjustment for need | Same per-pupil ignores different costs |
| Political manipulation | Formulas designed to benefit powerful districts |
| Under-appropriation | Formulas exist but aren't funded |

### Within-District Inequities

**The Comparability Loophole**

Federal law requires "comparable" services between Title I and non-Title I schools, but:

| Loophole | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Teacher salary exclusion | Most expensive cost ignored |
| Experience differentials | Senior teachers in affluent schools |
| Actual spending varies | 20-30% differences common |
| $2-4 billion annual cost | High-poverty schools shortchanged |

**How Within-District Inequity Works**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Teacher assignment | Senior teachers transfer to easier schools |
| Weighted enrollment | Basic formula doesn't weight for need |
| Supplemental funding | PTA funds, grants flow to advantaged schools |
| Administrative attention | Principal effectiveness varies |

## Policy Choices

### Assignment Policies

**Neighborhood Schools Default**

| Assumption | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Parents want neighborhood schools | Many want quality; neighborhood is proxy |
| Neighborhood reflects community | Neighborhoods are segregated |
| Walking distance matters | Most students are driven or bused anyway |
| Local control is paramount | Local control can mean local exclusion |

**Choice Without Equity Design**

| Policy | Equity Risk |
|--------|-------------|
| Uncontrolled choice | Information and transportation advantages for wealthy |
| Charter schools | Can cream-skim or increase segregation |
| Magnet schools without transportation | Access limited to those who can get there |
| Test-based admission | Advantages affluent families |

### Tracking and Placement

**How Tracking Creates Inequity**

| Stage | Mechanism | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Identification | Teacher referral favors dominant group students | Biased initial pools |
| Testing | Standardized tests reflect opportunity gaps | Prior disadvantage becomes permanent |
| Course availability | Advanced courses concentrated in certain schools | Geographic barrier |
| Counseling | Counselors steer by race and class | Expectations become limits |
| Parental advocacy | Affluent parents more likely to contest placement | Advantages compound |

**Gifted Program Disparities**

| Practice | Equity Problem |
|----------|----------------|
| Teacher referral | Implicit bias in who gets referred |
| Single-measure identification | IQ tests reflect opportunity, not just ability |
| Opt-in screening | Advantaged families more likely to seek testing |
| Program location | Often in whiter, wealthier schools |

### Discipline Policies

**Zero Tolerance**

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Mandatory suspensions | Removes discretion that could account for context |
| School resource officers | Criminalizes adolescent behavior |
| Referrals to law enforcement | Feeds school-to-prison pipeline |
| Harsh consequences for minor infractions | Pushes students out |

**Discretionary Discipline**

Even without zero tolerance, discretion produces disparities:

| Factor | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Same behavior, different consequences | Black students punished more harshly for same actions |
| Subjective infractions | "Defiance" and "disrespect" applied unevenly |
| Cultural mismatch | White teachers misread Black cultural expressions |
| Implicit bias | Unconscious associations affect decisions |

### Interconnected Systems

| System | Connection to Educational Inequity |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Housing | Determines school composition |
| Labor market | Affects tax base and family resources |
| Criminal justice | Discipline policies, community effects |
| Healthcare | Affects readiness and attendance |
| Political | Determines policy choices |
| Financial | Wealth gaps affect opportunities |

### Why Reform Is Difficult

**Structural Barriers**

| Barrier | How It Blocks Change |
|---------|---------------------|
| Fragmented governance | 13,000 districts make coordination difficult |
| Local control ideology | Reform seen as federal overreach |
| Property tax reliance | Wealthy districts resist redistribution |
| District boundaries | *Milliken* prevents metropolitan solutions |
| Opportunity hoarding | Advantaged families protect advantages |

**Political Barriers**

| Barrier | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Suburban political power | Majority of voters in many states |
| Racial politics | Integration opposed by significant portion |
| Sorting by choice | Those with options exit troubled systems |
| Concentrated costs, diffuse benefits | Those who lose influence are concentrated; those who gain are dispersed |

## Root Causes Summary

| Root Cause | Key Mechanisms | Policy Implications |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Housing segregation | Redlining, exclusionary zoning, discrimination | Address housing policy alongside education |
| District fragmentation | Tax base sorting, Milliken protections | Regional approaches, interdistrict programs |
| Funding inequity | Property tax reliance, inadequate state aid | State funding reform, federal supplement |
| Within-district policies | Teacher assignment, tracking, discipline | District policy reform, weighted funding |
| Legal constraints | Parents Involved limits race-conscious policy | Use socioeconomic factors, magnet schools |
