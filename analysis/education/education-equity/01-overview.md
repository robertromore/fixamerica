# Education Equity: Overview

## Executive Summary

Educational equity in America remains an unfulfilled promise seven decades after Brown v. Board of Education. School segregation, after declining through the 1970s and 1980s, has been rising since 1988 as court oversight ended and policies shifted. Today, millions of students attend schools that are racially and economically isolated, receiving fundamentally different educational experiences based on their zip code, race, and family income.

The opportunity gap manifests in nearly every measurable dimension: access to experienced teachers, availability of Advanced Placement courses, quality of facilities, counseling ratios, extracurricular offerings, and discipline practices. Students in high-poverty schools are more likely to be taught by inexperienced teachers, less likely to have access to rigorous coursework, and more likely to face exclusionary discipline that pushes them toward the criminal justice system.

These disparities are not accidents. They result from deliberate policy choices: how district boundaries are drawn, how schools are funded, how students are assigned, and how resources are distributed. Reform requires addressing these structural causes while navigating a constrained legal landscape that limits but does not eliminate paths to integration and equity.

## Scope

## The Core Problem

### Resegregation by the Numbers

American schools have been resegregating for over three decades:

| Metric | Peak Integration | Current Status | Change |
|--------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| Black students in majority-white schools | 43.5% (1988) | ~18% | -25 points |
| Latino students in majority-white schools | ~38% (late 1980s) | ~19% | -19 points |
| Black students in 90-100% minority schools | 32% (1988) | ~40% | +8 points |
| White students' exposure to minorities | 22% (2000) | ~25% | +3 points |

### The Dual System

American education operates as two systems with vastly different resources:

| Factor | High-Poverty Schools | Low-Poverty Schools | Gap |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|----|
| Inexperienced teachers | 25%+ | ~10% | 15+ points |
| Teacher turnover | 20%+ annually | ~10% | Double |
| AP courses offered | Limited | Extensive | 2-3x difference |
| Counselor ratio | 500:1+ | 250:1 | Double caseload |
| Per-pupil spending (state avg) | Below state avg | Above state avg | ~$2,000-4,000 |
| Building condition | Often poor | Generally adequate | Substantial |

### The Discipline Gap

Students of color face systematically harsher discipline:

| Group | Suspension Rate | Relative Risk |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Black students | 13.7% | 3.8x white rate |
| Latino students | 6.3% | 1.8x white rate |
| White students | 3.6% | Baseline |
| Students with disabilities | 11.9% | 2x non-disabled |
| Black males | 18%+ | Highest risk |

### The Tracking Divide

Access to advanced coursework varies dramatically:

| Program | White Access | Black Access | Latino Access | Gap |
|---------|--------------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| Gifted programs | 8.1% | 3.5% | 4.2% | 2x+ underrepresentation |
| AP enrollment | Higher | Lower | Lower | 20-30% gap |
| Calculus access | 33% of schools | Disproportionately available at white schools | | Substantial |
| Physics access | 48% of schools | Same pattern | | Substantial |

## Framework for Analysis

### Dimensions of Educational Equity

**Access Equity**

- Equal access to quality schools regardless of location
- Opportunity to attend diverse schools
- Access to full curriculum and programs
- Equal access to qualified teachers

**Resource Equity**

- Fair funding across schools and districts
- Equitable distribution of experienced teachers
- Equal facilities and materials
- Adequate support services

**Process Equity**

- Fair discipline policies and practices
- Unbiased placement in courses and programs
- Culturally responsive instruction
- Equitable participation in school decisions

**Outcome Equity**

- Closing achievement gaps
- Equal graduation rates
- College and career readiness
- Long-term economic outcomes

### The Opportunity Gap Framework

Rather than focusing solely on "achievement gaps" (outcomes), the opportunity gap framework examines:

┌─────────────────────┐              ┌─────────────────────┐

          └────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Levels of Inequity

| Level | Examples | Primary Drivers |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Between-state** | Mississippi vs. Massachusetts funding | State tax base, political will |
| **Between-district** | Urban vs. suburban in same metro | Property tax reliance, district boundaries |
| **Within-district** | School A vs. School B in same city | Attendance zones, magnet policies |
| **Within-school** | Honors vs. regular track | Course placement, counseling |

## Why This Matters

### For Individual Students

Educational inequity affects life trajectories:

- Students in high-poverty schools score 4 grade levels behind peers by 12th grade
- Access to rigorous coursework predicts college success
- Discipline disparities disrupt learning and increase dropout risk
- Early tracking limits future opportunities

### For Communities

Segregated, under-resourced schools harm communities:

- Reduced economic mobility
- Perpetuation of residential segregation
- Weakened tax base and civic infrastructure
- Intergenerational poverty

### For Democracy

An inequitable education system undermines democratic values:

- Unequal preparation for citizenship
- Reduced social cohesion
- Perpetuation of racial and class hierarchies
- Failure to develop full human potential

### For the Economy

The nation pays economic costs:

- Lost human capital development
- Higher social service costs
- Reduced innovation and productivity
- International competitiveness concerns

## The Current Legal Landscape

### What Courts Have Limited

- **Race-conscious assignment**: *Parents Involved v. Seattle* (2007) restricted use of race in student assignment
- **Interdistrict remedies**: *Milliken v. Bradley* (1974) limited cross-district desegregation
- **Federal enforcement**: Court oversight of desegregation orders largely ended

### What Remains Available

- **Socioeconomic integration**: Using income rather than race in student assignment
- **Magnet schools**: Voluntary choice programs attracting diverse enrollment
- **Controlled choice**: Managed choice systems considering diversity
- **State constitutional claims**: Some state constitutions require equity
- **Title VI enforcement**: Federal civil rights compliance
- **State legislation**: States can promote integration through law

## Key Concepts

### Segregation vs. Integration

**De jure segregation**: Segregation mandated by law (outlawed by Brown)

**De facto segregation**: Segregation resulting from "private choices" and policies (more limited legal remedies)

**Hypersegregation**: Schools with 90%+ minority enrollment (growing phenomenon)

### Opportunity Hoarding

The tendency of advantaged families to secure disproportionate access to:

- High-performing schools
- Advanced courses and programs
- Experienced teachers
- Extracurricular opportunities
- Social networks

### The Adequacy vs. Equity Debate

| Adequacy | Equity |
|----------|--------|
| All students receive minimum resources | Resources distributed based on need |
| Floor standard | Fairness standard |
| Easier legal standard | Higher bar |
| May perpetuate gaps | Aims to close gaps |
