# Education Equity: History

## Overview

The history of educational equity in America is a story of struggle, progress, and retrenchment. From the constitutionalization of segregation in *Plessy v. Ferguson* through the triumph of *Brown v. Board of Education*, the hard-fought integration era, and the subsequent decades of resegregation, this history reveals how legal, political, and social forces have shaped educational opportunity. Understanding this trajectory is essential for crafting effective reforms today.

## Pre-Brown Era (1865-1954)

### Reconstruction and Its Betrayal

**Post-Civil War Promise**

| Development | Year | Significance |
|-------------|------|--------------|
| 13th Amendment | 1865 | Abolished slavery |
| Freedmen's Bureau schools | 1865-1870 | First mass education for Black Americans |
| 14th Amendment | 1868 | Equal protection clause |
| 15th Amendment | 1870 | Voting rights (later gutted) |

**The Promise Unfulfilled**

- Freedmen's Bureau established over 4,000 schools
- Black literacy rose from 5% to 30% by 1880
- But Reconstruction's end brought systematic disenfranchisement
- Southern states institutionalized segregation

### The Establishment of Separate and Unequal

**Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)**

The Supreme Court's decision enshrined "separate but equal":

| Holding | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Separation does not imply inferiority | Separation was designed to impose inferiority |
| Equal facilities required | Facilities were never equal |
| Social vs. civil rights distinction | Distinction used to deny fundamental rights |
| States' rights preserved | States used this to oppress |

**The Dual System**

| Factor | White Schools | Black Schools |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Per-pupil spending | 10x+ higher in some states | Severely underfunded |
| Facilities | Adequate to good | Often buildings condemned for white students |
| Teacher salaries | Higher | 50-75% of white teachers |
| School year length | 8-9 months | 4-6 months |
| Transportation | Provided | Rarely provided |
| Curriculum | Full | Limited |

**Cumulative Deprivation**

By 1940:

- Black students in the South received less than half the funding of white students
- Many Black communities had no high schools at all
- College was essentially inaccessible for most Black Americans
- The education gap was deliberate policy

### The NAACP Legal Campaign

**Strategy Development**

The NAACP, led by Charles Hamilton Houston and later Thurgood Marshall, developed a systematic legal strategy:

| Phase | Focus | Key Cases |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1930s | Graduate/professional education | *Murray v. Maryland* (1936) |
| 1940s | Equalizing facilities, teacher pay | *Gaines v. Canada* (1938) |
| 1950s | Direct attack on segregation | *Sweatt v. Painter* (1950), *McLaurin v. Oklahoma* (1950) |
| Final | Elementary/secondary education | *Brown v. Board* (1954) |

**Building the Foundation**

- *Sweatt v. Painter*: Separate law schools inherently unequal
- *McLaurin v. Oklahoma*: Separation within institution unconstitutional
- Social science evidence: Kenneth Clark's doll studies
- Foundation laid for overturning Plessy

## The Brown Era (1954-1968)

### Brown v. Board of Education (1954)

**The Decision**

Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing for a unanimous Court:

> "We conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."

**Key Elements**

| Element | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Unanimity | 9-0 decision gave moral authority |
| Psychological harm | Recognized damage of segregation |
| Overturning precedent | Explicitly rejected Plessy |
| Ambiguity on remedy | Deferred to Brown II |

### Brown II and "All Deliberate Speed" (1955)

**The Retreat**

Brown II's implementation decree used the infamous phrase "with all deliberate speed," which:

- Provided no timeline for compliance
- Allowed Southern states to delay indefinitely
- Created decades of litigation
- Demonstrated limits of judicial power without executive enforcement

### Massive Resistance (1955-1964)

**Southern Response**

Southern states employed every possible tactic to avoid integration:

| Tactic | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Interposition | States claiming authority to nullify federal law |
| School closures | Prince Edward County, VA closed schools 1959-1964 |
| "Freedom of choice" | Nominally allowing choice while intimidating Black families |
| Pupil placement laws | Bureaucratic barriers to transfer |
| Tuition grants | Public money for white private academies |
| Violence/intimidation | Mobs, bombings, threats |

**Little Rock Crisis (1957)**

| Event | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| Arkansas National Guard blocks students | State directly defies federal court |
| Eisenhower federalizes Guard | First federal troops in South since Reconstruction |
| 101st Airborne escorts students | Federal supremacy asserted |
| Schools close following year | Resistance continues despite federal action |

**A Decade of Minimal Progress**

| Year | Black Students in Majority-White Schools (South) |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1954 | 0% |
| 1964 | 2.3% |

Ten years after Brown, 98% of Southern Black students remained in all-Black schools.

### The Civil Rights Revolution (1964-1968)

**Legislative Transformation**

| Law | Year | Education Impact |
|-----|------|------------------|
| Civil Rights Act | 1964 | Title VI: federal funds contingent on desegregation |
| Elementary and Secondary Education Act | 1965 | Title I: federal funding for high-poverty schools |
| Voting Rights Act | 1965 | Enabled election of school board members |

**Federal Enforcement**

Title VI proved transformative:

- HEW could cut off federal funds to segregated districts
- Federal money increasingly important to schools
- Financial pressure where courts had failed
- Integration accelerated dramatically

### Green v. County School Board (1968)

**The Turning Point**

The Supreme Court finally demanded action:

> "The burden on a school board today is to come forward with a plan that promises realistically to work, and promises realistically to work now."

**Key Requirements**

The Court identified six "Green factors" for evaluating desegregation:

1. Student assignment
2. Faculty assignment
3. Staff assignment
4. Transportation
5. Extracurricular activities
6. Facilities

**Impact**

| Year | Black Students in Majority-White Schools (South) |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1964 | 2.3% |
| 1968 | 18% |
| 1972 | 36.4% |
| 1976 | 37.6% |

## The Integration Era (1968-1988)

### Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg (1971)

**Approving Strong Remedies**

The Court upheld comprehensive desegregation tools:

| Tool | Status |
|------|--------|
| Busing | Approved as remedy |
| Racial quotas for schools | Permitted |
| Pairing/clustering schools | Approved |
| Gerrymandered attendance zones | Permitted when needed |
| Federal court oversight | Expanded |

**The Result**

Charlotte-Mecklenburg became a model:

- District went from segregated to highly integrated
- Achievement gaps narrowed
- Maintained integration for two decades
- Later dismantled after court release

### Keyes v. School District No. 1 (1973)

**Extending Beyond the South**

For the first time, the Court addressed Northern segregation:

| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Intent requirement | Must prove intentional segregation (de jure) |
| Circumstantial evidence | Actions showing segregative intent sufficient |
| System-wide remedy | If intentional segregation found anywhere, remedy can be system-wide |
| Northern exposure | Denver had to desegregate |

**The Intent Requirement's Double Edge**

- Allowed remedy in Denver
- But created high evidentiary bar
- Required proving conscious intent, not just disparate impact
- Many Northern districts escaped remedy

### Milliken v. Bradley (1974)

**The Critical Limitation**

The Supreme Court rejected interdistrict remedies for Detroit:

| Holding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| District lines sacred | Cannot combine urban-suburban districts without showing suburban intent |
| De facto segregation protected | Housing patterns shielded from remedy |
| White flight enabled | Suburbanization became escape valve |
| Metropolitan solutions blocked | Most effective remedies foreclosed |

**The Dissent's Warning**

Justice Thurgood Marshall:

> "In the short run, it may seem to be the easier course to allow our great metropolitan areas to be divided up each into two cities--one white, the other black--but it is a course, I predict, our people will ultimately regret."

### Peak Integration (1980-1988)

**High-Water Mark**

| Metric | Peak Year | Peak Level |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Black students in majority-white schools | 1988 | 43.5% |
| Exposure of Black students to white students | 1988 | ~38% |
| Number of districts under court order | ~500+ | Mid-1980s |

**Why It Worked**

- Active federal enforcement under Nixon (surprisingly)
- Court orders with teeth
- Magnet schools as integration tools
- Suburban participation in some metros
- Political acceptance (grudging)

**Limits of Progress**

Even at peak:

- Milliken blocked most metropolitan solutions
- Northern cities remained highly segregated
- Achievement gaps narrowed but persisted
- Political backlash building

## The Resegregation Era (1988-Present)

### The Retreat Begins

**Board of Education v. Dowell (1991)**

The Supreme Court established standards for ending court oversight:

| Standard | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| "Good faith" compliance | Districts could be released for trying |
| "Vestiges" addressed | Nebulous standard for completion |
| Unitary status | Declare district integrated, remove oversight |
| Predictable resegregation | Integration often collapsed post-release |

**Freeman v. Pitts (1992)**

Further eased release requirements:

- Incremental release allowed
- Courts could withdraw supervision category by category
- Demographic changes deemed beyond district responsibility
- Accelerated court releases

**Missouri v. Jenkins (1995)**

Limited remedial authority:

- Struck down "magnet school" remedy designed to attract suburban whites
- Rejected achievement gap remediation through funding
- Further constrained federal courts

### The Parents Involved Decision (2007)

**Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1**

The Roberts Court severely limited voluntary integration:

| Holding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Race-conscious assignment plans struck down | Seattle and Louisville programs invalidated |
| Strict scrutiny applies | Even voluntary integration must meet highest bar |
| "Diversity" not compelling in K-12 | Unlike higher ed, diversity interest unclear |
| Colorblind Constitution invoked | Roberts: "The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race" |

**Kennedy's Concurrence**

Justice Kennedy's narrower concurrence left some door open:

| Permitted | Prohibited |
|-----------|------------|
| Race-neutral policies with race-conscious goals | Racial classification of individual students |
| Site selection, attendance zones | Individual assignment based on race |
| Recruiting, targeted outreach | Using race as a factor for specific students |
| Socioeconomic integration | Direct racial balancing |

### Post-Parents Involved Landscape

**What Remains Available**

| Tool | Status |
|------|--------|
| Socioeconomic integration | Permitted (race-neutral) |
| Controlled choice with race-neutral factors | Permitted |
| Magnet schools | Permitted with race-neutral admission |
| Strategic site selection | Permitted |
| Interdistrict voluntary programs | Permitted where they exist |

**What Was Lost**

| Tool | Status |
|------|--------|
| Individual racial assignment | Prohibited |
| Racial balance requirements | Prohibited |
| Racial quotas/targets | Prohibited |
| Race-based transfer policies | Prohibited |

### The Resegregation Record

**The Numbers**

| Metric | 1988 | 2020 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Black students in majority-white schools | 43.5% | ~18% | -25 points |
| Black students in 90-100% minority schools | 32% | ~40% | +8 points |
| Latino students in majority-white schools | ~38% | ~19% | -19 points |
| Districts under court order | 500+ | <100 | -80%+ |

**Court Release Consequences**

Research shows consistent patterns:

- Districts released from court orders resegregate
- Resegregation occurs within 5-10 years
- Achievement gaps widen post-release
- Teacher quality distribution becomes more inequitable

## Timeline of Key Events

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1896 | *Plessy v. Ferguson* | "Separate but equal" doctrine established |
| 1954 | *Brown v. Board I* | Segregation unconstitutional |
| 1955 | *Brown v. Board II* | "All deliberate speed" implementation |
| 1957 | Little Rock Crisis | Federal troops enforce desegregation |
| 1964 | Civil Rights Act | Title VI funding leverage |
| 1965 | ESEA | Federal education funding begins |
| 1968 | *Green v. County School Board* | "Freedom of choice" insufficient |
| 1971 | *Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg* | Busing approved |
| 1973 | *Keyes v. Denver* | Northern segregation addressed |
| 1974 | *Milliken v. Bradley* | Interdistrict remedies limited |
| 1988 | Peak integration | Highest point of Black-white integration |
| 1991 | *Dowell* | Standards for ending court oversight |
| 1992 | *Freeman v. Pitts* | Incremental release permitted |
| 1995 | *Missouri v. Jenkins* | Remedial authority limited |
| 2007 | *Parents Involved* | Voluntary race-conscious assignment restricted |

## Lessons from History

### What Worked

| Strategy | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Federal enforcement with teeth | Title VI funding leverage transformed Southern schools |
| Court orders with specific requirements | Green factors created accountability |
| Comprehensive metropolitan solutions | Where permitted, produced lasting integration |
| Sustained political commitment | Progress required decades of effort |

### What Failed

| Approach | Why It Failed |
|----------|---------------|
| "All deliberate speed" | Allowed unlimited delay |
| "Freedom of choice" without enforcement | Token compliance while maintaining segregation |
| Court orders without political support | Easily abandoned when oversight ended |
| District-only remedies | Milliken enabled white flight to suburbs |

### Patterns to Recognize

1. **Legal victories are not self-executing**: Brown meant nothing without enforcement
2. **Progress requires sustained pressure**: Decade of post-Brown delay until Title VI
3. **Courts alone cannot transform society**: Political and social change essential
4. **Resistance adapts**: New forms replace outlawed tactics
5. **Progress is reversible**: Gains can be lost without continued vigilance
