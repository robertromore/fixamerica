# Education Equity: Overview

Educational equity in America remains an unfulfilled promise seven decades after Brown v. Board of Education. School segregation, after declining through the 1970s and 1980s, has been rising since 1988 as court oversight ended and policies shifted. Today, millions of students attend schools that are racially and economically isolated, receiving fundamentally different educational experiences based on their zip code, race, and family income.
