# Education Equity: Current State

## The Problem Today

### School Segregation in 2024

School segregation has been rising since the late 1980s, reversing gains made during the desegregation era. The trends are stark and accelerating:

**Black Student Segregation**

| Year | In Majority-White Schools | In 90-100% Minority Schools | In Schools <10% White |
|------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1954 | 0% | Nearly all | Vast majority |
| 1968 | 23% | 64% | Majority |
| 1988 (peak) | 43.5% | 32% | Minority |
| 2000 | 33% | 37% | Rising |
| 2020 | ~18% | ~40% | 40%+ |

**Latino Student Segregation**

Latino students now experience the highest levels of segregation:

| Metric | Current Status |
|--------|----------------|
| In majority-minority schools | 80%+ |
| In 90-100% minority schools | 42% |
| In majority-white schools | ~19% |
| Exposure to white students | 21% (lowest of any group) |

**Double Segregation**

Most segregated schools are both racially and economically isolated:

| School Type | Percentage of Students |
|-------------|------------------------|
| High-poverty + high-minority | Majority of Black/Latino students |
| Low-poverty + mostly white | Majority of white students |
| Integrated by both race and class | ~15% of students |

### Geographic Concentration

Segregation varies dramatically by region:

| Region | Segregation Level | Trend |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| **Northeast** | Most segregated | Worsening |
| **Midwest** | Highly segregated | Worsening |
| **South** | Most integrated (ironically) | Worsening since court release |
| **West** | Moderate | Worsening |
| **Border states** | Highly variable | Mixed |

**Most Segregated Metropolitan Areas**

| Metro Area | Black-White Dissimilarity Index | Latino-White Index |
|------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Detroit | 0.85+ | 0.60+ |
| Chicago | 0.83 | 0.65 |
| New York | 0.78 | 0.68 |
| Philadelphia | 0.76 | 0.62 |
| Los Angeles | 0.67 | 0.65 |
| Milwaukee | 0.82 | 0.60 |
| Cleveland | 0.80 | 0.55 |

*Note: Index of 1.0 = complete segregation; 0 = perfect integration*

## Opportunity Gap Data

### Teacher Quality Disparities

The distribution of experienced, effective teachers is highly inequitable:

**Experience Distribution**

| School Type | % Teachers <3 Years Experience | % Teachers with Advanced Degrees |
|-------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| High-poverty | 25-30% | 45% |
| Low-poverty | 10-15% | 60% |

| Urban | 20%+ | 4%+ |
| Suburban | 10-15% | 1-2% |

**Certification and Preparation**

| Factor | High-Poverty Schools | Low-Poverty Schools |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Out-of-field teaching | 25%+ of classes | 10% of classes |
| Emergency credentials | Higher | Lower |
| Teachers from competitive programs | Lower | Higher |

### Course Access Disparities

Students in different schools have vastly different curricular options:

**Advanced Placement**

|------------|--------------|
| Between states (highest vs lowest) | 3:1 ratio |
| Between districts (same state) | 2:1 ratio common |
| Between schools (same district) | 20-30% variation |

**Support Services**

| Service | High-Poverty Schools | Low-Poverty Schools |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Counselor ratio | 500:1 to 700:1 | 200:1 to 300:1 |
| School psychologist | Often none/shared | Usually available |
| Social worker | Rarely | Sometimes |
| Librarian | Often eliminated | Usually present |
| Nurse | Part-time/shared | Full-time |

## Discipline Disparities

### Suspension and Expulsion Data

Exclusionary discipline falls disproportionately on students of color:

**Out-of-School Suspension Rates (2017-18 CRDC)**

| Group | Suspension Rate | Risk Ratio vs White Students |
|-------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| White students | 3.6% | Baseline |
| Black students | 13.7% | 3.8x |
| Latino students | 6.3% | 1.8x |
| Native American | 7.4% | 2.1x |
| Asian students | 1.5% | 0.4x |
| Multiracial | 6.4% | 1.8x |

**Intersectional Disparities**

| Group | Suspension Rate |
|-------|-----------------|

## Tracking and Gifted Program Access

### Gifted Program Demographics

**Enrollment Disparities (2017-18)**

| Group | Share of Gifted Enrollment | Share of Total Enrollment | Representation Index |
|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| White | 55% | 48% | 1.15 (over) |
| Asian | 13% | 5% | 2.60 (over) |
| Black | 9% | 15% | 0.60 (under) |
| Latino | 17% | 27% | 0.63 (under) |
| Native American | 0.8% | 1% | 0.80 (under) |
| ELL students | Severely underrepresented | 10%+ | <0.30 |

**Identification Practices**

| Method | Bias Level | Usage |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Teacher referral | High | Most common first step |
| IQ/standardized tests | Moderate | Common screening |
| Universal screening | Lower | Rare |
| Local norms | Lower | Rare |
| Portfolio/performance | Lower | Rare |

### Course Tracking

**Enrollment in Advanced Tracks**

| Group | Honors/Advanced | Standard | Remedial |
|-------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| White students | Overrepresented | Baseline | Underrepresented |
| Asian students | Highly overrepresented | - | - |
| Black students | Underrepresented | Overrepresented | Overrepresented |
| Latino students | Underrepresented | Overrepresented | Overrepresented |
| Low-income (all races) | Underrepresented | Overrepresented | Overrepresented |

**Detracking Effects**

Research on schools that eliminated tracking shows:

- Previously low-track students improve significantly
- Previously high-track students maintain or improve
- Overall school achievement increases
- Racial gaps narrow

## English Learner Services

### ELL Population

| Statistic | Data |
|-----------|------|
| ELL students nationwide | 5+ million (10%+ of enrollment) |
| Languages represented | 400+ |
| Growth rate | Fastest-growing student population |
| Geographic concentration | Increasingly dispersed |

### Service Quality Disparities

**Teacher Qualifications**

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| ELL teachers with proper credentials | 30-50% in many states |
| Bilingual certified teachers | Severe shortage |
| Professional development | Often inadequate |
| Teacher-student language match | Rare |

**Program Quality**

| Program Type | Effectiveness | Availability |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Dual-language | Highest | Limited |
| Transitional bilingual | Moderate | Declining |
| ESL pull-out | Lower | Common |
| Sink-or-swim | Harmful | Still exists |

**Outcome Gaps**

| Metric | ELL Students | Non-ELL Peers | Gap |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-----|
| Graduation rate | 67% | 85% | 18 points |
| Proficiency rates | Much lower | Higher | Substantial |
| College enrollment | Lower | Higher | ~15 points |
| Long-term classification | 25%+ remain ELL 5+ years | N/A | - |

## Title I and Federal Policy

### Title I Funding Distribution

**Current Funding**

| Statistic | Data |
|-----------|------|
| Annual Title I funding | ~$18 billion |
| Schools receiving Title I | 60%+ |
| Average per-pupil | ~$600-700 |
| Maximum poverty threshold | 40% + supplemental |

**Funding Formula Issues**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Hold-harmless provisions | Protect wealthy states |
| Population vs. poverty weighting | Dilutes poverty focus |
| Supplement not supplant | Difficult to enforce |
| Comparability loophole | Allows within-district inequity |

### Federal Civil Rights Enforcement

**Office for Civil Rights (OCR)**

| Metric | Trend |
|--------|-------|
| Complaint backlog | Growing |
| Investigation completion | Lengthy delays |
| Enforcement actions | Rare |
| Systemic investigations | Declining |

**IDEA Enforcement**

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Disproportionate identification | Ongoing |
| Least restrictive environment | Uneven implementation |
| State compliance | Variable |
| Enforcement vigor | Administration-dependent |

## Within-District Inequities

### Same District, Different Schools

Even within districts, resources vary significantly:

**Teacher Distribution (typical large district)**

| School Type | Teacher Experience | Teacher Credentials |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| High-performing | 15+ years avg | Highest rates |
| Average | 8-12 years | Moderate |
| Low-performing | 5-8 years | Lowest rates |
| Specialized/magnet | Variable, often high | Often high |

**Funding Disparities**

| Source of Variation | Magnitude |
|--------------------|-----------|
| PTA/fundraising | $0 to $500+ per pupil |
| Grant acquisition | Varies dramatically |
| Teacher salary differences | 20-30% between schools |
| Staff allocation | Follows enrollment formulas that don't account for need |

**The Comparability Loophole**

Federal law requires "comparable" services between Title I and non-Title I schools, but:

- Districts can exclude teacher salaries from comparability
- High-poverty schools often have less experienced (cheaper) teachers
- Actual spending per pupil varies 10-30% within districts
- Loophole costs high-poverty schools billions annually

## Key Takeaways

1. **Segregation is rising**: Schools are more segregated than at any point since the late 1960s in many metrics
2. **Opportunity gaps are structural**: Disparities in inputs (teachers, courses, facilities) drive outcome gaps
3. **Discipline is inequitable**: Students of color face dramatically higher rates of exclusionary discipline
4. **Tracking perpetuates stratification**: Early placement decisions limit future opportunities
5. **Federal policy is weak**: Title I is insufficient and poorly targeted; civil rights enforcement is minimal
6. **Within-district gaps matter**: Even students in the same district receive very different educations
7. **ELL students are underserved**: Growing population with inadequate services
8. **The legal landscape is constrained**: Post-*Parents Involved*, integration tools are limited

## Recent Developments

### COVID-19 Impact

The pandemic exacerbated existing inequities:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Learning loss | Greater in high-poverty schools |
| Technology access | Digital divide exposed |
| Enrollment | Declines concentrated in high-poverty districts |
| Recovery resources | Uneven distribution |

### Policy Trends

| Trend | Direction |
|-------|-----------|
| School choice expansion | Increasing (mixed equity effects) |
| Integration programs | Stagnant or declining |
| Discipline reform | Some progress, backlash emerging |
| Teacher diversity efforts | Modest progress |
| Funding equity litigation | Active in several states |
