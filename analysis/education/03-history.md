# Education: History

## Overview

American education evolved from colonial religious instruction through the common school movement, compulsory attendance laws, desegregation battles, federal involvement, standards-based reform, and today's school choice debates. Each era has reshaped who receives education, who controls it, and what it's for—reflecting broader struggles over democracy, equality, and the role of government.
