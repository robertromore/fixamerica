# Higher Education: Stakeholders

## Who Is Affected

### Students and Families

**Current Students (19.4 million)**

Students are the system's primary beneficiaries and primary funders, yet have the least power to shape it.

| Student Type | Number | Key Concerns |
|--------------|--------|--------------|
| Traditional undergrads (18-24) | 11.3M | Cost, career outcomes, experience |
| Adult learners (25+) | 8.1M | Flexibility, affordability, completion |
| Graduate students | 3.0M | Funding, career preparation, debt |
| International students | 1.1M | Visa status, work authorization |
| Part-time students | 7.4M | Work-life balance, completion barriers |

**Families**

- Expected family contribution often unrealistic
- Parent PLUS loans create intergenerational debt
- Information asymmetry in college selection
- Pressure to support children regardless of cost

**Prospective Students**

- High school graduates face complex decisions
- Working adults weighing return to school
- Transfer students navigating articulation
- Military veterans using GI Bill

**Former Students**

- 43.5 million with student debt
- Non-completers (40% of borrowers) worst outcomes
- For-profit attendees disproportionately harmed
- Forgiveness debates politically charged

### Faculty

**Tenure-Track Faculty (30% of instructional workforce)**

| Characteristic | Tenured | Tenure-Track |
|----------------|---------|--------------|
| Number | 330,000 | 140,000 |
| Median salary | $95,000 | $75,000 |
| Job security | High | Probationary |
| Research expectations | High | High |
| Governance role | Significant | Growing |

**Interests**

- Academic freedom protection
- Shared governance
- Research support
- Reasonable teaching loads
- Salary competitiveness

**Contingent Faculty (70% of instructional workforce)**

| Type | Number | Pay | Security |
|------|--------|-----|----------|
| Full-time non-tenure | 280,000 | $55,000/year | Limited |
| Part-time/adjunct | 740,000 | $3,500/course | None |
| Graduate assistants | 80,000 | $20,000/year | Term |

**Interests**

- Living wages
- Benefits access
- Job security

**The Two-Tier System**

Tenured faculty have protected positions with high salaries; contingent faculty do the majority of teaching for poverty wages. This creates tension and undermines educational quality.

## Power Analysis

| Stakeholder | Resources | Organization | Power Level |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Universities (collective) | High | High | Very High |
| State governments | High | Medium | High |
| Federal government | High | Medium | High |
| Accreditors | Medium | High | Medium-High |
| Employers | High | Low | Medium |
| Tenured faculty | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Students (current) | Low | Low | Low |

| Student debtors | Low | Growing | Low |

The fundamental imbalance: those with the most at stake (students, borrowers) have the least power; those who benefit most (institutions, administrators) are best organized.
