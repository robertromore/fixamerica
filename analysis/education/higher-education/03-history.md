# Higher Education: History

## Historical Evolution

### Colonial and Early Republic (1636-1860)

**Origins**

American higher education began with nine colonial colleges, established primarily to train clergy and civic leaders. Harvard (1636), William & Mary (1693), Yale (1701), and their peers served a tiny elite, enrolling perhaps 1% of young men.

**Early Characteristics**

- Religious mission dominant
- Classical curriculum (Latin, Greek, rhetoric)
- Enrollment: Hundreds per institution
- Funding: Church, colonial governments, private benefactors
- Purpose: Character formation for leadership class

**Antebellum Expansion**

The early republic saw proliferation of small colleges, often denominational:

- By 1860: Over 250 colleges (many short-lived)
- Enrollment: Still under 2% of college-age population
- Regional variation: Colleges spread westward
- Early coeducation: Oberlin (1833), first to admit women and African Americans
- Early HBCUs: Lincoln University (1854), Wilberforce (1856)

### Land-Grant Revolution (1862-1900)

**The Morrill Act (1862)**

The most consequential legislation in higher education history, signed by Lincoln during the Civil War:

- Granted federal land to states for colleges
- Mission: Agriculture, mechanical arts, military training
- Democratic vision: "Education of the industrial classes"
- Result: Public universities in every state

**Impact**

| Before 1862 | After 1862 |
|-------------|------------|
| Colleges serve elite | Land-grants serve farmers, workers |
| Classical curriculum | Practical and scientific education |
| Private funding dominant | State responsibility established |
| Regional concentration | Nationwide access |

**Second Morrill Act (1890)**

- Required states to show equitable distribution or create separate institutions
- Led to establishment of 19 historically Black land-grant institutions
- Codified segregation while expanding access

**Research University Emerges**

German university model influenced American institutions:

- Johns Hopkins (1876): First true research university
- Graduate education and PhD programs established
- Research mission added to teaching
- Specialization and departments developed

### Progressive Era Through Depression (1900-1940)

**Growth and Standardization**

- Carnegie Foundation creates unit system (1906)
- Regional accreditation develops
- Professional schools expand (law, medicine, engineering)
- Women's enrollment grows to 40% of total by 1920

**Public University Expansion**

State universities became flagship institutions:

- University of Wisconsin "Wisconsin Idea" (university serves state)
- Extension programs reach rural areas
- Junior colleges emerge (Joliet, 1901)
- Enrollment reaches 1.5 million by 1940

**The Depression's Impact**

- Enrollment initially declined
- Federal work-study (NYA) helped students
- Faculty salaries cut
- Foundation for post-war federal role established

### The GI Bill Revolution (1944-1970)

**Servicemen's Readjustment Act (1944)**

Transformed higher education more than any other policy:

- 7.8 million veterans used education benefits
- Federal government paid tuition directly
- Enrollment doubled in two years
- Institutions expanded rapidly

**Democratization**

| Pre-GI Bill (1940) | Post-GI Bill (1950) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Enrollment: 1.5M | Enrollment: 2.4M |
| Elite population | First-generation students |
| Private dominance | Public expansion |
| Regional access | National system |

**Community College Movement**

- Truman Commission (1947) called for universal access
- Community colleges expanded from 200 to 900 (1945-1970)
- Open access mission established
- Transfer function developed

**Civil Rights Era**

- *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954) required desegregation
- Higher Education Act (1965) created federal student aid
- Affirmative action programs began
- HBCUs continued essential role despite integration

### Mass Higher Education (1970-2000)

**Enrollment Explosion**

| Year | Enrollment | % of 18-24 Population |
|------|------------|----------------------|
| 1970 | 8.6M | 35% |
| 1980 | 12.1M | 40% |
| 1990 | 13.8M | 41% |
| 2000 | 15.3M | 45% |

**The Shift to Loans**

1972 Higher Education Act amendments fundamentally changed financing:

- Pell Grants created (originally Basic Educational Opportunity Grants)
- Guaranteed Student Loan program expanded
- For-profit colleges made eligible for federal aid
- Seeds of debt crisis planted

**Federal Aid Evolution**

| Year | Max Pell Grant | As % of Public Tuition | Loan Limits |
|------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 1975 | $1,400 | 84% | $1,500/year |
| 1985 | $2,100 | 52% | $2,625/year |
| 1995 | $2,340 | 34% | $2,625/year |
| 2000 | $3,300 | 38% | $2,625/year |

**State Disinvestment Begins**

- Tax revolts (Proposition 13, 1978) cut state revenues
- Higher education "budget balancer" during recessions
- Per-student appropriations peaked around 1980
- Tuition began rapid ascent

**For-Profit Emergence**

- 1972 amendments enabled for-profit access to aid
- DeVry, University of Phoenix expand
- Initially served working adults
- Regulatory framework inadequate

### Era of Accountability (2000-Present)

**Rising Costs, Rising Scrutiny**

| Factor | 2000 | 2023 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Public tuition | $3,500 | $11,260 | +222% |
| Student debt (total) | $200B | $1.75T | +775% |
| State support (per student) | $8,500 | $8,000 | -6% |
| Admin positions | 100 | 221 | +121% |

**Great Recession Impact (2008-2015)**

- Massive state funding cuts (30%+ in some states)
- Tuition spikes to compensate
- Enrollment surge initially, then decline
- For-profit sector peaked then collapsed under scrutiny

**Regulatory Responses**

- Gainful employment rules (2010, rescinded 2019, restored 2023)
- College Scorecard (2015)
- Borrower defense regulations
- Accreditation reform efforts

**COVID-19 Disruption (2020-Present)**

- Immediate shift to remote instruction
- Enrollment decline accelerated (especially community colleges)
- Federal emergency relief ($76 billion HEERF)
- Questions about value of traditional model

**Student Debt Politics**

- Obama: Income-driven repayment expansion, Public Service Loan Forgiveness
- Trump: DeVry settlement, for-profit friendly
- Biden: Loan pause, forgiveness attempts, new IDR plans
- Supreme Court blocks broad forgiveness (2023)

## Lessons from History

**What Worked**

1. **Federal commitment**: GI Bill, land-grants showed federal investment transforms access
2. **Public funding**: Era of low tuition coincided with broad access
3. **Mission clarity**: Institutions thrived when purpose was clear
4. **Democratic access**: Opening doors raised all boats

**What Failed**

1. **Loan dependence**: Shifting from grants to loans created debt crisis
2. **State retreat**: Disinvestment shifted costs to students
3. **For-profit access to aid**: Poor outcomes, student harm
4. **Accreditation as gatekeeper**: Failed to ensure quality

**Recurring Tensions**

- Elite vs. democratic access
- Public good vs. private benefit
- State vs. federal responsibility
- Vocational vs. liberal education
- Research vs. teaching missions
