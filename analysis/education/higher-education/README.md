# Higher Education

American higher education stands at a crossroads. Once the envy of the world, the system that built the middle class and powered American innovation now burdens students with $1.75 trillion in debt, perpetuates inequality through stratified access, and increasingly fails to deliver on its promise of economic mobility. Tuition has risen 1,200% since 1980, far outpacing inflation, while state support per student has declined. The result is a system that charges more, delivers less value for many students, and excludes those who need it most.
