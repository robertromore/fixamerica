# Higher Education: Solutions

## Reform Framework

Comprehensive reform must address cost, access, quality, and accountability simultaneously. Piecemeal approaches have failed because the problems are interconnected.

### Principles for Reform

1. **Shift from loans to grants**: Reduce debt burden while maintaining access
2. **Hold institutions accountable**: Tie federal funds to outcomes
3. **Restore state investment**: Rebuild public funding compact
4. **Eliminate bad actors**: End for-profit predation
5. **Support completion**: Invest in student success, not just access
6. **Value teaching**: Recognize and reward instruction
7. **Simplify the system**: Reduce complexity for students

## Affordability Solutions

### Free Community College

**Proposal**: Eliminate tuition at public community colleges for all students.

**How It Works**

- Federal-state partnership (federal covers 75%, states 25%)
- States maintain current per-student funding
- Last-dollar program (after other grants)
- Requirements: maintain enrollment, meet quality standards

**Cost**: $8-10 billion per year (federal share)

**Evidence**

| State | Program | Results |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Tennessee | Promise | 25% enrollment increase, higher completion |
| Oregon | Promise | 48% increase in community college enrollment |
| New York | Excelsior | Modest impact (middle-class focus) |

**Design Considerations**

- First-dollar vs. last-dollar (first-dollar helps poorest more)
- Living expenses not covered (need supplemental grants)
- Must prevent state supplantation

### Pell Grant Expansion

**Current State**

- Maximum Pell: $7,395 (2023-24)
- Covers 29% of public university cost (was 79% in 1980)
- 7 million recipients

**Reform Options**

| Option | Details | Cost |
|--------|---------|------|
| Double the Pell | $14,790 maximum | $30B/year |
| Cover full public tuition | Variable by state | $35B/year |
| Extend to incarcerated students | Restore eligibility | $0.1B/year |
| Extend to DACA recipients | Restore eligibility | $0.5B/year |

**Indexing**

- Index to CPI (prevents erosion)
- Index to tuition (maintains purchasing power)
- Automatic appropriation (end annual uncertainty)

### Debt-Free College

**Concept**: No student should have to borrow to attend public college.

**How It Works**

- Pell expansion covers low-income students
- State-federal matching covers middle-income gap
- Work-study expanded for remaining costs
- No loans needed for tuition and fees

**Model**: New Mexico's Opportunity Scholarship

- Covers tuition gap after other aid
- Any New Mexico resident
- No income limit
- Funded by oil and gas revenue

### Student Debt Relief

**Targeted Cancellation**

| Target | Rationale | Cost |
|--------|-----------|------|
| For-profit victims | Fraud and deception | $25B (pending) |
| Public service workers (PSLF) | Promised forgiveness | $42B (approved) |
| Borrowers in IDR 20+ years | System failure | $150B |
| Disability discharge | Inability to pay | $12B |
| All borrowers (<$50K) | Economic stimulus | $400B |

**Income-Driven Repayment Reform**

The SAVE Plan (2023):

- 5% of discretionary income (undergraduate)
- $32,800 income protection (vs. poverty line)
- Forgiveness after 20 years (10 for small balances)
- Interest subsidy (balance won't grow)

**Bankruptcy Restoration**

- Student loans uniquely non-dischargeable
- No other consumer debt treated this way
- Restoration would provide safety valve
- Fear of abuse unfounded (studies show)

## Access and Equity Solutions

### Closing Completion Gaps

**Support Programs That Work**

| Intervention | Effect Size | Cost per Student |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| ASAP (CUNY) | +18 pts completion | $4,000/year |
| Guided Pathways | +5-10 pts | $200/year |
| Emergency aid | +3-5 pts | $500 one-time |
| Proactive advising | +4-8 pts | $300/year |
| Learning communities | +3-6 pts | $500/year |

**ASAP Model (Accelerated Study in Associate Programs)**

- Block scheduling
- Required full-time enrollment
- Intrusive advising
- Free textbooks and MetroCards
- Results: 40% completion vs. 22% comparison

**Scaling**

- ASAP costs ~$4,000 more per student
- But graduates more students per dollar spent
- More efficient use of resources overall

### Transfer and Articulation

**Problems**

- Students lose 43% of credits on average when transferring
- Each lost credit costs ~$600
- Transfer students take 6+ years to bachelor's

**Solutions**

1. **Common course numbering**: Ensure equivalencies
2. **Transfer guarantees**: Automatic admission for completers
3. **Meta-majors**: Broader pathways prevent wrong-course taking
4. **Reverse transfer**: Award associate's when credits accumulated

### Information and Transparency

**College Scorecard Enhancement**

- Program-level outcomes (not just institutional)
- Earnings by major and institution
- Debt-to-earnings ratios
- Disaggregated by student demographics

**Mandatory Disclosure**

- Net price (not sticker price) in marketing
- Graduation rates by subgroup
- Employment outcomes by program
- Default and repayment rates

**Shopping Sheet**

Standardized offer letter showing:

- True cost after aid
- Loan burden vs. expected earnings
- Comparison to similar institutions
- Graduation rate context

## Accountability Solutions

### Risk-Sharing (Skin in the Game)

**Concept**: Institutions share financial responsibility for student outcomes.

**Design Options**

| Model | Trigger | Institution Pays |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| Loan default | Default rate >15% | Percentage of defaults |
| Non-completion | Completion <25% | Portion of non-completer debt |
| Earnings threshold | Graduates earn <$25K | Refund portion of tuition |

**Risk Adjustment**

- Adjust thresholds by student population
- Pell recipient percentage
- Academic preparation
- Part-time student share

**Arguments For**

- Aligns institutional and student interests
- Creates incentive to improve outcomes
- Those who profit from debt share risk

**Arguments Against**

- May discourage serving at-risk students
- Institutions may game metrics
- Complicated to administer

### Gainful Employment Rules

**Concept**: Programs must prepare students for gainful employment.

**Current Rule (2023)**

Programs fail if:

- Debt-to-earnings ratio >8% (discretionary income)
- Debt-to-earnings ratio >20% (total income)
- Failing two consecutive years triggers sanctions

**Sanctions**

1. Warning and disclosure
2. Loss of federal aid eligibility
3. Closure

**Scope**

- Currently applies to for-profit programs
- Should apply to all career programs
- Exempts liberal arts bachelor's degrees

### Accreditation Reform

**Problems with Current System**

- Conflict of interest (peer review)
- Focus on inputs, not outcomes
- Failed to prevent for-profit abuses
- Barrier to innovation

**Reform Options**

1. **Outcome requirements**: Minimum completion, earnings standards
2. **Alternative pathways**: Allow EQUIP-style experiments
3. **Federal standards**: Department sets minimums
4. **Separation of functions**: Different bodies for aid eligibility vs. quality
5. **Transparency**: Public accreditation reports

## Quality and Workforce Solutions

### Improving Teaching

**The Problem**

- Research rewarded; teaching ignored
- Adjuncts teach most students
- Little pedagogical training
- Student evaluations flawed

**Solutions**

1. **Teaching-track positions**: Permanent, well-paid teaching faculty
2. **Pedagogical training**: Required for graduate students, new faculty
3. **Learning outcome assessment**: Measure what students learn
4. **Class size limits**: Reduce mega-lectures
5. **Teaching centers**: Support instructional improvement

### Faculty Labor Reform

**Adjunct Conversion**

- Require minimum percentage of courses by full-time faculty
- Provide health benefits for adjuncts teaching 2+ courses
- Pro-rata pay (same per-course as full-time)
- Multi-year contracts with renewal expectation

**Graduate Student Support**

- Living-wage stipends
- Health insurance coverage
- Family leave policies
- Clear time-to-degree expectations

### Skills and Workforce Alignment

**Short-Term Credentials**

- Pell-eligible certificate programs (already expanded)
- Stackable credentials toward degrees
- Industry-recognized certifications
- Apprenticeship integration

**Employer Partnerships**

- Co-op and internship programs
- Industry advisory boards
- Equipment and curriculum support
- Hiring commitments

**Competency-Based Education**

- Credit for prior learning
- Flexible pacing
- Demonstration of skills vs. seat time
- Technology-enabled assessment

## System-Level Solutions

### State Investment Restoration

**Maintenance of Effort**

- Federal funds contingent on state funding levels
- Prevent state supplantation of federal aid
- Indexed to inflation or enrollment

**State-Federal Compact**

| Party | Commitment |
|-------|------------|
| Federal | Increased Pell, completion funding |
| State | Maintain per-student funding, freeze tuition |
| Institution | Meet outcome standards, limit admin growth |

### Institutional Efficiency

**Administrative Streamlining**

- Shared services among institutions
- Technology for routine functions
- Benchmarking against peers
- Incentives for efficiency

**Athletics Reform**

- Revenue sharing among institutions
- Compensation caps
- Academic integration
- Cost containment requirements

### International Models

| Country | Model | Features |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Germany | Free tuition | No tuition at public universities |
| UK | Income-contingent loans | Payments tied to earnings; forgiveness after 30 years |
| Australia | HECS | Deferred tuition, income-contingent repayment |
| Canada | Provincial variation | Low tuition, strong grants |
| Nordic | Free + living stipend | Full support for students |

**Lessons**

- Direct public funding more efficient than loan-and-aid system
- Income-contingent repayment reduces default risk
- Universal access does not preclude high quality
- Political will is the constraint, not resources
