# Higher Education: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

Why have costs risen so dramatically while outcomes stagnate for many students?

### Structural Causes

**The Bennett Hypothesis: Aid Chasing Tuition**

William Bennett's 1987 thesis that federal aid enables tuition increases has empirical support:

- Institutions capture aid through price increases
- Loan limits correlate with tuition growth
- For-profits most aggressively captured aid
- Market discipline absent when third party pays

**Evidence**

- Studies find $0.60-$1.00 tuition increase per dollar of subsidized loan increase
- Effect stronger at for-profits and less selective institutions
- Pell Grant increases associated with smaller tuition effects
- Not the sole cause, but a contributing factor

**Baumol's Cost Disease**

Higher education shares characteristics with sectors that resist productivity gains:

- Labor-intensive service
- Difficult to substitute technology for faculty
- Must compete for talent with productive sectors
- Wages rise without corresponding productivity gains

**Critique**

- Applies to instruction, not administration
- Other countries have similar cost structures but lower prices
- Doesn't explain why administration grew faster than instruction

**State Disinvestment**

The most direct cause of tuition increases at public institutions:

| Decade | State Share of Public University Revenue | Tuition Share |
|--------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| 1980s | 48% | 21% |
| 1990s | 38% | 26% |
| 2000s | 31% | 32% |
| 2010s | 23% | 38% |
| 2020s | 21% | 42% |

**Causes of State Disinvestment**

- Medicaid growth crowds out higher education
- Tax cuts and revenue limits
- Prison spending growth
- Political choice: easier to cut higher ed than K-12
- View of higher education as private good

### Institutional Causes

**Administrative Bloat**

Administrator positions grew at more than twice the rate of faculty:

| Position Type | Growth (1975-2023) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Full-time faculty | +92% |
| Executive/professional | +221% |
| Other staff | +156% |
| Students | +122% |

**What Drives Administrative Growth**

1. **Compliance burden**: Federal regulations, accreditation, reporting
2. **Mission expansion**: Student services, wellness, diversity offices
3. **Marketing and recruitment**: Arms race for students
4. **Fundraising apparatus**: Development offices, alumni relations
5. **Technology management**: IT staff
6. **Athletics administration**: Separate bureaucracies
7. **Risk management**: Legal, HR, Title IX

**The Amenities Race**

Institutions compete on non-academic features:

- Luxury dormitories ($10,000+ rooms)
- Recreation centers ($50M+ facilities)
- Dining halls (celebrity chefs, unlimited options)
- Student unions (elaborate programming)
- Career centers and advising (helpful but expensive)

**Why It Happens**

- Rankings reward selectivity and prestige
- Students (especially wealthy ones) respond to amenities
- Parents expect campus experience
- No price competition (aid obscures true cost)
- "Winner-take-all" dynamics in admissions

**Prestige Competition**

Institutions pursue status rather than student outcomes:

- Research subsidized by undergraduate tuition
- Small classes at elite schools (large lectures elsewhere)
- Faculty evaluated on research, not teaching
- Rankings reward inputs, not learning

**Research Cross-Subsidization**

| Institution Type | Research Revenue | Tuition Cross-Subsidy |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| R1 Research University | 25% of budget | $15-25K per undergrad |
| Teaching University | 3% of budget | $5K per undergrad |
| Community College | <1% of budget | Minimal |

### Economic Causes

**Market Failures in Higher Education**

Higher education violates basic market assumptions:

1. **Information asymmetry**: Students cannot evaluate quality before purchase
2. **Delayed returns**: Benefits accrue years after decision
3. **Signaling vs. learning**: Degree may matter more than knowledge
4. **Third-party payment**: Disconnects price from decision
5. **Quasi-monopoly**: Geographic constraints, credential requirements

**Credential Inflation**

Jobs increasingly require degrees for tasks that don't require degree-level skills:

- Police officers: Increasingly require bachelor's
- Administrative assistants: Bachelor's common requirement
- Hospital technicians: Associate's or bachelor's
- Filtering mechanism for employers (shifts screening cost)

**College Wage Premium**

The premium for college degrees creates demand regardless of price:

| Education Level | Median Earnings | Unemployment Rate |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Less than high school | $35,000 | 7.8% |
| High school | $42,000 | 4.5% |
| Some college | $47,000 | 3.8% |
| Associate's | $52,000 | 3.3% |
| Bachelor's | $75,000 | 2.5% |
| Master's | $85,000 | 2.1% |

**Inelastic Demand**

Because college is seen as essential, demand persists despite price increases:

- "At any cost" mentality for children's education
- Fear of downward mobility
- Limited alternatives with credibility
- Status competition among families

### Political Economy

**Who Benefits from the Status Quo**

| Beneficiary | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| University administrators | High salaries, growing empires |
| Tenured faculty | Protected positions, sabbaticals |
| Loan servicers | $1.75T in loans to manage |
| Lending industry | Interest on private loans |
| Athletic programs | TV money, coach salaries |
| Construction industry | Perpetual campus building |
| Consulting industry | Continuous "reform" projects |

**Who Loses**

| Losers | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Students | Debt, uncertain outcomes |
| Adjunct faculty | Poverty wages, no security |
| Taxpayers | Subsidizing inefficient system |
| Employers | Skills mismatch |
| Non-attendees | Credential requirements exclude |

**Why Reform Is Hard**

1. **Distributed costs, concentrated benefits**: Students diffuse; universities organized
2. **Information advantages**: Institutions control narrative
3. **Political donations**: Universities in every district
4. **Ideological divides**: Free market vs. public funding debates
5. **Complexity**: Multiple issues conflated (access, cost, outcomes)

### Access Inequality

**Why Low-Income Students Don't Attend**

1. **Inadequate financial aid**: Pell covers only 29% of public university cost
2. **Information gaps**: Complex aid process, unclear returns
3. **Academic preparation**: K-12 disparities carry forward
4. **Geographic constraints**: Fewer options in rural areas
5. **Family obligations**: Work and caregiving compete
6. **Risk aversion**: Debt fear without parental safety net

**Why They Don't Complete**

1. **Working while enrolled**: Part-time students have 12% graduation rate
2. **Family responsibilities**: Childcare, eldercare
3. **Financial emergencies**: One crisis derails enrollment
4. **Academic support gaps**: Underfunded advising, tutoring
5. **Institutional resource differences**: Less spending at open-access schools

**Sorting and Stratification**

| Student Background | Typical Destination | Resources per Student |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Wealthy, prepared | Selective private | $92,000/year |
| Middle class | State flagship | $38,000/year |
| Working class | Regional public | $24,000/year |
| Low-income | Community college | $12,000/year |
| Underserved | For-profit | Minimal (high tuition) |

This sorting perpetuates inequality rather than reducing it.

Federal aid increases → Institutions capture aid → Price spiral
         ↓
Amenities race → Non-instructional spending grows

Admin proliferation → Overhead increases

Research cross-subsidy → Undergraduate teaching shortchanged

For-profit predation → Worst outcomes for vulnerable
         ↓
    RESULT: $1.75T debt, declining completion, stratified access
```

## Key Insight

The cost crisis is not primarily about instructional spending or faculty salaries. It results from:

1. Political choices (state disinvestment)
2. Institutional incentives (prestige over outcomes)
3. Market failures (third-party payment, information asymmetry)
4. Regulatory failures (for-profit oversight)
5. Collective action problems (no coordination among actors)

Other countries demonstrate that quality higher education need not bankrupt students. The American crisis is a policy failure, not an inevitable economic outcome.
