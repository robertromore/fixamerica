# Higher Education

## Overview

American higher education stands at a crossroads. Once the envy of the world, the system that built the middle class and powered American innovation now burdens students with $1.75 trillion in debt, perpetuates inequality through stratified access, and increasingly fails to deliver on its promise of economic mobility. Tuition has risen 1,200% since 1980, far outpacing inflation, while state support per student has declined. The result is a system that charges more, delivers less value for many students, and excludes those who need it most.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- Four-year public and private colleges and universities
- Community colleges and two-year institutions
- For-profit colleges and their regulatory failures
- Graduate and professional education
- Research universities and federal research funding
- Vocational and technical post-secondary education
- Accreditation and quality assurance systems
- Student financial aid systems
- Faculty labor markets and working conditions
- Athletics, amenities, and commercialization
- International student dynamics and brain circulation

## Key Facts

**Cost and Debt**

- Average annual tuition and fees (2023-24): $11,260 (public in-state), $41,540 (private)
- Total student loan debt: $1.75 trillion (larger than credit card or auto loan debt)
- Average debt at graduation: $29,400 (bachelor's degree)
- Borrowers in default or serious delinquency: 11%
- Share of Pell recipients from bottom income quartile: 57%

**Access and Enrollment**

- Total post-secondary enrollment: 19.4 million students
- First-generation college students: 33% of undergraduates
- Bachelor's degree attainment by age 25 by family income:
    - Top quartile: 58%
    - Bottom quartile: 11%
- Enrollment decline (2010-2022): 15%

**Outcomes**

- Six-year graduation rate (public universities): 62%
- Six-year graduation rate (community colleges toward bachelor's): 14%
- Completion rate at for-profits: 23%
- Students completing with credentials of value: 48% within 10 years
- Students who would choose a different school or major: 61%

**Workforce**

- Jobs requiring bachelor's degree: 35% (and growing)
- College wage premium (bachelor's vs. high school): 84%
- Underemployment rate for recent graduates: 41%
- Graduates working in jobs requiring their degree: 49%

## Why This Matters

Higher education is the primary pathway to middle-class life in America. Yet the current system increasingly stratifies rather than equalizes opportunity. Wealthy students attend well-resourced institutions with high completion rates, while low-income and first-generation students are funneled toward under-resourced community colleges and for-profit institutions with low completion rates and poor labor market returns.

The cost crisis affects not just students but the entire economy. Mounting debt delays household formation, homeownership, and entrepreneurship. States underfund public universities while demanding they drive economic development. Employers complain graduates lack needed skills while doing little to support training. And the federal government subsidizes the system through financial aid that inflates prices without improving outcomes.

Reform is essential for economic competitiveness, social mobility, and democratic citizenship. Other nations are catching up and surpassing American higher education while charging students far less. Without fundamental changes, America risks falling behind globally while failing its own citizens.

## Central Tensions

**Access vs. Excellence**

Mass higher education requires resources that spread thin as enrollment grows. Elite institutions preserve selectivity while public institutions struggle with open access and limited funding.

**Public Good vs. Private Benefit**

Higher education produces public benefits (civic participation, innovation, economic growth) and private benefits (higher earnings). The balance of who pays reflects this tension.

**Autonomy vs. Accountability**

Academic freedom and institutional autonomy enable innovation and protect against political interference. But without accountability, institutions may prioritize prestige over outcomes.

**Credentials vs. Learning**

Degrees serve as signals to employers, regardless of what was learned. This credentialing function may distort the educational mission.

**Research vs. Teaching**

Research universities reward faculty for publications, not teaching. Undergraduate education often suffers as a result.

## What Success Would Look Like

- Affordable access to quality higher education for all qualified students
- Completion rates above 80% across institution types
- Student debt that is manageable relative to post-graduation earnings
- Equity in access and outcomes across income, race, and geography
- Clear pathways between education and meaningful employment
- Faculty with sustainable working conditions and job security
- Research enterprise that addresses societal needs
- Institutions accountable for outcomes, not just inputs
