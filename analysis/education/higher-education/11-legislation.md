# Higher Education: Legislation

## Overview

Higher education reform requires legislative action at federal and state levels, supplemented by regulatory enforcement. The federal government controls student aid, while states control public institution governance and funding. This document provides draft legislation for comprehensive reform, with attention to potential loopholes and shortcomings.

## Federal Legislation

percent since 1980, far outpacing inflation and wage growth.

millions of Americans and constraining economic growth.
(3) Community colleges serve as the primary access point for
low-income, first-generation, and adult students.

shifting costs to students and families.

education while achieving comparable or better outcomes.

establish a program providing grants to States that agree to

adjusted each year by the percentage change in the Consumer
Price Index for All Urban Consumers.

may be necessary for each succeeding fiscal year, for the
free community college partnership;

Grant expansion.

academic year.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 3 creates federal-state partnership modeled on Tennessee Promise success
- Section 4 doubles Pell Grant and adds permanent indexing
- Section 5 addresses FAFSA complexity that deters applicants
- Section 6 prevents states from reducing their own funding
- First-dollar coverage ensures poorest students benefit most

**Potential Challenges**:

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**Spending Power**

- Federal conditions on education funding well-established
- States voluntarily participate
- Conditions must be clear and related to purpose
- *South Dakota v. Dole* (1987) framework applies

**Commerce Clause**

- Limited role in direct regulation
- Supports data collection requirements
- Affects interstate student movement

### Preemption Issues

**State Consumer Protection**

- State attorney general enforcement preserved
- Federal floor, not ceiling
- Dual enforcement permitted

**State Licensing**

- States retain authority over institutional authorization
- Federal eligibility requires state authorization
- Reciprocity agreements (SARA) permitted

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Federal Enforcement**

- Loss of Title IV eligibility (strongest tool)
- Heightened cash monitoring
- Provisional certification
- False Claims Act liability

**State Enforcement**

- Consumer protection actions
- Bond requirements
- Refund obligations

**Private Enforcement**

- Borrower defense claims
- Class actions for servicer violations
- State law claims

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| State supplantation | States reduce funding when federal aid increases | High |
| Risk-sharing avoidance | Institutions reject high-risk students | High |
| Data manipulation | Incomplete reporting, excluded students | Medium |
| Credential inflation | Create short programs to game completion rates | Medium |
| For-profit conversion | Convert to nonprofit to avoid rules | Medium |
| Transfer churning | Push out students before default triggers | High |
| Program elimination | Close low-return programs rather than improve | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Coverage gaps | Free CC doesn't cover living expenses | Partial solution |
| Existing debt | Current borrowers not addressed by reforms | Focus on future |
| Private institutions | Accountability limited | Voluntary participation |
| Adult learners | Program design favors traditional students | Historical bias |
| Graduate education | Debt often larger; less addressed | Focus on undergraduate |
| International comparison | Still more expensive than peer nations | Political constraints |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-supplantation enforcement**:
    - Require real per-student maintenance, not nominal
    - Include institutional support, not just appropriations
    - Independent auditing of state compliance
    - 2:1 penalty ratio for violations

2. **Risk-sharing design**:
    - Risk-adjust by student population
    - Reward improvement, not just levels
    - Floor protections for mission-driven institutions
    - Separate metrics for open-access institutions

3. **Data integrity**:
    - Third-party auditing of outcome data
    - Whistleblower protections
    - Criminal penalties for fraud
    - Presumption of inclusion for disputed students

4. **Credential gaming prevention**:
    - Minimum credential length for Pell eligibility
    - Stack-ability requirements
    - Labor market alignment verification
    - Earnings floors by credential level

5. **For-profit oversight**:
    - Look-through ownership rules
    - Nonprofit conversion waiting period
    - Executive compensation limits
    - Marketing-to-instruction ratios

6. **Student protection during enforcement**:
    - Teach-out requirements
    - Automatic transfer of credits
    - Emergency aid for stranded students
    - Loan pause during transitions

### General Implementation Concerns

1. **Regulatory capture**: Department of Education susceptible to industry influence
    - Solution: Inspector General oversight, GAO audits, term limits for political appointees

2. **Litigation delays**: Industry challenges delay enforcement
    - Solution: Expedited review procedures, preliminary injunction standards

3. **Political reversal**: Subsequent administrations may weaken rules
    - Solution: Statutory requirements, not just regulatory; sunset reviews

4. **Complexity burden**: Small institutions struggle with compliance
    - Solution: Tiered requirements by size, technical assistance

5. **Unintended consequences**: Reforms may have unforeseen effects
    - Solution: Pilot programs, regular evaluation, flexibility for adjustment
