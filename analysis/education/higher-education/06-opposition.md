# Higher Education: Opposition to Reform

## Who Opposes Reform and Why

### University Leadership and Associations

**American Council on Education (ACE)**

The main lobbying arm of higher education consistently opposes accountability measures.

| Reform Proposal | ACE Position | Stated Reason |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Risk-sharing (skin in the game) | Oppose | Would harm access |
| Gainful employment rules | Oppose | Federal overreach |
| Student outcome requirements | Oppose | Unfair metrics |
| Price controls | Oppose | Threatens quality |
| Loan limits | Oppose | Harms students |
| Accreditation reform | Oppose | Threatens autonomy |

**Talking Points**

- "Higher education is too diverse for one-size-fits-all rules"
- "Outcome measures punish institutions that serve at-risk students"
- "Regulation threatens academic freedom"
- "Market forces should determine prices"

**Real Interests**

- Preserve revenue streams
- Maintain autonomy from oversight
- Protect prestige competition
- Avoid accountability for outcomes

**Association of American Universities (AAU)**

The 65 elite research universities have distinct interests:

- Protect research funding
- Maintain selectivity
- Oppose changes that might redirect resources
- Preserve prestige hierarchy

**For-Profit College Industry**

Though diminished, still fights regulation:

| Organization | Activities |
|--------------|------------|
| Career Education Colleges and Universities (CECU) | Lobbying, lawsuits |
| Individual institutions | Campaign contributions |
| Private equity owners | Political influence |

**Arguments**

- "Serve non-traditional students others won't"
- "Provide workforce training"
- "Unfairly targeted by regulations"

**Track Record**

- ITT Tech, Corinthian: Massive fraud, taxpayer losses
- University of Phoenix, DeVry: Deceptive practices
- Student outcomes: Far worse than comparison groups

### Political Opposition

**Conservative Opposition to Free College**

| Argument | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|------------------|
| "Subsidizes wealthy" | Progressive financing possible; means-testing exists |
| "Government shouldn't pick winners" | Already subsidizes through tax breaks, loans |
| "Devalues existing degrees" | Credential inflation already happening |
| "Socialist policy" | GI Bill was popular; land-grants bipartisan |

**Deep Concerns**

- Ideological opposition to expanded government role
- View education as private good, not public investment
- Distrust of universities as liberal institutions
- Worry about tax increases

**Progressive Concerns About Accountability**

Some on the left oppose accountability measures:

- "Punishes institutions serving disadvantaged students"
- "Narrow metrics ignore broader mission"
- "Could lead to cutting access"
- "Gives ammunition to defunders"

**Real Trade-offs**

- Badly designed accountability can harm access
- But no accountability enables waste and predation
- Must design systems that hold institutions accountable while recognizing context

### Faculty Opposition

**Tenured Faculty Concerns**

| Reform | Concern |
|--------|---------|
| Teaching evaluation | Academic freedom, oversimplification |
| Outcome metrics | Gaming, mission distortion |
| Program elimination | Job losses, disciplinary harm |
| Administrative cuts | May shift work to faculty |
| Online expansion | Quality concerns, workload |

**Graduate Student/Adjunct Ambivalence**

- Support reform in principle
- Fear reforms may eliminate their positions
- Want better treatment, not just system change
- Skeptical of employer-driven reforms

**Union Positions**

Faculty unions generally support:

- Public funding increases
- Conversion of contingent to permanent positions
- Governance reforms

Faculty unions often oppose:

- Outcome-based accountability
- Program elimination
- Administrative efficiency measures

### State Government Opposition

**Reasons States Resist Reform**

1. **Cost**: Free community college requires appropriations
2. **Control**: Federal conditions on state programs
3. **Ideology**: Opposition to government expansion
4. **Politics**: University boards as patronage

**Regional Variation**

| Region | Typical Stance |
|--------|----------------|
| Northeast | Generally supportive of public investment |
| South | Resistance to federal involvement |
| Midwest | Mixed; populist tradition vs. fiscal conservatism |
| West | Innovation friendly but cost-conscious |

### Accreditor Resistance

**Opposition to Reform**

Accreditors oppose changes that would:

- Impose federal outcome standards
- Create alternative pathways to accreditation
- Reduce their gatekeeping power
- Make them liable for institutional failures

**Arguments**

- "Peer review protects academic quality"
- "Federal involvement politicizes accreditation"
- "Innovation requires flexibility"

**Conflicts of Interest**

- Board members from accredited institutions
- Revenue from accreditation fees
- No incentive to deny accreditation

### Loan Industry Opposition

**Student Loan Servicers**

- Oppose debt cancellation (reduces portfolio)
- Oppose simplification (reduces servicing needs)
- Resist accountability for errors
- Lobby for continued contracts

**Private Lenders**

- Oppose expanded federal lending
- Fight for bankruptcy exception continuation
- Resist interest rate caps
- Want access to graduate/parent loan market

**Collection Industry**

- Opposes forgiveness of defaulted loans
- Fights restrictions on wage garnishment
- Wants continued access to Social Security offsets

### Employer Opposition

**Resistance to Education-Industry Integration**

- Oppose requirements to contribute to training
- Resist curriculum influence requirements
- Want universities to bear all training costs
- Prefer screening function of credentials

**Credential Inflation Beneficiaries**

Some employers benefit from degree requirements:

- Screens out candidates cheaply
- Legal defense against discrimination claims
- Signals class and cultural fit
- No incentive to change

### Arguments Against Specific Reforms

**Against Free Community College**

| Argument | Evaluation |
|----------|------------|
| "Costs too much" | $8-10B/year; less than some tax expenditures |
| "Won't improve completion" | Tennessee saw increases |
| "Benefits wealthy" | Design can ensure progressive |
| "Community colleges are bad" | Underfunded, not inherently low quality |

**Against Student Debt Cancellation**

| Argument | Evaluation |
|----------|------------|
| "Regressive" | Most debt held by middle class, but poorest harmed most |
| "Moral hazard" | Future students still need systemic fix |
| "Unfair to non-borrowers" | Past injustice doesn't justify perpetuating |
| "Too expensive" | Costs can be distributed; generates economic activity |

**Against Gainful Employment Rules**

| Argument | Evaluation |
|----------|------------|
| "Hurts low-income students" | For-profits hurt them more |
| "Wrong metrics" | Debt-to-earnings is relevant |
| "Federal overreach" | Federal aid justifies conditions |
| "Picks winners and losers" | Current system lets losers continue |

**Against Risk-Sharing**

| Argument | Evaluation |
|----------|------------|
| "Punishes schools for serving poor students" | Can risk-adjust |
| "Too complex" | Complexity not an argument against |
| "Institutions can't control student success" | They control many factors |
| "Would reduce access" | Could be designed to protect access |

### Interest Group Politics

**Campaign Contributions**

| Sector | 2020 Cycle Contributions |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Higher education | $63 million |
| For-profit education | $12 million |
| Student loan industry | $8 million |

**Lobbying Expenditures**

| Organization | Annual Lobbying |
|--------------|-----------------|
| American Council on Education | $1.2 million |
| Association of American Universities | $0.8 million |
| CECU (for-profit) | $1.5 million |
| Various universities | $30+ million combined |

**Revolving Door**

- Department of Education officials join university associations
- For-profit executives serve in Department
- Congressional staff become university lobbyists
- Accreditors draw from regulated institutions

### What Reform Opponents Get Right

**Legitimate Concerns**

1. **Badly designed accountability can harm access**: Outcome measures must account for student population
2. **Some regulation is burdensome**: Compliance costs are real; streamlining matters
3. **Higher education is genuinely diverse**: One policy won't fit all institutions
4. **Federal involvement can be politicized**: Design matters for durability
5. **Trade-offs exist**: Free college might reduce per-student funding

**Incorporating Valid Concerns**

Effective reform must:

- Risk-adjust outcome metrics
- Streamline rather than add regulation
- Preserve institutional diversity
- Build bipartisan durability
- Address trade-offs explicitly
