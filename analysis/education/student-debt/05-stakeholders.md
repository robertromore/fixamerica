# Student Debt: Stakeholders

## Overview

The student debt crisis involves diverse stakeholders with varying interests, power, and capacity for action. Understanding these stakeholders is essential for designing politically viable reforms and anticipating opposition.

Broadly, stakeholders fall into three categories:

1. **Those who bear the burden**: Borrowers and their families
2. **Those who benefit from the system**: Servicers, collectors, institutions, investors
3. **Those with power over the system**: Congress, Department of Education, courts

## Borrowers

### Current Borrowers (45 Million)

The most directly affected stakeholders are the 45 million Americans carrying student debt. This group is internally diverse:

**Undergraduate Borrowers**:

- Average debt: $25,000-$30,000
- Often from lower-income backgrounds
- More likely to have attended public institutions
- Higher default rates than graduate borrowers
- More sensitive to small cancellation amounts

**Graduate and Professional Borrowers**:

- Average debt: $60,000+ (professional schools often $150,000+)
- Higher earning potential but also higher debt
- Lower default rates but more concentrated debt
- Benefit most from broad cancellation
- Often employed in jobs that qualify for PSLF

**For-Profit Attendees**:

- Higher default rates than any other group
- Often recruited deceptively
- Credentials frequently worthless
- Disproportionately low-income, minority, veteran, and first-generation
- Strong case for targeted relief

**Defaulted Borrowers (5+ Million)**:

- Wages garnished, tax refunds seized
- Credit destroyed
- Often permanently excluded from economic mainstream
- Disproportionately low-income and minority
- Most urgent need for relief

**Parent PLUS Borrowers**:

- Borrowed for children's education
- Often approach or in retirement
- Average debt: $28,000
- Growing share of borrowers over 50
- Unique policy considerations

### Advocacy Organizations

**Student Debt Crisis Center**: Grassroots organization of borrowers; advocacy and storytelling

**Student Borrower Protection Center**: Research and policy advocacy; legal expertise

**NAACP**: Racial equity focus; emphasizes disproportionate impact on Black borrowers

**Center for Responsible Lending**: Consumer protection focus; predatory lending expertise

**Young Invincibles**: Millennial/Gen Z advocacy; broader economic opportunity agenda

**Debt Collective**: Radical debt resistance; collective action and debt strikes

### Political Influence

Borrowers have significant numbers but face collective action problems:

**Strengths**:

- 45 million is a substantial voting bloc
- Personal stories are compelling
- Growing political salience
- Cross-demographic appeal

**Weaknesses**:

- Diffuse interest (no concentrated benefit)
- Internal divisions (who deserves relief?)
- Competing priorities
- Limited financial resources for lobbying
- Political mobilization uneven

## Loan Servicers

### Federal Servicers

The Department of Education contracts with private companies to service federal student loans. Major servicers include:

**MOHELA (Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority)**:

- Largest federal servicer by portfolio
- Nonprofit state agency
- Controversial role in *Biden v. Nebraska* (gave Missouri standing)
- History of processing errors

**Nelnet**:

### Servicer Interests

Servicers profit from the current system through:

- Per-borrower payments from Department of Education
- Revenue tied to portfolio size (not borrower outcomes)
- Fees for certain services
- Related businesses (refinancing, collections)

Servicer opposition to reform stems from:

- Cancellation reduces portfolio and revenue
- Stronger oversight increases costs
- Accountability threatens business model
- PSLF success reduces serviced accounts

### Servicer Power

Servicers exercise influence through:

- Lobbying and campaign contributions
- Revolving door with Department of Education
- Control of borrower data and communications
- Legal challenges to regulations
- State-level political relationships (especially MOHELA)
