# Student Debt: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the student debt crisis requires action on multiple fronts: relief for existing borrowers, reform of the repayment system, prevention of future excessive debt, and addressing root causes. No single policy is sufficient; a comprehensive approach is necessary.

Solutions are organized into three categories:

1. **Relief**: Helping those currently burdened by debt
2. **Reform**: Fixing the systems that created the crisis
3. **Prevention**: Ensuring future students do not face the same burden

## Relief Policies

### 1. Targeted Debt Cancellation

**Policy**: Cancel specified amounts of student debt for defined categories of borrowers.

**Target Categories**:

| Category | Rationale | Estimated Borrowers |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Pell Grant recipients | Demonstrated need at enrollment | 27 million |
| Borrowers defrauded by for-profit schools | Victims of predatory practices | 2-3 million |
| Borrowers in default for 5+ years | System has failed them | 3-4 million |
| Total and Permanent Disability | Cannot reasonably repay | 400,000 |
| Borrowers over 65 | Debt into retirement unconscionable | 2.8 million |
| Low-balance borrowers (<$10,000) | Greatest bang for buck | 14.5 million |

**Amounts**:

- $10,000 across-the-board for eligible borrowers
- $20,000 for Pell recipients
- Full discharge for defrauded borrowers
- Full discharge for those in default 10+ years
- Full discharge for those over 65

**Legal Authority**: Higher Education Act Section 432(a) authorizes the Secretary to "compromise, waive, or release" federal student loan debts. This authority is clearer than the HEROES Act basis blocked in *Biden v. Nebraska*.

**Implementation**:

- Use existing data to identify eligible borrowers
- Automatic cancellation without application where possible
- Outreach for borrowers requiring documentation
- Tax treatment: Cancelled debt not treated as income (extend ARPA provision)

**Cost Estimate**: $200-400 billion depending on scope and targeting

### 2. Broad Cancellation

**Policy**: Cancel $50,000 or more per borrower, or all federal student debt.

**Proposals**:

- Warren-Schumer: $50,000 per borrower, phased out above $125,000 income
- Sanders: Full cancellation of all federal student debt (~$1.6 trillion)
- Biden (blocked): $10,000-$20,000 with income limits

**Arguments For**:

- Largest economic stimulus effect
- Simplest to administer
- Addresses racial wealth gap most directly
- Acknowledges systemic failure, not individual fault

**Arguments Against**:

- Regressive distributional effects (graduate debt concentration)
- High cost
- Moral hazard concerns
- Fairness to those who paid or did not attend

**Political Viability**: Difficult under current Congress and courts; requires either legislative action or new legal theory.

### 3. Income-Driven Repayment Reform (SAVE Plan and Beyond)

**Current SAVE Plan Features**:

- Payments: 5% of discretionary income for undergraduate loans (10% for graduate)
- Discretionary income: Income above 225% of poverty line
- Interest subsidy: Government covers unpaid interest, preventing balance growth
- Forgiveness: 10 years for balances under $12,000; 20 years for undergraduate; 25 years for graduate

**Needed Improvements**:

- Automatic enrollment for all borrowers
- Automatic recertification using IRS data
- Simplified single plan (eliminate legacy IDR plans)
- Tax-free forgiveness (permanent, not temporary provision)
- Credit for past payments made under other plans
- Clear rules for married borrowers

**Implementation Challenges**:

- Legal challenges currently blocking full SAVE implementation
- IT system limitations
- Servicer capacity
- IRS data sharing requires coordination

### 4. Public Service Loan Forgiveness Fix

**Current Problems**:

- Complex eligibility requirements
- Poor servicer implementation
- Lack of prospective verification
- No partial credit for partial service

**Reform Elements**:

- Count all payment types (not just specific IDR plans)
- Provide prospective certification of eligibility
- Partial forgiveness for partial service (50% at 5 years)
- Include part-time qualifying employment (prorated)
- Automatic tracking (no employment certification forms)
- Permanent, fully funded as entitlement

**Beneficiaries**: Teachers, nurses, social workers, public defenders, government employees, nonprofit workers

### 5. Bankruptcy Reform

**Policy**: Restore standard bankruptcy treatment for student loans.

**Options**:

- **Full restoration**: Treat student loans like other consumer debt
- **Time-limited exception**: Non-dischargeable for 7-10 years, then dischargeable
- **Partial discharge**: Allow discharge of amounts beyond some threshold
- **Presumptive discharge**: Shift burden to creditor to prove undue hardship

**Benefits**:

- Provides escape valve for those who truly cannot pay
- Creates market discipline for lenders
- Addresses private loans (which have no federal relief options)
- Reduces power imbalance between borrowers and collectors

**Political Viability**: Some bipartisan support; Senator Durbin has introduced multiple bills

### 6. Existing Program Fixes

**Borrower Defense to Repayment**:

- Expedite processing of claims
- Group discharge for schools with documented fraud
- Automatic discharge for students of schools losing accreditation or shutting down
- Recoupment from schools, not just taxpayers

**Total and Permanent Disability Discharge**:

- Automatic discharge using SSA data
- Eliminate income monitoring period
- Retroactive refunds for past payments

**Closed School Discharge**:

- Automatic discharge without application
- Extend eligibility window

## Reform Policies

### 7. Servicer Accountability

**Policy**: Establish meaningful accountability for loan servicers.

**Elements**:

- Performance-based compensation (tied to borrower outcomes, not portfolio size)
- Private right of action for borrowers harmed by servicer misconduct
- Mandatory licensing and bonding
- State attorney general enforcement authority
- CFPB supervision with adequate resources
- Penalties for misinformation and payment misapplication
- Public reporting of servicer performance metrics

**Implementation**: Combination of Department of Education contract requirements and congressional legislation

### 8. Interest Rate Reform

**Policy**: Reduce interest rates on federal student loans.

**Options**:

- Set rates at government cost of borrowing (10-year Treasury rate)
- Eliminate interest during school and grace periods
- Cap interest accumulation at original principal (no balance growth beyond what was borrowed)
- Zero interest for borrowers in IDR
- Retroactive interest refunds for certain borrowers

**Rationale**: Government should not profit from student loans; interest compounds hardship

### 9. Federal-State Partnership for Free College

**Policy**: Federal matching funds for states that eliminate tuition at public institutions.

**Structure**:

- Federal government matches 75% of tuition reduction
- States commit to maintenance of effort
- Applies to community colleges first, then four-year publics
- Includes support services funding

**Cost**: Estimated $80-100 billion annually for full implementation

**Benefits**: Prevents future debt; addresses root cause of crisis

### 10. Accountability for Institutions

**Policy**: Make institutions share risk of student outcomes.

**Elements**:

- Minimum outcome standards for Title IV eligibility (completion, earnings, repayment)
- Risk-sharing: institutions contribute to fund when borrowers default
- Risk-adjusted for student population served
- Heightened oversight for high-risk institutions
- Gainful employment rules for all programs

**Benefits**: Aligns institutional incentives with student success; reduces taxpayer exposure

### 11. For-Profit College Reform

**Policy**: Enhanced oversight and restrictions on for-profit institutions.

**Elements**:

- Strengthen 90/10 rule (cap federal revenue at 85%)
- Reinstate and strengthen gainful employment rules
- Prohibit deceptive recruiting practices
- Require transparent disclosure of outcomes
- Ban revenue-sharing with recruiters
- Increase minimum instructional spending ratios
- Strengthen accreditation oversight

**Rationale**: For-profit sector has documented pattern of poor outcomes and fraudulent practices

## Prevention Policies

### 12. Pell Grant Expansion

**Policy**: Increase Pell Grant maximum and index to inflation.

**Current Maximum**: $7,395 (2023-24)
**Proposed**: $14,000+ with automatic inflation adjustment

**Benefits**:

- Reduces borrowing for lowest-income students
- Shifts from loans to grants
- Addresses affordability without debt

**Cost**: Approximately $25 billion annually for doubling

### 13. State Reinvestment

**Policy**: Incentivize state reinvestment in public higher education.

**Mechanisms**:

- Federal matching funds for increased state appropriations
- Penalties for states that reduce funding
- Maintenance of effort requirements for federal programs

**Goal**: Reverse the shift of costs from taxpayers to students

### 14. Borrowing Limits and Counseling

**Policy**: Constrain excessive borrowing while maintaining access.

**Elements**:

- Lower annual and aggregate limits for undergraduate borrowing
- Limit Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS to reasonable amounts
- Enhanced entrance and exit counseling
- Required disclosure of expected debt and earnings by program
- Standardized financial aid offers

**Tension**: Limits may reduce access; must be paired with increased grants

### 15. Address Labor Market Issues

**Policy**: Improve earnings to make repayment possible.

**Related Policies**:

- Minimum wage increases
- Strengthen unions and worker bargaining power
- Address credential inflation
- Expand apprenticeships and non-degree pathways

**Connection**: Student debt cannot be repaid when wages are stagnant
