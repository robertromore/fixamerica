# Student Debt: Actions

## What Borrowers and Citizens Can Do

Addressing the student debt crisis requires action at multiple levels: individual borrowers protecting their interests, collective advocacy for policy change, and citizen engagement with the political process. This document provides concrete actions for different audiences.

## For Individual Borrowers

### Know Your Rights and Options

**Step 1: Understand Your Loans**

- Log into StudentAid.gov to see all federal loans
- Identify loan types (Direct, FFEL, Perkins, PLUS)
- Note servicer for each loan
- Review interest rates and balances
- Check repayment status

**Step 2: Explore Repayment Options**

| Plan | Best For | Key Features |
|------|----------|--------------|
| SAVE | Most borrowers | 5-10% discretionary income; interest subsidy; 10-20 year forgiveness |
| Standard (10-year) | High earners who can pay quickly | Fixed payments; no forgiveness |
| PSLF | Public service workers | Forgiveness after 10 years of service |
| Extended/Graduated | Those who need lower initial payments | Extended terms; no forgiveness |

**Step 3: Enroll in the Right Plan**

- Use the Loan Simulator at StudentAid.gov to compare options
- For federal loans, income-driven repayment is almost always better than forbearance
- Recertify income annually (or set up automatic recertification)
- Keep records of all payments and communications

### Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)

**Am I Eligible?**

- Work for government (federal, state, local, tribal) or 501(c)(3) nonprofit
- Work full-time (30+ hours/week)
- Have Direct Loans (or consolidate FFEL/Perkins to Direct)
- Be on a qualifying repayment plan
- Make 120 qualifying payments

**Action Steps**:

1. Use the PSLF Help Tool at StudentAid.gov to check employer eligibility
2. Consolidate any FFEL or Perkins loans to Direct Loans
3. Enroll in SAVE or another qualifying IDR plan
4. Submit Employment Certification Form (ECF) annually
5. Track your qualifying payment count
6. Keep copies of all employment and payment records

**If Previously Denied**:

- Check if Limited PSLF Waiver provisions still apply
- Verify all payments were properly counted
- Appeal if there are errors
- Contact the PSLF Ombudsman

### Dealing with Servicer Problems

**Document Everything**:

- Keep records of all calls (date, time, representative name, what was said)
- Save all written communications
- Confirm important information in writing after phone calls
- Request written confirmation of enrollment in repayment plans

**Escalate Issues**:

1. **Servicer Complaint**: File formal complaint with servicer
2. **CFPB Complaint**: Submit at consumerfinance.gov/complaint
3. **FSA Ombudsman**: Contact at studentaid.gov/feedback-ombudsman
4. **State Attorney General**: File consumer complaint with your state AG
5. **Legal Aid**: Contact local legal aid for assistance with serious issues

### If You Are in Default

**Fresh Start Program**:

- Available through September 2025
- Removes loans from default status
- Restores eligibility for federal aid and IDR
- Removes negative marks from credit report
- No collection fees added

**Action Steps**:

1. Contact your loan holder or collection agency
2. Request Fresh Start
3. Enroll in income-driven repayment after rehabilitation
4. Consider consolidation if you have multiple loans

### If You Were Defrauded

**Borrower Defense to Repayment**:

- Available if your school misled you about job placement, program costs, or other material facts
- Available if school engaged in other misconduct

**Action Steps**:

1. Submit application at studentaid.gov/borrower-defense
2. Describe specifically how you were misled
3. Provide supporting documentation if available
4. Contact an advocacy organization for assistance

### Bankruptcy Consideration

While difficult, bankruptcy discharge is not impossible:

**When to Consider**:

- Debts are decades old
- No prospect of repayment
- Serious health or disability issues
- Private loans with no other options

**Action Steps**:

1. Consult with a bankruptcy attorney experienced in student loans
2. Document all circumstances demonstrating undue hardship
3. Consider adversary proceeding to discharge student loans
4. In some courts, partial discharge may be available

### Protect Yourself from Scams

**Red Flags**:

- Upfront fees for "forgiveness assistance"
- Pressure to act immediately
- Requests for FSA login credentials
- Promises of immediate debt elimination
- Unsolicited calls offering "special programs"

**Remember**: All federal programs are free. Never pay for help with federal student loans.
