# Student Debt: Root Causes

## Why Debt Exploded

The student debt crisis did not emerge from any single cause but from the interaction of multiple policy failures, economic shifts, and institutional behaviors. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective solutions.

The core dynamic: governments shifted the cost of higher education from taxpayers to students, while simultaneously expanding loan access and removing the market signals that might have constrained prices. The result was predictable: tuition rose, borrowing rose, and students were left holding debt that often exceeded any economic benefit from their education.

## Primary Drivers

### 1. State Disinvestment in Higher Education

The most significant driver of rising student debt is the decline in state funding for public higher education. States have systematically shifted the cost of public college from taxpayers to students.

**The Numbers**:

- In 1980, state appropriations covered approximately 75% of public college costs
- By 2020, state appropriations covered approximately 40% of costs
- Per-student state funding declined 13% in real terms between 2008-2018
- After the 2008 recession, states cut $9 billion from higher education
- Funding never fully recovered before COVID-19 brought new cuts

**Why States Cut**:

- Medicaid and K-12 education crowd out higher education in state budgets
- Higher education is politically easier to cut than prisons or healthcare
- Tuition can be raised to replace lost state revenue (students have less political power)
- Anti-tax sentiment constrains overall state revenue
- Some conservative policymakers actively prefer privatization

**The Tuition Response**:

- Every $1 cut in state funding corresponds to roughly $0.80 in tuition increases
- Public four-year tuition rose 213% in real terms from 1988-2020
- Public universities became increasingly reliant on tuition revenue
- Low-income students bore disproportionate burden as grants failed to keep pace

### 2. The Federal Loan Availability Effect

Federal student loans operate as a demand-side subsidy without supply-side cost controls. This creates the "Bennett Hypothesis" dynamic:

**The Mechanism**:

1. Federal policy makes loans available up to cost of attendance
2. Institutions capture additional borrowing capacity through tuition increases
3. Higher tuition is paid with larger loans
4. Students bear the cost; institutions capture the benefit

**Evidence**:

- Studies find that each $1 increase in federal loan limits leads to $0.50-0.65 in tuition increases at some institutions
- The effect is strongest at for-profit and less-selective institutions
- Graduate PLUS loans (with no borrowing cap) correlate with sharply rising professional school tuition

**Why This Persists**:

- Institutions have strong incentive to capture available revenue
- Competition for faculty, facilities, and prestige requires spending
- Accreditation provides access to federal funds regardless of price
- Students (especially first-generation) lack information to resist price increases
- The cost is diffuse and deferred; the benefit to institutions is immediate

### 3. Labor Market Polarization

Changes in the American labor market have made higher education seem essential while simultaneously reducing its value for many graduates.

**The College Premium Illusion**:

- The "college wage premium" reflects as much the collapse of non-college wages as the value of degrees
- Real wages for non-college workers declined 9% since 1980
- The alternative to college has gotten worse, making college seem necessary regardless of debt
- This creates pressure to attend even when the return is uncertain

**Underemployment**:

- 41% of recent college graduates are underemployed (working jobs not requiring degrees)
- Credential inflation means jobs once accessible without degrees now require them
- Supply of graduates exceeds demand for college-level work in many fields
- Underemployed graduates still carry debt

**Field Variation**:

- STEM and professional degrees often justify debt through earnings
- Humanities and social science graduates earn less yet carry similar debt
- Information asymmetry prevents students from accurately forecasting returns
- "Follow your passion" messaging ignores economic realities

### 4. The Elimination of Bankruptcy Protection

The 1976 restrictions on student loan bankruptcy, extended in 1998 and 2005, fundamentally altered the relationship between students, lenders, and educational institutions.

**Effects of Non-Dischargeability**:

- Lenders face no risk from lending to students unlikely to succeed
- Borrowers have no escape valve regardless of circumstances
- Debt persists through disability, illness, unemployment, and failure
- Power imbalance enables abusive practices

**Why It Matters for Root Causes**:

- Without bankruptcy risk, lenders approve loans without assessing ability to repay
- Institutions have no stake in student success (debt cannot be discharged to them)
- Students bear all risk; institutions and lenders bear none
- This moral hazard enables the entire dysfunction

### 5. The For-Profit College Business Model

For-profit institutions exemplify the student debt crisis's worst dynamics. Their business model depends on federal student aid while delivering poor outcomes.

**The Model**:

- Recruit aggressively, often targeting vulnerable populations
- Maximize federal aid capture (up to 90% of revenue from federal sources)
- Minimize educational spending (as low as 20% of revenue)
- Maximize profit extraction (executive compensation, marketing, real estate)
- Avoid accountability through lobbying and political influence

**The Outcomes**:

- For-profits enroll 10% of students but account for 50% of loan defaults
- Graduation rates far below other sectors
- Graduates earn less than community college graduates
- Massive fraud documented at ITT Tech, Corinthian, DeVry, and others

**Why They Persist**:

- Powerful lobbying operations
- Campaign contributions to both parties
- Revolving door with Department of Education
- Well-funded legal challenges to oversight
- Accreditation system fails to enforce quality

### 6. Income-Driven Repayment Failures

Income-driven repayment was meant to provide a safety valve but instead became a trap for many borrowers.

**Design Flaws**:

- Payments often do not cover interest, leading to balance growth (negative amortization)
- Annual recertification is burdensome; failure leads to capitalization
- Multiple plans with different terms confuse borrowers and servicers
- Forgiveness after 20-25 years creates "tax bomb" for cancelled debt

**Implementation Failures**:

- Servicers failed to track qualifying payments
- Servicers steered borrowers away from IDR to forbearance
- IT systems could not handle complexity
- No accountability for servicer errors

**Result**:

- Borrowers paying for decades owe more than they started with
- Fewer than 100 borrowers received IDR forgiveness through 2023 (despite 30 years of operation)
- IDR became a mechanism of debt accumulation rather than relief

### 7. Servicer Incentives and Misconduct

Federal loan servicers are paid based on portfolio size, not borrower outcomes. This creates systematic incentives for misconduct.

**Perverse Incentives**:

- Servicers profit from larger balances
- Processing forbearance is cheaper than processing IDR
- Forgiveness reduces serviced balances (and revenue)
- Accuracy costs money; errors are rarely penalized

**Documented Misconduct**:

- Misapplying payments to maximize interest
- Providing incorrect information about repayment options
- Failing to process PSLF and IDR applications
- Losing records during servicer transitions
- Steering borrowers away from beneficial programs

**Why Accountability Failed**:

- Department of Education contracts provided weak performance standards
- Servicers faced no consequences for most errors
- CFPB enforcement constrained by political opposition
- Industry lobbying blocked stronger oversight

### 8. The PSLF Implementation Failure

Public Service Loan Forgiveness was designed to encourage public service by forgiving debt after 10 years. Its near-total failure reveals systemic dysfunction.

**What Went Wrong**:

- Only certain loan types qualified (FFEL loans did not)
- Only certain repayment plans qualified (not all IDR plans)
- Servicers gave incorrect information about eligibility
- Employment certification forms were confusing and poorly processed
- When borrowers reached 10 years, 98% were rejected

**Root Causes**:

- Program designed by lawyers unfamiliar with loan system complexity
- No prospective eligibility verification
- Servicers had no incentive to provide accurate information
- Department of Education failed to monitor or enforce

**Consequences**:

- Public servants who relied on the promise were betrayed
- Trust in federal programs diminished
- Massive temporary waiver needed to partially address (2021-2022)

### 9. Information Asymmetry

Students making borrowing decisions lack information available to institutions and lenders.

**What Students Don't Know**:

- Expected earnings by program and institution
- Graduation and completion rates by program
- Default rates by program
- Total cost including interest
- Comparison to peers

**Why Information Is Hidden**:

- Institutions resist disclosure of unfavorable data
- Program-level data only recently required
- Standardized financial aid offers not mandated
- "Financial aid" terminology obscures loans as debt

**Consequences**:

- Students cannot make informed choices
- Price signals do not function
- Poor programs continue enrolling students
- Debt is incurred without understanding

### 10. Racial Wealth Gap Transmission

Student debt does not create racial inequality but amplifies pre-existing wealth gaps through intergenerational mechanisms.

**How It Works**:

- Black families have less wealth to contribute to education costs
- Black students borrow more and more often
- Labor market discrimination reduces earnings for repayment
- Black families less able to help with repayment
- Default rates higher; wealth building further impaired

**Compounding Effects**:

- Black borrowers owe more 4 years after graduation than at graduation
- White borrowers have paid down significant portions
- The gap widens over time
- Intergenerational wealth transfer operates in reverse

**Institutional Factors**:

- HBCUs have less endowment wealth for student aid
- For-profit targeting of Black students
- Discrimination in employment affects repayment capacity
- Default consequences more severe in context of limited wealth

## Secondary Factors

### Rising Cost of Attendance

Beyond tuition, other costs have increased:

- Room and board increased faster than inflation
- Books and supplies costs rose (though now declining with digital)
- Transportation costs for commuting students
- Childcare for student parents

These non-tuition costs are often covered by loans, increasing total debt.

### Credential Inflation

Jobs that once required high school now require bachelor's degrees; jobs that required bachelor's degrees now require master's degrees. This inflation:

- Extends time in education and borrowing
- Reduces relative value of each credential
- Forces borrowing for diminishing returns

### Extended Time to Degree

Students taking longer to complete degrees borrow more:

- Only 41% of students complete bachelor's degrees in 4 years
- Average time to bachelor's is 5.1 years
- Each additional year adds borrowing
- Part-time attendance (often due to work) extends timeline

### Parent PLUS and Graduate PLUS

Unlimited borrowing for parents and graduate students:

- Parent PLUS has no aggregate limit
- Graduate PLUS limited only by cost of attendance
- No underwriting based on ability to repay
- Parents with modest incomes taking massive debt
- Graduate students accumulating six-figure balances
