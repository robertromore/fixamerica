## Federal Legislation

### Student Debt Cancellation Act

**Purpose**: Provide targeted cancellation of federal student loan debt for borrowers who have been failed by the system, with particular focus on those in greatest need.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Student Debt Cancellation Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Outstanding student loan debt exceeds $1.77 trillion, burdening
    45 million Americans and constraining economic growth.
(2) Student debt disproportionately burdens Black borrowers, who hold
    $25,000 more debt on average than white borrowers four years after
    graduation, perpetuating the racial wealth gap.
(3) The student loan system has systematically failed borrowers through
    servicer misconduct, PSLF rejection, and inadequate income-driven
    repayment implementation.
(4) Borrowers who received Pell Grants demonstrated financial need at
    enrollment and merit targeted relief.
(5) Borrowers who have been in repayment for 20 or more years have paid
    their fair share and deserve forgiveness.
(6) The economic benefits of debt relief, including increased homeownership,
    entrepreneurship, and consumer spending, outweigh the fiscal cost.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN.—The term "federal student loan" means—
    (A) a loan made under part D of title IV of the Higher Education
        Act of 1965 (Direct Loans);
    (B) a loan made under part B of title IV of such Act (FFEL Loans)
        that is held by the Secretary;

    outstanding balance of principal and interest on federal student
    loans for borrowers who did not receive a Federal Pell Grant and

    $250,000 (married filing jointly).

(c) LONG-TERM REPAYMENT.—The Secretary shall cancel the entire

SEC. 5. IMPLEMENTATION.

    Secretary shall use existing data, including tax return information
    and loan records, to provide cancellation automatically without
    requiring borrower applications.

    (1) 90 days for automatic cancellation categories; and
    (2) 180 days for categories requiring documentation.

### Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act

**Purpose**: Restore standard bankruptcy treatment for student loans, providing an escape valve for borrowers who truly cannot pay.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Student Loan Bankruptcy Fairness Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Prior to 1976, student loans were dischargeable in bankruptcy like
    other consumer debts.
(2) The "undue hardship" standard, as interpreted through the judicially
    created Brunner test, has prevented discharge for borrowers with
    disabilities, terminal illnesses, and manifestly unpayable debts.
(3) There is no evidence that student loan borrowers abuse bankruptcy
    at higher rates than other borrowers.
(4) The elimination of bankruptcy protection has contributed to reckless
    lending and removed market discipline from the student loan system.
(5) Private student loans should not enjoy greater protection from
    bankruptcy than federal loans, particularly given the absence of
    income-driven repayment and forgiveness options.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO BANKRUPTCY CODE.

(a) FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS.—Section 523(a)(8) of title 11, United States
    Code, is amended to read as follows:

    "(8) unless excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph
    would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor's
    dependents, for—
        (A) an educational benefit overpayment or loan made, insured, or
            guaranteed by a governmental unit, or made under any program
            funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit
            institution, if such loan first became due more than 7 years
            before the date of the filing of the petition; or
        (B) an obligation to repay funds received as an educational
            benefit, scholarship, or stipend;".

(b) PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS.—Section 523(a)(8) of title 11, United States
    Code, is amended by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the
    following:

    "(B) any other educational loan that is a qualified education loan,
        as defined in section 221(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of
        1986, if such loan first became due more than 7 years before the
        date of the filing of the petition;".

(c) UNDUE HARDSHIP STANDARD.—For purposes of section 523(a)(8), a court
    shall find "undue hardship" exists unless the debtor demonstrates
    that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the debtor can
    maintain a minimal standard of living for the debtor and dependents
    while repaying the debt. The court shall consider:
    (1) The debtor's current and reasonably foreseeable income;
    (2) The debtor's current and reasonably foreseeable expenses;
    (3) The debtor's good-faith efforts to repay or negotiate repayment;
    (4) The debtor's age, health, and family circumstances; and
    (5) Any other relevant factors.

SEC. 4. REVERSAL OF BRUNNER TEST.

(a) CONGRESSIONAL INTENT.—It is the intent of Congress that the Brunner
    test, established in Brunner v. New York State Higher Education
    Services Corp., 831 F.2d 395 (2d Cir. 1987), shall not apply to
    the determination of undue hardship under section 523(a)(8).

(b) TOTALITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES.—Courts shall apply a totality of the
    circumstances test that does not require certainty of future
    circumstances and that recognizes the inherent uncertainty of
    long-term financial forecasts.

SEC. 5. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

(a) A borrower who is denied discharge under section 523(a)(8) despite
    meeting the undue hardship standard may bring a civil action.

(b) In such action, the borrower may recover—
    (1) declaratory and injunctive relief;
    (2) actual damages;
    (3) reasonable attorney's fees and costs.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall apply to—
(a) any case commenced under title 11 on or after the date of enactment;
(b) any case pending on the date of enactment, at the election of the
    debtor.
```

- Section 3: 7-year waiting period before discharge (compromise position)
- Section 3(c): Replaces Brunner test with totality of circumstances
- Section 4: Explicitly rejects prior judicial interpretation
- Section 5: Private enforcement mechanism

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**Spending Power**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Cancellation | Clear spending power authority; government can decline to collect its own debts |
| Forgiveness programs | Conditional spending well-established |
| Tax treatment | Tax power; exclusion from income |

**Commerce Clause**

| Legislation | Authority |
|-------------|-----------|
| Servicer regulation | Interstate commerce in loan servicing |
| Bankruptcy reform | Explicit constitutional authority (Art. I, Sec. 8) |
| Private lender requirements | Interstate consumer credit |

### *Biden v. Nebraska* Considerations

The Supreme Court's 2023 decision affects legislative and executive strategy:

**What Was Blocked**: Broad cancellation under HEROES Act "waive or modify" authority

**What Remains Available**:

- Cancellation under Higher Education Act Sec. 432(a) "compromise" authority
- Targeted relief for specific categories (fraud, PSLF, IDR)
- Congressional legislation

**Legislative Approach**: Explicit congressional authorization addresses major questions concerns

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Law | Primary Enforcement | Private Action |
|-----|---------------------|----------------|
| Cancellation Act | Dept. of Education | No |
| Bankruptcy Act | Bankruptcy courts | Yes |
| IDR Act | Dept. of Education | Limited |
| PSLF Act | Dept. of Education | Yes (servicer liability) |
| Servicer Act | CFPB, States | Yes |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Student Debt Cancellation Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Income timing | Use prior year income to qualify | Medium |
| Marriage status | File separately to meet individual threshold | Medium |
| Private loans excluded | No relief for private borrowers | High |
| Future borrowers | Creates expectation of future forgiveness | Medium |
| FFEL held by banks | Some FFEL loans not covered if not held by ED | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| One-time relief only | Doesn't address future borrowers | Political feasibility |
| Doesn't address causes | Tuition continues rising | Scope limitation |
| Constitutional challenge | May be blocked by courts | Separation of powers |
| Tax complications | State taxation may apply | Federal-state disconnect |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Income timing**: Use 2-year average; require recertification for significant income changes
2. **Marriage manipulation**: Combined household income regardless of filing status for eligibility
3. **Private loans**: Separate bankruptcy reform; incentivize refinancing to federal
4. **Future borrowers**: Pair with free college to eliminate future need
5. **FFEL**: Automatic consolidation pathway; ED purchase of remaining bank-held FFEL
6. **Constitutional issues**: Clear statutory authority through legislation; detailed congressional findings

### Bankruptcy Reform

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Strategic timing | Wait 7 years then file | Medium |
| Income manipulation | Reduce income before filing | Low |
| Asset sheltering | Protect assets before filing | Medium |
| Forum shopping | File in favorable districts | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 7-year waiting period | Delayed relief | Compromise |
| Doesn't help private loan holders immediately | Gap in coverage | Political viability |
| May reduce credit access | Lenders tighten underwriting | Market response |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strategic timing**: Waiting period is acceptable compromise; alternative is no reform
2. **Income manipulation**: Look-back period in bankruptcy law already addresses
3. **Asset sheltering**: Existing fraudulent transfer rules apply
4. **Forum shopping**: Uniform standard in statute reduces variation
5. **Waiting period**: Consider shorter period (5 years) in future amendments
6. **Private loans**: Apply same treatment; lenders can price risk appropriately
7. **Credit access**: Pair with free college to reduce borrowing need

### Servicer Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Subsidiary structures | Create new entities to avoid penalties | Medium |
| Arbitration clauses | Pre-existing contracts may include | Medium |
| State law variation | Patchwork of requirements | Medium |
| Small servicer exemption | May create carve-outs | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Enforcement resources | CFPB capacity limits | Budget |
| Borrower awareness | Must know rights to exercise | Information asymmetry |
| Industry adaptation | New evasion techniques | Cat-and-mouse dynamic |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Subsidiaries**: Attribution rules treating related entities as single servicer
2. **Arbitration**: Explicit prohibition; preempt state contract law
3. **State variation**: Federal floor with state enforcement; model state legislation
4. **Small servicers**: No exemptions; apply proportionately
5. **Enforcement**: Mandatory CFPB funding; private attorney general provisions
6. **Awareness**: Required disclosures; ombudsman outreach
7. **Adaptation**: Anti-evasion authority; annual regulatory review

### General Implementation Concerns

| Vulnerability | Affects | Mitigation |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Political reversal | All reforms | Statutory protections; build public support |
| Industry litigation | All provisions | Careful legal drafting; litigation defense |
| Agency capacity | Implementation | IT modernization; staffing increases |
