# Student Debt: Current State

## The Problem Today

America's student debt crisis has reached unprecedented proportions. As of 2024, 45 million Americans carry $1.77 trillion in student loan debt, making student loans the second-largest category of consumer debt after mortgages. This debt burden constrains economic mobility for an entire generation and increasingly affects older Americans as well.

The crisis is not simply about the total amount owed but about the system's dysfunction at every level. Borrowers struggle to navigate byzantine repayment options. Loan servicers provide inaccurate information and misapply payments. Forgiveness programs promised to public servants have failed to deliver. Millions of borrowers have paid for years or decades yet owe more than they originally borrowed due to interest capitalization. The system designed to facilitate educational opportunity has become a mechanism of financial extraction.

### The Debt Load

The average federal student loan borrower owes approximately $37,850, though this figure obscures significant variation. The median borrower owes less (approximately $20,000), while high-balance borrowers, particularly those with graduate and professional school debt, owe $100,000 or more. The top 10% of borrowers hold approximately 40% of total debt.

Graduate and professional school debt constitutes 56% of all student debt, despite graduate students representing a smaller share of borrowers. Law school graduates carry an average of $130,000 in debt; medical school graduates average $200,000. This concentration creates policy tensions: targeted cancellation benefits those with lower balances, while broad cancellation disproportionately benefits higher-earning professionals.

### The Federal-Private Split

Federal student loans comprise 92% of all student debt ($1.63 trillion), with private loans accounting for the remaining 8% ($140 billion). This distinction matters enormously for policy:

- **Federal loans** offer income-driven repayment, forgiveness programs, and (theoretically) borrower protections
- **Private loans** offer none of these, with terms set by lenders and no path to relief short of bankruptcy (which rarely succeeds)

Private loans are more prevalent among students who exhausted federal borrowing capacity, attended expensive private institutions, or were steered away from federal loans by for-profit schools seeking to maintain federal eligibility ratios.

| Default rate (private nonprofit) | 4.8% |

## Borrower Demographics

### By Age

Student debt is no longer confined to young adults. While borrowers under 35 hold the largest share by number, older borrowers carry substantial and growing debt:

| Age Group | Borrowers | Total Debt | Average Debt |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Under 25 | 8.1 million | $112 billion | $13,800 |
| 25-34 | 14.2 million | $500 billion | $35,200 |
| 35-49 | 12.8 million | $620 billion | $48,400 |
| 50-61 | 6.2 million | $360 billion | $58,100 |
| 62+ | 3.8 million | $120 billion | $31,600 |

Borrowers over 50 are the fastest-growing demographic. Many carry debt from their own education, while others borrowed Parent PLUS loans for children's education. Some have Social Security benefits garnished for defaulted student loans.

### By Race and Ethnicity

Student debt both reflects and exacerbates racial economic inequality:

| Group | Share of Borrowers | Share of Debt | Average Debt | Median Debt |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| White | 53% | 52% | $36,000 | $18,500 |
| Black | 20% | 25% | $45,000 | $28,000 |
| Hispanic | 18% | 15% | $30,000 | $15,500 |
| Asian | 5% | 5% | $36,500 | $19,000 |
| Other/Unknown | 4% | 3% | $28,000 | $14,000 |

Black borrowers face distinct challenges:

- **Higher initial borrowing**: Less family wealth means more loans to cover costs
- **Slower repayment**: Labor market discrimination affects earnings and repayment capacity
- **Graduate debt**: Black borrowers disproportionately pursue graduate degrees seeking to overcome discrimination, accumulating more debt
- **Four years after graduation**: Black borrowers owe 6% more than they borrowed originally, while white borrowers have paid down 10%
- **Default rates**: Black borrowers default at nearly twice the rate of white borrowers

### By Gender

Women hold approximately 66% of all student debt (over $1.15 trillion), driven by:

- Higher enrollment rates in higher education
- Concentration in lower-paying fields
- Higher rates of graduate school enrollment
- Gender pay gap reducing repayment capacity
- Greater likelihood of attending for-profit institutions

### By Institution Type

| Institution Type | Share of Borrowers | Share of Defaults |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Public 4-year | 33% | 20% |
| Public 2-year | 15% | 12% |
| Private nonprofit 4-year | 21% | 15% |
| For-profit | 13% | 33% |
| Graduate/Professional | 18% | 20% |

For-profit institutions enroll 13% of borrowers but account for 33% of defaults, reflecting their reliance on federal loans, high prices, poor outcomes, and predatory practices.

## Impact on Borrowers

### Financial Impact

**Wealth Accumulation**: The median net worth of households with student debt is approximately $30,000 less than comparable households without debt. The effect is particularly pronounced for Black households, where student debt reduces already-limited wealth.

**Homeownership**: Student debt delays homeownership by an estimated 2-4 years. Each $10,000 in student debt reduces homeownership probability by 1-2 percentage points. Millennial homeownership rates lag previous generations partly due to student debt.

**Retirement Savings**: Borrowers allocate resources to debt repayment rather than retirement savings. One study found that each dollar of student debt reduces retirement savings by 35 cents. Borrowers in their 50s and 60s carrying student debt have 40% less retirement savings than peers without student debt.

**Credit Access**: Student debt affects credit scores and debt-to-income ratios, limiting access to mortgages, auto loans, and business credit. Default devastates credit scores, with effects lasting seven years.

### Life Decisions

Survey data reveal how student debt shapes major life choices:

| Decision | Share Delayed Due to Debt |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Saving for retirement | 73% |
| Buying a home | 61% |
| Paying other bills | 52% |
| Making major purchases | 45% |
| Marriage | 21% |
| Having children | 26% |
| Changing careers | 35% |
| Starting a business | 29% |

### Mental Health and Well-Being

Student debt correlates with:

- Higher rates of anxiety and depression
- Lower life satisfaction
- Delayed sense of adulthood
- Relationship stress
- Physical health problems (stress-related)

Borrowers describe feeling "trapped," "hopeless," and "betrayed by the system." Many report that debt is their primary source of stress, exceeding concerns about health, family, or work.

## Recent Developments

### The COVID-19 Payment Pause (2020-2024)

In March 2020, the CARES Act suspended federal student loan payments and interest accrual. This pause was extended multiple times, lasting over three years and representing the longest period of relief borrowers had experienced. The pause:

- Provided $5 billion per month in relief to borrowers
- Demonstrated that mass payment suspension did not cause economic harm
- Revealed the system's dysfunction when payments resumed
- Set expectations for more significant reform

### Biden Administration Actions

The Biden administration has pursued multiple approaches to student debt relief:

**Broad Cancellation Attempt**: In August 2022, the administration announced up to $20,000 in cancellation for Pell Grant recipients and $10,000 for other borrowers with income below $125,000. In June 2023, the Supreme Court blocked this action in *Biden v. Nebraska*, holding that the HEROES Act did not authorize broad cancellation.

**SAVE Plan**: The administration created a new income-driven repayment plan (SAVE) with more favorable terms:

- Payments capped at 5% of discretionary income for undergraduate loans
- Discretionary income threshold raised to 225% of poverty
- Forgiveness after 10 years for balances under $12,000
- No interest accrual beyond payment amount (effective 0% interest for those making payments)

As of early 2025, SAVE enrollment exceeds 8 million borrowers, making it the most popular IDR plan. However, legal challenges have blocked full implementation.

**Targeted Relief**: The administration has discharged over $140 billion for approximately 4 million borrowers through:

- Public Service Loan Forgiveness (expanded through temporary waiver)
- Borrower Defense to Repayment (ITT Tech, Corinthian Colleges)
- Income-driven repayment forgiveness (for those reaching 20/25-year mark)
- Total and Permanent Disability discharge
- Closed school discharge

### Supreme Court Decisions

*Biden v. Nebraska* (2023) blocked broad executive cancellation, holding that:

- The HEROES Act's "waive or modify" language did not authorize complete debt elimination
- The major questions doctrine required clear congressional authorization
- States had standing through their connections to loan servicers

The decision left open other potential authority but significantly constrained executive action.

### State-Level Actions

Several states have enacted borrower protections:

- **California, New York, Illinois**: Student loan servicer licensing and standards
- **Multiple states**: Prohibition on professional license denial for student debt default
- **State attorneys general**: Enforcement actions against servicers and for-profit schools

## Systemic Failures

### Servicer Misconduct

Federal loan servicers have systematically failed borrowers:

- **Misinformation**: Providing incorrect information about repayment options and forgiveness
- **Payment misapplication**: Applying payments incorrectly, leading to increased balances
- **PSLF failures**: Giving borrowers inaccurate information leading to rejection
- **IDR denial**: Improperly denying income-driven repayment applications
- **Transfer chaos**: Losing records and payment histories during servicer transitions

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has documented thousands of complaints against servicers. State attorneys general have secured settlements in the hundreds of millions of dollars for servicer misconduct.

### Public Service Loan Forgiveness Collapse

PSLF promised forgiveness after 10 years of public service. Through 2021, the program rejected 98% of applicants due to:

- Wrong repayment plan (only certain plans qualified)
- Wrong loan type (FFEL loans did not qualify without consolidation)
- Employment certification failures
- Servicer errors and misinformation

A temporary waiver (2021-2022) allowed credit for previously ineligible payments, resulting in $56 billion in forgiveness for over 750,000 borrowers. This demonstrated both that the original program was poorly designed and that reform could work.

### Income-Driven Repayment Failures

IDR plans promise affordable payments and eventual forgiveness but have failed in practice:

- **Negative amortization**: Low payments that do not cover interest lead to balance growth
- **Recertification failures**: Missed annual recertification leads to capitalized interest and payment spikes
- **Tracking failures**: Servicers failed to track qualifying payments, denying forgiveness
- **Complexity**: Multiple plans with different terms confuse borrowers and servicers

As of 2024, fewer than 100 borrowers had received IDR forgiveness through the normal 20/25-year track, despite millions enrolled and the program existing since 1994.

### Bankruptcy Non-Dischargeability

Since 1976 for federal loans and 2005 for private loans, student loans have been extremely difficult to discharge in bankruptcy. The "undue hardship" standard, interpreted through the stringent Brunner test, has resulted in:

- Discharge denial for borrowers with cancer, disability, and total inability to pay
- Attorneys advising borrowers not to try
- A two-tier debt system where student loans are harder to discharge than credit cards, medical bills, or even some criminal fines
