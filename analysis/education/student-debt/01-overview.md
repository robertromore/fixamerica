# Student Debt: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's student debt crisis represents one of the most significant financial burdens affecting working-age Americans. With $1.77 trillion in outstanding student loan debt held by 45 million borrowers, student loans have become the second-largest category of consumer debt after mortgages. This debt load constrains economic mobility, delays major life milestones, widens racial wealth gaps, and creates cascading effects throughout the economy.

The crisis emerged from a confluence of policy failures: declining state investment in public higher education, rising tuition, expanding federal loan access without corresponding cost controls, the elimination of bankruptcy protections, and a complex repayment system that has left millions in distress. Despite promises of opportunity through education, many borrowers find themselves worse off financially than if they had never attended college.

Student debt disproportionately burdens Black borrowers, first-generation students, and those who attended for-profit institutions. The average Black borrower owes $25,000 more than white borrowers four years after graduation, driven by both higher initial borrowing and the racial wealth gap that prevents family assistance with repayment. Women hold nearly two-thirds of all student debt. Low-income students who borrowed for degrees at predatory for-profit schools often find their credentials worthless and their debts unpayable.

The system designed to collect these debts has proven equally problematic. Loan servicers have systematically failed borrowers through misinformation, improper payment application, and steering away from beneficial programs. Public Service Loan Forgiveness, promised to those who serve their communities, rejected 98% of initial applicants. Income-driven repayment plans, meant to provide affordable payments, have become a labyrinth of confusion leading to negative amortization and decades of debt.

Reform requires action across multiple dimensions: relief for existing borrowers through targeted cancellation and improved repayment options, systemic reforms to servicer accountability and bankruptcy rights, and preventive measures including reinvestment in public higher education to reduce future borrowing. This analysis examines the crisis from multiple angles and proposes evidence-based solutions.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Federal student loan programs**: Direct Loans, PLUS Loans, consolidated FFEL loans, and Perkins Loans
- **Private student loans**: Bank and credit union loans for education
- **Repayment systems**: Income-driven repayment, standard plans, forgiveness programs
- **Servicer operations**: The companies that manage loan repayment
- **Guaranty agencies**: Organizations that administered the former FFEL program
- **Debt relief mechanisms**: Cancellation, forgiveness, discharge, and bankruptcy
- **Downstream effects**: Impact on homeownership, family formation, wealth building, retirement

This analysis does not cover:

- General higher education policy (see [Higher Education](../higher-education/01-overview.md))
- K-12 education financing
- Employer education benefits (except as relates to loan repayment)
- International student loan systems (except as comparators)

## Key Questions

This analysis addresses the following questions:

1. **How did student debt reach $1.77 trillion?** What policy decisions and economic forces created this crisis?

2. **Who bears the burden?** How is student debt distributed across demographic groups, and why do some groups suffer disproportionately?

3. **Why is repayment so difficult?** What failures in the repayment system trap borrowers in debt despite payments?

4. **What role do servicers play?** How have student loan servicers contributed to borrower distress?

5. **Why doesn't bankruptcy work?** How did student loans become nearly non-dischargeable, and what are the consequences?

6. **What are the economic effects?** How does student debt affect homeownership, entrepreneurship, family formation, and retirement savings?

7. **What relief is possible?** What legal authority exists for debt cancellation, and what are the constraints?

8. **What systemic reforms are needed?** Beyond relief, what changes would prevent future crises?

9. **Who opposes reform?** What interests benefit from the current system, and how do they influence policy?

10. **What can borrowers and advocates do?** What actions are available to address this crisis at individual and collective levels?

## Why This Matters

Student debt affects virtually every aspect of affected Americans' lives:

**Economic Mobility**: Debt payments divert income from savings, investment, and consumption, slowing wealth accumulation and economic growth.

**Homeownership**: Each $1,000 in student debt reduces homeownership rates by 1-2 percentage points. Student debt has been identified as a major factor in declining millennial homeownership.

**Family Formation**: Borrowers delay marriage and childbearing due to financial stress. Survey data show 21% of borrowers have delayed marriage and 26% have delayed having children.

**Career Choices**: Debt influences career decisions, pushing graduates away from lower-paying public service work and toward higher-paying but potentially less fulfilling corporate positions.

**Retirement Security**: Older borrowers carry student debt into their 60s and beyond, with some having Social Security benefits garnished for defaulted loans.

**Racial Wealth Gap**: Student debt exacerbates racial economic inequality, as Black borrowers accumulate more debt and have fewer family resources to assist with repayment.

**Mental Health**: The stress of student debt is associated with depression, anxiety, and reduced life satisfaction.

**Democratic Participation**: Financial stress and distrust of institutions may affect civic engagement and trust in government.
