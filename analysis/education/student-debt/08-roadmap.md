# Student Debt: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to addressing the student debt crisis, sequencing reforms based on legal authority, political viability, and implementation capacity. The strategy prioritizes immediate relief through executive action while building toward systemic reform through legislation.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Help those in greatest need first**: Prioritize borrowers in default, those defrauded, and those who have paid longest
2. **Use existing authority aggressively**: Executive action while pursuing legislative change
3. **Build political momentum**: Early wins create support for larger reforms
4. **Prevent future crises**: Pair relief with systemic changes
5. **Prepare for legal challenges**: Multiple legal theories; defensive litigation strategy

## Risk Factors and Contingencies

### Legal Challenges

**Contingency**: Defensive litigation; state-level protection

### Implementation Failure

**Risk**: Department of Education cannot execute
**Mitigation**: Capacity building; simplified processes; contractor support
**Contingency**: Phased implementation; priority populations first

### Industry Opposition
