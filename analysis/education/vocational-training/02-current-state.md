# Vocational Training: Current State

## The Problem Today

### A System in Decline

American vocational and technical education has been systematically dismantled over the past four decades. What was once a robust system of shop classes, vocational high schools, and apprenticeship programs has been replaced by a college-preparatory monoculture that fails millions of students.

**Then vs. Now**

| Metric | 1980s | Today | Change |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| High schools with full shop programs | ~90% | ~30% | -67% |
| Vocational high schools | 1,500+ | ~800 | -47% |
| Students taking 3+ CTE courses | ~35% | ~20% | -43% |
| Federal CTE funding (inflation-adjusted) | $3.5B | $1.4B | -60% |
| Apprenticeship completions/year | 280,000 | 300,000 | +7% |

### The College Funnel

Today's high school experience is designed almost exclusively around college preparation:

## Impact Analysis

### On Students and Workers

**Students Channeled Away from Vocational Paths**

The college-for-all mentality creates pressure on students to avoid CTE:

- Guidance counselors steer toward college prep
- CTE seen as "tracking" lower-income students
- Parents view CTE as giving up on child's potential
- Schools reward college acceptance rates, not employment

**Result**: Many students who would thrive in skilled trades pursue college, fail to complete, and enter workforce with debt and no credentials.

**Workers Facing Skills Obsolescence**

- 30% of workers fear job will be automated
- Average worker changes careers 3+ times
- Most retraining programs serve fewer than 100,000 displaced workers/year
- TAA (Trade Adjustment Assistance) reaches only 50,000 workers

### On Employers

**Unable to Find Skilled Workers**

| Industry | % Reporting Difficulty Hiring | Primary Skill Gaps |
|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Manufacturing | 77% | Technical skills, problem-solving |
| Construction | 72% | Trade skills, safety certifications |
| Healthcare | 68% | Clinical skills, soft skills |
| IT | 63% | Programming, cybersecurity |
| Transportation | 70% | CDL, equipment operation |

**Training Investment Declining**

- Employer training spending: $1,300/employee (down from $1,800 in 2000)
- Most training goes to already-skilled workers
- Small businesses provide minimal training
- Poaching concerns reduce employer investment

### On the Economy

**Regional Impacts**

| Region Type | Skills Gap Impact | Key Missing Occupations |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Rural | Severe | Healthcare, construction, manufacturing |
| Post-industrial | Critical | Advanced manufacturing, IT |
| Suburban | Moderate | Healthcare, construction |
| Urban | Mixed | Varies by neighborhood |

**Sectors Most Affected**

- **Construction**: $160 billion in delayed projects due to workforce shortage
- **Healthcare**: Nurse shortage leading to longer wait times, worse outcomes
- **Manufacturing**: Companies relocating production overseas due to skills gap
- **Infrastructure**: Roads, bridges, utilities suffering from skilled labor shortage

## Recent Developments

### Federal Policy Changes

**Perkins V Implementation (2018)**

- Reauthorized Career and Technical Education funding
- Added "programs of study" requirements
- Required labor market alignment
- Increased employer engagement mandates
- Funding: $1.4 billion (essentially flat)

**WIOA Implementation (2014)**

- Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act
- Consolidated federal workforce programs
- Created sector partnerships
- Emphasized credential attainment
- Funding: $3.4 billion/year

**American Rescue Plan Workforce Investments (2021)**

- $350 billion state/local fiscal recovery
- Some states used for workforce programs
- $500 million for community college workforce
- Temporary investment, not structural reform

### State Innovations

| State | Initiative | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Colorado | CareerWise apprenticeships | 2,000+ apprentices, growing |
| South Carolina | Apprenticeship Carolina | 36,000 apprentices, employer-led |
| Tennessee | Tennessee Reconnect | Free community college for adults |
| Kentucky | Work Ready Communities | 100+ certified communities |
| Indiana | Next Level Jobs | Employer training grants |

### Industry Initiatives

**Manufacturing**

- National Association of Manufacturers "Manufacturing Day"
- FAME (Federation for Advanced Manufacturing Education)
- German companies establishing apprenticeships in U.S. plants

**Construction**

- Multi-Employer training trusts
- ABC (Associated Builders and Contractors) apprenticeships
- Union-management joint programs

**Healthcare**

- Hospital system in-house training programs
- Nursing pipeline programs
- Allied health credential programs

**Technology**

- Google, Amazon, IBM credential programs
- Coding bootcamps (variable quality)
- CompTIA, Cisco, Microsoft certifications

### Credential Proliferation

The U.S. now has over 730,000 unique credentials:

| Credential Type | Number | Quality Consistency |
|-----------------|--------|---------------------|
| Certifications | 4,100 | Variable |
| Licenses | 7,500 | State-regulated |
| Certificates (educational) | 18,000 | Variable |
| Badges | 700,000+ | Mostly low-value |
| Apprenticeship certifications | 27,400 | Higher quality |

**Problems with Credential Proliferation**

- Employers cannot evaluate unfamiliar credentials
- Workers don't know which credentials have value
- Many credentials don't increase earnings
- Fragmentation prevents credential stacking

## Current Challenges

### Funding Inadequacy

**Federal CTE Funding (Perkins)**

| Year | Appropriation | Inflation-Adjusted | Per Student |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 2000 | $1.2 billion | $2.1 billion | $200 |
| 2010 | $1.2 billion | $1.6 billion | $160 |
| 2020 | $1.3 billion | $1.4 billion | $110 |
| 2024 | $1.4 billion | $1.4 billion | $105 |

Compare to: Germany spends ~$10,000 per apprentice annually; U.S. spends ~$500.

### Institutional Capacity

**Equipment and Facilities**

- Average age of CTE equipment: 15 years
- Industry equipment life cycle: 5-7 years
- 60% of CTE programs report inadequate facilities
- Lab space being converted to academic classrooms

**Teacher Shortage**

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| CTE teacher vacancies | 10,000+ unfilled positions |
| Average CTE teacher salary | $52,000 (vs. $72,000 industry) |
| Certification barriers | Industry experts can't teach |
| Retirement rate | 25% of CTE teachers retiring within 5 years |

### Cultural and Perception Issues

**Stigma Indicators**

- 75% of parents want children to attend four-year college
- Only 5% of parents prefer apprenticeship for their child
- "Tracking" concerns dominate education policy discussions
- CTE often seen as warehousing low-performers

**School Incentive Misalignment**

- Schools measured by college acceptance rates
- CTE programs not weighted in academic rankings
- Guidance counselors trained in college advising, not career
- Athletic programs receive more investment than CTE

### Employer Disengagement

**Why Employers Don't Invest**

| Factor | % Citing | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Poaching by competitors | 67% | Free-rider problem |
| Unclear ROI | 54% | Hesitancy to invest |
| Administrative burden | 48% | Small business barrier |
| Short-term focus | 43% | Quarterly earnings pressure |
| Lack of training capacity | 38% | Need intermediaries |

**Coordination Failures**

- No single point of contact for employer engagement
- Education and workforce systems disconnected
- Industry associations fragmented
- Regional coordination lacking

## Key Takeaways

1. **CTE has declined dramatically**: Funding, programs, and enrollment down significantly since 1980s
2. **College-for-all has failed millions**: Low completion rates and high debt for non-completers
3. **Skills gap is real and growing**: Millions of middle-skill jobs unfilled
4. **Apprenticeship lags international models**: 5% of youth vs. 50%+ in Germany/Switzerland
5. **Credentials are fragmented**: 730,000+ credentials with inconsistent quality and value
6. **Employers are disengaged**: Training investment declining; poaching concerns dominate
7. **Funding is inadequate**: U.S. invests fraction of what peer nations spend per trainee
8. **Stigma persists**: Cultural bias toward college remains strong
9. **Some state innovation occurring**: Colorado, South Carolina, Tennessee showing promising models
10. **Federal policy is fragmented**: Multiple programs, agencies, funding streams lack coordination
