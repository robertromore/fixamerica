# Vocational Training: Stakeholders

## Overview

Vocational training reform involves a complex web of stakeholders with varying interests, influence, and resources. Understanding who benefits from the current system, who is harmed, and who has power to change it is essential for developing effective reform strategies.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Students and Prospective Workers

The most directly affected stakeholders, though often the least powerful.

**High School Students**

| Segment | Needs | Current Experience |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Academically struggling | Engaging alternatives to lecture-based learning | Few options, pushed toward college anyway |
| Hands-on learners | Applied, practical education | Shop classes eliminated |
| Career-focused | Clear pathway to employment | Must navigate college-for-all system |
| First-generation | Information about non-college options | Counselors trained in college advising only |

**Current Impact**

- 30% of high school students not college-bound lack meaningful alternatives
- Students who would thrive in trades pushed toward college
- Many accumulate debt, don't complete degrees
- Enter workforce with neither academic credential nor practical skills

**What They Need**

- High-quality CTE options in high school
- Information about career pathways
- Work-based learning opportunities
- Stackable credentials that have labor market value

**Adult Workers**

| Segment | Needs | Current Experience |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Displaced workers | Retraining for new careers | WIOA serves only 3 million/year |
| Career changers | Accessible pathway to new field | Must start from scratch |
| Incumbent workers | Skills upgrading | Depends on employer investment |
| Underemployed | Skills to qualify for better jobs | Limited affordable options |

**Current Impact**

- Average displaced worker takes 23 weeks to find new job
- Most retraining programs have limited capacity
- Community college programs often don't fit work schedules
- Credentials from one employer don't transfer

### Employers

Employers are both beneficiaries of and contributors to the current problems.

**Large Employers**

| Interest | Position | Influence |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Skilled workforce | Want trained workers without training investment | High |
| Competitive wages | Resist wage increases to attract workers | High |
| Credential recognition | Want to evaluate candidates' skills | Medium |
| Policy influence | Lobbying for workforce programs | High |

**Current Behavior**

- Demand experience for entry-level positions
- Reduced training investment (down 30% since 2000)
- Poach trained workers from competitors
- Complain about skills gap while not investing in solutions

**What Would Help Employers**

- National credential standards
- Shared training infrastructure
- Government subsidies for apprenticeships
- Tax incentives for training investment

**Small and Medium Employers**

| Interest | Position | Influence |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Workforce access | Struggle to compete for workers | Low |
| Training capacity | Cannot afford to train | Low |
| Bureaucracy | Overwhelmed by program complexity | Low |
| Sector partnerships | Need intermediaries | Low |

**Current Challenges**

- Cannot match large employer wages
- Lack HR capacity to develop training
- Too small for apprenticeship programs
- Limited political voice

### Community Colleges

Community colleges are the primary delivery mechanism for workforce training but face conflicting incentives.

**Institutional Interests**

| Interest | Effect on Workforce Programs |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Enrollment | Prefer full-time degree students over short-term certificate |
| Transfer rates | Prioritize transfer over terminal workforce programs |
| Faculty preferences | Academic credentials valued over industry experience |
| Accreditation | Regional accreditors focus on academic standards |

**Internal Stakeholders**

| Group | Position | Influence |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Administration | Wants enrollment and funding | High |
| Academic faculty | Protect academic identity | Medium |
| Workforce faculty | Advocate for programs | Low |
| Trustees | Often employer-aligned | High |
| Students | Divided interests | Low |

**Current State**

- Workforce programs often underfunded within institution
- Certificate completion rates below 25%
- Programs sometimes misaligned with employer needs
- Part-time students poorly served

### Labor Unions

Unions have historically been major sponsors of apprenticeship training.

**Union Interests**

| Member wages | Skilled workers command higher pay | High (in organized sectors) |
| Training quality | Want rigorous standards | Medium |
| Market control | Training access as barrier to entry | Medium |
| Membership growth | Could recruit from apprentices | High |

**Union Role by Sector**

| Sector | Union Training Role | Status |
|--------|--------------------| -------|
| Construction | Major (joint apprenticeship programs) | Active |
| Manufacturing | Moderate (declining with membership) | Declining |
| Healthcare | Limited (nurses, some techs) | Growing |
| Public sector | Limited | Stable |

**Tensions**

- Union training often high quality but limited access
- Non-union employers expanding apprenticeships
- Licensing requirements sometimes protect incumbents
- Need for expansion vs. quality control

### K-12 Education System

Schools are central to career preparation but currently focused on college prep.

**School District Interests**

| Interest | Effect on CTE |
|----------|--------------|
| Accountability metrics | Cut CTE to focus on tested subjects |
| College acceptance rates | School reputation based on college |
| Funding | No rewards for workforce outcomes |
