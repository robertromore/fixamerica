# Education: Current State

## Overview

American education in 2024 faces profound challenges: persistent achievement gaps, severe funding inequities, a teacher shortage crisis, rising student debt, and contentious debates over curriculum and school choice. Despite spending more per pupil than most developed nations, the U.S. produces mediocre outcomes and stark disparities by race, income, and geography. From early childhood through higher education, the system struggles to deliver on the promise of equal opportunity.
