# Teacher Workforce: Actions

## What Citizens Can Do

### Understand the Issues

Before advocating, citizens should understand the key facts:

**The basics**:

- Teachers earn 20% less than comparably educated professionals
- Teacher preparation enrollment has declined 33% in a decade
- High-poverty schools have 3x higher vacancy rates
- 8% of teachers leave the profession annually

**Common misconceptions to correct**:

- "Teachers only work 9 months" — Teachers work ~50 hours/week during school year; hourly rates still lag
- "Teacher benefits make up for lower pay" — Even including benefits, total compensation is 10-15% lower
- "Teachers have great job security" — 8%+ leave annually; turnover is high in many schools
- "Anyone can teach" — Research shows teacher effectiveness varies enormously and matters for students

### Individual Actions

#### Support Teachers Directly

1. **Thank teachers**: Personal recognition matters in an undervalued profession
2. **Volunteer in schools**: Classroom support, tutoring, guest speaking
3. **Donate supplies**: Teachers spend an average of $500+ annually from personal funds
4. **Mentor new teachers**: If you're an experienced educator or professional
5. **Provide meals/appreciation**: School staff often work through lunch

### Civic Engagement

#### Local Level: School Boards

School boards make crucial decisions affecting teachers:

5. **Join PTA/PTO**: Parent organizations have board access

**Key questions to ask board members**:

- What is our district's teacher turnover rate?
- How do our salaries compare to neighboring districts?
- What are we doing about shortage areas?
- How are we supporting new teachers?

#### State Level: Legislature and Governor
