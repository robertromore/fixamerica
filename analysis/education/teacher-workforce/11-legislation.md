# Teacher Workforce: Legislation

## Overview

Transforming the teacher workforce requires coordinated legislation at federal, state, and local levels. Federal legislation can establish funding streams, set minimum standards, and incentivize state action. State legislation controls licensure, pension systems, collective bargaining, and the majority of education funding. Local policy implements working conditions within state frameworks.

This section provides model legislation addressing the core elements of teacher workforce reform.

## Constitutional Considerations

### Federal Authority

The Constitution does not mention education, reserving authority to states under the Tenth Amendment. However, federal involvement is well-established through:

- **Spending Clause**: Congress can attach conditions to federal funding
- **Commerce Clause**: Limited direct authority, but teacher shortage affects interstate commerce
- **Civil Rights enforcement**: Equal protection and Title VI/VII authority

Most federal teacher legislation operates through conditional spending—providing funds with requirements attached.

### State Authority

States have plenary authority over education, including:

- Teacher certification and licensure
- Pension systems and benefits
- Collective bargaining rules
- School funding formulas
- Curriculum and standards

State constitutions typically include education clauses that may provide additional authority or constraints.

## Federal Legislation

### Teacher Compensation Competitiveness Act

**Purpose**: Eliminate the teacher pay penalty through federal incentives for state salary increases.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Teacher Compensation Competitiveness Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(a) Public school teachers earn, on average, 19.2 percent less than
    comparably educated professionals in other fields.
(b) This compensation gap has widened significantly over the past
    three decades.
(c) Teacher shortages have reached crisis levels in mathematics,
    science, special education, and schools serving low-income
    students.
(d) Competitive compensation is essential to recruiting and
    retaining qualified teachers.

SEC. 3. TEACHER SALARY COMPETITIVENESS GRANTS.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.—The Secretary of Education shall award grants
    to States to increase teacher compensation to competitive levels.

(b) FORMULA GRANTS.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall allocate funds to States
        based on—
        (A) the number of public school teachers in the State;
        (B) the State's teacher pay penalty relative to comparable
            professions; and
        (C) the proportion of students eligible for free or reduced-
            price lunch.

    (2) MINIMUM ALLOCATION.—No State shall receive less than 0.5
        percent of funds appropriated.

(c) STATE MATCHING REQUIREMENTS.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—To receive a grant, a State shall provide
        matching funds of not less than—
        (A) 50 percent of the Federal grant amount for States with
            per-capita income below the national median; and
        (B) 100 percent of the Federal grant amount for States with
            per-capita income at or above the national median.

    (2) MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT.—Grant funds shall supplement, not
        supplant, existing State and local funding for teacher
        compensation.

(d) USE OF FUNDS.—Grant funds shall be used to—
    (1) increase base salaries for all teachers;
    (2) provide additional compensation for teachers in shortage
        subjects, including mathematics, science, special education,
        and bilingual education;
    (3) provide additional compensation for teachers in high-need
        schools, defined as schools where 75 percent or more of
        students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch; and
    (4) improve teacher benefits, including health insurance and
        retirement contributions.

(e) SALARY FLOOR.—As a condition of receiving funds, States shall
    establish a minimum teacher salary of not less than—
    (1) $50,000 in the first year of implementation;
    (2) $55,000 in the third year; and
    (3) adjusted for inflation thereafter.

(f) REPORTING.—States receiving funds shall report annually on—
    (1) teacher salary levels and changes;
    (2) teacher vacancy and turnover rates;
    (3) teacher shortage areas and progress in addressing them; and
    (4) distribution of funds across districts and schools.

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000,000 for each
of fiscal years 2026 through 2035.
```

**Explanation**: This legislation uses the conditional spending model proven effective in education policy. The matching requirement ensures state investment and sustainability. The salary floor establishes a national minimum while allowing state flexibility above that level. Shortage and high-need differentials address distribution problems.

**Challenges**:

- Cost is substantial ($25 billion annually)
- State matching may be difficult for low-revenue states
- Maintenance of effort provisions require enforcement

**Refinements needed**:

- Define "comparable professions" for pay penalty calculation
- Specify enforcement mechanisms for salary floor violations
- Address cost-of-living variation in salary floor

### Teacher Preparation Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Transform teacher preparation through residency program expansion and clinical practice requirements.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Teacher Preparation Modernization Act".

SEC. 2. TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT PROGRAM.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Education shall establish a
    competitive grant program to support the creation and expansion
    of teacher residency programs.

(b) ELIGIBLE ENTITIES.—Grants may be awarded to—
    (1) partnerships between institutions of higher education and
        local educational agencies;
    (2) nonprofit organizations partnering with institutions of
        higher education and local educational agencies; and
    (3) consortia of local educational agencies partnering with
        institutions of higher education.

(c) PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.—A teacher residency program receiving
    funds under this section shall—
    (1) provide a full academic year of clinical experience in a
        high-need school;
    (2) pair each resident with an effective mentor teacher;
    (3) provide coursework integrated with clinical experience;
    (4) provide a living stipend of not less than $25,000 to
        residents during the residency year;
    (5) require a three-year teaching commitment in the partner
        district or another high-need school; and
    (6) achieve a three-year retention rate of not less than
        80 percent.

(d) PRIORITY.—In awarding grants, the Secretary shall give priority
    to programs that—
    (1) prepare teachers in shortage subjects;
    (2) prepare teachers from underrepresented backgrounds;
    (3) partner with schools serving predominantly low-income
        students or students of color; and
    (4) demonstrate evidence of graduate effectiveness.

(e) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be
    appropriated $3,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026
    through 2035.

SEC. 3. CLINICAL PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS.

(a) MINIMUM STANDARDS.—Beginning three years after enactment, as
    a condition of institutional eligibility for Title IV student
    financial assistance, teacher preparation programs shall
    provide—
    (1) not less than one full semester of supervised clinical
        experience; and
    (2) earlier clinical exposure beginning not later than the
        second year of the program.

(b) MENTOR TEACHER REQUIREMENTS.—Cooperating teachers supervising
    student teachers shall—
    (1) have not less than three years of teaching experience;
    (2) demonstrate evidence of effectiveness; and
    (3) receive training in mentorship.
```

**Explanation**: This combines grants for residency expansion with requirements for clinical practice in all programs. Linking clinical requirements to Title IV eligibility provides enforcement leverage.

**Challenges**:

- Residencies are expensive to scale
- Clinical requirements may burden small programs
- Mentor teacher requirements may be difficult to enforce

### Public Service Loan Forgiveness Simplification Act

**Purpose**: Fix PSLF to ensure teachers actually receive promised forgiveness.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Public Service Loan Forgiveness
Simplification Act".

SEC. 2. AUTOMATIC EMPLOYER CERTIFICATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Education shall establish a
    system for automatic verification of qualifying public service
    employment.

(b) EMPLOYER DATABASE.—The Secretary shall maintain a database of
    qualifying public service employers, including all public
    schools and school districts.

(c) AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT.—Borrowers employed by qualifying
    employers shall be automatically enrolled in PSLF unless they
    opt out.

SEC. 3. ANNUAL FORGIVENESS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—In lieu of forgiveness after 120 qualifying
    payments, borrowers may elect annual partial forgiveness equal
    to—
    (1) 10 percent of the original loan balance for each year of
        qualifying employment in the first five years; and
    (2) 15 percent for each year of qualifying employment in years
        six through ten.

(b) SHORTAGE AREA BONUS.—Teachers in designated shortage areas
    shall receive an additional 5 percent forgiveness annually.

SEC. 4. PAYMENT PLAN ELIGIBILITY.

All federal student loan repayment plans shall be qualifying
repayment plans for purposes of PSLF.

SEC. 5. PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) TIMELINE.—The Secretary shall process PSLF applications within
    60 days of submission.

(b) DENIAL REQUIREMENTS.—If an application is denied, the Secretary
    shall provide—
    (1) specific reasons for denial;
    (2) information on qualifying payments made; and
    (3) instructions for curing any deficiencies.
```

**Explanation**: Addresses the major PSLF implementation failures: employer verification, payment plan complexity, and processing delays. Annual forgiveness provides earlier benefits and clearer progress tracking.

```

## Regulatory Framework

### Department of Education Regulations

Federal legislation requires implementing regulations. Key regulatory areas:

**Title II Teacher Quality Regulations**:

- Define "effective teacher" for reporting purposes
- Establish teacher preparation program accountability measures
- Specify shortage area identification methodology

**PSLF Regulations**:

- Define qualifying employers (automatic inclusion of all public schools)
- Establish automatic certification procedures
- Specify processing timelines and denial procedures

**Teacher Residency Regulations**:

- Define program requirements for grant eligibility
- Establish retention rate calculation methodology
- Specify reporting requirements

### State Education Agency Regulations

State legislation requires state-level implementation:

**Certification Regulations**:

- Clinical practice requirements for initial certification
- Mentor teacher qualification standards
- Emergency credential limitations and phase-out

**Working Conditions Regulations**:

- Class size counting methodology
- Planning time documentation requirements
- Administrative burden audit procedures

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause limits**: Federal conditions must be related to program purpose and not coercive. Salary floor requirements may face challenge if too prescriptive.

**State sovereignty**: States retain primary education authority. Federal legislation must work through incentives rather than mandates in most cases.

**Collective bargaining**: *Janus v. AFSCME* (2018) eliminated mandatory agency fees for public employees. State laws cannot override this constitutional holding.

**Equal protection**: Differential pay must have rational basis. Shortage-area and high-need differentials have clear justification.

### Preemption

**State law controls**: Most teacher employment matters are governed by state law. Federal legislation operates through funding conditions.

**Local discretion**: Even with state requirements, districts retain some flexibility in implementation. State laws should specify minimum standards while allowing local enhancement.

### Enforcement

**Federal enforcement**: Department of Education can withhold funds for non-compliance. Administrative procedures must provide due process.

**State enforcement**: State education agencies typically monitor local compliance. Grievance procedures and litigation provide additional enforcement mechanisms.

**Union enforcement**: Collective bargaining agreements are enforceable through grievance procedures and, if needed, litigation.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Salary floor manipulation | Districts could reduce benefits or increase employee contributions to meet salary floor while reducing total compensation | High |
| Shortage area gaming | Districts could classify positions to avoid shortage supplements or misassign teachers | Medium |
| Clinical practice quality | Programs could meet hour requirements without meaningful clinical experience | High |
| Maintenance of effort circumvention | States could shift existing education spending to other purposes | High |
| Class size averaging | Districts could meet average requirements while having overcrowded individual classrooms | Medium |
| Planning time erosion | Administrators could interrupt planning time with "emergency" duties | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Funding inadequacy | Authorized amounts may not be appropriated | Appropriations separate from authorization |
| State capacity | Low-capacity states may struggle to implement | Variation in state education agency capabilities |
| Rural challenges | Some provisions (residencies, mentors) harder in rural areas | One-size-fits-all approach |
| Private school exclusion | Private school teachers unaffected by public policy | Constitutional separation |
| Charter school ambiguity | Charter teacher coverage varies by state | Inconsistent charter regulation |
| Substitute teacher omission | Legislation focuses on permanent teachers | Narrow definition of teaching workforce |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Total compensation protection**: Amend salary floor provisions to require minimum total compensation including benefits, not just base salary. Require annual reporting of total compensation per teacher.

2. **Certification verification**: Require teaching assignment verification through state data systems. Prohibit shortage supplements for teachers primarily assigned outside shortage areas.

3. **Clinical practice quality standards**: Establish accreditation requirements for clinical placements. Require mentor teacher training and evaluation.

4. **Maintenance of effort enforcement**: Require state maintenance of effort certification. Establish penalty provisions for states that reduce effort.

5. **Class size enforcement**: Require individual classroom reporting, not district averages. Establish procedures for teacher reporting of violations.

6. **Planning time protection**: Require documentation of any interruption to planning time. Establish compensation for interrupted planning.

### General Implementation Concerns

**Appropriations risk**: Authorization does not guarantee funding. Build bipartisan support for sustained appropriations.

**Administrative capacity**: Ensure Department of Education and state agencies have capacity to administer programs. Include administrative funding in appropriations.

**Data systems**: Effective implementation requires data tracking. Invest in state longitudinal data systems.

**Stakeholder buy-in**: Engage teachers, unions, districts, and states in implementation design. Create advisory structures.

**Evaluation**: Build evaluation requirements into legislation. Fund research on implementation effectiveness.
