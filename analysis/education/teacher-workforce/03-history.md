# Teacher Workforce: History

## The Origins of Teaching as a Profession

### The Common School Movement (1830s-1860s)

Before the common school movement, teaching in America was informal and inconsistent. Teachers were often itinerant young men earning money between other pursuits, ministers supplementing income, or community members with basic literacy. No training, standards, or career structure existed.

Horace Mann's common school movement transformed this landscape. Mann, as Massachusetts Secretary of Education (1837-1848), championed universal public education and, crucially, recognized that such a system required trained teachers. He established the first public "normal schools"—teacher training institutions—beginning with Lexington Normal School in 1839.

Mann's vision contained a fateful calculation: to staff schools affordably, teaching would need to be positioned as women's work. He argued that women were naturally suited to teaching young children, possessed superior moral character, and—critically—could be paid less than men.

### The Feminization of Teaching (1850s-1900s)

Mann's strategy succeeded dramatically. The proportion of female teachers rose from 25% in 1840 to 70% by 1880 and continued climbing. This feminization brought consequences:

**Economic**: Women teachers earned 30-50% of male teacher salaries for identical work. School boards explicitly justified lower pay based on gender.

**Professional status**: Teaching became classified as "semi-professional"—lacking the autonomy, training requirements, and compensation of male-dominated professions like law and medicine.

**Structural design**: Schools were organized around the assumption that teachers were single women who would leave upon marriage, or married women supplementing a primary male income.

The "marriage bar"—rules requiring women to resign upon marriage—persisted in many districts into the 1940s. This policy ensured constant turnover and suppressed wages.

### Early Unionization (1850s-1920s)

Teachers began organizing early, though initially through professional associations rather than unions:

**1857**: National Teachers Association founded (later National Education Association)
**1897**: Chicago Teachers Federation founded by Margaret Haley and Catherine Goggin
**1916**: American Federation of Teachers founded

The Chicago Teachers Federation pioneered teacher activism. Haley led the fight against tax evasion by corporations, arguing that foregone revenue meant lower school funding and teacher pay. The Federation won significant salary increases and helped defeat merit pay schemes that teachers viewed as subjective and politically manipulated.

However, early teacher organizations focused primarily on professional status rather than compensation, reflecting the predominantly middle-class self-image of teachers.

## The Professional Era (1920s-1960s)

### Normal Schools to Teachers Colleges

The normal school model evolved significantly in the early twentieth century:

**1920s**: Most states required high school diploma plus one to two years of normal school
**1930s**: Four-year degree requirements began spreading
**1940s**: Normal schools converted to state teachers colleges
**1960s**: Many teachers colleges became comprehensive state universities

This "academic drift" had mixed effects. Teacher preparation became more rigorous academically but often less connected to practical classroom skills.

### The Development of Tenure

Teacher tenure emerged from two concerns: academic freedom and protection from political patronage.

**1909**: First state teacher tenure law (New Jersey)
**1920s-1940s**: Most states adopt tenure statutes
**1970s**: Tenure universal in public education

Tenure provided due process rights—teachers could not be dismissed without cause and a hearing—rather than lifetime job guarantees. However, the administrative burden of dismissal proceedings made removing ineffective teachers rare.

### Salary Schedule Standardization

The single salary schedule—paying all teachers with equal experience and credentials the same, regardless of grade level, subject, or school—developed in the 1920s:

**1921**: Denver implements first comprehensive single salary schedule
**1930s-1950s**: Model spreads nationwide
**1960s**: Nearly universal in public education

The single salary schedule emerged from legitimate concerns:

- Ending pay discrimination against women and elementary teachers
- Preventing favoritism and corruption in salary decisions
- Creating predictability for budget planning

However, the schedule also prevented differential pay for shortage subjects or hard-to-staff schools.

### Post-War Expansion and Crisis

The Baby Boom created unprecedented demand for teachers:

**1950**: 940,000 public school teachers
**1960**: 1.6 million teachers
**1970**: 2.3 million teachers

This expansion strained supply. Many states lowered standards to fill classrooms, issuing emergency credentials and accepting minimally qualified candidates. The "warm body" era left lasting impressions that would shape later reform movements.

## The Reform Era (1960s-1980s)

### The 1960s: Militancy and Progress

Teacher unionization accelerated dramatically in the 1960s:

**1961**: United Federation of Teachers wins collective bargaining rights in New York City
**1962**: President Kennedy's Executive Order 10988 grants federal employees collective bargaining rights, inspiring state-level laws
**1968**: Over 100 teacher strikes nationwide

The AFT, initially smaller than the NEA, demonstrated that militant tactics won results. The NEA transformed from a professional association to a union, competing for members through increasingly aggressive bargaining.

By 1980, 75% of teachers were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Salaries improved significantly in relative terms, reaching their peak purchasing power.

### A Nation at Risk (1983)

The 1983 report "A Nation at Risk" declared American education failing and launched the modern standards-and-accountability movement. Regarding teachers, it warned:

> "Not enough of the academically able students are being attracted to teaching; too many teachers are being drawn from the bottom quarter of graduating high school and college students."

The report recommended higher standards for teachers, including competency testing, better preparation, and improved compensation. However, implementation focused more on testing and standards than on investment.

### The First Wave of Teacher Reform

States responded with reforms focused on teacher quality:

- **Competency testing**: By 1990, 44 states required teacher testing
- **Alternative certification**: Texas and New Jersey pioneer programs (1984-1985)
- **Career ladders**: Several states create master teacher positions
- **Merit pay experiments**: Multiple states attempt performance pay

Many reforms faded quickly. Merit pay proved contentious and administratively burdensome. Career ladders were eliminated during budget cuts. Alternative certification expanded but without consistent quality standards.

## The Accountability Era (1990s-2010s)

### Standards-Based Reform

The 1990s saw the rise of standards-based reform, culminating in No Child Left Behind (2002). For teachers, NCLB required:

- **Highly qualified teachers**: Content knowledge requirements
- **Testing consequences**: Schools failing to show adequate yearly progress faced sanctions
- **Data systems**: Tracking of teacher credentials and student outcomes

NCLB's teacher provisions had mixed effects. The "highly qualified" requirements were largely symbolic—most teachers already met them. The accountability pressure increased stress without corresponding support.

### Alternative Certification Expansion

Alternative certification programs grew dramatically:

| Year | % of New Teachers via Alt-Cert |
|------|-------------------------------|
| 1990 | 3% |
| 2000 | 8% |
| 2010 | 15% |
| 2020 | 18% |

**Teach For America**, founded in 1990, became the most prominent alternative program. TFA recruits high-achieving graduates for two-year commitments in high-need schools. It demonstrated that talented individuals could be attracted to teaching—but also highlighted that retention required addressing structural problems.

### The Teacher Effectiveness Movement

The 2000s brought intense focus on teacher effectiveness research and policy:

**Value-Added Modeling**: Statistical techniques to isolate teacher effects on student test scores gained prominence. Research suggested teacher effectiveness varied dramatically—and could be measured.

**Evaluation Reform**: The federal Race to the Top competition (2009) pushed states to adopt new evaluation systems incorporating student outcomes.

**Tenure Reform**: Several states weakened tenure protections, requiring multiple years of effective ratings to earn or keep tenure.

**Merit Pay**: Large-scale experiments with performance pay showed limited effects on student achievement.

### The Common Core and Backlash

Common Core State Standards (2010) brought curriculum standardization across most states. For teachers, implementation meant:

- New curriculum and instructional materials
- Changed assessments
- Professional development demands
- Political controversy affecting working conditions

The political backlash against Common Core—from both left and right—contributed to teacher demoralization and illustrated how teachers were caught in larger political battles.

## Recent Developments (2010s-Present)

### The Pay Penalty Widens

After a period of relative stability, the teacher pay penalty resumed growing:

| Year | Pay Penalty |
|------|-------------|
| 2000 | -9.8% |
| 2010 | -15.1% |
| 2015 | -17.0% |
| 2020 | -19.2% |
| 2023 | -19.2% |

Real teacher salaries remained flat while comparable professional salaries grew, widening the gap.

### Teacher Activism Resurges

2018 marked a turning point in teacher activism:

**West Virginia**: Nine-day strike wins 5% raise (February-March 2018)
**Oklahoma**: Nine-day walkout wins $6,000 raises (April 2018)
**Arizona**: "Red for Ed" movement wins 20% raises over three years (April-May 2018)
**Los Angeles**: Six-day strike wins class size reductions, nursing services (January 2019)

These "Red for Ed" strikes occurred predominantly in states with weak or no collective bargaining, demonstrating teacher frustration that transcended union politics.

### The Pandemic Disruption

COVID-19 devastated the teaching workforce:

**Initial chaos (Spring 2020)**: Emergency remote teaching with minimal support
**2020-21**: Hybrid models, health fears, dramatically increased workload
**2021-22**: Learning loss pressures, behavior challenges, continued health concerns
**2022-present**: Elevated turnover, staffing crises, burnout epidemic

Teacher job satisfaction hit record lows. Those who stayed reported unprecedented stress. Those who left cited pandemic working conditions as the final straw.

### The Current Crisis

Multiple trend lines converge into the current crisis:

- **Pipeline collapse**: Teacher preparation enrollment down 33%
- **Retention crisis**: Turnover elevated, particularly in high-need schools
- **Burnout epidemic**: Teacher stress and dissatisfaction at historic highs
- **Political attacks**: Teachers caught in culture war controversies
- **Shortage emergency**: Districts unable to fill positions, lowering standards

The teaching profession faces an existential crisis. Without dramatic intervention, the workforce problems of the past will compound into a catastrophic future shortage.

## Lessons from History

### What Works

**Investment produces results**: When salaries improved in the 1960s-1970s, teacher quality and retention improved.

**Collective voice matters**: Teacher organizations have historically been essential for improving conditions.

**Clinical preparation predicts success**: Programs emphasizing classroom practice produce more effective, longer-lasting teachers.

### What Fails

**Accountability without support**: Testing and evaluation without investment demoralizes teachers without improving outcomes.

**Quick fixes**: Emergency credentials, TFA-style short-term commitments, and crash preparation programs address symptoms, not causes.

**Devaluing the profession**: Policies treating teaching as unskilled work that anyone can do undermine recruitment and retention.

### Structural Patterns

Teaching has been structurally undervalued since its founding as a feminized profession. Each reform era has failed to fundamentally address compensation and working conditions. Until these structural issues are resolved, the teacher workforce crisis will persist.
