# Teacher Workforce: Stakeholders

## Primary Stakeholders

### Teachers

**The 3.2 million public school teachers** are the most directly affected stakeholders. Their interests include:

**Compensation**:

- Competitive salaries relative to other professions
- Comprehensive benefits (health, retirement)
- Predictable salary growth
- Recognition for additional responsibilities

**Working conditions**:

- Manageable class sizes
- Adequate planning and collaboration time
- Safe and well-maintained facilities
- Access to necessary materials and technology
- Reasonable administrative burden

**Professional standing**:

- Autonomy over instructional decisions
- Voice in policy affecting classrooms
- Respect from administrators, parents, and public
- Due process protections

**Career development**:

- Meaningful professional learning opportunities
- Pathways to leadership without leaving classroom
- Support for continuous improvement
- Mentorship for new teachers

**Positions on reform**:

- Generally support increased compensation
- Divided on merit pay (most oppose individual performance pay)
- Support reduced class sizes
- Skeptical of standardized testing
- Favor more preparation time
- Divided on evaluation systems

Teachers are not monolithic. Veteran teachers may prioritize job security; new teachers may prioritize loan forgiveness. Urban teachers face different challenges than rural teachers. Special education teachers have distinct concerns from general education teachers.

### Students

**The 50 million public school students** are the ultimate stakeholders, though they lack political voice:

**Interests**:

- Effective teachers in every classroom
- Stable relationships (low turnover harms learning)
- Teachers who understand their backgrounds
- Qualified teachers in all subjects
- Teachers with time and energy to support them

**Differential impacts**:
Students in high-poverty schools suffer most from teacher workforce problems. They are more likely to have:

- Inexperienced teachers
- Uncertified or emergency-credential teachers
- High teacher turnover
- Long-term substitutes
- Larger class sizes

Research consistently shows teacher effectiveness is the largest in-school factor in student outcomes. Workforce problems translate directly to diminished educational opportunity.

### Parents and Families

**The 40+ million families** with children in public schools have interests that sometimes align with and sometimes conflict with teacher interests:

**Shared interests with teachers**:

- Effective instruction for their children
- Qualified teachers in every classroom
- Adequate school resources
- Safe, supportive school environments

**Potential tensions**:

- Parents may support accountability systems teachers dislike
- Parents may favor school choice options teachers oppose
- Parents may disagree with curriculum decisions
- Parents may want more communication time than teachers can provide

**Political influence**:
Parent groups have significant political power. PTA/PTO organizations advocate for school funding. Some parent groups have organized against specific curriculum or policies, affecting teacher working conditions.

### School Districts

**The 13,000+ school districts** are the direct employers of teachers:

**District interests**:

- Recruit and retain qualified teachers
- Manage personnel costs within budgets
- Meet state and federal requirements
- Produce positive student outcomes
- Maintain community support

**District constraints**:

- Revenue limited by property tax base
- State funding formulas may be inadequate
- Collective bargaining agreements limit flexibility
- Competition with neighboring districts for teachers
- Accountability pressure from state

**District positions**:

- Generally support flexibility in hiring and compensation
- May resist salary increases due to budget constraints
- Support alternative certification to address shortages
- Divided on collective bargaining value
- Want flexibility on evaluation and tenure

Districts vary enormously—from 50-student rural districts to million-student urban systems. Their interests depend on their specific contexts.

### School Administrators

**The 130,000 principals and 14,000 superintendents** occupy a middle position between teachers and policymakers:

**Administrator interests**:

- Authority to build effective teams
- Flexibility in personnel decisions
- Adequate resources to support teachers
- Autonomy from micromanagement
- Support for school improvement

**Relationship with teachers**:
Administrators evaluate teachers, assign duties, and implement policies. This creates inherent tension even when relationships are positive. Administrators generally support:

- Stronger hiring authority
- Easier dismissal processes
- Flexibility in compensation
- Reduced union constraints

Teachers often view administrators as implementing harmful policies or failing to buffer them from external pressures. The principal-teacher relationship significantly affects teacher retention.

## Teacher Organizations

### National Education Association (NEA)

**Size**: 3 million members (largest union in the United States)
**Structure**: State and local affiliates with significant autonomy
**Political activity**: Major Democratic Party supporter; $50+ million in political spending per cycle

**NEA positions**:

- Substantial salary increases
- Reduced class sizes
- Opposition to standardized test-based accountability
- Support for tenure and due process
- Opposition to merit pay
- Opposition to vouchers and most charter expansion
- Support for diversity initiatives
- Federal education funding increases

**NEA influence**:
The NEA wields significant political power through:

- Campaign contributions and endorsements
- Grassroots mobilization of members
- Lobbying at federal and state levels
- Research and policy development

### American Federation of Teachers (AFT)

**Size**: 1.7 million members
**Structure**: Affiliated with AFL-CIO; strong local unions
**Political activity**: Major Democratic Party supporter; significant political spending

**AFT positions**:
Similar to NEA on most issues, with some distinctions:

- More open to performance-based elements in evaluation
- Historically more willing to accept accountability measures
- Stronger emphasis on working conditions
- More militant strike tradition

**AFT influence**:
AFT has particular strength in large urban districts (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles) and among higher education faculty.

### State and Local Unions

State affiliates and local unions often have more direct impact than national organizations:

**State-level power**:

- Bargaining laws determine what can be negotiated
- State budget decisions determine available resources
- State policy affects curriculum, testing, evaluation

**Local-level power**:

- Collective bargaining agreements set specific terms
- Grievance procedures enforce contracts
- Union building representatives shape school culture

Union strength varies dramatically by state:

- **Strong union states**: California, New York, Illinois, New Jersey
- **Right-to-work states**: Texas, Florida, Georgia, Arizona
- **Weak or no bargaining states**: North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina

### Non-Union Teacher Organizations

**Educators for Excellence**: Reform-oriented teacher group supporting evaluation, tenure reform, merit pay
**TNTP (The New Teacher Project)**: Teacher effectiveness research and advocacy organization
**National Board for Professional Teaching Standards**: Advanced certification and professional development

These groups represent teachers with different views than dominant union positions, particularly on accountability and compensation structures.

## Government Stakeholders

### Federal Government

**U.S. Department of Education**:

- Administers $40+ billion in elementary/secondary programs
- Sets conditions on federal funding
- Provides research and technical assistance
- Limited direct authority over teachers (state responsibility)

**Key federal programs affecting teachers**:

- Title II (teacher quality): ~$2 billion annually
- TEACH grants: Loan forgiveness for shortage subjects
- Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Benefits teachers (when it works)
- IDEA: Special education requirements

**Federal policy positions** (vary by administration):

- Obama era: Race to the Top pushed evaluation reform, alternative certification
- Trump era: Deregulation, support for school choice
- Biden era: Increased funding, teacher pipeline investments

### State Governments

**State education agencies**:

- License and certify teachers
- Set preparation program standards
- Determine evaluation requirements
- Distribute state education funding
- Establish curriculum standards

**State legislatures**:

- Fund education (largest state budget item)
- Set collective bargaining rules
- Determine pension systems
- Enact accountability policies
- Pass teacher quality legislation

**Governors**:

- Propose education budgets
- Appoint state board members
- Advocate for policy priorities
- Significant agenda-setting power

States have primary constitutional authority over education. Most consequential teacher policy happens at the state level.

### Local School Boards

**The 14,000 school boards** govern districts with elected (occasionally appointed) members:

**Board responsibilities**:

- Adopt budgets
- Approve personnel policies
- Ratify collective bargaining agreements
- Set district priorities
- Hire superintendents

**Board influence on teachers**:

- Salary schedule approval
- Class size policies
- Working condition policies
- Evaluation implementation

School board elections are typically low-turnout, non-partisan affairs where organized interests (including unions) have outsized influence.

## Education Schools and Preparation Programs

### Traditional Teacher Preparation Programs

**The 1,500+ education schools** prepare most new teachers:

**Interests**:

- Maintain enrollment and revenue
- Academic status within universities
- Accreditation and program approval
- Influence over licensure requirements
- Research funding and prestige

**Tensions**:
Education schools face criticism from multiple directions:

- Reformers say they are too theoretical, not practical enough
- Unions say they don't prepare teachers for real classroom challenges
- Researchers say many programs are low quality

**Positions**:

- Support high standards for preparation (but not so high as to reduce enrollment)
- Resist alternative certification as competition
- Support clinical practice but struggle to implement
- Favor comprehensive preparation over abbreviated routes

### Alternative Certification Programs

**Teach For America**:

- Selective recruitment from top universities
- Abbreviated preparation (summer institute)
- Two-year commitment to high-need schools
- Significant alumni network in education policy

**Other alternative programs**:

- District-run residency programs
- Online certification programs
- Transition-to-teaching programs for career changers

**Alternative certification interests**:

- Expand pathways into teaching
- Address shortages quickly
- Demonstrate that traditional preparation is not necessary
- Reform education school monopoly

Alternative programs vary dramatically in quality and outcomes. Research shows wide variation—some residencies outperform traditional programs; some emergency routes produce poor outcomes.

## Research and Advocacy Organizations

### Education Reform Organizations

**Stand for Children**: Advocates for evaluation reform, tenure changes, school choice
**Democrats for Education Reform**: Center-left reform advocacy
**Education Trust**: Equity-focused research and advocacy
**Center for American Progress**: Progressive education policy research

These organizations generally support:

- Teacher effectiveness focus
- Evaluation reform
- Some forms of performance pay
- Alternative certification expansion
- Accountability systems

### Teacher-Aligned Research Organizations

**Learning Policy Institute** (Linda Darling-Hammond): Comprehensive teacher workforce research
**Economic Policy Institute**: Teacher pay penalty research
**Albert Shanker Institute**: Union-aligned research
**National Center for Teacher Quality**: Teacher prep program ratings

These organizations generally support:

- Increased compensation

## Business and Employer Interests

### Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce

Business organizations advocate for education quality as workforce preparation:

**Interests**:

- Graduates prepared for employment
- STEM pipeline for technical jobs
- Soft skills (communication, teamwork, problem-solving)
- Reduced employer training costs

**Positions**:

- Generally support accountability and standards
- Support career and technical education
- May support school choice and charter expansion
- Generally silent on teacher compensation

### Technology Industry

**Education technology companies** have interests in teacher workforce policies:

- Larger class sizes create demand for tech solutions
- Teacher shortages create demand for online learning
- Professional development market is substantial
- Assessment and data systems are profitable

Technology interests may not align with teacher workforce investment—teacher shortages can be "solved" with technology rather than better teacher employment conditions.
