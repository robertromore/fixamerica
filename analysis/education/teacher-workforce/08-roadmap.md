## Sequencing Logic

### Why This Order

**Emergency response first**: Without immediate stabilization, the workforce will collapse before structural reforms can take effect

**Compensation before conditions**: Research shows salary matters more for recruitment; conditions matter more for retention. Must recruit before retaining.

**Preparation before expansion**: Quality must improve before scaling up

**Diversity integrated throughout**: Cannot wait until "later" to address diversity—must be embedded from start

## Risk Factors and Mitigation

### Political Risks

**Risk**: Change in federal administration reverses policy direction
**Mitigation**: Build bipartisan support; emphasize economic competitiveness and national security

**Risk**: State resistance to federal requirements
**Mitigation**: Incentive-based approach rather than mandates; state flexibility within goals

### Economic Risks

**Risk**: Recession reduces available funding
**Mitigation**: Counter-cyclical design—education investment as economic stimulus; protected funding streams

**Risk**: Inflation erodes value of fixed salary increases
**Mitigation**: Automatic adjustment mechanisms; regular adequacy reviews

### Implementation Risks

**Risk**: Teacher preparation programs cannot scale quality quickly
**Mitigation**: Phased implementation; technical assistance; quality accountability

**Risk**: Salary increases without quality improvement waste resources
**Mitigation**: Tie increases to system reforms; improve selectivity as salaries rise

## Cost Summary

### Annual Investment Required (at full implementation)

| Category | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| Salary competitiveness | $40-50 billion |
| Preparation investment | $7-10 billion |
| Working conditions | $15-20 billion |
| Loan forgiveness | $3-5 billion |
| Diversity pipeline | $2-3 billion |
| **Total additional** | **$67-88 billion** |

### Funding Sources
