# Teacher Workforce: Overview

America faces a deepening crisis in its teaching profession. The nation's 3.2 million public school teachers are underpaid, overworked, and increasingly leaving the profession. The average teacher earns 20% less than comparably educated professionals, and this "teacher pay penalty" has widened dramatically since the 1990s. Annual turnover rates exceed 8% nationally, with some high-poverty schools losing a third of their teachers each year. Meanwhile, enrollment in teacher preparation programs has plummeted by more than 33% over the past decade, creating a recruitment crisis that compounds retention failures.
