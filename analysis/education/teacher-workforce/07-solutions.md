# Teacher Workforce: Solutions

## Compensation Reform

### Eliminate the Teacher Pay Penalty

**Goal**: Close the 20% gap between teacher compensation and comparable professions

**Mechanism**:

1. **Base salary increases**: Raise starting salaries to competitive levels ($55,000-$65,000 depending on region)
2. **Salary schedule compression**: Reduce years to maximum salary (from 25+ years to 15-20)
3. **Regional cost-of-living adjustments**: Higher base in high-cost areas
4. **Ongoing adjustment mechanism**: Index teacher salaries to comparable profession growth

**Funding requirements**:

- National cost estimate: $50-100 billion annually (20% increase to $400 billion teacher compensation)
- Per-teacher average increase: $15,000-20,000

**Evidence base**:

- Research shows salary increases improve recruitment and retention
- International evidence links competitive pay to higher-quality applicant pools
- State-level evidence from recent raise initiatives (West Virginia, Arizona) shows recruitment improvement

### Shortage-Area and High-Need Differential Pay

**Goal**: Direct additional compensation to teachers where they're most needed

**Mechanism**:

1. **Subject area differentials**: Additional $5,000-$15,000 annually for:
   - Mathematics and science
   - Special education
   - Bilingual education/ESL
   - Career and technical education
2. **High-need school differentials**: Additional $5,000-$15,000 for teachers in:
   - Schools with >75% free/reduced lunch students
   - Hard-to-staff rural schools
   - Schools with chronic teacher shortages
3. **Commitment bonuses**: Additional compensation for multi-year commitments

**Design considerations**:

- Differentials must be large enough to matter (small bonuses don't change behavior)
- Should not reduce base salaries for non-shortage areas
- Require demonstrated retention (not just recruitment)

**Evidence base**:

- Research on small bonuses shows minimal effects
- North Carolina's bonus program showed larger incentives more effective
- Dallas ISD's differentiated compensation improved outcomes

### Retirement System Modernization

**Goal**: Remove pension lock-in while providing adequate retirement security

**Mechanism**:

1. **Portable retirement options**: Offer defined-contribution plans (like 401k) as alternative to traditional pensions
2. **Reduced vesting periods**: Cut from 5-10 years to 3 years maximum
3. **Interstate portability**: Develop reciprocity agreements or portable benefits
4. **Maintain defined-benefit option**: Don't eliminate traditional pensions; provide choice

**Benefits**:

- Removes barrier to mid-career entry
- Enables geographic mobility to address shortages
- Reduces "trapped teacher" phenomenon
- May reduce long-term pension liabilities

### Comprehensive Benefits

**Goal**: Ensure teachers have security beyond salary

**Mechanism**:

1. **Affordable health insurance**: Cap teacher premium contributions at reasonable percentage of salary
2. **Mental health support**: Robust employee assistance programs
3. **Housing assistance**: Down payment support, housing vouchers in high-cost areas
4. **Student loan benefits**: Employer loan repayment contributions

## Loan Forgiveness and Financial Support

### Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness

**Goal**: Make PSLF actually work for teachers

**Current problems**:

- Complex requirements
- Service inconsistencies
- Loan servicer errors
- Limited awareness

**Reform mechanism**:

1. **Streamlined eligibility**: Automatic verification of qualifying employment
2. **Annual forgiveness tranches**: Forgive portion each year (not just after 10 years)
3. **Broader plan eligibility**: Include all repayment plans
4. **Administrative fixes**: Centralized servicing, automatic tracking

### Teacher-Specific Loan Forgiveness

**Goal**: Targeted forgiveness for teacher shortage areas

**Mechanism**:

1. **TEACH Grant reform**: Fix the grant-to-loan conversion trap
2. **Shortage-area forgiveness**: $20,000-$50,000 forgiveness for:
   - 5+ years in high-need schools
   - 5+ years in shortage subjects
3. **Immediate partial forgiveness**: Begin forgiveness after 2-3 years (not 5-10)
4. **State matching programs**: Federal incentives for state loan forgiveness

### Preparation Financial Support

**Goal**: Remove financial barriers during teacher preparation

**Mechanism**:

1. **Paid student teaching**: Compensate student teachers during clinical experience
2. **Residency stipends**: Living wage during year-long residencies ($25,000-$35,000)

**Implementation considerations**:

- Phased implementation (prioritize K-3, then expand)
- Requires additional teachers (workforce expansion)
- Requires additional classroom space
- Substantial cost ($10-20 billion annually for meaningful reduction)

**Evidence base**:

- Tennessee STAR study: Strong effects in K-3
- Effects larger for disadvantaged students
- California reduction showed mixed results (rapid implementation without quality control)

### Planning and Collaboration Time

**Goal**: Provide adequate time for lesson preparation, grading, and professional collaboration

**Mechanism**:

1. **Minimum planning time**: At least 45 minutes daily for individual planning
