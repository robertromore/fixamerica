# Education: Overview

## Executive Summary

American education faces a paradox: the nation spends more per student than almost any other developed country yet produces mediocre outcomes, with vast disparities by race, income, and geography. From early childhood through higher education, the system fails to deliver on its promise of equal opportunity. This domain analyzes the structural causes of educational dysfunction and proposes evidence-based reforms.

## Scope

This domain covers the full spectrum of formal education in America:

- **Early childhood**: Birth through age 5, including pre-K and childcare
- **K-12 education**: Public elementary and secondary schools
- **Higher education**: Community colleges, universities, and graduate programs
- **Vocational training**: Career and technical education, apprenticeships
- **Cross-cutting issues**: Funding, equity, governance, workforce, curriculum

## Key Facts

- **Spending**: $15,000+ per K-12 student annually (top 5 globally), yet 35% of 4th graders read below basic level
- **Achievement gaps**: Black and Hispanic students score 20-30 points below white students on NAEP assessments
- **Segregation**: Schools are more segregated now than in 1988; typical Black student attends school that is 48% Black
- **Teacher pay**: 20% wage penalty compared to similar professionals; shortages in 42 states
- **Student debt**: $1.77 trillion owed by 45 million borrowers
- **Early childhood**: Only 34% of 4-year-olds enrolled in public pre-K
- **Completion**: Only 62% of students complete bachelor's degrees within 6 years

## Key Questions

- Why does high spending produce mediocre and unequal outcomes?
- How can funding be restructured to reduce dependence on local property taxes?
- What would it take to achieve integrated, equitable schools?
- How can teaching become an attractive profession that draws top talent?
- What role should the federal government play in a decentralized system?
- How can higher education become affordable without sacrificing quality?
- What pathways beyond college deserve investment?

## Subtopics

### Foundational Systems

| Subtopic | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [K-12 Education](k-12-education/01-overview.md) | Public elementary and secondary education, funding, standards, outcomes |
| [Higher Education](higher-education/01-overview.md) | Colleges, universities, access, costs, completion |
| [Early Childhood](early-childhood/01-overview.md) | Pre-K, childcare, Head Start, birth-to-five programs |
| [Vocational Training](vocational-training/01-overview.md) | Career and technical education, apprenticeships, workforce development |

### Cross-Cutting Issues

| Subtopic | Description |

| [Education Governance](education-governance/01-overview.md) | School boards, state role, district structure |

## Core Tensions

### Local Control vs. Equity

The American tradition of local control produces 13,000+ districts with wildly varying resources. Property-tax funding reinforces segregation and inequality. Federal intervention is limited and politically contested.

### Access vs. Quality

Expanding access (to pre-K, college, choice programs) without quality controls can produce poor outcomes. Quality controls can become barriers to access for disadvantaged students.

### Standardization vs. Autonomy

Standards movements (Common Core, NCLB) aim for consistency but face backlash over centralization. Teacher autonomy is valued but inconsistent quality results.

### Public vs. Private Provision

School choice expands options but raises questions about accountability, segregation, and public funding for private purposes.

## What Success Looks Like

- **Universal pre-K** with quality standards and adequate workforce compensation
- **Equitable K-12 funding** not dependent on local property wealth
- **Integrated schools** reflecting community diversity
- **Teaching as a prestigious profession** with competitive pay and strong preparation
- **Affordable higher education** accessible to all qualified students
- **Robust vocational pathways** with earnings comparable to college degrees
- **Outcomes** not predictable by race, income, or ZIP code

## Relationship to Other Domains

Education intersects with multiple policy areas:

### Economic Domain

Education is deeply intertwined with economic outcomes at both individual and societal levels:

- **Economic Inequality**: Educational achievement gaps by income and race are both a symptom and cause of broader economic inequality. Unequal school funding perpetuates wealth concentration across generations. See [Inequality: Root Causes](../economic/inequality/04-root-causes.md) for analysis of education's role in perpetuating inequality.

- **Economic Mobility**: Education remains the primary mechanism for intergenerational mobility in America. Geographic variation in school quality creates "mobility deserts" where children have little chance of rising above their parents' economic status. See [Economic Mobility: Root Causes](../economic/economic-mobility/04-root-causes.md) for detailed analysis.

- **Student Debt and Economic Impact**: The $1.77 trillion student debt burden suppresses household formation, homeownership, small business creation, and retirement savings. This debt disproportionately burdens low-income graduates and graduates of color, exacerbating wealth gaps. See [Student Debt](student-debt/01-overview.md) and [Consumer Debt](../economic/consumer-debt/01-overview.md).

- **Workforce Development**: The alignment (or misalignment) between educational output and labor market needs affects productivity, wages, and economic competitiveness. See [Vocational Training](vocational-training/01-overview.md) and [Wages](../economic/wages/01-overview.md).

### Other Policy Domains

- **Healthcare** (`../healthcare/`): Workforce development, child development, school-based health services
- **Housing** (`../housing/`): School segregation follows residential patterns; exclusionary zoning limits access to quality schools
- **Justice** (`../justice/`): School-to-prison pipeline, discipline disparities, incarceration's effects on children
- **Labor** (`../labor/`): Workforce skills, teacher unions, labor market outcomes
- **Social** (`../social/`): Child poverty, safety net programs, early childhood supports
