# Early Childhood Education: History

## Early Foundations (Pre-1900)

### European Origins

Modern early childhood education traces its intellectual roots to European philosophers and educators:

**Key Figures**:

- **John Locke (1632-1704)**: Argued children are "blank slates" shaped by experience, emphasizing early environment's importance
- **Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)**: Advocated child-centered education respecting natural development
- **Johann Pestalozzi (1746-1827)**: Pioneered developmentally appropriate practice and learning through activity
- **Friedrich Froebel (1782-1852)**: Created the kindergarten ("children's garden") in Germany in 1837, emphasizing play-based learning

### First American Kindergartens

The first American kindergarten opened in 1856 in Watertown, Wisconsin, serving German immigrant children. The first English-language kindergarten opened in Boston in 1860.

By the 1870s, charity kindergartens emerged in urban areas serving poor children, framed as both education and social reform. Settlement houses like Hull House (Chicago, 1889) operated kindergartens as part of comprehensive services for immigrant families.

**Early Kindergarten Characteristics**:

- Focused on socialization and "civilizing" immigrant children
- Used Froebel's "gifts" (structured play materials)
- Operated part-day, typically 3 hours
- Staffed primarily by educated middle-class women

### Nursery Schools

The nursery school movement, originating in England, emphasized child development research and parent education. The first American nursery school opened at Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1919.

Unlike charity kindergartens serving the poor, nursery schools primarily served middle and upper-class families and functioned as laboratory schools for child development research.

## New Deal and World War II (1930s-1945)

### Depression-Era Programs

The Works Progress Administration (WPA) operated emergency nursery schools during the Great Depression, employing out-of-work teachers while providing childcare for families seeking employment. At their peak in 1934, WPA nursery schools served 75,000 children in 1,900 centers.

These programs represented the first substantial federal involvement in early childhood care and established precedents for:

- Federal funding of childcare
- Employment of early childhood workers
- Integration of health and nutrition services

### Lanham Act Childcare

World War II created massive demand for childcare as women entered the workforce to support war production. The Lanham Act (1940) authorized federal funding for childcare centers near defense industries.

**Lanham Act Program Statistics**:

- Peak enrollment: 130,000 children
- Centers operated: 3,102
- Federal investment: $51.9 million ($750 million in 2023 dollars)
- Hours: Extended day (some 24-hour care for shift workers)
- Services: Included hot meals, health care, and social services

The most famous Lanham Act centers, operated by Kaiser Shipyards in Portland, Oregon, set standards unmatched since:

- Architect-designed facilities
- Trained teachers with competitive salaries
- Hot meals (including take-home family dinners)
- Infirmary for mildly ill children
- Child development specialists on staff

When the war ended, federal funding was terminated despite protests from parents and communities. Most centers closed within months.

### Lasting Impact

The wartime experience demonstrated that:

- Quality childcare at scale was possible with adequate resources
- Government could successfully operate childcare programs
- Working mothers could be productive when childcare was available
- Children thrived in well-designed group settings

However, the postwar period saw a rapid return to the ideology of mother care. Federal support evaporated, and the "Rosie the Riveter" generation was pushed back into domesticity.

## Head Start and the War on Poverty (1965)

### Origins

Head Start emerged from the War on Poverty, launched by President Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Designed as a summer program to prepare poor children for school, Head Start opened in summer 1965 serving 561,000 children in its first eight weeks.

**Key Architects**:

- **Sargent Shriver**: Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, championed the idea
- **Dr. Robert Cooke**: Pediatrician who chaired the planning committee
- **Dr. Edward Zigler**: Developmental psychologist who shaped the program model

### Comprehensive Design

Head Start was revolutionary in its comprehensive approach, reflecting the understanding that poverty affects all aspects of child development:

**Core Components**:

1. **Education**: Developmentally appropriate curriculum and school readiness
2. **Health**: Medical and dental screenings, immunizations, treatment referrals
3. **Nutrition**: Daily meals meeting nutritional requirements
4. **Parent Involvement**: Parents as partners and decision-makers
5. **Social Services**: Family support and community resource connections
6. **Mental Health**: Consultation and support for emotional development

### Community Action Model

Head Start embodied the "maximum feasible participation" philosophy of the Community Action Program. Local programs were required to include parents in governance, hire community members as staff, and respond to local needs.

This model created:

- Employment pathways for low-income parents
- Parent leadership development
- Community ownership of programs
- Flexibility to address local contexts

### Early Evaluation and Controversy

Early evaluations produced mixed results, with the "Westinghouse Report" (1969) finding that cognitive gains "faded out" by third grade. This finding, though methodologically contested, created lasting skepticism about Head Start's effectiveness.

Defenders argued that:

- The study occurred when the program was only three years old
- Gains in health, family functioning, and non-cognitive skills were not measured
- Comparison schools were also improving during this period
- Summer-only programs (most of the sample) could not be expected to produce lasting effects

## The Childcare Debate (1970s)

### Comprehensive Child Development Act (1971)

The most significant near-miss in American childcare policy was the Comprehensive Child Development Act of 1971, which passed both houses of Congress with bipartisan support.

**The Bill Would Have**:

- Created a national childcare system
- Provided free care for poor families, sliding-scale fees for others
- Established federal quality standards
- Authorized $2 billion in first-year funding
- Served an estimated 2.2 million children

President Richard Nixon vetoed the bill in December 1971, issuing one of the most ideologically charged veto messages in presidential history.

### Nixon's Veto Message

Nixon's veto rationale included:

- Childcare would weaken the family and "commit the vast moral authority of the National Government to the side of communal approaches to child rearing"
- Concern about federal intrusion into family life
- Fiscal responsibility arguments
- Administrative concerns about delivering services

The veto message, drafted by Patrick Buchanan, explicitly invoked Cold War anti-communism, comparing the bill to Soviet collective childcare.

### Lasting Impact

The 1971 veto established lasting political dynamics:

- Framed childcare as a partisan wedge issue
- Created ideological association between public childcare and socialism
- Made subsequent reform efforts more difficult
- Established pattern of failed national childcare initiatives

No comparable comprehensive childcare legislation has come as close to passage in the 50+ years since.

## Incremental Development (1980s-2000s)

### Child Care and Development Block Grant (1990)

After years of advocacy, Congress passed the Child Care and Development Block Grant in 1990, the first significant federal childcare legislation since Head Start.

**CCDBG Key Features**:

- Block grants to states for childcare subsidies
- Focus on families transitioning from welfare to work
- State flexibility in eligibility, rates, and administration
- Minimal federal quality requirements

While an important step, CCDBG was designed primarily as workforce support rather than child development policy, limiting its scope and funding.

### Welfare Reform and Childcare (1996)

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (1996) restructured welfare around work requirements, increasing demand for childcare:

- Required welfare recipients to work or participate in work activities
- Consolidated childcare funding streams
- Increased CCDBG funding from $1 billion to $3.5 billion
- Focused on childcare as employment support, not child development

### State Pre-K Expansion

Beginning in the 1990s, states increasingly developed their own pre-K programs:

**Milestone States**:

- **Georgia (1995)**: First universal (income-eligible) pre-K funded by lottery
- **Oklahoma (1998)**: Universal pre-K through public schools
- **Florida (2005)**: Voter-approved constitutional amendment for universal pre-K

By 2000, 40 states operated some form of state pre-K program, though with widely varying quality and access.

## The Science Revolution (1990s-2000s)

### Brain Development Research

Advances in neuroscience transformed understanding of early childhood:

**Key Findings**:

- Newborns have approximately 100 billion neurons, but limited connections
- 90% of brain growth occurs before age five
- One million new neural connections form per second in early years
- Early experiences literally shape brain architecture
- "Serve and return" interactions build neural pathways
- Toxic stress damages developing brain systems

The National Academy of Sciences report *From Neurons to Neighborhoods* (2000) synthesized this research, concluding that "the question is not whether early experience matters, but rather how early experiences shape individual development."

### Long-Term Outcome Studies

Landmark studies demonstrated lasting impacts of early intervention:

**Perry Preschool Project** (Ypsilanti, Michigan, 1962-1967):

- Random assignment of 123 African-American children from low-income families
- High-quality preschool program with home visits
- Follow-up through age 40

**Age 40 Outcomes (Perry Preschool vs. Control)**:

| Outcome | Program | Control |
|---------|---------|---------|
| High school graduation | 77% | 60% |
| Arrested 5+ times | 36% | 55% |
| Earned $20K+/year | 60% | 40% |
| Homeownership | 37% | 28% |
| Received welfare as adult | 59% | 80% |

Return on investment: $7-16 for every $1 invested

**Abecedarian Project** (Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 1972-1977):

- Full-day, year-round care from infancy through age 5
- Random assignment of 111 children from low-income families
- Follow-up through age 30

**Age 30 Outcomes (Abecedarian vs. Control)**:

| Outcome | Program | Control |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Bachelor's degree | 23% | 6% |
| Teen parent | 26% | 45% |
| Full-time employment | 75% | 53% |
| Depression diagnosis | 26% | 48% |

These studies provided rigorous evidence for early childhood investment, though critics noted the programs were more intensive and expensive than typical childcare.

## Universal Pre-K Movement (2000s-Present)

### Obama Administration

The Obama administration made early childhood a policy priority:

**Initiatives**:

- Proposed Preschool for All (2013): $75 billion over 10 years for universal pre-K
- Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge grants
- Preschool Development Grants to states
- Expanded Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships
- Increased Head Start funding

While Congress blocked comprehensive legislation, executive actions expanded access incrementally.

### State Momentum

States continued expanding pre-K:

**Notable Expansions (2010s-2020s)**:

- New York City: Universal pre-K for all 4-year-olds (2014), expanded to 3-year-olds (2017)
- California: Transitional Kindergarten expansion toward universality
- Colorado: Voter-approved universal pre-K (2022)
- New Mexico: Voter-approved constitutional amendment for early childhood (2022)

### Build Back Better and Its Failure

The most significant recent attempt at federal early childhood investment was the Build Back Better Act (2021), which would have:

- Established universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds
- Limited family childcare costs to 7% of income
- Raised early childhood wages toward parity with K-12
- Invested $400 billion over 10 years

The bill passed the House but failed in the Senate when Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) refused to support it, citing cost concerns and preference for means-testing.

### COVID-19 Disruption

The pandemic devastated the early childhood sector:

- One-third of childcare centers closed temporarily
- 10% of centers closed permanently
- 100,000+ childcare workers left the field
- Parents (especially mothers) dropped out of the workforce

Emergency relief ($52 billion through CARES Act, ARPA) prevented complete collapse but revealed the sector's fragility.
