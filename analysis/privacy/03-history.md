# Privacy: History

## Origins

### Constitutional Foundation

The Fourth Amendment, ratified in 1791, was a direct response to British colonial practices:

| British Practice | Colonial Grievance | Fourth Amendment Response |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| General warrants | No specificity required | Warrants must describe place, persons, things |
| Writs of assistance | Unlimited search authority | Prohibition on unreasonable searches |
| Fishing expeditions | No probable cause needed | Probable cause requirement |

The Founders understood privacy as essential to liberty but conceived it primarily in terms of physical spaces and tangible papers. They could not have anticipated digital communications, electronic surveillance, or the commodification of personal information.

### Early Privacy Concepts

**1890: Warren and Brandeis**

Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis published "The Right to Privacy" in the Harvard Law Review, responding to invasive journalism enabled by portable cameras:

> "The intensity and complexity of life... have rendered necessary some retreat from the world... solitude and privacy have become more essential to the individual."

This article established privacy as "the right to be let alone" and influenced tort law, though it had limited constitutional impact.

**Early 20th Century Wiretapping**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1890s | Telephone wiretapping begins |
| 1928 | *Olmstead v. United States*: No Fourth Amendment protection for wiretaps (no physical trespass) |
| 1934 | Federal Communications Act Section 605 restricts interception/divulgence (limited enforcement) |
| 1967 | *Katz v. United States*: Overrules *Olmstead*, establishes "reasonable expectation of privacy" |
| 1968 | Title III of Omnibus Crime Control Act creates statutory wiretap framework |

## Key Turning Points

### 1967: Katz v. United States

**The Transformation:**

- FBI bugged public phone booth to record bookie's calls
- Supreme Court rejected physical trespass requirement
- Justice Harlan's concurrence: Privacy exists where person has "reasonable expectation" that society recognizes as reasonable
- This two-part test became constitutional standard

**Significance:** Extended Fourth Amendment to electronic surveillance, but also created framework that courts would later use to deny privacy in data shared with third parties.

### 1976-1979: Third-Party Doctrine

**Miller (1976):** Bank records disclosed to bank, so no Fourth Amendment protection

**Smith v. Maryland (1979):** Phone numbers dialed given to phone company, so no privacy expectation

**Impact:** These cases created doctrine that any information shared with third parties loses constitutional protection—a rule that made sense for limited 1970s disclosures but devastates privacy in the digital age.

### 1978: Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)

| Element | Original FISA (1978) | Post-9/11 Changes |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Targets | Foreign powers, agents | Expanded via "lone wolf" provision |
| Court | FISA Court (secret) | Same, expanded jurisdiction |
| Standards | Foreign intelligence "the purpose" | "Significant purpose" (PATRIOT Act) |
| Scope | Targeted surveillance | Section 215 business records; Section 702 programmatic collection (2008) |

### 2001: September 11 and USA PATRIOT Act

**Immediate Changes:**

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Section 215 | "Any tangible things" accessible with FISA order |
| Section 206 | Roving wiretaps |
| Section 505 | Expanded National Security Letters |
| "Wall" removal | Intelligence-criminal info sharing |

**Long-term Impact:**

- Surveillance normalized as "necessary for security"
- Constitutional concerns dismissed as naive
- Massive infrastructure built
- Secrecy prevented public debate

### 2013: Snowden Revelations

**What We Learned:**

| Program | Description | Scale |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| PRISM | Compelled collection from tech companies (not direct system access) | Major platforms |
| Upstream | Internet backbone interception | Vast |
| Phone metadata | Bulk call detail records from major carriers | Millions of Americans |
| XKEYSCORE | Search tool for collected data | Global reach |
| Foreign partnerships | Five Eyes sharing arrangements | Potential domestic limit concerns |

**Public Response:**

- Brief public outrage
- Some congressional hearings
- Limited reforms (USA FREEDOM Act 2015)
- Surveillance infrastructure largely intact
- Tech companies adopted encryption (partially)

### 2018: Carpenter v. United States

**The Case:**

- FBI obtained 127 days of cell site location data without warrant
- Tracked robbery suspect's movements
- Supreme Court: This requires a warrant (5-4)

**The Limitation:**

- Decision explicitly narrow
- Did not overrule third-party doctrine generally
- Only applied to "detailed, encyclopedic, and effortlessly compiled" location data
- Left most data types unprotected

## Lessons from the Past

### Lesson 1: Technology Outpaces Law

Every technological advancement creates new privacy vulnerabilities that law takes decades to address—if ever:

| Technology | Years Before Legal Protection |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Telephone wiretapping | 39 years (1928-1967) |
| Electronic communications | Still inadequate (ECPA 1986) |
| Cell phone location | 32+ years (partial: *Carpenter* 2018) |
| Internet tracking | Still unprotected (federal) |
| Biometrics | Mostly unprotected |
| AI inference | Unprotected |

### Lesson 2: "Security" Justifies Expansion

Every crisis produces surveillance expansion that rarely contracts:

| Crisis | Expansion | Rollback |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| WWI/Red Scare | Palmer Raids, surveillance | Partial (1920s) |
| WWII | Japanese internment, censorship | Partial |
| Cold War | COINTELPRO, mass surveillance | Church Committee reforms (partial) |
| 9/11 | PATRIOT Act, mass collection | Minimal (USA FREEDOM Act) |

### Lesson 3: Secret Surveillance Breeds Abuse

| Era | Secret Program | Abuse Revealed |
|-----|---------------|----------------|
| 1960s-70s | COINTELPRO | Targeted civil rights, antiwar leaders |
| 1970s | NSA domestic surveillance | Mass collection of Americans |
| 2000s | Warrantless wiretapping | Bypassed FISA |
| 2010s | Section 702 | Backdoor searches, compliance failures |

### Lesson 4: Reform Is Incremental and Insufficient

| Reform | Promise | Reality |
|--------|---------|---------|
| FISA (1978) | Court oversight of surveillance | High approval rate (per FISA Court annual reports, 1979-2023) |
| USA FREEDOM Act (2015) | End bulk collection | Narrow; other programs continued |
| State privacy laws | Protect consumers | Patchwork, often business-friendly |

### Lesson 5: Corporate and Government Surveillance Converge

| Era | Relationship |
|-----|--------------|
| Cold War | Telecoms cooperated with surveillance |
| 1970s | Some resistance after Church Committee |
| Post-2001 | Full cooperation (PRISM, etc.) |
| Post-Snowden | Some encryption, but cooperation continues |
| 2020s | Government buys commercial data |
