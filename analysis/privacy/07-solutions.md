| **Transparency** | People should know what happens to their data |
| **Accountability** | Collectors responsible for harms |
| **Security** | Data must be protected |
| **Proportionality** | Surveillance proportional to legitimate need |

### Criteria for Evaluating Solutions

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Effectiveness** | Does it actually protect privacy? |
