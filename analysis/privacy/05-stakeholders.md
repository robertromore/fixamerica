# Privacy: Stakeholders

## Who Benefits from the Status Quo

### Technology Platforms

*Ad revenue figures are approximate, based on company reports (2023).*

| Company | Ad Revenue (2023, approx.) | Interest in Status Quo |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Alphabet (Google)** | ~$280 billion | Surveillance advertising model |
| **Meta** | ~$130 billion | Behavioral targeting |
| **Amazon** | ~$40 billion | Purchase data, Alexa data |
| **Microsoft** | ~$12 billion | LinkedIn data, enterprise data |
| **Apple** | Lower direct | Privacy as marketing, but App Store data |

**What They Stand to Lose:**

- Restrictions on data collection would fundamentally change business models
- Opt-in consent would dramatically reduce data available
- Data minimization would limit future AI training
- Private enforcement would create litigation risk

### Data Broker Industry

| Company | Business Model | Stakes |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| **Acxiom** | Marketing data aggregation | Entire business threatened |
| **Experian** | Credit + marketing data | Significant revenue at risk |
| **Oracle** | Digital advertising data (exited ad business 2024) | Was major business line |
| **LexisNexis Risk** | Background checks, risk data | Core business |
| **CoreLogic** | Property data | Lucrative data licensing |

**What They Would Lose:**

- Consent requirements would cut supply
- Deletion rights would reduce inventory
- Accuracy requirements would increase costs
- Registration requirements would add compliance burden

### Telecommunications Industry

*Carrier data revenue is difficult to isolate; advertising business lines have shifted significantly (Verizon divested Yahoo/AOL to Apollo in 2021).*

| Company | Data Collection | Interest |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Verizon** | Location, browsing, usage | Data monetization (reduced after ad-tech divestitures) |
| **AT&T** | Same + advertising | Data and advertising interests |
| **T-Mobile** | Same | Growing data business |
| **Comcast** | Browsing, viewing | Advertising integration |

### Advertising Industry

*Revenue figures are approximate global estimates (2023); exact figures vary by source.*

| Sector | Revenue (global, 2023, approx.) | Privacy Dependence |
|--------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Digital advertising | ~$600 billion | Targeting requires data |
| Programmatic ads | ~$150 billion | Real-time bidding needs profiles |
| Data management platforms | Billions | Entirely data-dependent |

### Intelligence Community

| **FBI** | Domestic investigations | Section 702 queries, NSLs |
| **CIA** | Foreign intelligence | Commercial data purchases |
| **DHS** | Immigration, security | Location data purchases |

**What They Would Lose:**

- Warrant requirements would slow investigations
- Data broker restrictions would cut supply
- Encryption mandates would complicate access
- Oversight requirements would expose methods

### Law Enforcement

| Level | Interest | Data Sources Used |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Federal** | Investigations | All commercial, tech company |
| **State** | Criminal enforcement | License plates, facial recognition |
