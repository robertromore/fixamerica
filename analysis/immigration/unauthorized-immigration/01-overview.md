# Unauthorized Immigration: Overview

## Executive Summary

Approximately 10-11 million unauthorized immigrants live in the United States, comprising about 3% of the total population and 5% of the labor force. This population includes long-term residents with deep community ties, DACA recipients, TPS holders whose status has lapsed, visa overstays, and recent border crossers. The unauthorized population represents a policy challenge with no politically viable enforcement-only solution, requiring a comprehensive approach addressing both the existing population and future flows.

- **Categories**: Different pathways to unauthorized status
- **Economic Role**: Labor force participation and contributions
- **Legal Limbo**: Living without status in American society
- **Policy Options**: Enforcement, legalization, and hybrid approaches
- **Historical Precedent**: Previous legalization programs and their outcomes
