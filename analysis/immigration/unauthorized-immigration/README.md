# Unauthorized Immigration: Overview

Approximately 10-11 million unauthorized immigrants live in the United States, comprising about 3% of the total population and 5% of the labor force. This population includes long-term residents with deep community ties, DACA recipients, TPS holders whose status has lapsed, visa overstays, and recent border crossers. The unauthorized population represents a policy challenge with no politically viable enforcement-only solution, requiring a comprehensive approach addressing both the existing population and future flows.
