# Immigration Enforcement: Current State

## Overview

Interior immigration enforcement operates through ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which conducts arrests, manages detention, and executes removals. Current operations are shaped by administration priorities, court backlogs, detention capacity, and the practical impossibility of enforcing against the entire unauthorized population. Enforcement intensity and targeting vary significantly by administration.
