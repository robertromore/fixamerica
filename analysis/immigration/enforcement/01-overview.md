# Immigration Enforcement: Overview

## Executive Summary

Immigration enforcement encompasses the policies, agencies, and operations that identify, apprehend, detain, and remove individuals who violate immigration laws. The primary enforcement agency is Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), operating through Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) for interior enforcement and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) for criminal investigations. Enforcement remains highly contentious, with debates about priorities, tactics, community impact, due process, and the balance between security and civil liberties.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Interior enforcement**: Operations within the US
- **ICE operations**: ERO and HSI activities
- **Deportation/removal**: Formal and informal processes
- **Worksite enforcement**: Employer and employee targeting
- **Criminal prosecution**: Immigration crimes
- **Cooperation programs**: 287(g), Secure Communities, state/local
