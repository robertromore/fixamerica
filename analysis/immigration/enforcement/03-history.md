# Immigration Enforcement: History

## Overview

Immigration enforcement evolved from minimal interior presence to the massive apparatus of today, shaped by the 1986 IRCA employer sanctions, the 1996 enforcement build-up, post-9/11 restructuring creating DHS and ICE, and ongoing debates about enforcement intensity and priorities. Each era reflected different policy priorities and political pressures.
