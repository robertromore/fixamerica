# Family-Based Immigration: Overview

## Executive Summary

Family-based immigration, the largest category of legal immigration to the United States, accounts for approximately two-thirds of all green cards issued annually. With over 4 million people in family visa backlogs—some waiting 20+ years—the system fails to achieve its core purpose of family reunification within reasonable timeframes. Per-country caps, outdated numerical limits, and complex categories create extraordinary delays that separate families for decades.

## Scope of This Analysis

This subtopic examines:

- **Immediate relatives**: Spouses, minor children, parents of citizens
- **Family preferences**: Sponsored relatives in capped categories
- **Backlogs**: Multi-decade waits for certain countries/categories
- **K and V visas**: Fiancé(e) and derivative visas
- **Family unity**: Policies affecting mixed-status families
- **Reform proposals**: Backlog relief, category changes
