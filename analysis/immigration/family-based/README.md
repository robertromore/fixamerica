# Family-Based Immigration: Overview

Family-based immigration, the largest category of legal immigration to the United States, accounts for approximately two-thirds of all green cards issued annually. With over 4 million people in family visa backlogs—some waiting 20+ years—the system fails to achieve its core purpose of family reunification within reasonable timeframes. Per-country caps, outdated numerical limits, and complex categories create extraordinary delays that separate families for decades.
