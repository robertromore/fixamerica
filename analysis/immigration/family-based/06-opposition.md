# Family-Based Immigration: Opposition

## Overview of Opposition

Opposition to family-based immigration ranges from proposals to limit categories to nuclear families to calls for eliminating family preferences entirely in favor of merit-based selection. The "chain migration" framing has been particularly effective in shaping public debate.
