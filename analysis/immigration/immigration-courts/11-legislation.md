## Constitutional Considerations

### Congressional Authority

| Basis | Application |
|-------|-------------|

| **Naturalization Clause** | Immigration regulation |
| **Necessary and Proper** | Court structure |
| **Spending Power** | Fund representation |

### Constitutional Constraints

| Provision | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Due Process** | Fair procedures required |
| **Appointments** | Principal/inferior officers |
| **Separation of Powers** | Court independence |
| **Article III** | Appellate review preserved |

### Key Precedents

| Case | Holding |
|------|---------|
| **Crowell v. Benson** | Article I tribunals valid |
