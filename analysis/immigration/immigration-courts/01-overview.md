# Immigration Courts: Overview

## Executive Summary

The immigration court system, operated by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) within the Department of Justice, faces a crisis of massive backlogs, inadequate resources, judicial independence concerns, and fundamental due process problems. With over 3 million pending cases, average wait times exceeding 4 years, and no right to appointed counsel, the system fails to provide timely, fair adjudication. Fundamental reform—including potential Article I court status—is necessary to restore legitimacy and functionality.
