# Immigration: Overview

American immigration policy is broken across virtually every dimension. Legal immigration backlogs stretch decades, the asylum system is overwhelmed, border enforcement is both ineffective and inhumane, millions of unauthorized immigrants live in legal limbo, and immigration courts face crushing caseloads without basic due process protections. Meanwhile, the economic and demographic case for immigration remains strong—immigration drives innovation, fills labor shortages, and supports fiscal sustainability. Comprehensive reform requires addressing legal pathways, enforcement, unauthorized populations, and integration simultaneously, but partisan polarization has blocked action for decades.
