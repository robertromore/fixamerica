# Immigration Detention: Overview

The United States operates the world's largest immigration detention system, holding an average of 25,000-40,000 people daily at an annual cost exceeding $3 billion. Primarily managed by private prison corporations, the system faces persistent criticism for inadequate medical care, conditions of confinement, lack of due process, and treatment of vulnerable populations including asylum seekers, families, and individuals with mental health conditions. Reform efforts focus on reducing reliance on detention, improving conditions, and expanding alternatives.
