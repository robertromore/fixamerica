# Immigration: Root Causes

## Overview

The dysfunction of American immigration policy stems from interconnected structural, political, economic, and international factors. The system was designed for a different era and has not been comprehensively updated since 1965/1996, while demand has fundamentally changed. Understanding these root causes reveals why incremental reforms fail and comprehensive reform faces persistent barriers.

## Structural Design Flaws

### Outdated Architecture

| Element | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| **1965 framework** | Designed for 300,000/year, processes 1 million+ |
| **Family preference system** | Created for European reunification, now global |
| **Per-country limits** | Same limit for China/India as Iceland |
| **Employment categories** | Not responsive to labor market |
| **Asylum system** | Built for Cold War defectors |

### Per-Country Limits

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Equal limits regardless of size** | 7% cap per country |
| **Demand mismatch** | India/China face decades-long waits |
| **Arbitrary outcomes** | Similar skills, vastly different waits |
| **Family separation** | Extended separation by nationality |
| **Brain waste** | Skilled workers in limbo |

### Category Rigidity

| Category | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **Family preference** | Fixed quotas don't match demand |
| **Employment-based** | Can't respond to economy |
| **Diversity** | Arbitrary lottery system |
| **Humanitarian** | Insufficient for global displacement |
| **Temporary work** | Inadequate, complex categories |

## Congressional Dysfunction

### Partisan Polarization

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|

| **Primary voters** | Reward ideological purity |
| **Media incentives** | Conflict over compromise |
| **Interest group pressure** | Both sides have veto players |
| **Issue framing** | Immigration as culture war |

### Structural Barriers

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Senate filibuster** | 60-vote threshold |
| **House discharge** | Majority can't force votes |

| **Comprehensive vs. piecemeal** | All-or-nothing traps |

### Historical Failures

## Executive Branch Limits

### Structural Constraints

## Economic Drivers
