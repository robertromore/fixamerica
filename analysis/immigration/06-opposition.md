# Immigration: Opposition Analysis

## Overview

Immigration reform faces opposition from multiple directions—restrictionists who want less immigration, some immigrant advocates who oppose enforcement trade-offs, business interests that resist verification requirements, and political actors who benefit from the issue remaining unresolved. Understanding opposition dynamics explains why comprehensive reform has failed repeatedly despite majority support.
