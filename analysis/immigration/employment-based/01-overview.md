# Employment-Based Immigration: Overview

## Executive Summary

Employment-based immigration encompasses temporary work visas (H-1B, L-1, O-1), permanent residence categories (EB-1 through EB-5), and the labor certification process. With only 140,000 green cards available annually, multi-year backlogs, and contentious debates over temporary worker programs, the employment-based system fails to meet economic needs while facing criticism from both those seeking more skilled workers and those concerned about wage depression.

## Scope of This Analysis

This subtopic examines:

- **Temporary work visas**: H-1B, L-1, O-1, and other categories
- **Permanent immigration**: EB categories and green card backlog
- **Labor certification**: PERM process and requirements
- **Employer sponsorship**: Requirements and procedures
- **Economic debates**: Impact on wages, jobs, and competitiveness
- **Reform proposals**: H-1B changes, green card expansion, STEM exemptions
