# Immigration: History

## Overview

American immigration policy has swung between openness and restriction throughout history, shaped by economic needs, racial attitudes, geopolitical events, and demographic anxieties. The current system's architecture was largely established in 1965, with significant enforcement additions in 1986 and 1996. Understanding this history reveals how today's dysfunction emerged from accumulated policy choices.
