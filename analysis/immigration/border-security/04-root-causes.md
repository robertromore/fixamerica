# Border Security: Root Causes

## Overview

Border security challenges stem from structural factors including global migration pressures, legal framework constraints, resource limitations, operational tensions, and political dynamics that prevent sustainable policy. Understanding these root causes is essential for developing effective solutions beyond the recurring cycle of crisis and response.

## Operational Tensions

### Security vs. Processing

| Tension | Impact |

| **Per-migrant fee** | $3,000-$15,000 |
| **Annual revenue** | $10+ billion |
| **Cartel involvement** | Organized crime |
| **Corruption** | Government officials |

### Demand-Side Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **No legal pathway** | Smuggling only option |

## Systemic Failures

### Immigration System Design

| Failure | Impact |

| **Third country processing** | Not developed |

## Feedback Loops

### Success Breeds Attempts

```
Successful crossing → Information shared
        ↓                    ↓
More attempts ← Family brings others ← Established community
```

### Enforcement Arms Race

```
Border hardening → Smuggling sophistication
        ↓                    ↓
More hardening ← Continued migration ← Higher fees
```

### Crisis-Response Cycle

```
Surge occurs → Crisis response
      ↓              ↓
Temporary relief ← Surge subsides ← Normal operations → New surge
```

## Root Cause Interactions

### Reinforcing Dynamics

| Dynamic | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Push + pull** | Both factors strong |
| **Legal + physical** | No pathway + border |
| **Political + operational** | No solution allowed |
| **Criminal + demand** | Smuggling thrives |

### Why Solutions Fail

| Proposed Solution | Why It Fails |
|-------------------|--------------|
| **More barriers** | Migration shifts, smuggling adapts |
| **More agents** | Processing burden continues |
| **Harsher deterrence** | Legal constraints, humanitarian |
| **Asylum restrictions** | Court challenges |
| **Mass deportation** | Capacity, cost, legal limits |
