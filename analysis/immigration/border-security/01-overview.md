# Border Security: Overview

## Executive Summary

Border security encompasses the infrastructure, personnel, technology, and policies that manage the flow of people and goods across US land and maritime borders. The US-Mexico border has been the primary focus of policy debates, with record encounters in recent years, overwhelmed processing capacity, and ongoing tension between security imperatives and humanitarian obligations. The current system struggles to manage irregular migration while facilitating legitimate travel and trade.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Land borders**: US-Mexico (1,954 miles), US-Canada (5,525 miles)
- **Ports of entry**: Land, air, and sea ports
- **Border Patrol operations**: Between ports of entry
- **Infrastructure**: Barriers, technology, facilities
- **Processing**: Apprehension, screening, determination
- **Regional cooperation**: Mexico, Central America, Caribbean
