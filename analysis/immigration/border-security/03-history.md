# Border Security: History

## Overview

US border security evolved from minimal presence in the 19th century, through the creation of the Border Patrol in 1924, to massive expansion after 9/11 and ongoing debates about barriers, technology, and enforcement strategies. Each era responded to different migration patterns and security concerns, creating today's complex system.

## Early History (Pre-1924)

### Minimal Border Presence

| **Pre-1882** | Open border, no enforcement |
| **1882-1891** | Chinese exclusion, customs focus |
