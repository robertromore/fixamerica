# Legal Immigration: Overview

## Executive Summary

Legal immigration is the foundation of America's immigration system, governing how people can permanently settle in the United States through family relationships, employment, diversity lottery, and humanitarian programs. The system is characterized by severe backlogs, outdated numerical limits set in 1990, per-country caps that create decades-long waits for applicants from high-demand countries, and complexity that requires legal assistance for most applicants.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Family-sponsored immigration**: Immediate relatives and preference categories
- **Employment-based immigration**: Worker categories and labor certification
- **Diversity Visa Program**: Lottery-based immigration
- **Special immigrant categories**: Religious workers, investors, translators
- **Naturalization**: The path from green card to citizenship
- **Green card processing**: Adjustment of status and consular processing

## Scale of the Challenge

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Annual green cards issued** | ~1 million | Stable |
| **Family-based backlog** | 4+ million | Growing |
| **Employment-based backlog** | 1+ million | Growing |
| **Average wait (India EB-2)** | 90+ years | Increasing |
| **Average wait (Mexico F2A)** | 20+ years | Increasing |
| **USCIS processing backlog** | 8+ million cases | Growing |
| **Naturalization applications** | 900,000+ annually | Stable |

## Key Challenges

### Outdated Numerical Limits

| Category | Annual Limit | Set In | Problem |
|----------|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Family-sponsored** | 226,000 | 1990 | Doesn't meet demand |
| **Employment-based** | 140,000 | 1990 | Far below labor needs |
| **Per-country cap** | 7% | 1965 | Creates massive disparities |
| **Diversity Visa** | 55,000 | 1990 | Controversial allocation |

### Per-Country Caps Create Extreme Disparities

| Country | Category | Wait Time | vs. Small Country |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **India** | EB-2 | 90+ years | vs. 1-2 years |
| **India** | EB-3 | 50+ years | vs. 1-2 years |
| **China** | EB-2 | 10+ years | vs. 1-2 years |
| **Mexico** | F2A | 20+ years | vs. 2-3 years |
| **Philippines** | F4 | 25+ years | vs. 10+ years |

### Processing Inefficiency

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **USCIS backlogs** | 8+ million pending cases |
| **Paper-based systems** | Slow processing |
| **Fee increases** | Accessibility barriers |
| **RFE rate** | 30-40% of applications |
| **Adjudication inconsistency** | Unpredictable outcomes |

## Current Framework

| **US families** | Family reunification | Support expansion |
| **Employers** | Worker access | Support employment reform |
| **Immigration lawyers** | Client service, system function | Support modernization |
| **USCIS** | Manageable workload | Mixed |

## Reform Priorities

### Immediate Actions

1. Recapture unused visas from previous years
2. Treat spouses/minor children of LPRs as immediate relatives
3. Expand USCIS processing capacity
4. Implement modern technology systems

### Structural Reforms

1. Eliminate or raise per-country caps
2. Increase employment-based numbers
