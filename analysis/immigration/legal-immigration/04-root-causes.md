# Legal Immigration: Root Causes

## Overview

The dysfunction in legal immigration stems from structural features frozen in 1990 legislation, political dynamics that prevent updates, a funding model that creates perverse incentives, and administrative capacity that cannot meet demand. These root causes interact to produce backlogs, inefficiency, and unfairness that have accumulated over decades.

## Statutory Limitations

### Frozen Numerical Caps

| Problem | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **1990 numbers** | Limits set 35 years ago | Cannot meet modern demand |
| **No inflation adjustment** | Static caps regardless of growth | Relative decline |
| **No labor market link** | Numbers don't track economy | Skill shortages |
| **No recapture** | Unused visas lost forever | Wasted capacity |

### Per-Country Caps

| Feature | Design | Problem |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **7% limit** | Equal per country | Ignores population differences |
| **Applies to demand** | Not supply | High-demand countries disadvantaged |
| **Historical intent** | Prevent domination | Creates discrimination |
| **Mathematical result** | India 7% vs. Iceland 7% | Absurd disparities |

### Category Rigidity

| Issue | Description | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Fixed percentages** | Categories get set share | Cannot shift to need |
| **No spillover efficiency** | Limited visa movement | Underutilization |
| **Binary categories** | Family or employment | Mixed cases don't fit |
| **Definition constraints** | Narrow eligibility | Arbitrary exclusions |

## Political Dynamics

### Congressional Paralysis

| Factor | Mechanism | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Partisan polarization** | Immigration as wedge issue | No compromise possible |
| **Comprehensive requirement** | All-or-nothing approach | Repeated failure |
| **Electoral incentives** | Base mobilization > policy | Posturing over progress |
| **Filibuster** | 60-vote requirement | Blocks majority support |

### Interest Group Gridlock

| Group | Priority | Blocks |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Business** | More employment visas | Labor protections |
| **Labor** | Worker protections | Visa increases |
| **Restrictionists** | Reduce numbers | Any expansion |
| **Advocates** | Legalization, family | Enforcement |

### Symbolic Politics

| Dynamic | Example | Impact |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Crisis focus** | Border dominates debate | Legal system ignored |
| **Emotional framing** | "Amnesty" vs. "family unity" | Policy reduced to slogans |
| **Electoral cycles** | Election-year demagoguery | Prevents rational debate |
| **Media coverage** | Sensational stories | Distorts understanding |

## Funding Model Failures

### Fee-Based System

| Feature | Problem | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **97% fee-funded** | Revenue depends on applications | Boom/bust cycles |
| **No general appropriations** | Must be self-sustaining | Cannot invest in capacity |
| **Fee increases** | $1,000+ for green card | Accessibility barriers |
| **Cross-subsidization** | Some forms subsidize others | Market distortion |

### Revenue Volatility

| Period | Application Volume | USCIS Impact |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **2008-2009** | Down 30% (recession) | Furloughs, layoffs |
| **2017-2020** | Down (policy changes) | Budget crisis |
| **2020-2021** | Down (COVID) | Severe shortfall |
| **Post-COVID** | Surge | Backlog explosion |

### Perverse Incentives

| Incentive | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| **Maximize revenue** | Complexity increases fees |
| **No efficiency mandate** | No penalty for delays |
| **Premium processing** | Fast service costs extra |
| **Denial consequences** | Lost fees, no refunds |

## Administrative Capacity

| **Management instability** | Political appointee turnover | Shifting priorities |

### System Architecture

| Problem | Description | Effect |
|---------|-------------|--------|

| **Legacy technology** | 1990s infrastructure | Cannot scale |

### Adjudication Quality

| Issue | Cause | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Inconsistency** | Subjective standards | Different outcomes for similar cases |
| **RFE overuse** | Risk aversion | Adds months to processing |
| **Denial rates** | Policy pressure | Discourages applications |
| **Appeals backlog** | Insufficient capacity | Delayed resolution |

## Legal Framework Complexity

### Statutory Complexity

| Feature | Description | Problem |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Multiple laws** | INA + amendments + other statutes | Fragmented authority |
| **Layered requirements** | Different rules by category | Extreme complexity |

| **Multiple agencies** | USCIS, DOL, DOS | Coordination failures |
| **Form proliferation** | Dozens of forms | Applicant confusion |
| **Documentation requirements** | Extensive evidence needed | Costly to prepare |
| **Changing rules** | Administration shifts | Uncertainty |

### Legal Representation

| Issue | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Complexity requires lawyers** | System too complex for self-help | Access barrier |
| **High costs** | $5,000-$15,000+ for green card | Economic exclusion |
| **Notario fraud** | Unauthorized practice | Victimization |
| **Uneven quality** | No minimum standards | Poor representation |

## Structural Design Flaws

### Family vs. Employment Tension

## Root Cause Interactions

### Reinforcing Dynamics

```
Frozen caps → Growing backlog → Political pressure
     ↑                              ↓
Paralysis ← Polarization ← Blame game
```

### Accumulating Problems

| Stage | Mechanism | Result |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Initial** | Caps set below demand | Small backlog |
| **Growth** | Applications exceed visas | Backlog grows |
| **Crisis** | Decade+ waits | System dysfunction |
| **Political** | Reform attempts fail | Backlog permanent |
| **Current** | Hopelessness | Illegal alternatives |

### Feedback Loops

| Loop | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| **Backlog → Illegal immigration** | Legal path too slow |
| **Complexity → Errors** | More RFEs → More delays |
| **Fees → Access barriers** | Fewer applicants → Revenue drop |
| **Instability → Brain drain** | Talent goes elsewhere |
