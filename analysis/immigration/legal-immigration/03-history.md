# Legal Immigration: History

## Overview

America's legal immigration system evolved from open immigration in the colonial era, through racially discriminatory quotas, to the current preference-based system established in 1965. Each major reform addressed the injustices of previous eras while creating new problems. The current framework, largely unchanged since 1990, is now severely outdated.
