# Asylum and Refugees: Root Causes

## Overview

The dysfunction in the US asylum and refugee system stems from structural features that cannot manage current volumes, legal requirements that create tension with enforcement goals, political dynamics that prevent reform, and international factors driving displacement. Understanding these root causes is essential for developing effective solutions.

## System Design Flaws

### Capacity Mismatch

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Volume exceeds capacity** | Applications far outpace adjudication |
| **No workload-based staffing** | Static despite growing demand |
| **Backlog accumulation** | Years of delay compound |
| **Quality vs. quantity** | Pressure to rush decisions |

### Dual-Track Inefficiency

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Affirmative vs. defensive** | Two separate systems |
| **USCIS vs. EOIR** | Different agencies, standards |
| **Referral process** | Cases move between systems |
| **Duplication** | Same claims reviewed multiple times |

### One-Year Filing Deadline

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Arbitrary cutoff** | Genuine refugees barred |
| **Exception complexity** | Litigation over exceptions |
| **No other country** | US unique in this restriction |
| **Creates illegality** | Miss deadline, lose claim |

## Legal Framework Constraints

### Protection Obligations

| Obligation | Source |
|------------|--------|
| **Non-refoulement** | 1951 Convention/1967 Protocol |
| **Due process** | Fifth Amendment |
| **Individualized determination** | INA § 208 |
| **Appeal rights** | Administrative review |

### Definition Limitations

| Limitation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **Five protected grounds** | Many persecuted don't fit |
| **State vs. non-state actors** | Gang, domestic violence claims |
| **Nexus requirement** | Must be "on account of" |
| **Particular social group** | Unclear, evolving standard |

### Bars to Asylum

| Bar | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| **One-year deadline** | Many genuine claims denied |
| **Criminal bars** | Broad disqualification |
| **Firm resettlement** | Transit through other countries |
| **Persecutor bar** | Including coerced assistance |
| **Terrorism-related** | Material support, even under duress |

## Adjudication Problems

### Judge Variation

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Grant rate range** | 5% to 95% |
| **Same facts, different outcomes** | Lottery effect |
| **No meaningful review** | Deference to IJ findings |
| **Political appointment** | Ideological variation |

### Quality of Decisions

| Problem | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| **Rushed hearings** | Caseload pressure |
| **Inadequate record** | Time constraints |
| **Credibility focus** | Subjective assessments |
| **Country condition gaps** | Outdated, incomplete |

### Lack of Independence

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **DOJ control** | Political influence |
| **Case completion quotas** | Speed over accuracy |
| **AG certification** | Policy changes by fiat |
| **No tenure protection** | Job insecurity |

## Representation Gap

### Impact of Counsel

| Representation | Grant Rate |
|----------------|------------|
| **With attorney** | 50%+ |
| **Without attorney** | 10-15% |
| **Difference** | 5x more likely to win |

### Why Gap Exists

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **No right to counsel** | Unlike criminal cases |
| **Cost** | $5,000-$20,000+ |
| **Limited legal aid** | Insufficient funding |
| **Pro bono limits** | Complex, time-intensive |
| **Geographic distribution** | Lawyers concentrated in cities |

## Global Displacement

### Push Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Conflict** | Syria, Afghanistan, DRC |
| **Persecution** | Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba |
| **Climate** | Central America dry corridor |
| **Economic collapse** | Venezuela |
| **Governance failure** | Multiple countries |

### Scale of Displacement

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| **Global displaced** | 100+ million |
| **Refugees** | 35+ million |
| **Asylum seekers** | 6+ million |
| **US share** | ~1% of global |

### Why US

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Geographic proximity** | Americas displacement |
| **Economic opportunity** | Jobs, wages |
| **Existing communities** | Networks, support |
| **Protection system** | Can apply for asylum |
| **Comparative stability** | Rule of law |

## Political Dynamics

### Polarization

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Wedge issue** | Used for political mobilization |
| **Symbolic politics** | "Crisis" vs. "protection" framing |
| **No middle ground** | Compromise impossible |
| **Electoral incentives** | Base mobilization |

### Reform Paralysis

| Dynamic | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **Comprehensive failure** | All-or-nothing approach fails |
| **Administrative limits** | Legal constraints on executive |
| **Litigation** | Policies blocked in court |
| **Reversal risk** | Next administration changes |

### Funding Constraints

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Insufficient appropriations** | Backlog grows |
| **Competing priorities** | Enforcement vs. processing |
| **No user fees** | Unlike other immigration |
| **Supplemental dependence** | Unpredictable funding |

## Enforcement Tension

### Asylum as Border Issue

| Dynamic | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Border arrival** | Most claims now at border |
| **Processing burden** | Overwhelms capacity |
| **Deterrence attempts** | Conflict with protection |
| **Release necessity** | Detention limits |

### Non-Meritorious Claims

| Issue | Complexity |
|-------|------------|
| **Economic migrants** | May claim asylum |
| **Coached claims** | Smuggler instructions |
| **Screening standard** | Low threshold (credible fear) |
| **Years to decision** | Time in US while waiting |

### Removal Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **Appeal rights** | Delays removal |
| **Country cooperation** | Won't accept returns |
| **Absconding** | Some don't appear |
| **Mixed families** | Removal difficult |

## International Context

### No Burden Sharing

| Reality | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **US bears disproportionate** | Americas displacement |
| **No regional system** | Unlike Europe |
| **Limited cooperation** | Bilateral only |
| **Root cause failure** | Insufficient investment |

### Transit Country Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Mexico** | Limited capacity |
| **Central America** | Source and transit |
| **Third country agreements** | Controversial |
| **Regional processing** | Underdeveloped |

## Feedback Loops

### Backlog Begets Backlog

```
Delays → More applications → More backlog
   ↑                            ↓
Resources spread thin ← Processing slows
```

### Enforcement-Protection Spiral

```
Restrictions → Litigation → Injunctions
      ↓                        ↓
New policies ← Court orders ← Delays
```

### Crisis Cycle

```
Arrivals surge → Crisis response → Temporary measures
       ↓                                  ↓
Normal operations → Capacity depleted → Next surge
```

## Root Cause Interactions

| Factor A | + Factor B | = Outcome |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Global displacement | Inadequate legal pathways | Border arrivals |
| Border arrivals | Insufficient capacity | Backlog |
| Backlog | Judge variation | Inconsistent outcomes |
| No counsel | Complex law | Unfair process |
| Political polarization | Reform paralysis | System dysfunction |
