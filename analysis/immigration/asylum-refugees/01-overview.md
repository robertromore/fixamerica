# Asylum and Refugees: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States has longstanding legal obligations to protect refugees and asylum seekers fleeing persecution, rooted in international treaties and domestic law. The current system is overwhelmed, with a 3+ million case backlog in immigration courts, multi-year waits for asylum decisions, and ongoing debates about who qualifies for protection and how claims should be processed. Balancing protection obligations with border management remains one of the most contentious immigration policy challenges.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Asylum system**: Affirmative and defensive applications
- **Refugee resettlement**: Overseas processing and admission
- **Credible fear screening**: Initial border assessment
- **Withholding of removal**: Non-refoulement protection
- **Temporary Protected Status**: Humanitarian designation
- **Due process**: Rights of asylum seekers
