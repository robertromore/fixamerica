# Fair Housing: Current State

## The Problem Today

### Ongoing Housing Discrimination

Despite 55+ years of fair housing law, discrimination remains pervasive. The gap between the law on the books and the law in practice is vast. Testing studies, complaint data, and academic research consistently document discrimination across rental, sales, and lending markets.

**The Testing Evidence**

The most rigorous evidence comes from paired testing studies, where matched testers of different races/ethnicities seek the same housing. The most comprehensive recent study by HUD (2012, with ongoing research) found:

| Market | Form of Discrimination | Prevalence |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| Rental | Fewer units shown to Black renters | 21.6% |
| Rental | Fewer units shown to Latino renters | 19.7% |
| Sales | Fewer homes shown to Black buyers | 17.0% |
| Sales | Fewer homes shown to Latino buyers | 19.2% |
| Sales | Fewer homes shown to Asian buyers | 15.5% |

**Forms of Current Discrimination**

| Type | Description | Prevalence |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Steering | Guiding buyers/renters to certain neighborhoods | Common |
| Differential treatment | Different terms, conditions, information | Very common |
| Refusal to deal | Outright denial of housing | Less common but still occurs |
| Discriminatory advertising | Language/imagery excluding groups | Persists, including online |
| Lending discrimination | Disparate terms, denial | Documented in data |
| Insurance redlining | Higher rates/denial in minority areas | Ongoing |
| Harassment | Hostile treatment in housing | Underreported |

### Residential Segregation Metrics

**Dissimilarity Index by Race/Ethnicity**

The dissimilarity index measures the percentage of a group that would need to move for perfect integration (0 = integrated, 1 = completely segregated).

| Group Comparison | 1970 | 1990 | 2010 | 2020 |
|------------------|------|------|------|------|
| Black-White | 0.79 | 0.68 | 0.59 | 0.55 |
| Hispanic-White | 0.44 | 0.50 | 0.48 | 0.46 |
| Asian-White | 0.43 | 0.41 | 0.41 | 0.40 |

**Most Segregated Metro Areas (Black-White)**

| Rank | Metro Area | Dissimilarity Index |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Milwaukee, WI | 0.79 |
| 2 | Detroit, MI | 0.75 |
| 3 | Chicago, IL | 0.74 |
| 4 | Cleveland, OH | 0.73 |
| 5 | Newark, NJ | 0.73 |
| 6 | Philadelphia, PA | 0.69 |
| 7 | St. Louis, MO | 0.69 |
| 8 | New York, NY | 0.67 |
| 9 | Los Angeles, CA | 0.65 |
| 10 | Baltimore, MD | 0.64 |

**Exposure Index**

Measures likelihood of contact between groups in neighborhoods:

| Metric | 1980 | 2020 |
|--------|------|------|
| Typical Black person's white neighbors | 31% | 35% |
| Typical white person's Black neighbors | 7% | 8% |
| Typical Hispanic person's white neighbors | 48% | 43% |

### Concentrated Poverty

**Racially/Ethnically Concentrated Areas of Poverty (R/ECAPs)**

HUD defines R/ECAPs as census tracts with >50% non-white population and poverty rates >40% or 3x the metro average.

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Number of R/ECAP tracts | ~4,500 |
| Population in R/ECAPs | ~7 million |
| Percent of Black population in R/ECAPs | 13% |
| Percent of Hispanic population in R/ECAPs | 9% |
| Percent of white population in R/ECAPs | 2% |

**Consequences of Concentrated Poverty**

| Domain | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Schools | Lower-performing, fewer resources |
| Employment | Fewer jobs accessible, worse networks |
| Health | Higher mortality, more chronic disease |
| Environment | More pollution, less green space |
| Safety | Higher crime rates |
| Services | Fewer amenities, predatory businesses |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Discrimination persists**: Testing studies document ongoing discrimination across rental, sales, and lending
2. **Segregation declining slowly**: Progress since 1970 but still highly segregated by historical standards
3. **Enforcement vastly inadequate**: Only 1% of estimated discrimination results in complaints
4. **Homeownership gap unchanged**: Black-white gap larger than before Fair Housing Act
5. **Wealth consequences enormous**: Housing discrimination drives racial wealth gap
6. **Algorithms perpetuate bias**: New technology encodes and scales historical discrimination
7. **Source of income discrimination common**: Undermines voucher program in most states
8. **School segregation connected**: Residential patterns drive educational inequality
9. **Environmental justice implicated**: Segregation determines pollution exposure
10. **Political pendulum swings**: Fair housing enforcement varies dramatically by administration
