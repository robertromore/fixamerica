# Fair Housing: Root Causes

## Why Discrimination Persists

### The Persistence Puzzle

Housing discrimination has been illegal for over 55 years, yet it remains pervasive. Understanding why requires examining multiple reinforcing factors that perpetuate discrimination despite legal prohibitions.

**The Gap Between Law and Reality**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Weak enforcement | <1% of discrimination results in complaints |
| Subtle discrimination | Harder to detect than overt discrimination |
| Systemic factors | Market structures encode discrimination |
| Wealth effects | Historical discrimination compounds over time |
| Social networks | Segregated information flows |
| Political opposition | Fair housing enforcement contested |

## Structural Causes

### Inadequate Enforcement Architecture

**The Complaint-Driven Model**

The fair housing enforcement system relies primarily on individual complaints:

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Victims must identify discrimination | Most goes unrecognized |
| Victims must file complaints | Time, knowledge barriers |
| Burden on individual | Not on discriminator |
| No systematic monitoring | Discrimination patterns undetected |
| Resource-intensive per case | Limited capacity |

**Enforcement Resource Gap**

| Agency | Budget (Annual) | Scope of Problem |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| HUD FHEO | ~$75 million | 4+ million incidents |
| DOJ Housing Section | ~$10 million | Nationwide jurisdiction |
| State/local agencies | Varies, usually small | Large populations |

**The Proof Problem**

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Direct evidence rare | Discriminators hide intent |
| Circumstantial evidence insufficient | Courts skeptical |
| Disparate impact limited | *Inclusive Communities* constraints |
| Discovery expensive | Deters private litigation |
| Expert witnesses costly | Many victims cannot afford |

### Economic Structures That Perpetuate Discrimination

**Housing as Wealth Vehicle**

| Dynamic | Effect on Discrimination |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Home values tied to neighborhood | Incentive to exclude "undesirable" groups |
| Property taxes fund schools | Incentive to maintain segregation |
| Exclusion maintains scarcity | Economic motivation for discrimination |
| Homeowner voting power | Political support for exclusion |

**The Property Value Myth**

Many whites believe minority neighbors lower property values:

| Belief | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Black neighbors reduce values | Studies show minimal or no effect |
| Integration lowers values | Tipping points create self-fulfilling prophecy |
| Segregation protects investment | Segregation correlates with decline |

This belief motivates discriminatory behavior even without racial animus.

**Landlord Economic Incentives**

| Incentive | Discriminatory Behavior |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Risk aversion | Stereotype-based screening |
| Voucher administration costs | Source of income discrimination |
| Perceived maintenance costs | Discriminate against families |
| Liability concerns | Discriminate against people with disabilities |

### Exclusionary Zoning

**Zoning as Discrimination Tool**

After explicit racial zoning was struck down, zoning shifted to facially neutral exclusion:

| Requirement | Discriminatory Effect |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Single-family only | Excludes affordable housing |
| Large lot minimums | Prices out lower-income families |
| Parking requirements | Increases housing costs |
| Height limits | Restricts density |
| Prohibitions on apartments | Excludes renters |

**The Disparate Impact**

| Zoning Restriction | Who Is Excluded |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Single-family only | Disproportionately minorities, low-income |
| Large lots (1+ acre) | 90%+ white in such areas |
| Ban on multifamily | Limits minority access to opportunity areas |
| Historic district rules | Often protect formerly segregated areas |

See [Zoning Reform: Root Causes](../zoning/04-root-causes.md).

### Algorithmic Perpetuation

**How Algorithms Encode Discrimination**

| System | How It Perpetuates Bias |
|--------|------------------------|
| Credit scoring | Based on data from discriminatory era |
| Automated underwriting | Trained on historical decisions |
| Appraisal models | Use comparables from segregated markets |
| Tenant screening | Criminal records with racial disparities |
| Online advertising | Proxy-based targeting |

**The Feedback Loop**

```text
Historical discrimination
        ↓
    Segregated data
        ↓
   Algorithm trained
        ↓
 Discriminatory output
        ↓
Reinforces segregation
        ↓
    New biased data
        ↓
      (Cycle repeats)
```

**Opacity Problem**

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Proprietary algorithms | Cannot be audited |
| "Black box" decisions | Discrimination hard to prove |
| Multiple systems interact | Compounding effects |
| No regulatory framework | Limited accountability |

## Institutional Factors

### Real Estate Industry Practices

**Agent Behavior**

| Practice | Description | Motivation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Steering | Guide buyers to "appropriate" neighborhoods | Commission, client expectations, prejudice |
| Selective marketing | Different information to different races | Assumptions about preferences |
| Dual agency issues | Conflicts in representation | Financial incentives |
| Homogeneous networks | Referrals within race | Social patterns |

**Industry Structure**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Commission-based pay | Incentive to close quickly, not challenge bias |
| Local market expertise | Reinforces neighborhood stereotypes |
| MLS control | Can limit access to listings |
| Limited diversity | 87% of agents are white |

### Lending Industry

**Structural Discrimination**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Branch locations | Fewer in minority neighborhoods |
| Marketing practices | Target different products by race |
| Underwriting discretion | Allows bias in borderline cases |
| Compensation structures | Rewarded steering to high-cost loans |

**Post-Crisis Changes**

| Change | Impact on Fair Housing |
|--------|----------------------|
| Tighter credit standards | Disparate impact on minorities |
| Risk-based pricing | Higher costs for minority borrowers |
| Automated underwriting | Potential to reduce bias OR encode it |
| Reduced subprime | Fewer predatory loans, but also less access |

### Insurance Industry

**Insurance Redlining**

| Practice | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Territory-based pricing | Higher costs in minority areas |
| Claims history weighting | Reflects neighborhood history |
| Credit-based scoring | Encodes economic discrimination |
| Agent networks | Fewer in minority areas |

### Appraisal Industry

**Appraisal Bias**

| Source | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Comparable sales | Limited by segregated markets |
| Neighborhood analysis | Subjective judgments |
| Appraiser demographics | 98% white |
| Training and culture | Perpetuates bias |

**Documented Undervaluation**

| Study Finding | Magnitude |
|---------------|-----------|
| Homes in Black neighborhoods undervalued | 12-23% |
| Aggregate lost equity | $156 billion |
| Refinancing discrimination | Higher rates despite qualifications |

## Political and Legal Factors

### Weak Political Will

**Why Enforcement Is Underfunded**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Diffuse beneficiaries | Victims don't form powerful lobby |
| Concentrated opponents | Real estate, lending industries organized |
| White homeowner constituency | Political power opposes integration |
| Federalism | Local resistance to federal enforcement |
| Administration changes | Priorities shift dramatically |

**The Political Economy of Segregation**

| Actor | Interest in Status Quo |
|-------|----------------------|
| Suburban homeowners | Property values, school quality |
| Local governments | Tax base, demographic control |
| Real estate industry | Avoid liability, serve market |
| Lending industry | Risk management by geography |

### Legal Limitations

**Fair Housing Act Weaknesses**

| Limitation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Intent requirements for some claims | Hard to prove |
| Exemptions | Single-family, small multifamily exempt |
| Damages caps (some states) | Inadequate deterrent |
| Statute of limitations | 2 years limits claims |
| Discovery burdens | Expensive for plaintiffs |

**Court-Created Constraints**

| Decision | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| *Inclusive Communities* limits | Narrows disparate impact |
| Intent requirements | Makes discrimination harder to prove |
| Standing restrictions | Limits who can sue |
| Damages skepticism | Judges reduce awards |

### Federalism Challenges

**Federal-State-Local Conflicts**

| Level | Issue |
|-------|-------|
| Federal | Limited enforcement resources; political shifts |
| State | Many lack fair housing laws; some preempt local |
| Local | Zoning authority; resistance to integration |

**Local Control as Obstacle**

| Local Power | How Used Against Fair Housing |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Zoning | Exclude affordable housing |
| Building permits | Delay or deny multifamily |
| Site selection | Block affordable housing sites |
| Service provision | Discourage minority residents |

## Social and Psychological Factors

### Implicit Bias

**How Bias Operates**

| Form | Housing Manifestation |
|------|----------------------|
| Implicit associations | Unconscious preferences in showing homes |
| Statistical discrimination | Using race as proxy for risk |
| In-group favoritism | Preferential treatment of own race |
| Confirmation bias | Seeing what expected in neighborhoods |

**Research Findings**

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|------------|
| Whites have implicit anti-Black bias | Even "non-racist" discriminate |
| Bias affects split-second decisions | Training limited effectiveness |
| Stress increases bias | High-stakes housing decisions affected |
| Structural cues matter | Segregated environments reinforce bias |

### Social Networks and Information

**Segregated Information Flows**

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Word-of-mouth housing information | Stays within racial networks |
| Real estate agent referrals | Follow social patterns |
| Neighborhood knowledge | Limited to own-race areas |
| School information | Segregated parent networks |

**Self-Perpetuating Segregation**

| Process | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Limited interracial contact | Stereotypes persist |
| Segregated social networks | Housing information segregated |
| Neighborhood reputation | Shapes preferences |
| "Tipping point" fears | White flight dynamics |

### Preference vs. Constraint

**The Debate**

| View | Argument |
|------|----------|
| Preferences explain segregation | People want to live with own race |
| Constraints explain segregation | Discrimination limits choices |

**Evidence Favors Constraints**

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|------------|
| Black preference for integration | 50%+ white neighborhood preferred |
| White preference matters | Strong preference for <30% Black |
| Discrimination documented | Testing shows different treatment |
| Wealth gap | Economic constraints compound |

White preferences, not Black preferences, primarily drive segregation.

## Compounding Effects

### Historical Discrimination's Long Shadow

**Intergenerational Wealth Transfer**

| Generation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 1930s-1960s | White families built equity through FHA/VA |
| 1970s-1990s | Equity appreciation widened gap |
| 2000s | Predatory lending stripped minority wealth |
| 2010s-present | Recovery favored white homeowners |

**The Compound Interest of Segregation**

| Factor | Compounding Effect |
|--------|-------------------|
| Lower home values | Less appreciation, less wealth |
| Worse schools | Lower human capital, lower earnings |
| Fewer jobs | Lower income, harder to buy home |
| Worse health | Higher costs, lower productivity |
| Criminal justice exposure | Employment barriers, wealth loss |

### The Vicious Cycle

    (Cycle continues)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Enforcement is structurally inadequate**: Complaint-driven system catches <1% of discrimination
2. **Economic incentives perpetuate discrimination**: Property values, taxes, scarcity create motivation
3. **Zoning excludes without explicitly discriminating**: Facially neutral rules have disparate impact
4. **Algorithms automate and scale bias**: Historical discrimination encoded in modern systems
5. **Industry practices persist**: Real estate, lending, insurance perpetuate discrimination
6. **Political will is weak**: Opponents organized, beneficiaries diffuse
7. **Legal tools are constrained**: Courts have limited fair housing remedies
8. **Implicit bias operates unconsciously**: Even well-meaning actors discriminate
9. **Information flows are segregated**: Social networks perpetuate patterns
10. **Historical effects compound**: Past discrimination creates current disparities
