# Fair Housing: History

## Origins

### Colonial Era Through Reconstruction

**Early Housing Discrimination**

- Colonial laws restricted where free Black people could live
- Slavery concentrated Black population in South
- Northern cities had de facto segregation even before Civil War
- Free Black communities in cities faced violence and exclusion

**Post-Civil War Promise**

The Civil Rights Act of 1866 theoretically protected housing rights:
> "All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property."

This law was largely unenforced and ignored.

### The Rise of Formal Segregation (1890s-1940s)

**Racial Zoning Ordinances**

| Year | City | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| 1910 | Baltimore | First racial zoning ordinance |
| 1911-1917 | Many cities | Adopted racial zoning |
| 1917 | Louisville | *Buchanan v. Warley* strikes down racial zoning |

After *Buchanan*, cities turned to private enforcement mechanisms.

**Restrictive Covenants**

Private deed restrictions prohibited sale to racial minorities:

- "No part of said property shall ever be used or occupied by any person of the Negro or African race"
- "Property shall not be sold, conveyed, leased or rented to any person other than of the Caucasian race"

| Period | Prevalence |
|--------|------------|
| 1920s | Growing adoption |
| 1930s-1940s | Near-universal in new subdivisions |
| 1948 | *Shelley v. Kraemer* makes unenforceable |
| 1950s-1960s | Continued use despite unenforceability |

**Impact of Restrictive Covenants**

| City | Estimated Coverage |
|------|-------------------|
| Chicago | 80% of property by 1940 |
| Los Angeles | Vast majority of subdivisions |
| St. Louis | Most of county |
| Detroit | Extensive coverage |

## Key Turning Points

### Federal Government Creates Segregation (1930s-1960s)

**Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) Redlining**

Beginning in 1933, HOLC created "residential security maps" for 239 cities:

| Grade | Color | Description | Typical Population |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| A | Green | "Best" | New, homogeneous, white |
| B | Blue | "Still Desirable" | Older, stable white |
| C | Yellow | "Declining" | Aging, "infiltration" of minorities |
| D | Red | "Hazardous" | Minority neighborhoods |

**The Redlining System**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Racial basis | Race explicitly cited in ratings |
| Federal endorsement | Maps used by federal agencies |
| Private adoption | Banks adopted maps for lending decisions |
| Long-term effect | Shaped investment for decades |

**Federal Housing Administration (FHA)**

The FHA, created in 1934, systematically discriminated:

| Practice | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Underwriting manual | Explicitly required racial homogeneity |
| Appraisal standards | Penalized integrated neighborhoods |
| Redlining | Refused insurance in minority areas |
| Suburban development | Funded exclusively white suburbs |

FHA Underwriting Manual (1936):
> "If a neighborhood is to retain stability, it is necessary that properties shall continue to be occupied by the same social and racial groups."

**Veterans Administration (VA)**

Post-WWII VA loans followed FHA discrimination:

| Statistic | Data |
|-----------|------|
| VA loans to Black veterans (1946-1960) | <2% |
| Suburbs built with VA/FHA loans | Almost exclusively white |
| Wealth created | Trillions for white families |

### Public Housing Segregation

**Local Housing Authorities**

| Practice | Prevalence |
|----------|------------|
| Separate projects by race | Universal in South, common in North |
| Site selection in minority areas | Concentrated poverty |
| Tenant selection by race | Explicit policies |
| Demolition of minority housing | Urban renewal "Negro removal" |

**Urban Renewal**

| Statistic | Data |
|-----------|------|
| Families displaced | ~1 million |
| Percent minority | ~65% |
| Replacement housing provided | Minimal |
| Effect | Destroyed minority neighborhoods |

### The Civil Rights Era

**Early Civil Rights Housing Efforts**

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1948 | *Shelley v. Kraemer* - restrictive covenants unenforceable |
| 1962 | JFK Executive Order 11063 - fair housing in federal programs |
| 1964 | Civil Rights Act - no housing provision |
| 1966 | Chicago Freedom Movement - open housing campaign |
| 1967 | MLK leads fair housing marches |

**The Chicago Freedom Movement**

Martin Luther King Jr. moved to Chicago in 1966:

- Led marches into all-white neighborhoods
- Met with violent white resistance
- Exposed northern segregation
- Negotiations produced limited agreement
- Demonstrated need for federal law

**The Fair Housing Act of 1968**

|----------|-------|
| 1966-1967 | Fair housing bills fail in Congress |
| April 4, 1968 | MLK assassinated |
| April 10, 1968 | House passes Fair Housing Act |
| April 11, 1968 | LBJ signs into law |

**What the Original Act Did**

| Provision | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Section 804 | Prohibited discrimination in sale/rental |
| Section 805 | Prohibited discrimination in lending |
| Section 806 | Prohibited interference with fair housing |
| Section 808 | Required affirmatively furthering fair housing |
| Exemptions | Single-family owner-occupied, small multifamily |

**Limitations of Original Act**

| Weakness | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Weak enforcement | Only pattern/practice suits by DOJ |
| No private attorney fees | Limited private enforcement |
| HUD conciliation only | No administrative enforcement |
| Mrs. Murphy exemption | Small landlords exempt |

### Post-1968 Developments

**Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. (1968)**

- Upheld 1866 Civil Rights Act for housing
- Private discrimination prohibited under 13th Amendment
- Broadened legal basis for fair housing

**Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988**

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Added protected classes | Familial status, disability |
| HUD enforcement authority | Administrative hearing process |
| Private attorney fees | Enabled private enforcement |
| Unlimited punitive damages | Stronger deterrent |
| Accessibility requirements | New construction standards |

**Significant Pre-2000 Developments**

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1974 | Equal Credit Opportunity Act |
| 1975 | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act |
| 1977 | Community Reinvestment Act |
| 1994 | AFFH rule promulgated |

## Lessons from History

### Lesson 1: Government Created Segregation

Federal, state, and local governments actively created and enforced segregation:

| Level | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| Federal | FHA, VA, HOLC redlining; public housing segregation |
| State | Enabling legislation, enforcement of covenants |
| Local | Zoning, public housing siting, urban renewal |

Segregation is not merely the result of private choices - it was government policy.

### Lesson 2: Market Forces Reinforced Discrimination

Private actors amplified government discrimination:

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| Real estate agents | Steering, blockbusting |
| Banks | Redlining, discriminatory lending |
| Insurance companies | Denying coverage in minority areas |
| Developers | Building whites-only suburbs |
| Homeowner associations | Enforcing covenants |

### Lesson 3: Integration Requires Affirmative Action

Passive non-discrimination does not undo decades of active segregation:

- Segregation patterns persist for generations
- Wealth gaps compound over time
- Social networks remain segregated
- "Neighborhood effects" self-perpetuate
- Affirmative steps required to overcome history

### Lesson 4: Enforcement Determines Impact

The Fair Housing Act's impact depended entirely on enforcement:

| Period | Enforcement | Outcome |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1968-1988 | Weak | Limited impact |
| 1988-2000 | Stronger (amendments) | Some progress |
| 2000-2008 | Variable | Stalled progress |
| 2008-2016 | Stronger under Obama | AFFH adopted |
| 2017-2020 | Gutted under Trump | AFFH repealed |
| 2021-present | Rebuilding | Restoration ongoing |

### Lesson 5: Housing Discrimination Affects Everything

Housing segregation shaped:

| Domain | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Education | School segregation follows housing |
| Wealth | Homeownership gap drives wealth gap |
| Health | Neighborhood determines health outcomes |
| Employment | Access to jobs tied to location |
| Environment | Pollution exposure varies by neighborhood |
| Political power | Representation tied to residence |

### Lesson 6: Progress Is Fragile

Advances can be reversed:

- AFFH adopted in 2015, repealed in 2020
- Disparate impact nearly eliminated
- Enforcement priorities shift with administrations
- Court composition affects outcomes
- Constant vigilance required
