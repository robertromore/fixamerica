# Fair Housing: Overview

The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was landmark civil rights legislation that prohibited discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, and national origin. Subsequent amendments added sex, familial status, and disability as protected classes. Yet more than 55 years later, America remains deeply segregated, and housing discrimination persists in both overt and subtle forms. Testing studies consistently find discrimination against Black, Latino, and Asian homebuyers and renters. Algorithmic systems perpetuate historical bias. Enforcement remains woefully inadequate, with HUD investigating only a fraction of complaints and achieving meaningful remedies even less often. The result is ongoing segregation that shapes educational opportunity, wealth accumulation, health outcomes, and life chances for millions of Americans.
