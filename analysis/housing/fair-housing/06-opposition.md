## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### "Fair Housing Is Social Engineering"

**The Argument**

- Government shouldn't dictate where people live
- Integration should happen naturally
- AFFH forces outcomes

**The Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Government *created* segregation | FHA, VA, HOLC, public housing |
| "Natural" patterns reflect discrimination | Testing proves ongoing discrimination |
| AFFH requires planning, not quotas | No mandatory integration |
| Passive non-discrimination insufficient | 55 years of limited progress |

### "Disparate Impact Punishes Innocent Actors"

**The Argument**

- Discrimination requires intent
- Disparate impact creates liability for neutral practices
- Unfair to landlords and lenders

**The Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| FHA prohibits discriminatory effects | Congressional intent clear |
| Supreme Court upheld disparate impact | *Inclusive Communities* (2015) |
| Intent is hard to prove | Discrimination would be legal otherwise |
| Business necessity defense exists | Legitimate reasons protected |
| Effects matter to victims | Harm is the same regardless of intent |

### "Source of Income Discrimination Is Economic, Not Racial"

**The Argument**

- Landlords have right to choose tenants
- Voucher acceptance should be voluntary
- Economic discrimination isn't illegal

**The Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Voucher holders disproportionately minority | 60-75% are people of color |
| Economic discrimination has racial effect | Disparate impact doctrine applies |
| Vouchers are public benefit | Like prohibiting discrimination against Social Security recipients |
| No evidence of increased risk | Voucher holders not higher-risk tenants |
| Undermines housing policy | Vouchers useless if can't be used |

### "Property Rights Should Prevail"

**The Argument**

- Property owners have constitutional rights
- Fair housing infringes on property rights
- Market should allocate housing

**The Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Property rights not absolute | Always subject to regulation |
| Civil rights supersede property preference | Long established principle |
| No right to discriminate | Constitution doesn't protect discrimination |
| Fair housing enhances property values | Integration benefits all |

### "Local Control Should Be Respected"

**The Argument**

- Housing is local issue
- Federal government overreaches
- Communities should decide their character

**The Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Civil rights are federal concern | 14th Amendment, Commerce Clause |
| Local control enabled discrimination | Zoning, public housing siting |
| Regional effects require regional response | Housing markets cross boundaries |
| Federal funds come with conditions | AFFH is condition of funding |

### "Fair Housing Hurts Property Values"

**The Argument**

- Integration lowers property values
- Homeowners have legitimate interest in exclusion
- Market reflects preferences

**The Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Research shows integration doesn't lower values | Studies contradict belief |
| Tipping points are self-fulfilling | Fear causes flight, then decline |
| Segregation correlates with decline | Concentrated poverty harms all |
| Protecting prejudice is not legitimate | Fair housing supersedes preference |

### "We Don't Discriminate Anymore"

**The Argument**

- Fair housing law solved the problem
- Discrimination is rare
- Ongoing enforcement unnecessary

**The Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Testing proves ongoing discrimination | 15-21% experience discrimination |
| Segregation remains severe | 0.55 dissimilarity index |
| Homeownership gap unchanged | Black-white gap larger than 1960 |
| Complaints understate problem | 99%+ of discrimination unreported |
| Algorithmic discrimination new frontier | Technology perpetuates bias |
