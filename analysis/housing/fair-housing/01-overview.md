# Fair Housing: Overview

## Executive Summary

The Fair Housing Act of 1968 was landmark civil rights legislation that prohibited discrimination in housing based on race, color, religion, and national origin. Subsequent amendments added sex, familial status, and disability as protected classes. Yet more than 55 years later, America remains deeply segregated, and housing discrimination persists in both overt and subtle forms. Testing studies consistently find discrimination against Black, Latino, and Asian homebuyers and renters. Algorithmic systems perpetuate historical bias. Enforcement remains woefully inadequate, with HUD investigating only a fraction of complaints and achieving meaningful remedies even less often. The result is ongoing segregation that shapes educational opportunity, wealth accumulation, health outcomes, and life chances for millions of Americans.

## The Core Problem

| Metric | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Annual estimated acts of housing discrimination | 4 million+ |
| Discrimination complaints filed annually | ~25,000 |
| Percentage of discrimination going unreported | 99%+ |
| Black-white dissimilarity index (segregation measure) | 0.55 (highly segregated) |
| Average white family wealth vs. Black family wealth | 8:1 ratio |
| Homeownership gap (white vs. Black) | 30 percentage points |

## Why It Matters

**For Individuals and Families**

- Discrimination limits housing choices, forcing families into fewer, often lower-quality options
- Segregation concentrates poverty, limiting access to good schools, jobs, and services
- Housing location affects health outcomes, exposure to pollution, and life expectancy
- Discrimination in lending reduces wealth-building through homeownership
- Children in segregated neighborhoods face compounding disadvantages

**For Communities**

- Segregated communities have unequal resources and opportunities
- Property values reflect and reinforce segregation patterns
- Municipal services vary dramatically by neighborhood composition
- Environmental hazards disproportionately burden minority communities
- Concentrated poverty strains local institutions

**For Society**

- Segregation undermines social cohesion and trust
- Economic costs of discrimination and segregation estimated at trillions
- Democratic legitimacy harmed when policies perpetuate inequality
- American ideals of equal opportunity contradicted by housing reality
- Generational wealth gaps compound over time

## Key Questions

1. Why has fair housing law failed to desegregate America after 55+ years?
2. How do modern forms of discrimination differ from historical overt discrimination?
3. What role do algorithms and AI play in perpetuating housing discrimination?
4. How can enforcement be strengthened to address the massive gap between discrimination experienced and discrimination remedied?
5. What does "affirmatively furthering fair housing" require of governments?
6. How does housing segregation perpetuate educational inequality?
7. What is the role of source of income discrimination in maintaining segregation?

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Protected class | Groups protected from discrimination (race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, disability) |
| Disparate impact | Practice that disproportionately harms protected class without business necessity |
| Disparate treatment | Intentional discrimination based on protected class |
| Redlining | Historical practice of denying services to neighborhoods based on racial composition |
| Steering | Guiding buyers/renters toward or away from neighborhoods based on race |
| Blockbusting | Inducing panic selling by suggesting minority groups are moving in |
| Paired testing | Using similar testers of different races to detect discrimination |
| Dissimilarity index | Measure of segregation (0-1 scale; higher = more segregated) |
| Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) | Statutory requirement for federal grantees to overcome segregation |
| Racially/Ethnically Concentrated Areas of Poverty (R/ECAP) | Census tracts with high poverty and minority concentration |
| Source of income discrimination | Refusing to rent to tenants using housing vouchers |

## The Scale of the Problem

**Housing Discrimination Prevalence**

| Group | Testing Study Results |
|-------|----------------------|
| Black renters | 21% experience discrimination vs. white counterparts |
| Latino renters | 19% experience discrimination |
| Black homebuyers | 17% experience discrimination |
| Latino homebuyers | 19% experience discrimination |
| Asian homebuyers | 15% experience discrimination |
| Families with children | Significant discrimination in rental market |
| People with disabilities | High rates of accessibility denial |

**Segregation Metrics**

| Metro Area | Black-White Dissimilarity Index |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| Milwaukee | 0.79 |
| Detroit | 0.75 |
| Chicago | 0.74 |
| Cleveland | 0.73 |
| Newark | 0.73 |
| National average | 0.55 |

**Enforcement Gap**

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Estimated discrimination incidents annually | 4+ million |
| Complaints filed with HUD annually | ~8,000 |
| Complaints filed with state/local agencies | ~17,000 |
| Cases reaching adjudication or settlement | <10% of complaints |
| Cases resulting in meaningful relief | <5% of complaints |

## What's at Stake

**Current Reality**

- Most Americans still live in segregated neighborhoods
- School segregation has increased since 1990s, driven by residential patterns
- Black homeownership rate lower than before Fair Housing Act enforcement
- Algorithmic systems encode historical discrimination into modern decisions
- Environmental racism persists in housing location decisions
- Source of income discrimination undermines voucher program effectiveness

**Without Reform**

- Segregation will persist for generations
- Wealth gaps will continue widening
- School inequality will remain
- Health disparities tied to neighborhood will continue
- Environmental justice impossible without addressing housing discrimination
- AI and algorithms will automate discrimination at scale

## The Path Forward

Addressing fair housing requires:

1. **Strengthening enforcement** - More resources, stronger penalties, private right of action improvements
2. **Restoring AFFH** - Meaningful requirements for federal grantees to overcome segregation
3. **Addressing algorithmic discrimination** - Auditing and regulating AI in housing decisions
4. **Prohibiting source of income discrimination** - Ensuring voucher holders can access all neighborhoods
5. **Codifying disparate impact** - Protecting doctrine from Supreme Court rollback
6. **Connecting to school integration** - Addressing housing-school segregation nexus
7. **Environmental justice** - Ensuring fair housing includes healthy housing location

No single reform suffices. Comprehensive action across enforcement, regulation, and affirmative requirements is necessary to finally realize the promise of fair housing.
