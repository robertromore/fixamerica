# Housing: Overview

## Executive Summary

America faces a housing crisis affecting every dimension of the market: affordability, availability, quality, and equity. Nearly half of renters are cost-burdened, homeownership remains out of reach for millions, homelessness persists despite unprecedented wealth, and segregation continues decades after fair housing laws. Housing dysfunction ripples through education, healthcare, economic mobility, and democracy itself. This domain analyzes the structural causes of housing failure and proposes comprehensive reforms.

## Scope

This domain covers the full housing system in America:

- **Market dynamics**: Affordability, supply, demand, prices, rents
- **Tenure**: Rental markets, homeownership, public/assisted housing
- **Equity**: Fair housing, segregation, discrimination, disparities
- **Geography**: Urban, suburban, rural housing challenges
- **Finance**: Mortgages, lending, credit access, investment
- **Policy**: Zoning, subsidies, regulation, programs

## Key Facts

- **Cost burden**: 22 million renter households (49%) pay 30%+ of income on housing
- **Supply shortage**: 3.8-5.5 million unit deficit nationally
- **Homeownership gap**: 30+ percentage point gap between white (74%) and Black (45%) homeownership
- **Homelessness**: 650,000+ people homeless on any given night
- **Segregation**: Dissimilarity index of 0.55+ in major metros (highly segregated)
- **Evictions**: 900,000+ formal evictions annually, 2.7 million eviction filings
- **Waitlists**: 5+ year waits for housing assistance in major cities
- **Rural housing**: 2+ million substandard units in rural America

## Key Questions

- Why does the richest country have a housing affordability crisis?
- How can supply be increased without displacing existing residents?
- What would it take to close the racial homeownership gap?
- How can homelessness be functionally ended?
- Why does housing remain segregated despite fair housing laws?
- What role should government play in housing markets?

## Core Tensions

### Supply vs. Displacement

Increasing housing supply can reduce prices but may accelerate gentrification and displace existing residents. Anti-displacement protections can preserve affordability for current residents but may restrict supply and raise prices for newcomers.

### Local Control vs. Regional Need

Local governments control zoning but housing markets are regional. Local decisions to restrict development impose costs on neighboring communities. State preemption can override local exclusion but reduces democratic control.

### Market vs. Public Provision

Market-rate housing serves those who can pay; public/subsidized housing serves those who cannot. The balance between market solutions and public investment reflects fundamental values about housing as commodity vs. right.

### Homeownership vs. Rental

U.S. policy heavily favors homeownership (mortgage interest deduction, FHA, GSEs) over rental housing. This privileging contributes to wealth inequality and may not match household preferences or needs.

## What Success Looks Like

- **No cost burden**: All households spending <30% of income on housing
- **Adequate supply**: Housing production matching household formation and need
- **Closed gaps**: Homeownership rates equal across racial groups
- **Functional zero homelessness**: Homelessness rare, brief, and non-recurring
- **Integration**: Neighborhoods reflecting regional diversity
- **Quality**: All housing meeting health and safety standards
- **Stability**: Security of tenure for renters and owners

## Relationship to Other Domains

Housing intersects with virtually every policy area:

- **Education** (`../education/`): School segregation follows residential patterns; property taxes fund schools
- **Healthcare** (`../healthcare/`): Housing instability harms health; lead paint, mold, overcrowding
- **Economic** (`../economic/`): Housing as wealth building; affordability constrains mobility
- **Justice** (`../justice/`): Fair housing enforcement; eviction courts; homelessness criminalization
- **Environment** (`../environment/`): Land use, sprawl, climate resilience
- **Infrastructure** (`../infrastructure/`): Transportation access shapes housing value
