# Housing: Stakeholders

## Overview

American housing involves a complex ecosystem of stakeholders with competing interests and varying degrees of power. Homeowners who benefit from appreciation, developers seeking profits, tenants needing stability, and communities resisting change all vie for influence over policy. Understanding who benefits from the status quo, who is harmed, and who can drive change is essential for effective reform advocacy.
