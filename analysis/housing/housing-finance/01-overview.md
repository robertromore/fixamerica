# Housing Finance: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's housing finance system is a vast, complex infrastructure that enables most households to purchase homes through mortgage credit. The system is dominated by government involvement: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Government-Sponsored Enterprises or GSEs) guarantee nearly half of all mortgages, the FHA insures loans for first-time and lower-income buyers, and the mortgage interest deduction costs taxpayers over $30 billion annually. Yet despite this massive public investment, the system produces deeply unequal outcomes. Black and Hispanic borrowers are denied mortgages at rates 40-80% higher than white borrowers with similar financial profiles. Black-owned homes are appraised at values 23% lower than comparable white-owned homes. The subprime crisis of 2008, which devastated minority communities, resulted from predatory lending that regulators failed to prevent. Today, institutional investors are outcompeting first-time buyers, fintech lenders operate with minimal fair lending oversight, and credit scoring systems perpetuate historical discrimination. The housing finance system requires fundamental reform to fulfill its promise of expanding homeownership fairly.

## The Core Problem

| Metric | Status | Significance |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| GSE market share | 47% of all mortgages | Taxpayer-backed system dominates market |
| FHA market share | 15% of purchase mortgages | Primary pathway for first-time buyers |
| Mortgage denial rate (white) | 10.2% | Baseline for comparison |
| Mortgage denial rate (Black) | 17.4% | 70% higher than white applicants |
| Mortgage denial rate (Hispanic) | 14.3% | 40% higher than white applicants |
| Appraisal gap | Black homes valued 23% lower | Billions in lost equity |
| Investor share of purchases | 28% (2024) | Crowding out first-time buyers |
| Average credit score for mortgage | 754 | Excludes millions with thin credit |

## Why It Matters

**For Individuals and Families**

- Access to mortgage credit determines homeownership possibility
- Interest rates and loan terms affect lifetime housing costs by hundreds of thousands of dollars
- Appraisal values directly impact home equity and wealth building
- Mortgage servicing quality affects foreclosure risk during hardship
- Credit requirements exclude those without traditional credit histories
- Down payment requirements lock out families without generational wealth

**For Racial Equity**

- Mortgage discrimination was explicit federal policy until 1968
- FHA explicitly refused to insure loans in Black neighborhoods (redlining)
- Subprime lenders targeted minority communities with predatory products
- Algorithmic discrimination perpetuates bias through ostensibly neutral criteria
- Appraisal bias systematically devalues Black-owned homes
- Credit scoring penalizes communities excluded from traditional financial services

**For the Economy**

- Housing finance represents $12 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt
- Mortgage markets affect interest rates economy-wide
- Housing wealth drives consumer spending and economic stability
- GSE failures required $190 billion taxpayer bailout in 2008
- Healthy mortgage markets prevent foreclosure crises
- Equitable lending expands the consumer base and economic growth

**For Financial Stability**

- 2008 crisis originated in mortgage market failures
- GSEs remain in conservatorship 15+ years later
- Private label securities markets have not recovered
- Mortgage servicing concentration creates systemic risk
- Climate risks to housing not yet priced into mortgages
- Rising rates expose vulnerabilities in mortgage market structure

## The Scale of the Challenge

**Mortgage Market Structure**

| Segment | Volume (2024) | Market Share |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| GSE-backed mortgages | $5.7 trillion | 47% |
| Government (FHA/VA/USDA) | $1.8 trillion | 15% |
| Private label (jumbo, non-QM) | $4.6 trillion | 38% |
| **Total** | **$12.1 trillion** | 100% |

**Lending Disparities**

| Metric | White | Black | Hispanic | Asian |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| Application rate (per 1000 adults) | 82 | 41 | 52 | 78 |
| Denial rate | 10.2% | 17.4% | 14.3% | 11.8% |
| Higher-priced loan share | 14.8% | 27.4% | 22.1% | 12.9% |
| Median credit score | 756 | 677 | 701 | 765 |

**Appraisal Disparities**

| Home Type | Average Appraisal Gap |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Black owner in Black neighborhood | 23% below comparable white area |
| Black owner in integrated neighborhood | 15% below comparable |
| Hispanic owner in Hispanic neighborhood | 11% below comparable |
| Homes in formerly redlined areas | 18% lower appreciation since 1980 |

## What's at Stake

**Current Reality**

- 26 million Americans are credit invisible, unable to access mortgages
- Black homeowners have $48,000 less home equity on average than white homeowners with similar homes
- FHA share of purchase mortgages fell from 25% to 15% as lending standards tightened
- 28% of home purchases made by investors, up from 15% pre-pandemic
- Mortgage rates doubled from 3% to 7%+, reducing buying power by 40%
- No major subprime lender faced criminal prosecution after 2008 crisis

**Without Reform**

- Racial homeownership gap continues for another generation
- Appraisal bias erases billions in minority wealth annually
- Credit invisible Americans remain locked out of homeownership
- Institutional investors accumulate housing stock as families rent
- GSEs remain in indefinite conservatorship without clear mission
- Next crisis could require another taxpayer bailout
- Climate-exposed mortgages create hidden systemic risk

## The Path Forward

Reforming housing finance requires:

1. **Strengthening fair lending enforcement** - Vigorous enforcement against discrimination in lending and appraisal
2. **Reforming credit scoring** - Incorporating alternative data, limiting negative factors
3. **Eliminating appraisal bias** - Automated valuation models, blind appraisals, anti-bias training
4. **Expanding down payment assistance** - Federal programs for first-generation buyers
5. **Reforming GSEs** - Clear affordable housing mission, explicit government backing
6. **Rebalancing subsidies** - Converting mortgage interest deduction to credit, targeting assistance
7. **Regulating fintech lenders** - Equal fair lending requirements for all mortgage originators
8. **Addressing investor competition** - Owner-occupant preferences, investor cooling measures
9. **Improving mortgage servicing** - Loss mitigation requirements, servicing transfer protections

A fair and stable housing finance system is essential for expanding homeownership and building wealth for all Americans.
