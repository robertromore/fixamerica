# Housing Finance: Stakeholders

## Overview

The housing finance system involves a complex network of stakeholders with often competing interests. Borrowers seek affordable access to credit; lenders seek profitable lending within acceptable risk; government-sponsored enterprises balance public mission with financial returns; regulators attempt to ensure fairness and stability; and industry trade associations lobby to shape the rules. Understanding these stakeholders - their interests, power, and influence - is essential for designing and implementing effective reforms. This analysis maps the stakeholder landscape and identifies potential allies and opponents for various reform approaches.
