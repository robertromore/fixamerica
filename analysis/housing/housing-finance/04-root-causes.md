# Housing Finance: Root Causes

## Overview

Despite fair lending laws on the books since 1968, significant disparities in mortgage access persist. Black applicants are 70% more likely to be denied mortgages than white applicants. Black-owned homes are appraised at values 23% below comparable white-owned homes. These disparities do not simply reflect differences in creditworthiness - they persist even when controlling for income, wealth, and credit scores. Understanding why requires examining the structural, institutional, and systemic factors that perpetuate unequal access to housing finance. The root causes include the legacy of historical discrimination embedded in wealth and credit patterns, ongoing discrimination in lending and appraisal, credit scoring systems that penalize alternative financial behaviors, down payment barriers that entrench generational inequality, and weak enforcement of fair lending laws.

## Legacy of Historical Discrimination

### Intergenerational Wealth Effects

**How FHA Redlining Still Affects Today's Borrowers**

| Historical Policy | Current Effect |
|-------------------|----------------|
| FHA denied mortgages to Black families | Black families missed 30+ years of home appreciation |
| Exclusion from postwar suburbs | Less inheritance wealth to transfer |
| Contract buying exploited excluded families | Assets extracted rather than built |
| Lower homeownership rates | Less down payment help from family |

**Wealth Gap by Generation**

| Generation | White Median Net Worth | Black Median Net Worth | Gap Ratio |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Silent (born 1928-1945) | $242,000 | $41,000 | 5.9x |
| Baby Boomer | $188,000 | $28,000 | 6.7x |
| Gen X | $131,000 | $24,000 | 5.5x |
| Millennial | $29,000 | $4,000 | 7.3x |

### Credit History Legacy

**Why Black Borrowers Have Lower Credit Scores**

| Factor | Cause | Effect on Credit |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Medical debt | Less employer insurance historically | 43% of Black adults have medical debt in collections |
| Student loans | Higher borrowing, lower family support | Higher delinquency rates |
| Neighborhood effects | Fewer bank branches, more predatory lenders | Less credit-building opportunity |
| Wealth buffer | Less savings for emergencies | More likely to miss payments during hardship |
| Alternative financial services | Check cashers, payday loans | Not reported positively, only negatively |

### Geographic Concentration

**Formerly Redlined Areas Today**

| Metric | Formerly "A" (Green) | Formerly "D" (Red) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Home values | 50% higher | Baseline |
| Home appreciation (1980-2020) | 238% | 194% |
| Poverty rate | 8% | 22% |
| Black population share | 12% | 48% |
| Mortgage denial rate | 9% | 19% |

## Ongoing Discrimination

### Lending Discrimination

**Evidence of Continued Disparate Treatment**

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| CFPB (2023) | Black applicants 40% more likely to be denied after controlling for credit |
| Federal Reserve (2022) | Minority applicants receive higher rates even with same credit profile |
| Urban Institute (2021) | Same-day mystery shopping found different treatment by race |
| NCRC (2020) | Black borrowers steered to FHA when eligible for conventional |

**Forms of Current Discrimination**

| Type | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Disparate treatment | Different treatment of similarly-situated applicants |
| Disparate impact | Neutral policies with discriminatory effect |
| Steering | Directing minorities to higher-cost products |
| Discouragement | Deterring applications from protected groups |
| Redlining 2.0 | Digital marketing excluding minority areas |

### Appraisal Bias

**How Bias Enters Valuations**

| Source | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Comparable selection | Appraisers choose which sales to compare |
| Neighborhood assessment | Subjective views of area quality |
| "Highest and best use" | Judgment calls favor majority white areas |
| Photos and descriptions | Reveal race of current owners |
| Appraiser demographics | 84% white, may not know minority markets |

**Evidence of Appraisal Bias**

| Study | Method | Finding |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Brookings (2018) | Cross-neighborhood comparison | Black homes valued $48K less than comparable white-area homes |
| Freddie Mac (2021) | Appraisal vs. contract analysis | Black neighborhoods 12.5% more likely undervalued |
| NYU Furman (2022) | Automated vs. human comparison | Human appraisals show larger race gap |
| Federal Reserve (2023) | Same-home refinance study | Values rise when Black owners hide race indicators |

### Algorithmic Discrimination

**How AI/ML Models Perpetuate Bias**

| Issue | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Training data | Historical loan data reflects past discrimination |
| Proxy discrimination | ZIP codes, education, names proxy for race |
| Black box models | Cannot explain adverse decisions |
| Validation testing | Often not tested for disparate impact |
| Feedback loops | Denied applicants don't generate data |

**Fintech Lending Disparities**

| Metric | Traditional Lenders | Fintech Lenders |
|--------|--------------------| ----------------|
| Black-white denial gap | 5.8 percentage points | 6.3 percentage points |
| Hispanic-white denial gap | 4.1 percentage points | 4.5 percentage points |
| Rate spread (minority borrowers) | +0.12% | +0.15% |

## Credit Scoring System

### FICO Model Limitations

**What FICO Measures (and Doesn't)**

| Counted Positively | Not Counted |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Credit card payments | Rent payments |
| Mortgage payments | Utility payments |
| Auto loans | Insurance payments |
| Student loans | Cell phone bills |
| Personal loans | Savings behavior |

**Factors Penalizing Marginalized Groups**

| Factor | Effect | Disproportionate Impact |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| Length of credit history | 15% of score | Hurts young, immigrants |
| Credit mix | 10% of score | Penalizes those without multiple products |
| Credit utilization | 30% of score | Hurts those with low limits |
| Hard inquiries | Hurts score | Rate shopping penalized |
| Medical debt | Lowers score | Disproportionately Black/brown |

### Credit Invisibility

**Who Lacks Credit Scores**

| Group | Credit Invisible Rate |
|-------|----------------------|
| Overall U.S. | 10% (26 million) |
| Black adults | 15% |
| Hispanic adults | 12% |
| Rural residents | 14% |
| Young adults (18-24) | 18% |
| Recent immigrants | 28% |

**Causes of Credit Invisibility**

- No credit cards or loans
- Use of alternative financial services not reported
- Recent immigration
- Historical exclusion from banking
- Distrust of financial system

### Alternative Data Challenges

**Potential and Pitfalls of Alternative Data**

| Data Type | Potential Benefit | Risk |
|-----------|-------------------|------|
| Rent payments | +5% could qualify | Only reported if landlord participates |
| Utility payments | +3% score improvement | Payment history may reflect poverty |
| Bank account activity | Shows financial capacity | Could reveal race/income patterns |
| Employment verification | Stability indicator | Gig workers disadvantaged |
| Education data | Predictive of repayment | Perpetuates educational inequality |

## Down Payment Barriers

### The Wealth Prerequisite

**Down Payment Requirements as Wealth Test**

| Down Payment | Amount ($400K home) | Years to Save (Median Income) |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| 3% (FHA minimum) | $12,000 | 1.5 years |
| 5% (conventional) | $20,000 | 2.5 years |
| 10% | $40,000 | 5 years |
| 20% (no PMI) | $80,000 | 10 years |

**Plus Closing Costs and Reserves**

| Additional Requirement | Typical Amount |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Closing costs | 2-5% ($8K-$20K) |
| Cash reserves | 2 months payments ($5K) |
| Total cash needed (3% down) | $25,000-$37,000 |

### Family Wealth Transfer

**Gift Assistance in Home Purchase**

| Buyer Demographics | Received Gift | Median Gift Amount |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| White first-time buyers | 26% | $58,000 |
| Black first-time buyers | 9% | $22,000 |
| Hispanic first-time buyers | 12% | $29,000 |
| All first-time buyers | 21% | $45,000 |

### PMI Penalty

**Cost of Low Down Payment**

| Down Payment | PMI Cost (annual) | Lifetime PMI Cost |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 3% | $3,600 | $18,000+ |
| 5% | $2,800 | $12,000+ |
| 10% | $1,600 | $6,000+ |
| 20% | $0 | $0 |

PMI perpetuates wealth inequality: those without inherited wealth pay more.

## Structural Market Factors

### Lender Incentives

**Why Lenders May Underserve Minority Markets**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Smaller loan amounts | Less profit per transaction |
| Perceived higher risk | Even if data doesn't support |
| Fewer branches in minority areas | Less relationship lending |
| Automation favors prime | Algorithms optimize for "clean" applications |
| Servicing challenges | Older housing stock needs more work |

### GSE Underwriting Standards

**How GSE Standards Exclude**

| Standard | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Credit score minimums | Below 620 effectively excluded |
| DTI limits | 43-50% max excludes gig workers |
| Employment verification | W-2 required; self-employed harder |
| Appraisal requirements | Undervaluation kills deals |
| Property standards | Older housing in minority areas may fail |

### FHA Constraints

**FHA Limitations**

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Mortgage insurance premium | Adds cost, never cancels |
| Loan limits | Cannot buy in high-cost areas |
| Property standards | Strict requirements exclude older homes |
| Seller concession limits | Less flexibility in negotiations |
| Stigma | Some sellers prefer conventional offers |

## Enforcement Gaps

### Weak Fair Lending Enforcement

**Fair Lending Enforcement Resources**

| Agency | Fair Lending Staff | Annual Budget |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| DOJ Housing Section | ~45 attorneys | $12 million |
| HUD FHEO | ~500 staff | $80 million |
| CFPB Fair Lending | ~100 staff | $50 million |
| OCC Fair Lending | ~30 examiners | $10 million |
| **Total** | **~675 staff** | **$152 million** |

Compared to industry with $12 trillion in mortgage debt and millions of transactions annually.

### Enforcement Outcomes

**Fair Lending Enforcement Actions (2015-2024)**

| Agency | Major Actions | Penalties Assessed |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| DOJ | 32 settlements | $890 million |
| HUD | 12 major cases | $120 million |
| CFPB | 8 major actions | $290 million |
| OCC/FDIC | 15 consent orders | $85 million |

**Comparison to Industry Revenue**

- Annual mortgage industry revenue: ~$100 billion
- Total penalties (10 years): ~$1.4 billion
- Penalties as share of revenue: 0.14%

### Evidentiary Challenges

**Why Discrimination Is Hard to Prove**

| Challenge | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Individual vs. pattern | Single cases hard to prove |
| Disparate impact defense | Business justification accepted |
| Discovery limitations | Hard to access lender data |
| Statute of limitations | 2 years for private action |
| Standing requirements | Must prove individual harm |
| Arbitration clauses | Forced out of court |

## Market Structure Issues

### Non-Bank Dominance

**Shift to Less-Regulated Lenders**

| Lender Type | Market Share 2010 | Market Share 2024 |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Banks | 52% | 34% |
| Credit unions | 7% | 8% |
| Independent mortgage banks | 35% | 46% |
| Fintech | 6% | 12% |

Non-banks face less rigorous CRA and fair lending examination.

### Servicing Concentration

**Problems with Concentrated Servicing**

| Issue | Risk |
|-------|------|
| Too-big-to-fail servicers | Systemic risk |
| Servicing transfers | Lost paperwork, errors |
| Conflict of interest | Foreclosure may be more profitable |
| Understaffed | Poor customer service |
| Inconsistent modification | Different treatment for similar borrowers |

### Investor Competition

**Institutional Buyers Crowding Out First-Time Buyers**

| Factor | Advantage for Investors |
|--------|------------------------|
| All-cash offers | Beat financed buyers |
| Bulk purchases | Volume discounts |
| Speed | Close in days |
| As-is purchases | No inspection contingencies |
| Market intelligence | Better data on values |
| Access to capital | Unlimited buying power |

## Systemic Issues

### Mortgage Interest Deduction

**Why MID Exacerbates Inequality**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Benefits itemizers only | 90% of renters don't benefit |
| Larger for expensive homes | More subsidy for wealthy |
| Phases out for high income | But mostly benefits upper-middle |
| Encourages larger mortgages | Tax incentive for more debt |
| Capitalizes into prices | May raise home prices |

**Distribution of MID Benefit**

| Income | Share of Benefits |
|--------|------------------|
| Top 20% | 63% |
| Middle 20% | 15% |
| Bottom 40% | 4% |

### GSE Conservatorship Limbo

**Effects of Indefinite Conservatorship**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| No clear affordable housing mission | Competing priorities |
| Treasury sweep of profits | No retained earnings for housing programs |
| Political football | Reform blocked by partisan disagreement |
| Implicit vs. explicit guarantee | Uncertainty about government backing |
| Private shareholder lawsuits | Distraction from public mission |

### Climate Risk Blind Spot

**Unpriced Climate Risk in Mortgages**

| Risk | Current Status |
|------|----------------|
| Flood risk | Often not disclosed; insurance gaps |
| Wildfire risk | Increasingly uninsurable in some areas |
| Sea level rise | Long-term property value decline |
| Heat exposure | Affects property values, habitability |
| Insurance availability | Some areas losing coverage |

## Interconnected Causes

### Feedback Loops

```text
Historical discrimination
    ↓
Lower Black homeownership/wealth
    ↓
Less inheritance → Higher down payment barrier
    ↓
Alternative financial services → Lower credit scores
    ↓
Higher denial rates → Lower homeownership
    ↓
Perpetuates wealth gap → Cycle continues
```

### Cumulative Disadvantage

**How Multiple Factors Compound**

| Factor | Individual Effect | Combined Effect |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Lower credit score | +2% denial rate | - |
| Black applicant | +5% denial rate | - |
| Minority neighborhood | +3% denial rate | - |
| Low down payment | +4% denial rate | - |
| **Combined** | - | **+14% denial rate** |

Effects compound rather than simply add.
