# Housing Finance: History

## Overview

The history of American housing finance is a story of government intervention creating both opportunity and injustice. From the Great Depression through the present, federal policy has shaped who can access mortgage credit and on what terms. The Federal Housing Administration, created in 1934, democratized homeownership for white Americans while explicitly excluding Black families through redlining. The savings and loan industry built the suburban middle class before collapsing in the 1980s. Government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expanded the mortgage market while privatizing gains and socializing losses. The subprime crisis of 2008 represented the culmination of decades of deregulation, predatory lending, and regulatory failure. Understanding this history is essential for designing a fairer system.

## Pre-New Deal Era (Before 1934)

### Early Mortgage Markets

**Characteristics of Pre-Depression Mortgages**

| Feature | Pre-1934 Norm | Challenge |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Down payment | 50%+ | Excluded most families |
| Term | 3-5 years | Required refinancing or balloon |
| Amortization | None (interest-only) | No equity building |
| Interest rate | Variable | Unpredictable costs |
| Lenders | Local banks, building & loan | Limited capital |

### The Depression Mortgage Crisis

**Impact of Great Depression on Housing**

| Year | Foreclosures | Home Prices | Unemployment |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1929 | 134,000 | Peak | 3% |
| 1932 | 273,000 | -31% | 24% |
| 1933 | 252,000 | -33% | 25% |
| 1934 | 230,000 | -31% | 22% |

- Over 1 million families lost homes between 1930-1935
- Half of all mortgages were in default by 1933
- Banks failed, cutting off credit entirely in many communities
- Building and loan associations collapsed nationwide

## New Deal Housing Finance (1934-1968)

### Creation of the FHA (1934)

**Federal Housing Administration Innovations**

| Innovation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Mortgage insurance | Reduced lender risk, expanded lending |
| Long-term amortizing loans | 20-30 year terms with principal paydown |
| Low down payments | Reduced from 50% to 20%, then 10% |
| Standardized appraisals | Created national underwriting standards |
| Minimum property standards | Improved housing quality |

**FHA Underwriting Manual (1936)**

The FHA Underwriting Manual explicitly mandated racial segregation:

> "If a neighborhood is to retain stability, it is necessary that properties shall continue to be occupied by the same social and racial classes."
>
> "Inharmonious racial or nationality groups" were grounds for refusing insurance.

### Redlining: Federal Policy of Discrimination

**Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) Maps**

| Grade | Description | FHA Treatment |
|-------|-------------|---------------|

| B (Blue) | "Still desirable" - stable, white | Insurance available |
| C (Yellow) | "Declining" - older, infiltration | Limited insurance |
| D (Red) | "Hazardous" - Black, immigrant | No insurance |

**Redlining Statistics**

|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| White | 65% | Full access |

### Private Sector Discrimination

Beyond government policy, private actors enforced segregation:

## Lessons from History

### Patterns That Repeat

| Pattern | Historical Example | Current Risk |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Government enabling discrimination | FHA redlining | Algorithmic bias |
| Deregulation leading to crisis | S&L crisis, subprime | Fintech lending gaps |
| Privatizing gains, socializing losses | GSE bailout | GSEs still in conservatorship |
| Predatory targeting of minorities | Subprime lending | Digital marketing discrimination |
| Regulatory capture | OCC preemption | Industry influence on FHFA |

### Key Takeaways

1. **Government policy shaped the racial wealth gap** - FHA discrimination was explicit and devastating
2. **Deregulation without oversight creates crises** - S&L and subprime both followed deregulation
3. **Private sector will discriminate without enforcement** - Fair lending requires active enforcement
4. **Implicit government backing creates moral hazard** - GSE structure invites risk-taking
5. **Crisis response determines recovery equity** - 2008 response prioritized banks over borrowers
