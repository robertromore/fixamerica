### First-Generation Homebuyer Act

**Purpose**: Provide down payment assistance to first-generation homebuyers to address intergenerational effects of housing discrimination.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "First-Generation Homebuyer Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The federal government explicitly excluded Black Americans
    from FHA-insured mortgages from 1934 to 1968, preventing
    wealth accumulation during the greatest housing boom in
    American history.
(2) The effects of this exclusion persist: Black homeownership
    is lower today than in 2000, and the racial wealth gap has
    widened.
(3) First-generation homebuyers—those whose parents did not own
    homes—face significant barriers due to lack of inherited
    wealth for down payments.
(4) Targeting assistance to first-generation buyers addresses
    the legacy of discrimination without using race as a
    criterion.

SEC. 3. FIRST-GENERATION HOMEBUYER TAX CREDIT.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1
    of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding:

"SEC. 36C. FIRST-GENERATION HOMEBUYER CREDIT.

first-generation homebuyer, there shall be allowed as a credit
against the tax imposed by this subtitle an amount equal to 10
percent of the purchase price of the principal residence, not to
exceed $25,000.

"(b) FIRST-GENERATION HOMEBUYER.—For purposes of this section, an
individual is a first-generation homebuyer if:
    (1) the individual has not owned a principal residence during
        the 3-year period ending on the date of the purchase; and
    (2) the individual's parents or legal guardians did not own a
        home during any period in which the individual was a minor.

"(c) INCOME LIMITATION.—The credit under this section shall be
reduced (but not below zero) by $500 for each $1,000 by which the
taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds 150 percent of
the area median income for the area in which the residence is
located.

"(d) REFUNDABILITY.—The credit under this section shall be
treated as a refundable credit under subpart C.

"(e) RECAPTURE.—
    (1) If the taxpayer disposes of the residence within 5 years
        of purchase, except by reason of death, the credit shall
        be recaptured at a rate of 20 percent per year remaining.
    (2) No recapture shall apply if the disposition is due to
        divorce, loss of employment, or other hardship as
        determined by the Secretary.

"(f) ADMINISTRATION.—The Secretary shall prescribe regulations
necessary to carry out this section, including verification of
first-generation status."

        median income;
    (3) Complete a HUD-approved homebuyer education course; and
    (4) Occupy the residence as a principal residence.

(d) PRIORITY.—In awarding grants, priority shall be given to:
    (1) Applicants in census tracts with homeownership rates below
        50 percent;
    (2) Applicants in census tracts formerly designated as
        "hazardous" or "declining" in HOLC maps; and
    (3) Applicants with income below 80 percent of area median
        income.

(e) REPAYMENT.—
    (1) Grants shall be structured as forgivable loans.
    (2) The loan shall be forgiven at a rate of 20 percent per
        year for each year the recipient maintains the residence

    (3) If the recipient sells or ceases to occupy the residence
        within 5 years, the unforgiven portion shall be repaid.

## Regulatory Framework

### CFPB Algorithm Testing Regulation

**Draft Regulatory Text**:

```text
PART 1002—EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT (REGULATION B)

§ 1002.15 Automated Decision Systems.

(a) Annual Testing Requirement.
    (1) Any creditor using an automated decision system in
        connection with a credit decision shall conduct annual
        testing for disparate impact.
    (2) Testing shall be conducted using a statistically valid
        methodology that measures outcomes by race, ethnicity,
        sex, and age.
    (3) Testing shall control for legitimate, non-discriminatory
        underwriting factors.

(b) Documentation.
    (1) Creditors shall maintain documentation of all automated
        decision systems, including model specifications, training
        data, validation results, and testing outcomes.
    (2) Documentation shall be retained for not less than 7 years.
    (3) Documentation shall be made available to the Bureau upon
        request.

(c) Remediation.
    (1) If testing reveals disparate impact, the creditor shall
        take steps to remediate the disparity.
    (2) Remediation may include model adjustment, variable
        removal, or alternative decision processes.
    (3) Remediation efforts and outcomes shall be documented.

(d) Adverse Action Notices.
    (1) When an automated decision system contributes to an
        adverse action, the notice shall include the specific
        factors that most influenced the decision.
    (2) Generic or boilerplate explanations do not satisfy this
        requirement.
```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**

| Federal Action | Constitutional Basis |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Fair lending regulation | Commerce Clause (mortgage market is interstate) |
| GSE regulation | Spending Clause (government guarantee) |
| Tax credits | Taxing and Spending Clause |
| CRA expansion | Commerce Clause |

**Equal Protection Considerations**

| Program | Analysis |
|---------|----------|
| First-generation buyer assistance | Facially neutral; targets intergenerational exclusion |
| Appraisal bias remediation | Addresses documented discrimination |
| Alternative credit | Expands access without racial classification |

### Preemption Questions

**Federal-State**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| State fair lending laws | Federal law is floor, not ceiling |
| State appraisal regulation | State licensing, federal standards |
| State CRA laws | May supplement federal |

**OCC Preemption**

The OCC has historically preempted state consumer protection laws for national banks. Legislation should clarify that state fair lending laws apply to all lenders.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Fair Lending Modernization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Testing methodology manipulation | Creditors could use methodologies designed to minimize finding disparities | High |
| Variable substitution | Replace prohibited proxies with other correlated variables | High |
| Model registration gaming | Provide incomplete information, claim trade secrets | Medium |
| Small lender exemption abuse | Structure to avoid thresholds | Medium |
| Compliance delay | Challenge regulations, delay implementation | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Enforcement resources still limited | Even increased funding may be insufficient | Budget constraints |
| CRA for non-banks voluntary compliance | May not reach worst actors | Industry lobbying |
| No private right of action for algorithm disclosure | Limits enforcement | Political feasibility |
| Disparate impact defense available | Business necessity still applies | Legal precedent |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Testing methodology standardization**: Bureau shall prescribe specific approved methodologies
2. **Proxy variable registry**: Maintain list of prohibited proxies, updated regularly
3. **Model registration audits**: Random audits of registered models
4. **Threshold anti-structuring**: Aggregate affiliated entities
5. **Expedited implementation**: Compressed comment and effective date periods

### First-Generation Homebuyer Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| First-generation status fraud | False claims about parent homeownership | High |
| Income manipulation | Shift income to qualify | Medium |
| Straw buyers | Use eligible person for ineligible buyer | Medium |
| Flip and repay | Refinance immediately to extract credit | Medium |
| Area median income gaming | Relocate to lower-AMI area | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Verification challenges | Proving parent non-ownership is difficult | Data limitations |
| Funding uncertainty | Appropriations subject to annual debate | Budget process |
| Home prices may rise | Subsidies capitalized into prices | Market dynamics |
| Doesn't address ongoing discrimination | One-time assistance | Program scope |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Verification requirements**: IRS records, signed attestations with penalty of perjury
2. **Anti-fraud enforcement**: HUD IG oversight, fraud hotline
3. **Supply-side investments**: Pair with housing production funding
4. **Price impact monitoring**: Annual assessment of market effects
5. **Mandatory appropriations**: Move to direct spending

### Appraisal Fairness and Transparency Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Training without effect | Complete training without changing behavior | Medium |
| Reconsideration denial | Lenders rubber-stamp original appraisal | Medium |
| Comparable selection workarounds | Find technical justifications for exclusion | High |
| Testing avoidance | Know testing patterns, adjust behavior | Medium |
| Pipeline program capture | Existing appraisers dominate programs | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Implicit bias is hard to eliminate | Training has limited effect | Human psychology |
| Pipeline takes years | Diversity won't change quickly | Apprenticeship requirements |
| AVM bias harder to detect | Algorithmic bias more opaque | Technical complexity |
| Individual enforcement difficult | Pattern-or-practice easier | Evidentiary challenges |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Training effectiveness testing**: Post-training assessment, outcome monitoring
2. **Reconsideration oversight**: Report outcomes to FHFA/HUD
3. **Comparable documentation**: Detailed justification required
4. **Covert testing**: Random testing program
5. **Accelerated pipeline**: Reduce apprenticeship barriers while maintaining quality

### GSE Reform and Affordable Housing Mission Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Goal gaming | Meet goals with loans that marginally qualify | High |
| Duty to serve minimization | Technical compliance without impact | Medium |
| Capital retention diversion | Use retained earnings for non-mission purposes | Medium |
| Guarantee fee diversion | Pressure to reduce fees for market share | Medium |
| Executive compensation gaming | Metrics manipulation | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Shareholder pressure | Private ownership creates profit pressure | Structural |
| Market competition | May take risks to compete with private label | Market dynamics |
| Political interference | Goals could be weakened by future administrations | Political process |
| Climate risk unaddressed | Legislation doesn't price climate risk | Scope limitation |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Outcome-based goals**: Measure actual impact, not just volume
2. **Duty to serve enforcement**: Specific metrics with consequences
3. **Capital use restrictions**: Mission-related investment requirements
4. **Guarantee fee floor**: Minimum fee dedicated to affordable housing
5. **Compensation claw-backs**: Recover bonuses if goals not met

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Industry lobbying | Public interest representation in rulemaking |
| Regulatory capture | Cooling-off periods, revolving door restrictions |
| Enforcement gap | Dedicated funding, insulated from appropriations |
| Data limitations | Expanded reporting requirements |
| Judicial narrowing | Clear statutory language, legislative history |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All provisions should include:

- **5-year GAO evaluation** of effectiveness
- **Annual agency reporting** on implementation and outcomes
- **Automatic threshold adjustments** for inflation
- **Stakeholder feedback mechanisms** for ongoing refinement
- **Congressional oversight hearings** annually
