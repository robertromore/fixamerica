# Housing Finance: Current State

## Overview

The U.S. mortgage market in 2024-2025 operates in a transformed environment. After decades of historically low interest rates, the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting rate increases pushed mortgage rates from 3% to over 7%, dramatically reducing affordability and transaction volume. Home purchase originations fell 50% from their 2021 peak. The market has bifurcated: homeowners locked into low-rate mortgages are reluctant to sell, while prospective buyers face both high prices and high rates. Meanwhile, structural issues persist - discriminatory lending patterns continue despite fair lending laws, GSEs remain in conservatorship 16 years after the financial crisis, and institutional investors have emerged as powerful competitors to individual homebuyers.
