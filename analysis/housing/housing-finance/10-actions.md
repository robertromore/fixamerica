Dear [Representative/Senator],

As your constituent, I urge you to support reforms to make
housing finance fairer and more accessible.

[Choose relevant issues]:
- Strengthen fair lending enforcement at CFPB and HUD
- Support down payment assistance for first-generation homebuyers
- Ensure GSE reform maintains affordable housing mission
- Remove medical debt from credit reports
- Address racial bias in home appraisals

The homeownership gap between white and Black Americans has

failure that requires action.

Thank you for your attention to this important issue.
