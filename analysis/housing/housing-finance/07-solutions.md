# Housing Finance: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming America's housing finance system requires a multi-pronged approach addressing fair lending enforcement, credit access, down payment barriers, appraisal bias, GSE reform, and mortgage subsidies. No single intervention can solve the interconnected problems of discrimination, exclusion, and inequality. This document presents a comprehensive reform agenda organized by policy area, with evidence-based solutions ranging from near-term administrative actions to long-term structural reforms.

## Fair Lending Enforcement

### Strengthen Disparate Impact Standards

**The Problem**

The Supreme Court in *Texas Department of Housing v. Inclusive Communities* (2015) upheld disparate impact claims under the Fair Housing Act but narrowed the standard. Subsequent administrations have weakened enforcement.

**Solutions**

| Action | Mechanism | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Codify disparate impact in ECOA | Legislation | Remove doubt about standard |
| Restore robust HUD disparate impact rule | Regulation | Clear enforcement framework |
| Require adverse impact testing | GSE seller/servicer requirements | Industry accountability |
| Fund fair lending testing programs | Appropriations | Detect discrimination |

### Algorithmic Accountability

**The Problem**

Fintech lenders use AI/ML models that may discriminate without explicit racial factors. Current fair lending frameworks were designed for human decisions.

**Solutions**

| Solution | Description | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Algorithm auditing requirements | Regular disparate impact testing of models | CFPB rulemaking |
| Model explainability mandates | Lenders must explain adverse decisions | Legislation or regulation |
| Prohibited proxy variables | Ban use of factors highly correlated with race | Regulation |
| Public model registries | Require registration and testing | New program |
| Whistleblower protections | Protect employees who report bias | Legislation |

### Enforcement Resources

**Current Staffing vs. Need**

| Agency | Current Fair Lending Staff | Recommended Level |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| DOJ Housing Section | ~45 | 150 |
| HUD FHEO | ~500 | 1,000 |
| CFPB Fair Lending | ~100 | 250 |
| Bank regulators combined | ~30 | 100 |

**Funding Proposal**

- Triple DOJ fair lending enforcement budget
- Double HUD fair housing investigation capacity
- Expand CFPB fair lending office
- Create interagency fair lending task force

## Credit Scoring Reform

### Alternative Credit Data

**Expanding What Counts**

| Data Type | Potential Impact | Implementation Challenge |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Rent payments | Could qualify 5+ million borrowers | Landlord reporting infrastructure |
| Utility payments | 3-5% score improvement average | Utility cooperation |
| Bank account activity | Alternative to credit history | Privacy concerns |
| Cell phone payments | Young adult credit building | Carrier participation |

**Policy Options**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Mandatory rent reporting | Universal coverage | Landlord burden, privacy |
| Opt-in rent reporting | Consumer choice | Limited adoption |
| GSE requirement | Market incentive | Limited to GSE loans |
| Tax credit for reporters | Incentivizes participation | Cost |

### Medical Debt Reform

**The Problem**

Medical debt in collections affects credit scores despite often being involuntary and disputed. Black and Hispanic adults have medical debt at twice the rate of white adults.

**Solutions**

| Solution | Mechanism | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Remove medical debt from credit reports | Legislation | Proposed (S. 2117) |
| Longer waiting period before reporting | Regulation | CFPB proposed 1 year |
| Verification requirements | Must verify before reporting | State laws vary |
| Exclude paid medical debt | Credit bureau voluntary action | Already implemented |

### Credit Invisible Solutions

**For 26 Million Credit Invisible Americans**

| Solution | Target Population | Mechanism |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Bank account data scoring | Those with checking accounts | VantageScore 4.0 |
| Rent reporting programs | Renters | Experian Boost, similar |
| Public credit registry | All | Government alternative to private bureaus |
| Credit builder programs | Low-income | Nonprofit programs |
