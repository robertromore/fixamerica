# Housing Finance: Overview

America's housing finance system is a vast, complex infrastructure that enables most households to purchase homes through mortgage credit. The system is dominated by government involvement: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Government-Sponsored Enterprises or GSEs) guarantee nearly half of all mortgages, the FHA insures loans for first-time and lower-income buyers, and the mortgage interest deduction costs taxpayers over $30 billion annually. Yet despite this massive public investment, the system produces deeply unequal outcomes. Black and Hispanic borrowers are denied mortgages at rates 40-80% higher than white borrowers with similar financial profiles. Black-owned homes are appraised at values 23% lower than comparable white-owned homes. The subprime crisis of 2008, which devastated minority communities, resulted from predatory lending that regulators failed to prevent. Today, institutional investors are outcompeting first-time buyers, fintech lenders operate with minimal fair lending oversight, and credit scoring systems perpetuate historical discrimination. The housing finance system requires fundamental reform to fulfill its promise of expanding homeownership fairly.
