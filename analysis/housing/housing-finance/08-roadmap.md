# Housing Finance: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Implementing comprehensive housing finance reform requires strategic sequencing that builds momentum, establishes precedents, and creates political conditions for more ambitious changes. This roadmap organizes reforms into phases based on political feasibility, implementation complexity, and dependencies between reforms. The strategy prioritizes executive actions that can be taken immediately, then regulatory reforms that build agency capacity, followed by legislative changes that require congressional action. Throughout, the approach emphasizes building coalitions, demonstrating success, and creating constituencies for further reform.

## Strategic Principles

### Sequencing Logic

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Start with executive authority | Use existing powers before seeking new ones |
| Build administrative capacity | Enforcement requires staff and systems |
| Create facts on the ground | Successful pilots enable expansion |
| Build political coalitions | Each victory expands support |
| Address opposition arguments | Demonstrate reforms work |
| Link to broader agendas | Connect to economic opportunity, racial equity |

### Political Context

| Factor | Implication for Timing |
|--------|----------------------|
| Presidential administration | Executive action window |
| Congressional composition | Legislative feasibility |
| Economic conditions | Crisis enables reform |
| Interest rate environment | Market conditions affect priorities |
| Court composition | Litigation risk assessment |
| Public attention | Capitalize on housing salience |
