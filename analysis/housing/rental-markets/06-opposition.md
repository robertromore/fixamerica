## Core Opposition Arguments

### Economic Arguments

**"Rent Control Reduces Supply"**

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Developers won't build | New construction often exempt |
| Landlords exit market | Limited evidence in well-designed policies |
| Housing quality declines | Maintenance requirements can address |
| Misallocation of housing | Vacancy decontrol can mitigate |

**Evidence Debate**:

- Context matters (exemptions, design)
- Long-term effects unclear

**"Market Solutions Work Better"**

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Build more, prices fall | New construction is expensive, doesn't help lowest-income |
| Subsidize demand, not supply | Vouchers without supply don't work |
| Filtering theory | Takes decades, doesn't reach bottom |
| Deregulation attracts investment | Investment seeks returns, not affordability |

### Property Rights Arguments

**Constitutional Claims**:

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Rent control is a "taking" | Courts have upheld rent regulation |
| Landlord contracts are sacrosanct | Police power allows regulation |
| Eviction is property right | Balanced by tenant due process |
| Government interference | Long history of landlord-tenant regulation |

**Case Law**:

- *Yee v. City of Escondido* (1992): Rent control not a taking
- *Pennell v. City of San Jose* (1988): Tenant hardship consideration upheld
- State constitutional challenges have generally failed

### Practical Arguments

**"Good Landlords Will Suffer"**

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Small landlords can't absorb costs | Small landlord exemptions possible |
| Mom-and-pop forced to sell | Corporate buyers are alternative problem |
| Retirement income threatened | Rent increases still allowed |
| Personal relationships harmed | Just cause protects good tenants |

**"Tenants Will Abuse Protections"**

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Non-payment will increase | Evidence from just cause states mixed |
| Tenants will damage property | Security deposits, habitability separate |
| Harder to remove problem tenants | Just cause allows for-cause eviction |
| Squatters and fraud | Minimal; not addressed by no-cause |

**"Evictions Will Take Forever"**

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Courts will be clogged | Right to counsel reduces frivolous filings |
| Landlords can't recover units | Expedited process for cause still available |
| Delays cost money | Balance tenant stability against cost |
| Tenants game the system | Limited evidence of widespread abuse |
