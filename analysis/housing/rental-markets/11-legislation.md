# Rental Markets: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Tenant protections require legislation at multiple levels: federal law for baseline rights and funding, state law for core landlord-tenant regulations, and local ordinances for context-specific protections. This document provides model legislation for just cause eviction, rent stabilization, right to counsel, and related protections, along with analysis of potential loopholes and implementation challenges.

## Federal Legislation

### Tenant Protection Act

**Purpose**: Establish baseline federal tenant protections for properties receiving federal support or financing, and expand rental assistance.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
    (1) over 44 million American households rent their homes;
    (2) nearly half of renter households are cost-burdened, paying more
        than 30 percent of income for housing;
    (3) approximately 900,000 evictions occur annually, destabilizing
        families and communities;
    (4) eviction disproportionately affects women, people of color,
        and families with children;
    (5) housing stability is essential for employment, education,
        and health outcomes.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to—
    (1) establish baseline tenant protections for federally-supported housing;
    (2) expand rental assistance to serve all eligible households;
    (3) provide resources for eviction prevention and legal assistance.

```

**Explanation**: This bill establishes federal baseline protections for properties with federal involvement while expanding rental assistance. It leverages existing federal connections to housing (mortgages, subsidies, tax credits) to extend tenant protections without requiring new constitutional authority.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Constitutional: Commerce Clause limits on purely private transactions
- Political: Industry opposition, moderate Democrat concerns
- Practical: Enforcement mechanisms, coordination with states

**Refinements**:

- Phase in coverage by property type
- Allow state opt-out with equivalent protections
- Increase funding for enforcement

### Fair Chance Housing Act

**Purpose**: Limit use of criminal records in tenant screening nationally.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Fair Chance Housing Act".

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON BLANKET CRIMINAL RECORD EXCLUSIONS.

    (1) inquire about or consider arrest records not resulting in conviction;
    (2) apply blanket exclusions based on criminal history;
    (3) deny housing solely based on conviction record without
        individualized assessment.

(b) INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT.—Before denial based on conviction,
    landlord must consider—
    (1) Nature and severity of offense;
    (2) Time elapsed since offense;
    (3) Evidence of rehabilitation;
    (4) Relationship between offense and housing criteria.

(c) TIMING.—Criminal background check may not occur until after
    conditional approval of application.

(d) NOTICE.—Applicant must receive written notice and opportunity
    to respond before adverse action based on criminal history.

SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT.

Violations shall be enforced under Fair Housing Act procedures.
```

**Explanation**: Addresses discriminatory use of criminal records in housing, which disproportionately affects people of color and contributes to homelessness among formerly incarcerated people.

**Potential Challenges**: Industry claims about safety; enforcement complexity.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Takings Clause**:

| Claim | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Rent control as taking | Courts have upheld rent regulation (*Pennell v. San Jose*) |
| Just cause as taking | Property use remains; economic impact limited |
| Eviction moratoriums | Temporary restrictions generally upheld; duration matters |

**Due Process**:

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Notice | All model bills include notice requirements |
| Hearing | Eviction through court process |
| Rational basis | Housing stability is legitimate government interest |

### Preemption Questions

**State-Federal**:

- Federal law generally does not preempt stronger state protections
- Fair Housing Act sets floor, not ceiling
- Federal subsidy programs may impose additional requirements

**State-Local**:

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Rent control preemption | 37 states prohibit local rent control |
| Just cause preemption | Less common but exists |
| Savings clause | Model bills preserve local authority |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|-----------|---------------|
| Private right of action | Empowers tenants |
| Agency enforcement | Requires resources |
| Court defense | Available in eviction |
| Penalties | Deter violations |
| Attorney fee shifting | Enables representation |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Model Just Cause Eviction Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Single-family exemption | Corporate owners can evade through LLC structure | High |
| 12-month occupancy threshold | Tenants vulnerable in first year | Medium |
| Owner move-in abuse | False claims to remove tenants | High |
| Substantial rehabilitation pretext | Over-claim repairs to force vacancy | High |
| Good faith standard | Difficult to prove bad faith | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No rent cap pairing | Constructive eviction through unaffordable increases | Separate bill often |
| Relocation assistance inadequate | One month insufficient for moving costs | Political compromise |
| Enforcement burden on tenant | Must bring action to assert rights | Resource asymmetry |
| No administrative enforcement | Individual litigation only | Cost concerns |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Close single-family exemption for corporate owners by defining "owner" as natural person
2. Reduce occupancy threshold to 60 days or eliminate
3. Require affidavit of intent for owner move-in with 3-year occupancy requirement and penalty for false statement
4. Define substantial rehabilitation to require building permits and specific cost threshold
5. Create rebuttable presumption of bad faith for pattern of no-fault evictions
6. Pair just cause with rent stabilization
7. Increase relocation assistance to 2-3 months
8. Create agency enforcement mechanism with investigation authority

### Model Rent Stabilization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| New construction exemption | 15-year rolling exemption delays coverage | Medium |
| Vacancy decontrol | 10% vacancy increase can accumulate | Medium |
| Passthrough abuse | Over-claim capital improvements | Medium |
| Unit reconfiguration | Combine or split units to evade | Medium |
| Corporate single-family | May claim exemption | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Inflation-linked cap | High inflation undermines protection | Economic volatility |
| No local authority | State bill may preempt stronger local | Political compromise |
| Banking provision | Can lead to large cumulative increases | Landlord concession |
| Limited passthrough oversight | Agency may lack capacity | Funding constraints |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Shorten new construction exemption to 10 years
2. Limit cumulative vacancy increases over multiple turnovers
3. Require pre-approval for all passthrough increases with documentation
4. Define unit reconfiguration as evading rent stabilization
5. Explicitly exclude corporate-owned single-family homes from exemption
6. Cap annual increase at absolute dollar amount in high-inflation years
7. Preserve local authority to enact stronger protections
8. Fund robust enforcement agency

### Model Right to Counsel Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Income eligibility | 200% FPL may exclude working poor in high-cost areas | Medium |
| Phased implementation | Years of delay in some areas | Medium |
| Capacity constraints | Insufficient attorneys to meet demand | High |
| No holdover protection | Can proceed without counsel in some cases | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Funding sustainability | Depends on appropriations | Political variability |
| Geographic coverage gaps | Rural areas underserved | Attorney distribution |
| Quality variation | Not all representation equal | Provider capacity |
| Late intervention | Counsel may enter after case disadvantage | Timing of notice |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Raise income eligibility to 300% FPL or 80% AMI in high-cost areas
2. Accelerate implementation timeline with capacity building grants
3. Fund law school clinics, public defender expansion, pro bono coordination
4. Prohibit default judgment against any eligible tenant not offered counsel
5. Create dedicated sustainable funding stream (filing fees, recording fees)
6. Establish mobile/telephonic counsel for rural coverage
7. Create quality standards and monitoring
8. Require landlord to notify tenant of right to counsel before filing

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Industry litigation | Establish legislative intent clearly; fund defense of laws |
| Agency capture | Independent oversight; tenant board representation |
| Data collection gaps | Mandate reporting; fund research |
| Coordination failures | Interagency task forces; unified tenant services |
| Judicial education | Training on tenant protection laws for judges |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

1. All tenant protection legislation should include:
   - 5-year review requirement
   - Data collection mandate for outcome assessment
   - Advisory committee with tenant representation
   - Automatic renewal unless repealed
   - Annual reporting to legislature

2. Rent stabilization should include:
   - Annual cap formula review
   - Economic impact assessment
