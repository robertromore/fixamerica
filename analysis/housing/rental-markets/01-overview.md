# Rental Markets: Overview

## Executive Summary

America has become a renter nation, with over 44 million households (35%+ of all households) renting their homes. Yet rental housing policy remains stuck in a homeownership-obsessed framework that treats renters as temporary, transient, and less deserving of housing stability. The result is a rental market characterized by soaring rents, minimal tenant protections, and an eviction crisis that displaces nearly a million families annually.

Rent has outpaced income growth for decades. The typical renter now spends over 30% of income on housing, with millions spending 50% or more. When rent increases arrive, tenants have few options: most states allow landlords to raise rent by any amount, for any reason, with minimal notice. When tenants cannot pay, eviction proceedings move swiftly, often providing less time to respond than small claims court gives for traffic tickets.

The eviction crisis is a quiet catastrophe. Over 3.6 million eviction cases are filed annually, with roughly 900,000 resulting in actual evictions. Eviction records follow tenants for years, making it nearly impossible to secure stable housing again. This creates a downward spiral where eviction begets homelessness begets unemployment begets poverty.

Meanwhile, the rental market has transformed. Corporate landlords now own millions of single-family homes. Algorithmic pricing software coordinates rent increases across competing properties. Private equity firms buy up affordable housing and jack up rents. And short-term rentals remove housing from the long-term rental market entirely.

Reform requires a fundamental shift: recognizing that renters deserve housing stability, that the power imbalance between landlords and tenants requires legal correction, and that the rental market cannot self-regulate into affordability.

### What This Subtopic Does Not Cover

- Homeownership policy (see [Housing: Affordability](../affordability/01-overview.md))
- Zoning and housing supply (see [Housing: Zoning](../zoning/01-overview.md))
- Homelessness directly (though connected to eviction)
- Public housing stock (see parent [Housing Overview](../01-overview.md))

## Key Questions

1. **Why have rents risen so dramatically?** What drives rent increases beyond supply and demand?

2. **Does rent control work?** What does the evidence show about rent stabilization policies?

3. **Why is eviction so easy?** What explains America's landlord-friendly eviction laws?

4. **How do evictions perpetuate poverty?** What is the cascade effect of housing loss?

5. **Can we protect tenants without harming housing supply?** Is there a middle ground?

6. **What happened during COVID-19?** What did eviction moratoriums teach us about housing stability?

## Why This Matters

**Scale of Impact**: 44+ million renter households, 100+ million people affected

**Housing as Foundation**: Stable housing is the platform for employment, education, health

**Poverty Trap**: Eviction creates a downward spiral that is nearly impossible to escape

**Racial Justice**: Eviction falls disproportionately on Black women and people of color

**Health Outcomes**: Housing instability linked to worse physical and mental health

**Economic Costs**: Evictions cost communities billions in emergency services, homelessness

**Democratic Legitimacy**: A system that can displace you without cause undermines belonging

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Renter households | 44+ million (35%+) |
| Rent-burdened households (>30% income) | 21+ million (48%) |
| Severely burdened (>50% income) | 11+ million (25%) |
| Eviction filings annually | 3.6+ million |
| Actual evictions annually | ~900,000 |
| Median renter income | ~$43,000 |
| Median rent | ~$1,400/month |
| States with no rent control allowed | 37 |
| States without just cause eviction | 48 |

## The Problem in Context

### The Power Imbalance

**Landlord Advantages**:

- Can raise rent by any amount in most jurisdictions
- Can evict without stating cause in most states
- Access to tenant screening (blacklisting evicted tenants)
- Resources for legal representation in eviction court
- Ability to keep security deposits with minimal oversight
- Time advantage (eviction takes weeks; finding housing takes months)

**Tenant Disadvantages**:

- Limited housing options (low vacancy rates)
- Cannot easily relocate (jobs, schools, community)
- Few financial reserves
- Rarely have legal representation
- Eviction record follows for 7+ years
- Information asymmetry (landlords know market, laws)

### The Eviction Crisis

**Who Gets Evicted**:

- Disproportionately women (especially Black women)
- Families with children
- People with disabilities
- Low-income workers in unstable employment
- People without family safety nets

**Cascade Effects**:

- Job loss (can't maintain schedule without stable address)
- School disruption for children
- Health deterioration (stress, interrupted care)
- Homelessness (shelters, streets, couch surfing)
- Criminal legal system involvement
- Permanent housing instability

### The Changing Rental Landscape

**Corporate Ownership**:

- Private equity firms buying single-family homes
- 300,000+ single-family homes owned by largest investors
- Algorithmic rent-setting software (RealPage, Yardi)
- Maintenance cuts to maximize returns
- Aggressive eviction for minor violations

**Short-Term Rentals**:

- 1+ million properties on Airbnb/VRBO
- Removes housing from long-term rental market
- Drives up rents in tourist-adjacent areas
- Creates housing pressure in major cities
