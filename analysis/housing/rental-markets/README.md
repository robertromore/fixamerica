# Rental Markets: Overview

America has become a renter nation, with over 44 million households (35%+ of all households) renting their homes. Yet rental housing policy remains stuck in a homeownership-obsessed framework that treats renters as temporary, transient, and less deserving of housing stability. The result is a rental market characterized by soaring rents, minimal tenant protections, and an eviction crisis that displaces nearly a million families annually.
