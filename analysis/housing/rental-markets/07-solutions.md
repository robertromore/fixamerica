# Rental Markets: Solutions

## Overview

A comprehensive approach to fixing rental markets requires multiple interventions across rent regulation, eviction prevention, tenant protections, and housing assistance. No single reform will suffice; these policies work together to create a stable, affordable rental housing system.

## Rent Stabilization

### Types of Rent Regulation

| Type | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Strict rent control** | Caps on increases, no vacancy decontrol | Maximum tenant stability | Reduces landlord investment |
| **Rent stabilization** | Percentage caps, vacancy reset | Balances stability and market | Turnover resets to market |
| **Anti-gouging** | Emergency caps only | Prevents exploitation | No ongoing protection |
| **Vacancy control** | Limits increases even at turnover | Maintains affordability | Strongest opposition |

### Recommended Policy Design
