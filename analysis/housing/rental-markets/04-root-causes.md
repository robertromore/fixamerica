# Rental Markets: Root Causes

## Overview

The dysfunction of American rental markets is not accidental. It emerges from a confluence of policy choices, market structures, and power imbalances that systematically disadvantage tenants while protecting landlord interests. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective reforms.

## Structural Power Imbalance

### Inherent Asymmetry

**The Fundamental Disparity**:

| Dimension | Landlord | Tenant |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Time horizon | Can wait for new tenant | Must find housing immediately |
| Information | Knows market, laws, property | Often unaware of rights |
| Resources | Capital, legal access | Living paycheck to paycheck |
| Alternatives | Many potential tenants | Limited housing options |
| Legal expertise | Routine with eviction process | First-time court experience |
| Documentation | Keeps records, lease copy | May lack documentation |

**Market Dynamics**:

- Low vacancy rates give landlords leverage
- Housing is non-fungible (can't substitute)
- Moving costs are significant
- Community ties constrain mobility
- Children's schools limit options
- Disability access further constrains

### Information Asymmetry

**What Landlords Know**:

- Property condition history
- Market rent comparables
- Eviction process and timelines
- Legal requirements and loopholes
- Tenant screening options
- Government program requirements

**What Tenants Often Don't Know**:

- Their legal rights
- Habitability standards
- Proper notice requirements
- Eviction defenses
- Rent subsidy availability
- Complaint processes

## Legal Framework Favoring Landlords

### No-Cause Eviction

**The Problem**:

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| 48 states allow no-cause eviction | Tenants can be displaced without reason |
| Retaliation hard to prove | Complaints risk eviction |
| No tenure security | Landlords can remove at will |
| Rent negotiation weakness | Accept increase or leave |
| Organizing deterrent | Union activity risks housing |

**Comparison with Employment**:

- Employment-at-will criticized but has some protections
- Rental tenure even weaker than employment
- Housing loss more immediately catastrophic than job loss

### Eviction Court Design

**Pro-Landlord Procedures**:

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Short response times | 3-7 days to answer in some states |
| Summary process | Limited discovery, quick hearings |
| No automatic right to counsel | 97% of tenants unrepresented |
| Filing fees low for landlords | Easy to file repeatedly |
| Default judgments | 40-50% of tenants lose by no-show |
| No jury trial right (many states) | Judge-only proceedings |

**Court Access Barriers for Tenants**:

- Hearings during work hours
- Courthouses hard to reach without cars
- Process intimidating and confusing
- Legal jargon inaccessible
- Tight deadlines for responses

### Security Deposit Exploitation

**Structural Problems**:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| No limits in 30+ states | First/last/security = 3 months rent |
| Landlord controls funds | Can withhold without justification |
| Burden on tenant to sue | Small claims court for return |
| Pre-existing damage disputes | Tenant lacks documentation |
| Move-in costs prohibit mobility | Trapped in bad situations |

### Lease Terms

**One-Sided Contracts**:

- Adhesion contracts (take it or leave it)
- Waiver of rights often included
- Complex legal language
- Automatic rent increases
- Fee provisions buried in fine print
- Arbitration clauses limit court access

## Federal Policy Failures

### Homeownership Obsession

**Subsidy Imbalance**:

| Subsidy | Annual Amount | Beneficiaries |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Mortgage interest deduction | $30+ billion | Homeowners (mostly wealthy) |
| Property tax deduction | $15+ billion | Homeowners |
| Capital gains exclusion | $40+ billion | Home sellers |
| Section 8 vouchers | $28 billion | 2.3 million households |
| Gap | Owners receive 3x more | |

**Policy Bias**:

- Federal agencies promote ownership
- "Ownership society" rhetoric
- Renters seen as temporary/transient
- No federal renter protections
- HUD focused on ownership programs

### Insufficient Rental Assistance

**Section 8 Underfunding**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Households receiving vouchers | 2.3 million |
| Eligible households | 17+ million |
| Households on waiting lists | 2.5+ million |
| Average wait time | 2-8 years |
| Funding gap | Only 1 in 4 eligible receive help |

**Voucher Limitations**:

- Payment standards below market rent
- Landlord participation optional
- Source of income discrimination legal in 30+ states
- Administrative burdens
- Inspection delays

### Public Housing Disinvestment

**Decline of Public Stock**:

| Year | Public Housing Units |
|------|---------------------|
| 1994 | 1.4 million |
| 2000 | 1.2 million |
| 2010 | 1.1 million |
| 2020 | 960,000 |
| Change | -30% |

**Policy Choices**:

- No new construction since 1990s
- HOPE VI demolished more than replaced
- Faircloth Amendment caps units
- Chronic underfunding of maintenance
- Private management often failing

## State Pre-emption

### Blocking Local Action

**Pre-emption Map**:

| Pre-empted Protection | States |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Rent control | 37 states ban |
| Just cause eviction | Few states allow local |
| Source of income protection | Many pre-empt |
| Short-term rental regulation | Some pre-empt |
| Inclusionary zoning | Some pre-empt |

**Pre-emption Effect**:

- Cities cannot respond to local conditions
- Tenant organizing at city level neutered
- Corporate landlords write state law
- One-size-fits-all favors landlords
- Democratic local responses blocked

### Landlord Lobby Power

**State-Level Influence**:

| Lobby Activity | Impact |
|----------------|--------|
| Campaign contributions | Legislators beholden |
| Model legislation (ALEC) | Pro-landlord bills spread |
| Realtor associations | Oppose rent control |
| Apartment associations | Block tenant protections |
| Property rights framing | Constitutional claims |

## Market Failures

### Supply Constraints

**Why Supply Doesn't Solve Affordability**:

| Issue | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| New construction is expensive | Only profitable at high rents |
| Filtering takes decades | New luxury doesn't help today's poor |
| Land costs | Urban land prices prohibit affordable development |
| Construction costs | Labor and materials rising |
| Neighborhood opposition | NIMBYism blocks new housing |
| Zoning restrictions | Density limits constrain supply |

**Supply and Affordability**:

- More supply helps at median
- Does not create affordable units at bottom
- Luxury units don't filter down quickly
- Low-income requires subsidy

### Financialization

**Private Equity and Housing**:

| Trend | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Investor purchases | 25%+ of homes in some markets |
| REITs and institutional capital | Prioritize returns over residents |
| Short holding periods | Extract value, defer maintenance |
| High leverage | Pressure to raise rents |
| Quarterly earnings focus | Rent increases to meet targets |

**Algorithmic Pricing**:

| Problem | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| RealPage software | Coordinates pricing across competitors |
| Recommended rent levels | Optimizes for landlord revenue |
| Vacancy tolerance | Maintains higher vacancies for higher rents |
| Antitrust concerns | DOJ investigation ongoing |
| Collusion effect | Landlords follow same algorithm |

### Short-Term Rental Drain

**Housing Stock Removal**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active Airbnb listings (U.S.) | 1+ million |
| Listings removed from long-term | 500,000+ |
| Impact on rent (high-tourism areas) | +2-5% |
| Impact on availability | Significant in tourist cities |

## Wage Stagnation

### Rent vs. Income

**The Growing Gap**:

| Period | Rent Change | Income Change | Gap |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-----|
| 2000-2010 | +28% | +15% | 13 pts |
| 2010-2020 | +36% | +20% | 16 pts |
| 2020-2023 | +25% | +12% | 13 pts |

**Minimum Wage and Rent**:

- $7.25 federal minimum = $1,250/month gross
- Average 2BR rent = $1,600/month
- Would require 2.5 minimum wage jobs for fair market rent
- No state has minimum wage sufficient for median rent

### Benefits of Low-Wage Work

**Employer Housing Cost Externalization**:

- Low wages force workers into overcrowded housing
- Public assistance supplements inadequate wages
- Housing instability increases worker precarity
- Landlords extract what workers earn

## Discrimination

### Racial Discrimination

**Persistent Housing Discrimination**:

| Form | Prevalence |
|------|------------|
| Steering | Ongoing despite Fair Housing |
| Different terms offered | Documented in testing |
| Higher deposits/rent | Charged to Black tenants |
| Eviction targeting | Black renters evicted at higher rates |
| Section 8 discrimination | Black voucher holders more likely refused |

### Other Discrimination

| Group | Discrimination Pattern |
|-------|----------------------|
| Families with children | "Adult only" policies, steering |
| People with disabilities | Failure to accommodate, accessible unit shortage |
| Voucher holders | Refusal to accept, where legal |
| Immigrants | Documentation requirements, language barriers |
| Formerly incarcerated | Criminal background screening |

## Cultural Factors

### Renter Stigma

**Negative Perceptions**:

- Renters seen as transient
- Assumed less invested in community
- Associated with poverty
- Treated as second-class residents
- Political voice diminished

**Policy Implications**:

- "Homeowners vote, renters don't"
- Local politics favor owners
- Renter interests subordinated
- NIMBYism includes renter exclusion

### Property Rights Absolutism

**Ideology**:

- Property rights framed as fundamental
- Landlord as sovereign over property
- Tenant protections as "takings"
- Market fundamentalism
- Resistance to regulation
