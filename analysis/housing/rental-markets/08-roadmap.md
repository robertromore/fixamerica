# Rental Markets: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Transforming rental markets requires a sequenced strategy that builds political power, establishes precedents, and expands protections over time. This roadmap prioritizes achievable early wins while laying groundwork for more ambitious reforms.

## Strategic Principles

| 3 (Years 4-7) | Rent stabilization, assistance | Requires political groundwork |
| 4 (Years 7+) | Federal framework, pre-emption repeal | Long-term transformation |
