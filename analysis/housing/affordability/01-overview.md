# Housing Affordability: Overview

## Executive Summary

America faces its most severe housing affordability crisis since the Great Depression. Over 50 million households spend more than 30% of their income on housing, the threshold considered "cost-burdened." Nearly 28 million spend more than 50%, classified as "severely cost-burdened." The median home now costs over 7 times median household income, compared to 3.5 times in the 1980s. Rents have increased 150% since 2000 while median wages rose only 50%. This crisis undermines economic mobility, delays family formation, forces long commutes, and threatens retirement security for millions of Americans.

## The Core Problem

| Metric | Historical Norm | Current Reality |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Home price-to-income ratio | 3-4x | 7.5x nationally, 10-15x in coastal metros |
| Rent burden (% of income) | 25% | 35% median, 50%+ for low-income |
| Housing unit deficit | Balanced supply | 3.8-5.5 million unit shortage |
| Annual housing starts | 1.5-2 million needed | 1.4 million actual |
| First-time buyer age | 29 (1980s) | 36 (2024) |

## Why It Matters

**For Individuals and Families**

- Housing costs crowd out savings, retirement, healthcare
- Delays in marriage, childbearing, homeownership milestones
- Long commutes reduce quality of life and family time
- Housing instability harms children's education and development
- Elderly face displacement or poverty

**For the Economy**

- Workers cannot move to high-opportunity areas
- Businesses struggle to recruit in expensive metros
- Consumer spending suppressed by housing costs
- Wealth inequality widens as homeownership declines
- Homelessness creates public costs for healthcare and services

**For Society**

- Increasing segregation by income and race
- Growing wealth divide between owners and renters
- Political instability as young people feel locked out
- Community instability from frequent moves
- Environmental costs of sprawl and long commutes

## Scope

**This Topic Covers**

- Cost burden for renters and owners
- Home price and rent trends relative to income
- Geographic variation in affordability
- Supply constraints and housing shortage
- Construction costs and land prices
- Affordability for specific populations (seniors, essential workers, families)
- Measurement and affordability indexes

## Key Questions

1. How did housing become unaffordable relative to incomes?
2. What role do supply constraints play versus demand factors?
3. Why hasn't the market solved the affordability problem?
4. Who benefits from the current system?
5. What combination of policies can meaningfully improve affordability?
6. How do we balance affordability with existing homeowner interests?

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Cost burden | Spending 30%+ of income on housing |
| Severe cost burden | Spending 50%+ of income on housing |
| Area Median Income (AMI) | Midpoint of incomes in a geographic area |
| Affordable housing | Generally defined as affordable to households at 80% AMI or below |
| Very low income | Households earning 50% or less of AMI |
| Extremely low income | Households earning 30% or less of AMI |
| Housing supply elasticity | How quickly supply responds to price increases |
| Filtering | Process by which older housing becomes more affordable |
| Exclusionary zoning | Land use rules that restrict housing types/density |
| Inclusionary zoning | Requirements to include affordable units in new developments |

## The Scale of the Crisis

**Cost Burden by Income Level**

| Income Level | Share Cost-Burdened | Share Severely Burdened |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Extremely low income (<30% AMI) | 83% | 71% |
| Very low income (30-50% AMI) | 75% | 43% |
| Low income (50-80% AMI) | 52% | 18% |
| Moderate income (80-120% AMI) | 25% | 6% |
| Above moderate (>120% AMI) | 7% | 2% |

**Geographic Variation**

| Market Type | Median Home Price | Price/Income Ratio |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Coastal metros (SF, LA, NYC, Boston) | $800,000-$1.5M | 10-15x |
| Sun Belt metros (Austin, Phoenix, Denver) | $400,000-$600,000 | 6-8x |
| Midwest metros (Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland) | $250,000-$400,000 | 4-5x |
| Rural areas | $150,000-$250,000 | 3-5x |

## What's at Stake

**Current Reality**

- First-time homeownership rate at lowest level in 40 years
- 50% of renters are cost-burdened
- Average renter cannot afford a 2-bedroom in any state at minimum wage
- 600,000+ people homeless on any given night
- Eviction filings at 3.6 million per year

**Without Reform**

- Homeownership increasingly limited to inheritance recipients
- Essential workers priced out of communities they serve
- Economic mobility further declines
- Housing insecurity becomes generational
- Homelessness continues increasing

## The Path Forward

Addressing affordability requires:

1. **Significantly increasing supply** - Building millions more units, especially affordable units
2. **Reducing barriers** - Reforming zoning, permitting, construction regulations
3. **Protecting tenants** - Eviction protections, rent stabilization where appropriate
4. **Expanding assistance** - More vouchers, tax credits, subsidized development
5. **Preserving affordability** - Preventing displacement, maintaining existing affordable stock
6. **Addressing root causes** - Income support, wealth-building programs

No single intervention suffices. A comprehensive approach attacking multiple barriers simultaneously offers the best chance of meaningful improvement.
