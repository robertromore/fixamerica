# Housing Affordability: What Citizens Can Do

## Overview

Individual citizens can make meaningful contributions to housing affordability through voting, advocacy, organizing, and direct action. The housing crisis persists partly because those who benefit from scarcity are more politically engaged than those harmed by it. Changing this dynamic requires sustained civic participation.
