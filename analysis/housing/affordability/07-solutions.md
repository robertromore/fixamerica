# Housing Affordability: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Solution Criteria

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Impact scale | Will it meaningfully improve affordability for many? |
| Equity | Does it help those most in need? |
| Political feasibility | Can it be enacted and sustained? |
| Market compatibility | Does it work with or against market forces? |
| Sustainability | Will benefits persist long-term? |
| Side effects | Does it create unintended consequences? |

### Core Values

**Housing as a Right**

- Everyone deserves stable, affordable housing
- Market alone cannot provide for all
- Public intervention justified and necessary

**Production and Protection**

- Both supply increases AND tenant protections needed
- Not either/or but both/and
- Different tools for different parts of the problem

**Equity and Inclusion**

- Address racial and economic segregation
- Affirmatively further fair housing
- Include affected communities in solutions

## Supply-Side Solutions

### Zoning Reform

**Allow More Housing Types**

| Reform | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Legalize ADUs (accessory dwelling units) | Add millions of units in existing neighborhoods |
| Allow duplexes/triplexes in single-family zones | Gentle density without high-rises |
| Eliminate single-family-only zoning | Enable diverse housing types |
| Reduce minimum lot sizes | Allow smaller, affordable homes |
| End parking minimums | Reduce per-unit costs by $30-75K |
| Increase height limits near transit | Enable density where appropriate |

**Successful State Examples**

| State | Reform | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Oregon | HB 2001 (2019) | Legalized middle housing statewide |
| California | SB 9 (2021) | Allows lot splits and duplexes statewide |
| California | SB 10 (2021) | Streamlines rezoning near transit |
| Montana | SB 382 (2023) | Preempted local zoning restrictions |
| Minnesota | (Minneapolis 2040) | Eliminated single-family zoning |

**Implementation Keys**

| Factor | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| State preemption | Override local obstruction |
| By-right approval | Remove discretionary review |
| Form-based codes | Focus on design, not use |
| Anti-discrimination | Ensure reform doesn't increase segregation |

### Streamline Approvals

**Reduce Process Barriers**

| Reform | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| By-right approval for compliant projects | Eliminate discretionary denial |
| Environmental review reform | Exempt infill housing |
| Unified permit process | One-stop approval |
| Shot clock requirements | Automatic approval if deadline missed |
| Reduce hearing requirements | Limit NIMBY veto points |

**California CEQA Reforms**

| Reform | Status | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Transit-rich area exemption | Limited | Modest improvement |
| Infill exemption | Limited | Modest improvement |
| SB 35 streamlining | Active | Forces approval of compliant projects |
| Lawsuit reform | Pending | Would reduce litigation |

### Reduce Construction Costs

**Labor and Materials**

| Strategy | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Workforce development | Train more construction workers |
| Immigration reform | Allow construction workers |
| Prefab/modular housing | Factory-built reduces costs 20-40% |
| Building code modernization | Remove unnecessary requirements |
| Bulk purchasing | Lower material costs through scale |

**Land Costs**

| Strategy | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Public land for housing | Dispose of government land for affordable development |
| Land banking | Acquire land for future affordable development |
| Community land trusts | Remove land from speculative market |
| Transit-oriented development | Maximize value of public investments |

### Increase Density Where Appropriate

**Strategic Upzoning**

| Location | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Near transit | Access without cars |
| Commercial corridors | Buffer neighborhoods, use infrastructure |

**Best Practices**

| Practice | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Pair with density bonus | Offset costs to developers |
| Deep targeting for some units | Reach very low income |
| On-site preference | Avoid concentrating affordable housing |

| Rent stabilization | Reduces displacement for current tenants |

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Supply vs. Demand-Side Approaches

|----------|------|------|
| Supply-side | Market-leveraging, scalable | Slow, benefits may not reach lowest income |
| Demand-side | Immediate help, targetable | Expensive, may raise prices without supply |
| Both needed | Comprehensive | Requires political coalition |

### Local Control vs. State/Federal Action

| Level | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Local | Tailored to community | Often captured by NIMBYs |
| State | Can preempt obstruction | One-size-fits-all risk |
| Federal | Resources, scale | Slow, inflexible |

### Market vs. Non-Market Housing

| Approach | Role |
|----------|------|
| Market housing | Majority of production |
| Regulated market | Affordability requirements |
| Subsidized housing | Fill gaps market won't |
| Public/social housing | Serve lowest income |
