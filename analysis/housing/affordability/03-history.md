# Housing Affordability: History

## Origins

### The Postwar Housing Boom (1945-1970)

America emerged from World War II with severe housing shortages but built the most affordable housing market in developed world history through:

**Federal Interventions**

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| GI Bill (1944) | 4.3 million home loans to veterans |
| FHA mortgage insurance | Made 30-year mortgages standard |
| Highway Act (1956) | Enabled suburban development |
| Fannie Mae expansion | Created secondary mortgage market |
| Tax deductibility of mortgage interest | Subsidized homeownership |

**Production Achievement**

| Decade | Annual Housing Starts | Population Growth |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1940s | 500,000 (postwar years) | 19 million |
| 1950s | 1.5 million | 28 million |
| 1960s | 1.5 million | 24 million |

**Affordability Metrics (1960)**

- Median home price: $12,000
- Median household income: $5,600
- Price-to-income ratio: 2.1x
- Average mortgage rate: 5.5%
- Monthly payment on median home: $72
- Homeownership rate: 62%

### Exclusionary Foundations

The postwar housing boom was deeply inequitable:

**Discriminatory Practices**

| Practice | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| FHA redlining | Excluded Black neighborhoods from mortgage insurance |
| Restrictive covenants | Legally barred minority ownership in new suburbs |
| Blockbusting | Profited from racial fear, destroyed neighborhoods |
| Urban renewal | Displaced 1 million people, disproportionately minorities |
| Highway placement | Destroyed minority neighborhoods, isolated communities |

**Lasting Consequences**

- White homeownership rate: 65% (1960) to 74% (2024)
- Black homeownership rate: 38% (1960) to 44% (2024)
- Wealth gap attributable to housing: Estimated at $5 trillion

## Key Turning Points

### The 1970s: Inflation and Affordability Strain

**Economic Shocks**

| Event | Housing Impact |
|-------|----------------|

**Regulatory Changes**

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|

### The 1990s-2000s: Financialization and Boom

**Housing Finance Transformation**

**Supply-Constrained Recovery**

| Trend | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Underbuilding | 5.5 million units below needed production |
| NIMBY victories | Major projects blocked in growth areas |
| Construction labor shortage | 300,000 unfilled positions |

| 2012 | $156,000 | $728 | 3.0x |
| 2015 | $223,900 | $959 | 3.7x |

## Lessons from the Past

### What Worked

**High-Production Era (1945-1970)**

| Factor | Lesson |
|--------|--------|
| Strong federal support | Government investment can drive mass production |
| Standardized financing | Accessible mortgages enable ownership |
| Permissive zoning | Less regulation enabled rapid building |
| Infrastructure investment | Transportation access opened land for development |
| Economic growth shared | Rising wages made housing affordable |

**Successful Interventions**

| Program | Success Factors |
|---------|-----------------|
| GI Bill | Direct support, clear eligibility, simple process |
| Early FHA | Risk reduction enabled lending |
| LIHTC | Leverages private capital, creates partnerships |
| Mount Laurel doctrine | Required regional fair share of affordable housing |

### What Failed

**Policy Failures**

| Failure | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| Public housing high-rises | Concentrated poverty without support services fails |
| Urban renewal | Destruction without replacement harms communities |
| Subprime lending | Access without consumer protection causes harm |
| GSE privatization | Profit motive undermined public mission |
| Voucher-only approach | Without supply, assistance just raises prices |

**Regulatory Failures**

| Regulation | Problem |
|------------|---------|
| Exclusive zoning | Created artificial scarcity |
| CEQA/NEPA abuse | Environmental review weaponized to block housing |
| Parking minimums | Added unnecessary costs |
| Height limits | Prevented density where appropriate |
| Historic preservation overreach | Blocked infill development |

### Structural Lessons

**Why Affordability Eroded**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Wage stagnation | Incomes didn't keep pace with productivity or housing |
| Local control over land use | Enabled exclusion, blocked supply |
| Homeowner political power | Existing owners benefit from scarcity |
| Financialization | Housing as investment rather than consumption |
| Wealth inequality | Cash buyers and investors outcompete workers |

**What History Suggests**

1. **Supply matters**: Periods of adequate production had better affordability
2. **Government role essential**: Market alone never provided affordable housing for all
3. **Local control problematic**: Municipalities have incentive to exclude
4. **Discrimination persistent**: Fair housing requires active enforcement
5. **Finance structure matters**: How housing is financed shapes who can access it
