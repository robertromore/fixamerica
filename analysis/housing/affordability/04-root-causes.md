# Housing Affordability: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The housing affordability crisis results from multiple reinforcing factors that collectively restrict supply, inflate demand, and suppress household incomes. No single cause dominates; instead, a system of interlocking barriers perpetuates and deepens the crisis.

### The Supply-Demand Framework

**Simple Economics vs. Housing Reality**

| Standard Market | Housing Market |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Supply responds to price signals | Supply constrained by regulation, construction capacity |
| New entrants compete | High barriers to entry for builders |
| Prices reflect production costs | Prices reflect scarcity and location value |
| Consumers can substitute | Limited substitutes (must live somewhere) |
| Markets clear | Persistent shortages in desirable areas |

## Supply Constraints

### Regulatory Barriers

**Zoning Restrictions**

| Restriction Type | Effect | Prevalence |
|------------------|--------|------------|
| Single-family only zones | Prohibits apartments, townhomes | 75% of residential land in major metros |
| Minimum lot sizes | Increases per-unit land costs | Universal |
| Height limits | Prevents density | Universal |
| Floor area ratios | Caps building size | Common in cities |
| Setback requirements | Reduces buildable area | Universal |
| Parking minimums | Adds $30-75K per unit | Universal (declining) |
| Unit size minimums | Prevents smaller affordable units | Common |

**Cumulative Regulatory Impact**

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Glaeser & Gyourko (2018) | Regulation adds 50%+ to costs in expensive markets |
| Hsieh & Moretti (2019) | Zoning constraints cost $1.6 trillion annually in lost GDP |
| NAHB (2021) | Regulation accounts for 24% of single-family home price, 41% of multifamily |

**Development Process Barriers**

| Barrier | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Discretionary approval | Adds uncertainty, enables NIMBY opposition |
| Environmental review (CEQA/NEPA) | Abused to delay/block housing |
| Design review | Subjective standards, unpredictable |
| Multiple agency approvals | Extends timelines, increases costs |
| Lawsuit vulnerability | Threat of litigation adds risk premium |
| Community input requirements | Empowers opposition, lengthens process |

**Approval Timeline Costs**

| Jurisdiction Type | Typical Approval Time | Cost Impact |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Restrictive coastal metro | 2-5 years | +15-30% of project cost |
| Moderately regulated | 1-2 years | +8-15% of project cost |
| Streamlined process | 6-12 months | +3-5% of project cost |
| By-right development | 1-3 months | Minimal |

### Construction Costs

**Materials and Labor**

| Cost Component | Share of Total | Trend |
|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Labor | 40-50% | Rising, worker shortage |
| Materials | 30-40% | Volatile, supply chain issues |
| Land | 15-25% | Rising in high-demand areas |
| Soft costs (permits, design, fees) | 15-25% | Rising with regulations |

**Labor Shortage**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Workforce aging | Average construction worker is 43 |
| Immigration restrictions | Reduced labor supply |
| Career stigma | Young workers avoid trades |
| Training gaps | Apprenticeship programs declined |
| Post-2008 exodus | Workers left industry, didn't return |

**Labor Gap by Trade**

| Trade | Shortage Estimate |
|-------|------------------|
| Carpenters | 45% |
| Electricians | 35% |
| Plumbers | 30% |
| HVAC technicians | 25% |
| All construction | 650,000 workers |

### Land Costs

**Scarcity and Regulation**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Urban growth boundaries | Limit developable land |
| Agricultural preservation | Restricts conversion |
| Environmental protection | Limits building in sensitive areas |
| Infrastructure gaps | Undeveloped land lacks utilities |
| Zoning density limits | Even available land underutilized |

**Land Cost by Metro**

| Metro | Land Share of Home Price |
|-------|-------------------------|
| San Francisco | 75% |
| Los Angeles | 65% |
| New York | 60% |
| Boston | 55% |
| Seattle | 50% |
| Denver | 45% |
| Phoenix | 35% |
| Houston | 25% |

## Demand Factors

### Population and Household Growth

**Demographic Pressures**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Population growth | 2+ million annually (slowing) |
| Household formation | 1.2 million new households annually |
| Immigration | 1+ million annually |
| Declining household size | More households per capita |
| Aging in place | Seniors staying in homes longer |

**Household Formation Surge**

| Age Cohort | Households 2010 | Households 2024 | Change |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| 25-34 | 19.5 million | 22.8 million | +17% |
| 35-44 | 22.1 million | 24.5 million | +11% |
| 65+ | 26.3 million | 34.2 million | +30% |

### Investment Demand

**Financialization of Housing**

| Investor Type | Market Share | Strategy |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Individual investors | 18% of purchases | Rental income, appreciation |
| Small landlords (2-4 units) | 6% of purchases | Wealth building |
| Institutional investors | 3-5% of purchases | Portfolio diversification |
| iBuyers | 1-2% of market | Market arbitrage |
| Foreign investors | 2-4% of market | Capital preservation, speculation |

**Investment Impact**

| Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Price competition | Cash buyers win bidding wars |
| Supply withdrawal | Conversions to short-term rentals |
| Rent extraction | Maximize returns over tenant welfare |
| Land banking | Hold vacant lots for appreciation |
| Market concentration | Reduce competition, enable rent increases |

### Low Interest Rates (2009-2022)

**Cheap Money Effects**

| Rate Environment | Consequence |
|------------------|-------------|
| 3% mortgage rates | Increased buying power 30%+ |
| Low cap rates | Made investment properties profitable |
| Refinancing boom | Reduced selling pressure |
| Cash-out refinancing | Enabled investment purchases |
| Asset price inflation | Housing as inflation hedge |

## Income Stagnation

### Wage Growth vs. Housing Costs

**The Great Divergence**

| Period | Median Wage Growth | Median Home Price Growth | Rent Growth |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| 1950-1980 | +2.5% annually | +2.8% annually | +2.0% annually |
| 1980-2000 | +0.5% annually | +3.5% annually | +3.0% annually |
| 2000-2020 | +0.3% annually | +3.8% annually | +3.5% annually |
| 2020-2024 | +4.5% annually | +10% annually | +6% annually |

### Income Inequality

**Housing Affordability by Income Quintile**

| Income Quintile | Median Income | Affordable Rent | Affordable Home Price |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Bottom 20% | $16,000 | $400 | $48,000 |
| Second 20% | $35,000 | $875 | $105,000 |
| Middle 20% | $58,000 | $1,450 | $174,000 |
| Fourth 20% | $95,000 | $2,375 | $285,000 |
| Top 20% | $195,000 | $4,875 | $585,000 |

**Affordable Unit Availability**

| Income Level | Affordable Units Exist | Actually Available |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| <30% AMI (ELI) | 7.4 million | 3.5 million |
| 30-50% AMI (VLI) | 8.5 million | 5.2 million |
| 50-80% AMI (LI) | 15.2 million | 11.8 million |
| 80-120% AMI | 21.0 million | 19.5 million |

### Geographic Mismatch

**Jobs vs. Housing**

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Jobs concentrate in metros | High demand in specific areas |
| Housing restricted in job centers | Supply constrained where needed most |
| Affordable housing in suburbs | Far from jobs, requires cars |
| Reverse commutes | Workers commute from far, expensive cores |

**Commute Burden**

| Income Level | Average Commute Time | Workers with 60+ min commute |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Bottom quartile | 32 minutes | 18% |
| Middle quartile | 28 minutes | 12% |
| Top quartile | 24 minutes | 8% |

## Political Economy

### Homeowner Bias

**Political Incentives**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Homeowners vote more | 2x turnout of renters in local elections |
| Homeowners have wealth at stake | Direct financial interest in scarcity |
| HOAs and neighborhood groups | Organized opposition to development |
| Property tax dependence | Incentivizes exclusion |
| "Character" concerns | Code for exclusion |

**The Homevoter Hypothesis**

| Behavior | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| Support supply restrictions | Protects property values |
| Oppose affordable housing | Fear of "undesirable" neighbors |
| Support environmental review | Provides tool to block projects |
| Elect NIMBY officials | Representatives reflect constituent interests |

### Developer Incentives

**Why Affordable Housing Isn't Built**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Higher returns on luxury | Developers maximize profit per unit |
| Fixed costs spread over expensive units | More efficient at high price points |
| Affordable housing requires subsidy | Limited subsidy availability |
| Risk-adjusted returns | Affordable projects face more uncertainty |
| Financing barriers | Harder to get loans for affordable |

### Landlord Consolidation

**Concentration Effects**

| Trend | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Small landlords exiting | Less responsive to local markets |
| Corporate management | Algorithmic rent-setting |
| Real estate software | Enables coordinated pricing |
| Reduced competition | Fewer alternatives for tenants |

## Feedback Loops

### The Affordability Trap

**Reinforcing Dynamics**

| Loop | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Scarcity-value loop | Restrictions increase value, owners demand more restrictions |
| Exclusion-wealth loop | High prices exclude, concentrate wealth among owners |
| Politics-policy loop | Owners elect officials who maintain restrictions |
| Investment-price loop | Rising prices attract investors, raising prices further |
| Cost-wage loop | High housing costs require high wages, raising business costs |

### Why Markets Don't Self-Correct

| Market Failure | Explanation |
|----------------|-------------|
| Regulatory capture | Homeowners control local policy |
| Externalities | Builders don't bear full social cost of exclusion |
| Information asymmetry | Buyers don't know full costs of location |
| Coordination failure | No actor can fix regional problem alone |
| Path dependence | Existing built environment constrains future |

## The Fundamental Problem

The housing affordability crisis results from a system designed to:

1. **Protect existing homeowner wealth** through supply restrictions
2. **Maximize local fiscal benefits** through exclusionary zoning
3. **Externalize costs** of housing shortage onto renters and newcomers
4. **Treat housing as investment** rather than essential need
5. **Distribute political power** to those with housing security

This system is **rationally designed** for those who benefit from it, even as it fails those who need affordable housing. Reform requires restructuring incentives and redistributing power.
