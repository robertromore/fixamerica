# Housing Affordability: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Housing affordability legislation must address multiple barriers simultaneously: supply constraints, inadequate subsidies, tenant vulnerability, and discriminatory patterns. This document provides draft legislative text at federal, state, and local levels, along with analysis of potential loopholes and implementation challenges.

## Constitutional Amendments

Housing policy does not generally require constitutional amendment, as Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause and Spending Clause to regulate and fund housing programs. However, a constitutional right to housing would fundamentally strengthen enforcement:

### Right to Housing Amendment

**Purpose**: Establish housing as a constitutional right, providing basis for litigation and compelling government action.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. All persons in the United States shall have the right
to adequate housing. This right includes access to housing that
is affordable relative to income, habitable in condition, secure
in tenure, and free from discrimination.

Section 2. The federal government and states shall take reasonable
steps to progressively realize this right, subject to available
resources. No government action shall deliberately regress in the
realization of this right.

Section 3. Congress and the states shall have power to enforce
this article by appropriate legislation.

Section 4. This article shall take effect two years after
ratification.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 1**: Establishes affirmative right with defined components
- **Section 2**: "Progressive realization" standard from international human rights law; prevents cutting existing programs
- **Section 3**: Standard enforcement clause
- **Section 4**: Implementation period for legislative development

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Political infeasibility | Long-term goal; build toward it |
| Justiciability concerns | "Reasonable steps" provides standard |
| Cost concerns | Progressive realization limits immediate obligations |
| Federalism | Both federal and state enforcement |

## Federal Legislation

### Housing Supply and Affordability Act

**Purpose**: Dramatically increase housing production and affordability through expanded subsidies, zoning reform incentives, and fair housing enforcement.

**Draft Text**:

```text

    than 30% of income on housing.
(3) Local zoning restrictions limit housing production and
    contribute to segregation.
(4) Federal housing assistance reaches only a fraction of
    eligible households.

        single-family homes;
    (2) permits duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes in all
        residential zones;

**Draft Regulation**:

```text
PART 5—AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING

§ 5.150 Purpose.

This subpart implements the requirement that HUD programs and
activities affirmatively further fair housing.

```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**

Housing markets are interstate commerce, providing broad federal authority:

| Federal Action | Constitutional Basis |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Tenant protections for federally assisted housing | Spending Clause conditions |
| Fair housing enforcement | Commerce Clause, 13th/14th Amendments |
| Tax incentives for housing | Tax and Spending Clause |
| Zoning reform incentives | Spending Clause conditions |

**Takings Clause**

| Regulation | Takings Analysis |
|------------|------------------|
| Rent stabilization | Constitutional if allows reasonable return |
| Inclusionary zoning | Constitutional if includes incentives |
| Just cause eviction | Constitutional; property right limited by contract |
| Tenant protections | Constitutional; regulation of conduct |

**State Preemption of Local Zoning**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| State authority | States created local governments; can limit their powers |
| Home rule | Does not protect from state preemption |
| Police power | Housing supply is legitimate state concern |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Provision | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Federal funding conditions | HUD administrative enforcement |
| Fair housing | Private right of action, HUD, DOJ |
| Tenant protections | State courts, administrative agencies |
| Zoning preemption | State courts, administrative enforcement |

### Preemption Questions

**Federal-State**

- Federal tenant protections set floor; states may exceed
- Fair housing preempts conflicting state law
- Federal programs may condition funding on state/local action

**State-Local**

- States may preempt local zoning authority
- Home rule generally does not insulate local zoning
- State housing element mandates enforceable

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Housing Supply and Affordability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Local gaming of CDBG incentives | Jurisdictions may adopt minimal reforms to claim incentive without meaningful change | High |
| LIHTC basis boost manipulation | High-cost designation may be gamed through boundary manipulation | Medium |
| Fair housing enforcement gaps | Individual violations difficult to identify; systemic patterns may persist | Medium |
| Federal land inventory delays | Agencies may resist identifying suitable properties | Medium |
| Voucher portability barriers | Receiving PHAs may create administrative obstacles | Medium |
| Income averaging manipulation | LIHTC projects may average to avoid serving lowest incomes | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No direct zoning preemption | Relies on incentives; resistant jurisdictions may forgo funds | Political feasibility |
| Phased voucher expansion | 10-year timeline means millions wait years for assistance | Budget constraints |
| No production mandate | Supply incentives may be insufficient without requirements | Federalism limits |
| Limited enforcement resources | Fair housing enforcement under-resourced | Appropriations |
| Market-rate housing still unaddressed | Subsidies help low-income; moderate-income still cost-burdened | Program design |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Require certification verification**: HUD audits of jurisdictions claiming zoning reform incentives
2. **Anti-gaming provisions**: Define minimum standards for each reform to qualify for incentives
3. **Portability enforcement**: Automatic transfer of funding when voucher holder moves
4. **Fair housing monitoring**: Regular disparate impact testing and compliance reviews
5. **Federal land disposition deadlines**: Mandatory timelines with consequences for non-compliance
6. **Income averaging guardrails**: Require minimum units at 30% AMI in averaged projects

### Tenant Protection and Housing Stability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Federally assisted definition | Narrow definition could exclude many properties despite federal connection | High |
| Cure period insufficiency | 14 days may be insufficient for tenants to address issues | Medium |
| Owner move-in abuse | Owners may claim move-in to evict then re-rent | High |
| Relocation assistance calculation | Three months may be insufficient in high-cost areas | Medium |
| Habitability enforcement gaps | Tenants may fear retaliation for asserting rights | Medium |
| Record sealing delays | Three-year waiting period for satisfied judgments may be too long | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Limited coverage | Only federally assisted properties covered | Constitutional limits on federal reach |
| No rent regulation | Just cause without rent limits may be insufficient | Political feasibility |
| Legal aid capacity | $500M may be insufficient to meet demand | Budget constraints |
| State resistance | Some states may not implement effectively | Federalism |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Expand federal nexus**: Cover any property with federally-backed mortgage, including most rental housing
2. **Cure period extension**: Allow 30 days for monetary default, 14 days for other violations
3. **Owner move-in verification**: Require owner occupancy for 36 months; penalties for bad faith
4. **Relocation calculation reform**: Base on actual moving costs plus rent differential
5. **Anti-retaliation strengthening**: Shift burden of proof to landlord within 180 days
6. **Expedited sealing**: Seal immediately upon dismissal or tenant prevailing; reduce satisfied judgment wait to one year

### State Housing Supply Act (Model)

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Objective standards manipulation | Localities may create impossible-to-meet "objective" requirements | Critical |
| Density bonus workarounds | Minimum density requirements may be circumvented through height/FAR limits | High |
| ADU restrictions through fees | High fees may discourage ADU construction despite permission | High |
| Design standard abuse | "Objective" design standards may effectively prevent housing types | High |
| Environmental exemption limitations | Infill definition may be interpreted narrowly | Medium |
| Transit proximity manipulation | Local control over transit service could reduce station-area housing | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Implementation timeline | Years before zoning changes translate to construction | Housing development timelines |
| No affordable housing requirement | Supply increase may not reach lowest incomes | Market economics |
| Local enforcement dependence | State may lack capacity to enforce against all localities | Administrative capacity |
| Construction cost unaddressed | Zoning reform doesn't reduce materials/labor costs | Separate policy domain |
| Neighbor opposition continues | By-right approval doesn't prevent harassment of residents | Social factors |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Define objective standards**: Legislatively define what standards qualify as objective; require state review of local standards
2. **Density floor enforcement**: Prohibit FAR/height limits that prevent achieving required density
3. **Fee limits**: Cap ADU fees at actual service costs; require nexus studies
4. **Design standard review**: State architecture board may invalidate standards that effectively prevent housing types
5. **Construction start requirement**: Housing element credit only for units under construction within 5 years
6. **Affordable unit requirement**: Require 10-15% affordable in upzoned areas without additional incentive

### State Tenant Protection Act (Model)

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Small landlord exemption gaming | Landlords may structure ownership to qualify for exemption | High |
| Owner move-in abuse | Difficult to verify; bad faith hard to prove | High |
| Rent stabilization opt-out areas | Localities may decline to adopt; no floor protection | Medium |
| Source of income enforcement | Pretextual denials difficult to prove | Medium |
| Criminal activity definition | Overly broad interpretation could facilitate evictions | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Local option for rent stabilization | Protection depends on local political will | Political feasibility |
| Rent increase cap may be insufficient | CPI + 3% may still exceed wage growth | Economic trade-offs |
| New construction exemption length | 15 years may be too long in fast-changing markets | Development incentives |
| Enforcement resource gaps | Private enforcement depends on tenant capacity | Structural barriers |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-structuring provisions**: Look through ownership structures to aggregate units; penalties for structuring
2. **Owner move-in verification**: Require affidavit, proof of intent; 3-year occupancy requirement
3. **State floor with local enhancement**: Establish state minimum with local option to strengthen
4. **Testing programs**: Fund fair housing testing for source of income discrimination
5. **Criminal activity definition**: Specify must be conviction, must threaten health/safety of others
6. **Shorter new construction exemption**: Reduce to 10 years with inflation-adjusted rent cap after

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Enforcement resource gaps | Dedicated funding streams; fee-supported enforcement |
| Local government resistance | State accountability mechanisms; funding conditions |
| Market volatility | Counter-cyclical program design; emergency provisions |
| Data limitations | Require reporting; fund research |
| Political backlash | Phase implementation; build coalitions |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All provisions should include:

- **5-year effectiveness review** by GAO or state auditor
- **Automatic threshold adjustments** for inflation
- **Public reporting requirements** on outcomes
- **Stakeholder feedback mechanisms** for ongoing refinement
- **Adaptation authority** for administrative updates without new legislation
