# Housing Affordability: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Overview

### The Challenge

Meaningful housing affordability reform requires:

1. **Overcoming entrenched opposition** from homeowners and local governments
2. **Building coalitions** across diverse stakeholders
3. **Acting at multiple levels** (federal, state, local)
4. **Sustaining efforts** over decades of implementation
5. **Learning and adapting** as policies take effect

### Strategic Principles

|-----------|-------------|
| Win where possible | Start in favorable jurisdictions |
| Build momentum | Early wins create pressure elsewhere |

| Both supply and protection | Don't sacrifice one for the other |
| Persistence | Housing takes years to build |
