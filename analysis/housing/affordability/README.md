# Housing Affordability: Overview

America faces its most severe housing affordability crisis since the Great Depression. Over 50 million households spend more than 30% of their income on housing, the threshold considered "cost-burdened." Nearly 28 million spend more than 50%, classified as "severely cost-burdened." The median home now costs over 7 times median household income, compared to 3.5 times in the 1980s. Rents have increased 150% since 2000 while median wages rose only 50%. This crisis undermines economic mobility, delays family formation, forces long commutes, and threatens retirement security for millions of Americans.
