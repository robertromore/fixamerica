# Public Housing and Assisted Housing: Current State

## Overview

As of 2024, federal housing assistance serves approximately 5 million households through a patchwork of programs, while an estimated 5 million additional eligible households receive no assistance. The gap between need and provision represents the most fundamental feature of American housing policy: assistance is rationed rather than provided as an entitlement. This section documents current program statistics, waiting list conditions, physical condition of public housing, voucher utilization and success rates, and housing authority operations.

## Waiting Lists

### Scale of Waiting

**Estimated Waiting Populations**

| Program | Estimated Waiting |
|---------|-------------------|
| Housing Choice Vouchers | 2-3 million |
| Public housing | 1-2 million |
| Total (with overlap) | 3-4 million households |

**Note**: Many waiting lists are closed, so these figures undercount true demand.

### Wait Times

**National Distribution**

| Wait Time | Share of Lists |
|-----------|----------------|
| Under 1 year | 15% |
| 1-2 years | 25% |
| 2-5 years | 40% |
| 5-10 years | 15% |
| 10+ years | 5% |

**Notable Long Waits**

| Location | Estimated Wait |
|----------|----------------|
| New York City (NYCHA) | 7-10+ years |
| Los Angeles | 5-8 years |
| Chicago | 5-7 years |
| Washington, DC | 5-10 years |
| San Francisco | Lists often closed |

### Waiting List Management

**Common Practices**

- Preferences for elderly, disabled, veterans, homeless
- Local preferences (residency, employment)
- Purging lists periodically
- Closing lists for years at a time
- Lottery systems versus first-come-first-served

**Challenges**

- Outdated contact information
- Families' circumstances change during wait
- Keeping lists open misleads applicants
- Administrative burden of maintaining large lists

## Project-Based Section 8

### Program Scale

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Properties | ~20,000 |
| Units | ~1.2 million |
| Annual budget | ~$13 billion |
| Average contract rent | ~$950/month |

### Contract Status

**Expiration Concerns**

- Many original 20-40 year contracts expired or expiring
- Owners can opt out when contracts expire
- Opt-outs have led to loss of affordable units
- Mark-to-market program attempted to preserve units

**Current Contract Terms**

- New contracts typically 15-20 years
- Annual renewals available for some
- Section 8 renewal funding mostly stable
- RAD conversions extending affordability periods

## Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD)

### Conversions to Date

| Metric | Value (through 2024) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Units converted | ~250,000 |
| Properties converted | ~1,500 |
| Applications pending | ~200,000 units |
| Goal | All 960,000 public housing units eligible |

### Conversion Outcomes

**Potential Benefits**

- Access to private capital for repairs
- More flexible operating rules
- Long-term use agreements
- Tenant protections required

**Concerns**

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Rent increases | Limited by Section 8 rules |
| Right to return | Required but sometimes compromised |
| Public control | Properties may transfer to private owners |
| Long-term affordability | Use agreements typically 15-20 years |
| Resident organizing | May be complicated by private ownership |

## Housing Authority Operations

### Number and Types of PHAs

| Type | Number | Units/Vouchers |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Large (>1,250 units/vouchers) | ~250 | 75% of total |
| Medium (250-1,249) | ~1,000 | 15% of total |
| Small (<250) | ~2,000 | 10% of total |

### Performance Assessment

**HUD Scoring Systems**

- Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS)
- Section 8 Management Assessment Program (SEMAP)
- Scores from 0-100

**Performance Distribution**

| Rating | Share of PHAs |
|--------|---------------|
| High performer (90+) | 40% |
| Standard (60-89) | 45% |
| Troubled (below 60) | 15% |

### Troubled Housing Authorities

**Notable Examples (Historical and Current)**

- NYCHA (New York) - Largest, chronic issues
- CHA (Chicago) - Under federal oversight historically
- PRHA (Puerto Rico) - Financial difficulties
- Various smaller PHAs - Management issues

**Common Problems in Troubled PHAs**

- Deferred maintenance
- Financial mismanagement
- Poor inspection performance
- Inadequate resident services
- Slow voucher processing
- Political interference

## Federal Funding Trends

### Appropriations (FY 2024, approximate)

| Program | Appropriation |
|---------|---------------|
| Housing Choice Vouchers | $27 billion |
| Public Housing Operating Fund | $5.0 billion |
| Public Housing Capital Fund | $2.8 billion |
| Project-Based Section 8 | $13 billion |
| Choice Neighborhoods | $250 million |
| Total HUD Rental Assistance | ~$50 billion |

### Historical Funding Trends

**Funding Changes (Inflation-Adjusted)**

| Period | Public Housing Capital | Operating Fund | Vouchers |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|----------|
| 1999 | $3.0 billion | $3.5 billion | $15 billion |
| 2009 | $2.4 billion | $4.5 billion | $19 billion |
| 2019 | $2.8 billion | $4.7 billion | $23 billion |
| 2024 | $2.8 billion | $5.0 billion | $27 billion |

**Key Observations**

- Capital funding has not kept pace with needs
- Operating funding has been relatively stable
- Voucher funding has grown but not enough to reduce waiting lists
- Net loss of public housing units continues

## Emerging Issues

### Post-Pandemic Conditions

**Emergency Rental Assistance Impact**

- Temporary assistance helped many assisted households
- ERA programs mostly ended by 2023
- Eviction moratoria expired
- Rent arrears accumulated during pandemic

**Current Challenges**

- Rising rents outpacing payment standards
- Increased voucher failures in competitive markets
- PHAs rebuilding operations after pandemic disruption
- Deferred inspections creating quality concerns

### Climate and Physical Resilience

**Vulnerabilities**

- Older public housing stock poorly insulated
- Many developments in flood-prone areas
- HVAC systems inadequate for extreme heat
- Limited resilience funding available

### Fair Housing Concerns

**Ongoing Issues**

- Concentration of assisted housing in high-poverty areas
- Limited mobility counseling
- Small Area Fair Market Rents underutilized
- Source of income discrimination widespread
