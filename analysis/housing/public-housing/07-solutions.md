# Public Housing and Assisted Housing: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the crisis in public and assisted housing requires a multi-pronged approach: expanding assistance to reach all who need it, preserving and improving existing public housing, making vouchers work in tight markets, protecting residents through transformation, and building new deeply affordable housing. This section presents policy solutions across federal, state, and local levels, with attention to implementation challenges and political feasibility.

## Expand Housing Assistance

### Universal Voucher Program

**Proposal**: Make Housing Choice Vouchers an entitlement for all eligible households.

**Design Elements**

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Eligibility | All households below 30% AMI (extremely low income) |
| Benefit | Standard voucher covering rent up to payment standard |
| Administration | PHAs with enhanced capacity |
| Timeline | 10-year phase-in |
| Cost | Approximately $20-30 billion annually at full implementation |

**Implementation Approach**

1. Immediate expansion of vouchers for priority populations (homeless, exiting institutions)
2. Gradual expansion of eligibility (30% AMI first, then 50% AMI)
3. Capacity building for PHAs
4. Landlord recruitment and retention programs

**Challenges and Responses**

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Budget constraints | Phase in; offset with tax expenditure reforms |
| Landlord participation | Landlord incentives; source of income protection |
| Market capacity | Combine with supply expansion |
| PHA capacity | Technical assistance; consolidation options |

### Increase Payment Standards

**Current Problem**: Fair Market Rents set at 40th percentile miss substantial market segment.

**Solution Options**

| Option | Description | Cost |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Raise to 50th percentile | Increase FMR calculation | Moderate |
| Small Area FMRs | Zip code-level payment standards | Modest |
| Exception payment standards | Allow 110-120% of FMR in all areas | Moderate |
| Market-responsive standards | Real-time market adjustment | Variable |

### Landlord Incentives

**Goal**: Increase landlord participation in voucher program.

**Incentive Options**

| Incentive | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Signing bonuses | One-time payment for accepting voucher tenant |
| Holding fees | Payment while unit held during processing |
| Damage mitigation funds | Cover damages beyond deposit |
| Risk pools | Insurance against rent loss |
| Expedited processing | Faster inspections and payments |
| Landlord liaison programs | Dedicated staff for landlord support |

### Source of Income Protection

**Proposal**: Prohibit discrimination against voucher holders.

**Current Status**

- 21 states plus DC have some protection
- Remaining states allow landlords to reject vouchers
- Local ordinances in some jurisdictions without state law

**Federal Solution**

- Amend Fair Housing Act to include source of income
- Applies to all covered housing
- HUD enforcement authority
- Private right of action

**State Solution**

- Model legislation prohibiting source of income discrimination
- Enforcement through state civil rights agencies
- Adequate penalties for violation

## Preserve Public Housing

### Address Capital Backlog

**Current Backlog**: $70-80 billion and growing.

**Funding Options**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| Dramatically increase Capital Fund | Direct appropriation | Simple, direct | Requires budget allocation |
| Bond financing | Leverage federal dollars | More units addressed | Adds debt service |
| Green retrofit funds | Climate-focused investment | Addresses energy costs | Limited scope |
| Infrastructure bills | Include housing as infrastructure | Popular framing | Competition with other needs |

**Phased Approach**

1. **Year 1-3**: Address worst conditions; emergency repairs
2. **Year 4-7**: Major systems replacement (HVAC, elevators, roofs)
3. **Year 8-10**: Modernization and accessibility

### Operating Fund Reform

**Current Problem**: Operating Fund formula does not cover actual costs.

**Solutions**

| Solution | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Increase proration | Fund formula at 100% rather than current levels |
| Update formula | Revise Fair Market Rent basis for operating subsidy |
| Energy adjustments | Account for actual utility costs |
| Security funding | Add security to operating fund allowables |

### Prevent Further Demolitions

**Policy Changes**

- Reinstate one-for-one replacement requirement (repealed 1998)
- Require rehabilitation assessment before demolition approval
- Fund repairs as alternative to demolition
- Community right to advance notice and participation

## Make RAD Work for Residents

### Strengthen Resident Protections

**Current Requirements**

### Ensure Long-Term Affordability

**Current Concern**: Use agreements have 15-20 year terms; what happens after?

**Solutions**

| Solution | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Perpetual affordability | Require permanent affordability covenants |
| Right of first refusal | Public/nonprofit can purchase at end of term |
| Extended terms | 30-40 year or longer use agreements |
| Public option | Reversion to public ownership option |

### Prevent Excessive Rents

**Concern**: RAD can increase rents for higher-income residents who don't receive vouchers.

**Solutions**

- Extend voucher eligibility to all over-income residents
- Cap rents at affordable levels regardless of income
- Phase in increases slowly

## Build More Deeply Affordable Housing

### Expand Housing Trust Funds

**National Housing Trust Fund**

**Proposal**: Increase National Housing Trust Fund to $5 billion annually

**Funding Sources**

| Source | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Mortgage finance fees | Increased assessments on GSEs |
| Appropriations | Direct federal funding |
| Tax expenditure savings | Redirect from upper-income subsidies |

### Deepen LIHTC Affordability

**Current Limitation**: Most LIHTC units serve 60% AMI, not extremely low income.

**Solutions**

**Enhancements**

| Enhancement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Resident satisfaction measures | Include resident voice |
| Outcome metrics | Track resident wellbeing, not just compliance |
| Public reporting | Transparency for residents and community |
| Consequences for failure | Intervention, not just ratings |

### Governance Reform

|-------------|-------------|
| Earlier intervention | Act before crisis |
| Technical assistance | Provide support, not just sanctions |
| Receivership authority | Clear process for takeover |
| Path to restoration | Help troubled PHAs recover |

### Small Area Fair Market Rents

**Concept**: Set payment standards at zip code level rather than metro-wide.

**Benefits**

- Higher payment standards in expensive areas
- Lower standards in low-cost areas
- Enables moves to opportunity areas
- Cost-neutral overall

**Implementation**

- Mandatory in some areas; optional elsewhere
- PHAs need capacity to implement
