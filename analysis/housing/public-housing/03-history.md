# Public Housing and Assisted Housing: History

## Overview

The history of public housing in America is a story of initial promise, deliberate undermining, and contested transformation. What began in the New Deal as quality housing for the working class became, through a series of intentional policy decisions, the housing of last resort for the poorest Americans. Understanding this history is essential because the current state of public housing was not inevitable but resulted from specific choices about funding, siting, management, and alternatives.

## Origins: The New Deal Era (1930s-1940s)

### The Housing Act of 1937

**Context**

- Great Depression created massive unemployment and housing distress
- Private housing market had collapsed
- European social housing models influenced reformers
- Labor unions and progressive organizations advocated for public housing

**Key Provisions**

- Established the United States Housing Authority
- Provided loans to local housing authorities
- Required "equivalent elimination" - one slum unit demolished for each public housing unit built
- Income limits for residents (intended for working class, not destitute)
- Local option - communities had to create PHAs to participate

**Design and Intent**

- Initial developments often well-designed and popular
- Garden-style apartments, townhouses, community facilities
- Intended for temporarily displaced workers who would move up
- Strong screening ensured "deserving" tenants

### World War II and Postwar Era

**War Housing**

- Massive construction for defense workers
- Temporary housing often became permanent
- Lanham Act funded war worker housing
- Racial segregation was standard practice

**Housing Act of 1949**

- Set goal of "a decent home and suitable living environment for every American family"
- Authorized 810,000 new public housing units over six years
- Linked public housing to urban renewal/slum clearance
- Reality: Only 356,000 built by 1960

**Urban Renewal Connection**

- Title I of 1949 Act funded slum clearance
- Displaced residents promised public housing
- Displacement exceeded new construction
- "Negro removal" - disproportionately affected Black communities

## The High-Rise Era (1950s-1960s)

### Shift to High-Rise Construction

**Driving Factors**

- Lower per-unit land costs
- Modernist architectural influence
- Pressure to build quickly and cheaply
- Cost-cutting eliminated amenities

**Iconic Developments**

| Development | City | Units | Built | Demolished |
|-------------|------|-------|-------|------------|
| Pruitt-Igoe | St. Louis | 2,870 | 1954 | 1972-1976 |
| Robert Taylor Homes | Chicago | 4,415 | 1962 | 2005-2007 |
| Cabrini-Green | Chicago | 3,607 | 1942-1962 | 1995-2011 |
| Queensbridge Houses | NYC | 3,142 | 1939 | Still standing |
| Desire Projects | New Orleans | 1,860 | 1956 | 1997-2003 |

### Design Flaws

**Common Problems**

- "Double-loaded corridors" with units on both sides
- Skip-stop elevators increasing stairwell crime
- Lack of "defensible space" - no clear ownership of common areas
- Inadequate community facilities
- Distance from employment centers
- Isolated from surrounding neighborhoods

### Deliberate Segregation

**Siting Decisions**

- Almost all developments placed in minority neighborhoods
- Federal policy endorsed or required segregation until 1962
- Local politics ensured projects stayed out of white areas
- Created hyper-concentrated poverty

**Tenant Selection**

- Initially, projects were often integrated or white-only
- Working families with employed heads preferred
- Gradually, as whites moved to suburbs, developments became predominantly Black
- Income limits prevented upward mobility within projects

## Decline and Disinvestment (1970s-1990s)

### The Brooke Amendment (1969)

**Provision**: Limited tenant rent contribution to 25% of income (later 30%)

**Consequences**

- PHAs lost operating revenue as tenant incomes declined
- Federal operating subsidies did not fully compensate
- Maintenance deferred, conditions deteriorated
- Working families left, replaced by poorer households
- "Fiscal trap" created

### Nixon Moratorium (1973)

**Actions**

- 18-month moratorium on new construction
- Shifted policy toward demand-side subsidies (Section 8)
- Signaled federal retreat from public housing production

**Rationale**

- Public housing labeled as failed experiment
- Private market alternatives preferred
- Cost concerns (construction was expensive)
- Political opposition from real estate industry

### Section 8 Program Creation (1974)

**Housing and Community Development Act of 1974**

- Created Section 8 rental assistance
- Three programs: New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, Existing Housing
- Existing Housing program became Housing Choice Vouchers
- New Construction/Substantial Rehab later terminated

**Shift in Federal Approach**

- Production programs phased out
- Vouchers became preferred tool
- Existing public housing received less attention
- Private market expected to provide affordable units

### Reagan Era Cuts

**Dramatic Reductions**

| Metric | FY 1981 | FY 1989 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| HUD budget authority | $26 billion | $7 billion | -73% |
| New public housing units | 25,000 | Near zero | -100% |
| Section 8 new construction | Active | Terminated | - |

**Policy Changes**

- Raised tenant rent contribution from 25% to 30% of income
- Eliminated most new construction programs
- Promoted vouchers over project-based assistance
- Introduced homeownership programs for public housing

### Physical Deterioration

**Deferred Maintenance**

- Capital funding consistently below needs
- Older developments fell into disrepair
- Aging systems (plumbing, electrical, HVAC) failed
- Vacancy rates increased in worst developments

**Crime and Disorder**

- Drug epidemics hit public housing hard (crack cocaine in 1980s)
- Gangs established presence in some developments
- Inadequate security and policing
- Media coverage emphasized worst cases

## Transformation Era (1990s-2010s)

### HOPE VI Program (1992-2010)

**Origins**

- National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing (1992)
- Identified 86,000 units (6%) as severely distressed
- Recommended demolition and redevelopment
- HOPE VI created to fund transformation

**Program Elements**

- Competitive grants for demolition and redevelopment
- Mixed-income development required
- Community and supportive services funding
- Resident self-sufficiency emphasis

**Scale**

| Metric | Total |
|--------|-------|
| Grants awarded | 260 |
| Total funding | $6.7 billion |
| Units demolished | ~100,000 |
| New units built | ~107,000 (but many not deeply affordable) |
| Original residents returned | ~10-15% |

### HOPE VI Outcomes

**Positive Assessments**

- Replaced severely distressed developments
- Broke up concentrated poverty in some areas
- Improved physical conditions
- Attracted private investment to neighborhoods

**Criticisms**

- Net loss of deeply affordable units
- Displaced longtime residents
- Low return rates for original families
- "Deconcentration" meant moving poor people away
- Gentrification of public housing sites
- Loss of community networks

### Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (1998)

**Key Provisions**

- Repealed one-for-one replacement requirement
- Allowed demolition without replacement
- Strengthened work requirements
- Created Section 8 management reforms
- Authorized site-based waiting lists

**Impact**

- Accelerated demolition of public housing
- Reduced barriers to removing "problem" tenants
- Shifted policy toward promoting work over housing stability

### Moving to Opportunity Experiment

**Design (1994-1998)**

- Random assignment experiment in five cities
- Vouchers with mobility counseling to move to low-poverty areas
- Tested whether neighborhood affects outcomes

**Long-Term Findings**

- Children who moved young showed improved earnings, college attendance
- Mental health benefits for mothers
- Mixed results for adolescents who moved
- Demonstrated neighborhood effects but difficulty of implementation

## Recent Transformations (2010s-Present)

### Choice Neighborhoods (2010-Present)

**HOPE VI Successor**

- Smaller scale, more targeted
- Emphasis on comprehensive neighborhood investment
- "People, Housing, Neighborhood" framework
- Requires one-for-one replacement
- More attention to resident outcomes

### Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) (2012-Present)

**Purpose**

- Convert public housing to project-based Section 8
- Access private capital for repairs
- Address capital backlog
- Maintain affordability and resident rights

**Mechanism**

- PHAs convert units to Project-Based Vouchers or Project-Based Rental Assistance
- Can leverage Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, bonds, loans
- Long-term use agreements required
- Resident protections mandated

**Progress**

| Year | Cumulative Conversions |
|------|----------------------|
| 2016 | 45,000 units |
| 2018 | 100,000 units |
| 2020 | 170,000 units |
| 2024 | ~250,000 units |

**Debates**

- Does RAD preserve public housing or privatize it?
- Are resident protections adequate?
- Will affordability last beyond initial use agreements?
- Is there sufficient oversight of private owners?

## Lessons from History

### What Caused Public Housing's Decline?

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Deliberate underfunding | Congress never appropriated sufficient operating and capital funds |
| Segregated siting | Concentration in minority neighborhoods created isolated ghettos |
| Income targeting | Brooke Amendment reduced operating revenue; poorest tenants housed |
| Design failures | High-rise, high-density designs proved unsuitable for families |
| Deindustrialization | Loss of jobs in cities left residents without employment |
| Drug epidemics | Crack cocaine devastated some developments |
| Political abandonment | Republicans and many Democrats gave up on public housing |

### What Succeeded?

**Well-Functioning Public Housing**

- Smaller developments
- Mixed populations (elderly, family)
- Strong management and maintenance
- Connected to neighborhoods
- Adequate funding
- Examples: Many elderly-only developments; smaller family developments in functioning markets

### Key Inflection Points

1. **1949 Housing Act** - Set ambitious goals never achieved
2. **1969 Brooke Amendment** - Created fiscal crisis
3. **1973 Nixon Moratorium** - Ended new construction
4. **1974 Section 8** - Shifted to vouchers
5. **1981 Reagan cuts** - Dramatic disinvestment
6. **1992 HOPE VI** - Demolition and transformation
7. **1998 QHWRA** - Ended one-for-one replacement
8. **2012 RAD** - Conversion to project-based assistance
