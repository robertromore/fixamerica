# Public Housing and Assisted Housing: Root Causes

## Overview

The inadequacy of public and assisted housing in America is not the result of a single policy failure but a complex interaction of political, economic, institutional, and ideological factors. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing reforms that address fundamental problems rather than symptoms. This section analyzes why housing assistance reaches only a fraction of those who need it, why public housing deteriorated, and why market-based alternatives have not solved the affordability crisis.

## Political Causes

### Lack of Constituency Power

**Diffuse and Marginalized Beneficiaries**

- Low-income renters have limited political influence
- Public housing residents often face barriers to voting
- Geographic concentration limits electoral impact
- Stigma discourages political mobilization
- No organized lobby comparable to homeowner interests

**Comparison to Other Housing Subsidies**

| Subsidy | Annual Cost | Beneficiaries | Political Power |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Mortgage Interest Deduction | ~$25 billion | Homeowners, especially higher-income | Very high |
| Capital Gains Exclusion | ~$50 billion | Home sellers | Very high |
| Property Tax Deduction | ~$10 billion | Property owners | High |
| Low-Income Housing Assistance | ~$50 billion | Low-income renters | Low |

### Racial Politics

**Public Housing as Racialized**

- White flight from public housing paralleled white flight from cities
- Public housing became coded as "Black" housing
- Opposition to public housing often reflects racial animus
- "Welfare" framing stigmatizes program

**Geographic Politics**

- Suburban representatives oppose public housing
- Urban delegation fragmented
- Rural housing programs have separate political dynamics
- NIMBY opposition crosses party lines

### Discretionary vs. Entitlement Status

**Fundamental Design Flaw**

- Housing assistance is discretionary appropriation
- Must compete annually for funding
- No legal right to assistance
- Waiting lists result from political choice

**Contrast with Entitlements**

| Program | Type | Eligibility Guarantee |
|---------|------|----------------------|
| Social Security | Entitlement | Yes - all who qualify receive benefits |
| Medicare | Entitlement | Yes - all who qualify receive coverage |
| Food Stamps (SNAP) | Entitlement | Yes - all who qualify receive assistance |
| Medicaid | Entitlement | Yes - all who qualify receive coverage |
| Housing Assistance | Discretionary | No - limited to available funding |

### Real Estate Industry Opposition

**Historical Opposition**

- National Association of Real Estate Boards fought public housing from inception
- Argument that government competition undermines private market
- Successful lobbying for income limits (preventing competition for middle-class tenants)
- Pushed for equivalence elimination requirement

**Contemporary Influence**

- National Apartment Association opposes rent control, source of income protection
- Landlord groups resist voucher regulations
- Real estate PACs major political donors
- Framing of housing as private market function

## Economic Causes

### Land and Construction Costs

**Rising Development Costs**

| Cost Component | Trend | Impact |
|----------------|-------|--------|
| Land | Increasing faster than inflation | Makes new development expensive |
| Materials | Volatile, generally increasing | Raises construction costs |
| Labor | Increasing, shortages in trades | Limits production capacity |
| Financing | Interest rate sensitive | Affects feasibility |
| Regulations | Increasing complexity | Adds time and cost |

**Subsidy Requirements**

- New affordable units require $200,000-$400,000+ per unit in high-cost areas
- Gap between development costs and affordable rents requires deep subsidy
- Limited subsidy dollars mean limited production

### Operating Cost Challenges

**Public Housing Operating Formula**

- Operating Fund formula based on Fair Market Rent calculations
- Formula does not fully cover actual costs
- Older, higher-cost buildings penalized
- No adjustment for local operating conditions

**Cost Drivers**

| Cost | Challenge |
|------|-----------|
| Utilities | Older buildings energy-inefficient |
| Insurance | Increasing costs, especially in high-risk areas |
| Security | Needed but unfunded |
| Resident services | Expected but not in operating budget |
| Maintenance | Deferred due to funding gaps |

### Voucher Market Dynamics

**Why Vouchers Fail in Tight Markets**

1. **Insufficient Payment Standards**: Fair Market Rents set at 40th percentile, below market rates in expensive areas
2. **Landlord Preferences**: Landlords prefer market-rate tenants
3. **Discrimination**: Source of income discrimination legal in most jurisdictions
4. **Competition**: Voucher holders compete with market-rate renters
5. **Administrative Burden**: Inspections, paperwork deter landlord participation

**Market Mismatch**

| Market Condition | Voucher Success |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Weak market (high vacancy) | High success rate |
| Moderate market | Moderate success |
| Tight market (low vacancy) | Low success rate |
| Very tight market | Very low success; many vouchers expire unused |

### Income Targeting and Cross-Subsidy Failure

**Extremely Low-Income Focus**

- 75% of assisted households are extremely low income (<30% AMI)
- Tenant rent contribution of 30% of income yields minimal revenue
- Cross-subsidy from higher-income tenants eliminated by income limits
- Operating revenue insufficient without federal subsidy

**Income Mix Trade-offs**

| Strategy | Revenue | Mission |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Serve very lowest income | Lowest | Highest need served |
| Mixed-income development | Higher | Fewer deeply poor served |
| Work requirements | Potentially higher | Excludes those unable to work |

## Institutional Causes

### Fragmented Governance

**3,300+ Housing Authorities**

- Each PHA operates independently
- No national standards for quality
- Variable management capacity
- Political appointment of boards
- Inconsistent policies and practices

**Federal-Local Relationship**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| HUD oversight | Under-resourced, often reactive |
| Local control | Allows innovation but enables dysfunction |
| Funding streams | Complex, siloed programs |
| Accountability | Weak mechanisms for poor performers |

### Housing Authority Challenges

**Structural Problems**

- Boards often political appointees without housing expertise
- Executive compensation not competitive with private sector
- Labor agreements may limit flexibility
- Capital improvement capacity limited
- IT systems outdated

**Capacity Variation**

| PHA Size | Typical Capacity |
|----------|------------------|
| Large (NYC, Chicago, LA) | Bureaucratic, complex, variable quality |
| Medium | Often adequate |
| Small | Limited staff, management stretched thin |

### HUD Limitations

**Underfunding and Understaffing**

- HUD staff reduced from 16,000 (1980) to ~7,000 (2020s)
- Oversight capacity diminished
- IT systems antiquated
- Field offices reduced

**Regulatory Complexity**

- Multiple program regulations create compliance burden
- Rules often conflict or overlap
- Amendments create layers of requirements
- Small PHAs struggle to keep up

## Ideological Causes

### Anti-Government Housing Philosophy

**Market Fundamentalism**

- Belief that private market can and should provide all housing
- Government provision seen as distorting markets
- Preference for demand-side subsidies over supply-side
- Skepticism of government's ability to manage property

**Historical Evolution**

| Era | Dominant View |
|-----|---------------|
| 1930s-1960s | Government production acceptable |
| 1970s | Shift toward private provision with subsidy |
| 1980s-1990s | Market-based solutions preferred |
| 2000s-present | Mixed, but production programs limited |

### "Culture of Poverty" Narratives

**Blaming Residents**

- Narrative that public housing failed because of residents' behavior
- Focus on individual pathologies rather than structural factors
- Work requirements premised on moral improvement
- Ignores that most residents work, are elderly, or disabled

**Design Determinism**

- Architectural explanations for social problems
- "Towers in the park" blamed for crime
- Physical design solutions for poverty
- Ignores role of investment, management, services

### Homeownership Ideology

**Homeownership as Norm**

- Federal policy promotes homeownership for wealth-building
- Rental housing seen as transitional
- "Ownership society" rhetoric
- Renters treated as second-class housing consumers

**Rental Assistance as Temporary**

- Programs designed to be stepping stones
- Time limits proposed periodically
- Self-sufficiency emphasis
- Ignores that many need permanent assistance

## Structural Causes

### Housing as Commodity

**Market-Based System**

- Housing treated primarily as investment
- Affordability not market goal
- Profit motive dominates production
- Land speculation inflates costs

**Financialization**

- Housing as asset class
- Investor ownership of rental housing
- Private equity in affordable housing
- Shareholder returns versus resident welfare

### Income Inequality

**Affordability as Income Problem**

| Decade | Minimum Wage (2024 $) | Median Rent (2024 $) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1970 | $13.00/hour | $750/month |
| 1990 | $10.00/hour | $900/month |
| 2010 | $8.50/hour | $1,100/month |
| 2024 | $7.25/hour | $1,400/month |

**Wage-Rent Gap**

- Wages for low-income workers stagnated
- Rents increased faster than inflation
- Two-income requirement for housing
- Impossible math for single-earner households

### Zoning and Land Use

**Barriers to Affordable Housing**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Single-family zoning | Excludes apartments |
| Minimum lot sizes | Increases land cost per unit |
| Density limits | Caps units per acre |
| Parking requirements | Adds $20,000-$50,000 per unit |
| Height limits | Prevents efficient use of land |

**NIMBY Opposition**

- Local opposition blocks affordable development
- Process costs favor opponents
- Delay as strategy
- Concentrated costs, diffuse benefits

## Interconnected Dynamics

### Vicious Cycles

**Disinvestment Spiral**

1. Funding cuts reduce maintenance
2. Conditions deteriorate
3. Working families leave
4. Income mix worsens
5. Operating revenue declines
6. Further disinvestment
7. Development becomes "distressed"
8. Demolition justified

**Voucher Failure Cycle**

1. Tight markets reduce success rates
2. Frustrated recipients give up
3. PHAs return unused funds
4. Appropriations reduced
5. Fewer vouchers available
6. Waiting lists grow

### Concentrated Poverty

**Self-Reinforcing Dynamics**

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Job access | Employers avoid high-poverty areas |
| Schools | Under-resourced, lower outcomes |
| Crime | Higher rates, less investment |
| Services | Fewer retail, healthcare options |
| Stigma | Limits opportunities for residents |
