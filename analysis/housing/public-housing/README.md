# Public Housing and Assisted Housing: Overview

Public housing and federal housing assistance programs represent America's primary tools for providing affordable housing to extremely low-income households, yet these programs serve only a fraction of eligible families. While approximately 10 million households qualify for rental assistance, only about 5 million receive it, leaving millions on waiting lists that can stretch for years or even decades in high-demand areas.
