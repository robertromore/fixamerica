# Public Housing and Assisted Housing: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Transforming public and assisted housing from a rationed program serving a fraction of those in need to a robust system providing housing security for all low-income Americans requires a strategic, phased approach. This roadmap sequences reforms based on political feasibility, administrative capacity, and interdependencies. The goal is to build momentum through achievable early wins while laying the groundwork for more transformational changes.

## Strategic Framework

### Guiding Principles

1. **Protect existing residents**: No reform should harm current assisted households
2. **Expand incrementally**: Build capacity alongside program growth
3. **Demonstrate success**: Pilot programs generate evidence and political support
4. **Build coalitions**: Engage diverse stakeholders in implementation
5. **Address equity**: Prioritize those with greatest need and historical exclusion
