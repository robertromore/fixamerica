# Public Housing and Assisted Housing: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Addressing the crisis in public and assisted housing requires comprehensive legislative reform at federal, state, and local levels. This document presents draft legislation, regulatory frameworks, and legal analysis for expanding and improving housing assistance, with attention to potential loopholes and implementation challenges.

## Constitutional Framework

No constitutional amendments are required for public housing legislation. Congress has established authority under:

- **Spending Power**: Federal grants and subsidies to states and localities
- **Commerce Clause**: Regulation of housing markets and interstate activity
- **Taxing Power**: Tax credits for housing development (LIHTC)

**Constitutional Limitations**:

- Tenth Amendment: Housing primarily a state and local function
- Takings Clause: Limits on rent control and land use regulation
- Equal Protection: Requires race-neutral or remedial justifications for targeting
- Due Process: Procedural protections for termination of benefits

## Federal Legislation

### Universal Housing Voucher Act

**Purpose**: Make Housing Choice Vouchers an entitlement for all extremely low-income households, eliminating waiting lists.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Universal Housing Voucher Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
    (1) only 1 in 4 eligible households currently receives federal rental
        assistance due to funding limitations;
    (2) waiting lists for housing vouchers average 2-3 years nationally and
        exceed 10 years in some jurisdictions;
    (3) housing assistance reduces homelessness, improves educational
        outcomes for children, and promotes economic stability;
    (4) the cost of housing instability, including emergency services,
        healthcare, and lost productivity, exceeds the cost of providing
        assistance.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to ensure that all eligible
    households have access to Housing Choice Vouchers within 10 years.

SEC. 3. ENTITLEMENT ESTABLISHED.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 is
    amended to establish Housing Choice Vouchers as an entitlement for—
    (1) all households with income at or below 30 percent of area median
        income (extremely low income);
    (2) phased in over 10 fiscal years beginning October 1, 2026.

(b) PHASE-IN SCHEDULE.—
    (1) YEARS 1-2.—Priority for homeless households, persons exiting
        institutions, and veterans.
    (2) YEARS 3-5.—Expansion to all extremely low-income households with
        children.
    (3) YEARS 6-8.—Expansion to all extremely low-income elderly and
        disabled households.
    (4) YEARS 9-10.—Expansion to all remaining extremely low-income
        households.

(c) APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as
    necessary to provide vouchers to all eligible households, estimated at—
    (1) $5,000,000,000 additional for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $10,000,000,000 additional for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $15,000,000,000 additional for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $20,000,000,000 additional for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) such sums as necessary for fiscal year 2031 and thereafter.

SEC. 4. PAYMENT STANDARD IMPROVEMENTS.
(a) MINIMUM STANDARD.—No payment standard shall be set below 110 percent
    of the applicable Fair Market Rent.

(b) SMALL AREA FAIR MARKET RENTS.—The Secretary shall require the use of
    Small Area Fair Market Rents in all metropolitan areas.

(c) EXCEPTION PAYMENT STANDARDS.—Public housing authorities may set
    exception payment standards up to 150 percent of Fair Market Rent in
    any area without prior approval.

SEC. 5. LANDLORD PARTICIPATION.
(a) SOURCE OF INCOME PROTECTION.—The Fair Housing Act is amended to add
    "source of income" as a protected class, including Housing Choice
    Vouchers and other forms of housing assistance.

(b) LANDLORD INCENTIVES.—The Secretary shall establish—
    (1) a national signing bonus program offering landlords one month's
        rent for accepting voucher tenants;
    (2) a national damage mitigation fund covering landlord losses beyond
        security deposits;
    (3) expedited inspection and payment processing standards.

SEC. 6. MOBILITY SUPPORT.
(a) MOBILITY SERVICES.—Each public housing authority shall provide
    mobility counseling services to voucher holders seeking to move to
    higher-opportunity areas.

(b) REGIONAL LANDLORD DATABASES.—The Secretary shall establish regional
    databases of landlords accepting vouchers in high-opportunity areas.

(c) AUTHORIZATION.—There are authorized to be appropriated $500,000,000
    annually for mobility support services.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation**: This bill converts the Housing Choice Voucher program from a capped appropriation to an entitlement for extremely low-income households, phased in over 10 years. It includes improvements to payment standards and landlord participation to ensure vouchers are usable.

**Challenges**: Major budget impact; appropriations politics; landlord opposition to source of income protection; PHA capacity constraints.

**Refinements**: Consider starting with narrower priority populations; build in flexibility for market conditions.

## Regulatory Framework

### HUD Regulations

**Voucher Payment Standard Regulations**

| Current Rule | Proposed Change |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Payment standard 90-110% of FMR | Minimum 110% of FMR |
| Small Area FMR optional | Small Area FMR mandatory in all metros |
| Exception requests required above 110% | Automatic authority to 150% |

**RAD Resident Protection Regulations**

| Area | Enhanced Requirement |
|------|---------------------|
| Right to return | Documented tracking; enforcement |
| Relocation assistance | Minimum standards; adequacy review |
| Rent increases | Longer phase-in; hardship exemptions |
| Organizing rights | Explicit protections; remedies |

**PHA Performance Standards**

| Current Measure | Enhancement |
|-----------------|-------------|
| PHAS/SEMAP scoring | Add resident satisfaction |
| Physical inspections | Real-time condition monitoring |
| Compliance focus | Outcome measures |
| Annual assessment | Continuous monitoring |

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Power**

- Federal housing assistance well-established under spending power
- Conditions on funding must be clearly stated and related to program
- Commandeering concerns if imposing requirements on states

**Commerce Clause**

- Housing markets have interstate effects
- Source of income protection affects interstate commerce
- Regulation of landlords in federally-assisted housing clearly permitted

**Due Process**

- Termination of housing assistance requires procedural protections
- Grievance procedures mandated for public housing
- Voucher terminations require due process

### Preemption Questions

| Issue | Federal Authority | State Role |
|-------|------------------|------------|
| Public housing operations | Primary | Limited |
| Voucher administration | Primary | Can supplement |
| Source of income protection | Can establish federal floor | Can exceed |
| Zoning/land use | Limited | Primary |
| Landlord-tenant law | Limited | Primary |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Level | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Federal | HUD oversight; funding conditions; civil rights enforcement |
| State | Civil rights agencies; attorney general enforcement |
| Local | Code enforcement; local civil rights enforcement |
| Private | Fair housing litigation; tenant rights lawsuits |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Payment standard manipulation | PHAs set standards at minimum despite tight markets | High |
| Inspection delays | Extended timelines reduce voucher success | Medium |
| Source of income workarounds | Pretextual rejections based on credit, references | High |
| RAD conversion displacement | Residents pushed out despite protections | High |
| Capital fund diversion | Funds used for administration rather than repairs | Medium |
| Faircloth repeal limits | New construction still faces funding constraints | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Discretionary appropriations | Funding unpredictable | Congressional budget process |
| Market dependency | Vouchers fail in tight markets | Insufficient supply |
| PHA capacity variation | Implementation varies widely | Fragmented system |
| Landlord voluntary participation | Can't compel participation | Property rights |
| 10-year phase-in | Immediate needs unmet | Budget constraints |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Payment standard manipulation**:
   - Require annual market analysis
   - Automatic adjustment to market conditions
   - HUD monitoring and intervention

2. **Inspection delays**:
   - Maximum 14-day inspection timeline
   - Self-certification for minor repairs
   - Consequences for PHA non-compliance

3. **Source of income workarounds**:
   - Testing programs to detect discrimination
   - Burden-shifting in enforcement
   - Significant penalties for violations
   - Landlord education and outreach

4. **RAD displacement**:
   - Independent monitoring of resident outcomes
   - Public reporting of return rates
   - Enforcement actions for violations
   - Resident organizing protections

5. **Capital fund diversion**:
   - Clear limits on administrative use
   - Third-party physical needs assessments
   - Transparent reporting requirements

6. **Market supply constraints**:
   - Pair voucher expansion with supply programs
   - Zoning reform to enable construction
   - Social housing development

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| PHA administrative capacity | Technical assistance; consolidation incentives |
| Federal workforce limitations | Increased HUD staffing; regional capacity |
| Political sustainability | Build broad coalitions; demonstrate results |
| State/local cooperation | Incentives and requirements |
| Data systems | HMIS integration; improved reporting |
