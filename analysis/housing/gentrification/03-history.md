# Gentrification: History

## Overview

The transformation of urban neighborhoods through influxes of higher-income residents has deep historical roots, though the term "gentrification" dates only to 1964. Understanding this history requires tracing the evolution of urban policy from the post-war era through multiple waves of neighborhood change. The story includes urban renewal's government-led displacement, the back-to-the-city movement of the 1970s-80s, the neoliberal restructuring of the 1990s, and the tech-driven super-gentrification of the 2000s-present. Throughout, gentrification has been intertwined with racial dynamics, government policy, and shifting economic geography.

## Pre-History: Urban Renewal (1949-1974)

### The Federal Urban Renewal Program

| Policy | Year | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| Housing Act of 1949 | 1949 | Authorized slum clearance, redevelopment |
| Housing Act of 1954 | 1954 | Expanded urban renewal beyond housing |
| Highway Act of 1956 | 1956 | Enabled highway construction through neighborhoods |
| Housing Act of 1961 | 1961 | Added commercial redevelopment focus |

### The Scale of Urban Renewal Displacement

| Metric | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Total projects | 2,500+ nationwide |
| Acres cleared | 400,000+ |
| Housing units demolished | 600,000+ |
| People displaced | 1,000,000+ |
| Percentage Black | 60-70% of displaced |
| Replacement units built | Fraction of demolished |

### Case Studies in "Negro Removal"

| City | Project | Residents Displaced | Notes |
|------|---------|---------------------|-------|
| Boston | West End | 7,000 | Working-class Italian neighborhood destroyed |
| San Francisco | Western Addition | 10,000+ | Predominantly Black Fillmore gutted |
| New York | Lincoln Center | 7,000 | Puerto Rican San Juan Hill cleared |
| Chicago | Near West Side | 8,000 | Italian, Black, Mexican communities displaced |
| St. Louis | Mill Creek Valley | 20,000 | Entire Black neighborhood erased |

### The "Federal Bulldozer" Critique

Urban renewal became synonymous with government-led displacement by the 1960s:

- Jane Jacobs' *The Death and Life of Great American Cities* (1961) challenged renewal logic
- Civil rights movement highlighted racial targeting
- Community resistance grew in cities nationwide
- Program renamed "Community Development" and reformed in 1974

## The Coining of "Gentrification" (1964)

### Ruth Glass and London

British sociologist Ruth Glass coined the term in 1964 to describe London:

> "One by one, many of the working-class quarters of London have been invaded by the middle classes... Once this process of 'gentrification' starts in a district, it goes on rapidly until all or most of the original working-class occupiers are displaced."

### Key Elements of Glass's Definition

- Middle-class influx into working-class areas
- Housing renovation and improvement
- Displacement of original residents
- Transformation of neighborhood character
- Market-driven process (distinguished from government-led renewal)

## First Wave: Back-to-the-City Movement (1970s-1980s)

### Conditions Enabling Gentrification

| Factor | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Suburban maturation | First-generation suburbanites' children sought alternatives | Urban demand increased |
| Urban disinvestment | Decades of decline created "rent gap" | Low prices attracted pioneers |
| Economic restructuring | Shift from manufacturing to services | Professional class growth |
| Demographic change | Smaller households, delayed families | Urban amenities valued |
| Historic preservation | Tax credits, landmark designation | Incentivized renovation |

### Pioneer Gentrifiers

| Type | Characteristics | Neighborhoods |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| Artists | Low incomes, high cultural capital | SoHo (NYC), Wicker Park (Chicago) |
| Gay men | Disposable income, design orientation | Castro (SF), West Village (NYC) |
| Young professionals | Two incomes, no kids | Society Hill (Philadelphia), Georgetown (DC) |
| Historic preservationists | Interest in architecture, community | Charleston, Savannah historic districts |

### Academic Debates Emerge

| Theorist | Perspective | Key Argument |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Neil Smith | Production/supply-side | "Rent gap" theory: capital seeks profit from disinvested areas |
| David Ley | Consumption/demand-side | Cultural preferences of new middle class drive gentrification |
| Chris Hamnett | Hybrid | Both supply and demand factors necessary |

### Early Displacement Resistance

- Anti-displacement organizing emerged in San Francisco, NYC
- Hotel residents' movement in San Francisco (1970s)
- Artists vs. developers conflicts (SoHo)
- Rent control strengthened in some cities
- Community land trusts founded (first: 1969, Georgia)

## Second Wave: Neoliberal Restructuring (1990s)

### Policy Context

| Policy Shift | Year | Effect |
|--------------|------|--------|
| HOPE VI | 1993 | Public housing demolition, mixed-income replacement |
| Welfare reform | 1996 | Reduced safety net, increased housing precarity |
| Fannie Mae expansion | 1990s | Expanded mortgage credit, fueled housing demand |
| Urban Empowerment Zones | 1993 | Tax incentives for urban investment |
| Tax credit for historic renovation | Continued | Encouraged renovation of older housing |

### HOPE VI and Public Housing Transformation

| City | Project | Units Demolished | Units Replaced | Displacement |
|------|---------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Chicago | Cabrini-Green | 3,600 | 2,300 (mixed-income) | 15,000 residents |
| Atlanta | Techwood | 1,100 | 900 (mixed-income) | 5,000 residents |
| New Orleans | St. Thomas | 1,500 | 600 (mixed-income) | 3,500 residents |
| San Francisco | North Beach | 299 | 341 | Significant |
| National total | All HOPE VI | 96,000+ | ~55,000 | 200,000+ |

### Gentrification Expands Geographically

Previously untouched cities began experiencing gentrification:

| City | Key Neighborhoods | Timing |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Chicago | Wicker Park, Pilsen, Bronzeville | Mid-1990s |
| Washington DC | Logan Circle, U Street, Columbia Heights | Late 1990s |
| Portland | Pearl District, Alberta | Late 1990s |
| Seattle | Capitol Hill, Fremont | Mid-1990s |
| Denver | LoDo, Five Points | Late 1990s |

### The "Creative Class" Thesis

Richard Florida's *Rise of the Creative Class* (2002) influenced urban policy:

- Cities compete for educated workers
- Amenities and tolerance attract talent
- Urban revitalization through creative industries
- Critics noted displacement consequences often ignored

## Third Wave: Financialization and Super-Gentrification (2000s)

### The Housing Boom (2000-2007)

| Factor | Impact on Gentrification |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Easy credit | Enabled more buyers in transitional neighborhoods |
| Speculation | Flipping accelerated neighborhood change |
| Subprime lending | Initially expanded homeownership, later caused foreclosures |
| Condo conversion | Rental buildings converted to ownership |
| Foreign investment | Global capital sought US real estate |

### Super-Gentrification

High-end gentrification of already gentrified areas:

| Neighborhood | First Wave | Super-Gentrification |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|

| Phase | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Foreclosure crisis | Displacement through foreclosure, not gentrification |
| Investor purchases | Wall Street bought foreclosed homes |

|---------|-------------|
| Speed | More rapid transformation |
| Scale | Larger geographic areas |
| Investment sources | Venture capital, REITs, foreign investment |
| Displacement pressure | More intense due to income gaps |
| Community response | More organized resistance |

### Platform Economy Effects

| Platform | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Airbnb | Removes long-term rental housing, enables speculation |
