# Gentrification: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Anti-displacement legislation operates at multiple levels: federal law can establish baseline protections and funding, state law can set statewide standards and enable local action, and local ordinances can address context-specific needs. This document provides model legislation for community land trusts, tenant opportunity to purchase, anti-displacement impact review, right to return, and commercial rent stabilization, along with analysis of potential loopholes and implementation challenges.

## Federal Legislation

### Community Land Trust Investment Act

**Purpose**: Establish federal support for community land trusts and shared equity housing.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Community Land Trust Investment Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
    (1) community land trusts and other shared equity homeownership
        models have proven effective at maintaining long-term housing
        affordability while enabling wealth-building for residents;
    (2) there are over 300 community land trusts operating in the
        United States, but they remain small relative to housing need;
    (3) community land trusts preserve public investment in affordable
        housing in perpetuity rather than allowing it to expire;
    (4) community land trust homeowners have substantially lower
        foreclosure rates than conventional homeowners;
    (5) scaling community land trusts requires significant capital
        investment in land acquisition.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to—
    (1) establish a dedicated funding stream for community land trust
        land acquisition;
    (2) provide technical assistance for CLT development and expansion;
    (3) create preferences for permanent affordability in federal programs.

    annually for the technical assistance program.

SEC. 6. PERMANENT AFFORDABILITY PREFERENCES.

(a) HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM.—Section 212 of the
    Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act is amended to
    require that units produced with HOME funds that utilize community
    land trust or permanent affordability structures receive—
    (1) increased per-unit subsidy of 20%;
    (2) priority in allocation of HOME funds.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This bill creates dedicated federal funding for community land trust expansion, addressing the primary barrier to CLT scale: capital for land acquisition. It also creates preferences across existing programs to incentivize permanent affordability.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Political: Skepticism about federal housing investment
- Constitutional: None significant; standard spending power
- Practical: CLT capacity to absorb funding

**Refinements**:

- Phase funding increases tied to demonstrated capacity
- Include evaluation metrics
- Coordinate with state CLT programs

        economic development can increase land values and contribute
        to displacement of low-income residents;
    (2) the benefits of federal investment should accrue to existing
        community members, not solely to new arrivals or investors;
    (3) advance assessment of displacement risk enables mitigation.

SEC. 3. DISPLACEMENT IMPACT ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENT.

(a) COVERED ACTIONS.—The following federal actions shall require a

    (1) Demographic profile of affected area including race, income,
        tenure, and length of residence;
    (2) Current housing affordability conditions including rent levels,
        cost burden rates, and vacancy rates;
    (3) Projected impact on land values and rents;
    (4) Identification of populations at risk of displacement;
    (5) Proposed mitigation measures;
    (6) Monitoring plan for post-investment displacement.

(c) MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS.—Projects with identified displacement risk

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Takings Clause**:

| Claim | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| TOPA as taking | Purchase right, not forced sale; no taking |
| Commercial rent control | Regulatory, not physical; likely upheld |
| Right to return | Condition on government action; valid |
| Vacancy tax | Tax on property use; valid |

**Due Process**:

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Notice | All bills include notice requirements |
| Hearing | Administrative or judicial review available |
| Rational basis | Anti-displacement is legitimate interest |

### Preemption Questions

**State-Local**:

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Commercial rent control | Some states may preempt |
| TOPA | Generally within local authority |
| Impact review | Within planning authority |
| Vacancy tax | Taxing authority varies |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Effectiveness |
|-----------|---------------|
| Private right of action | Empowers affected parties |
| Agency enforcement | Requires dedicated resources |
| Void transactions | Strong remedy for TOPA violations |
| Penalties | Deter violations |
| Attorney fees | Enables representation |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Model Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Time pressure | 120 days insufficient for financing | Medium |
| Qualified purchaser limits | Narrow definition excludes some allies | Low |
| Family exemption abuse | Create fictitious family transfers | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Financing gap | Tenants cannot secure financing | Market constraints |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Long displacement periods | Households rebuild elsewhere | Market timelines |

5. Expand trigger definition to capture restructured projects
6. Create presumption of eligibility for documented prior residents
7. Simplify registration process; allow community organization assistance
8. Fund comprehensive interim support including housing counseling

### Model Commercial Rent Stabilization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Size threshold gaming | Keep just above 5,000 sq ft | Medium |
| Tenure threshold | New tenants not covered for 10 years | High |
| Capital improvement abuse | Over-claim improvements for passthrough | Medium |
| Building reconfiguration | Combine or split spaces to evade | Medium |

| Market rate gap | Controlled rents far below market | Market pressure |
| Property value impact | May affect commercial property values | Economic effects |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Eliminate or reduce size threshold to 2,500 sq ft
2. Reduce tenure requirement to 5 years for basic protections
3. Require pre-approval for capital improvement passthroughs with documentation
4. Define reconfiguration as evasion with penalties
5. Broaden independence definition; audit suspicious structures
6. Create commercial tenant legal assistance program
7. Phase in protections for newer businesses (partial protection at 3 years)
8. Fund enforcement with dedicated staff
9. Create legacy business protection regardless of tenure

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Funding sustainability | Dedicated revenue streams, not appropriations |
| Agency capacity | Phase-in with capacity building |
| Political vulnerability | Build constituency for programs |
| Regional arbitrage | Coordinate across jurisdictions |
| Data gaps | Mandate displacement tracking |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

1. All anti-displacement legislation should include:
   - 5-year review requirement
   - Data collection mandate for outcome assessment
   - Advisory committee with affected community representation
   - Automatic renewal unless repealed
   - Annual reporting to legislature

2. TOPA and Right to Return should include:

3. Commercial protections should include:
   - Business retention rate monitoring
   - Rent trend analysis
   - Impact on commercial investment
   - Small business diversity assessment
