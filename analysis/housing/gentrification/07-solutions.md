# Gentrification: Solutions

## Overview

Effective anti-displacement strategies require a comprehensive toolkit addressing multiple pathways to displacement. No single policy suffices; protection requires layered interventions across tenant protections, homeowner stabilization, community ownership, equitable development, and commercial preservation. The most successful approaches combine immediate protections for vulnerable residents with long-term structural changes to land ownership and development patterns. This document outlines evidence-based solutions at the federal, state, and local levels.
