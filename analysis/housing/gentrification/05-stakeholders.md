# Gentrification: Stakeholders

## Overview

Gentrification involves a complex web of stakeholders with varying interests, power levels, and relationships to neighborhood change. Understanding these stakeholders is crucial for designing effective anti-displacement strategies and building coalitions for reform. The fundamental tension is between those who benefit from rising property values and those who are harmed by displacement. However, many stakeholders have mixed or complicated interests that create opportunities for coalition-building.
