# Gentrification: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Implementing comprehensive anti-displacement strategies requires careful sequencing that accounts for political feasibility, urgency of need, and building blocks for more ambitious reforms. This roadmap outlines a phased approach over 10 years, beginning with immediate tenant protections and building toward structural transformation of land ownership and development patterns. Success depends on building political power, securing funding, and creating institutional capacity at each stage.

## Implementation Principles

### Sequencing Logic

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Protect first, transform later | Stop the bleeding before restructuring |
| Build power as you go | Each win expands capacity for next |
| Layer protections | Multiple overlapping protections |
| Start local, expand | Local wins create models for state/federal |
| Enforcement first | Strengthen existing before adding new |

### Success Factors

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Organized constituency | Tenant unions, community organizations |
| Political champions | Elected officials committed to anti-displacement |
| Funding commitment | Resources for programs and enforcement |
| Data infrastructure | Track displacement, monitor interventions |
| Coalition breadth | Beyond housing advocates to broader movement |
