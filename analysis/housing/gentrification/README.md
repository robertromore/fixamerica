# Gentrification: Overview

Gentrification describes the transformation of lower-income urban neighborhoods through an influx of higher-income residents and investment, often resulting in rising housing costs and the displacement of long-time residents. This process affects an estimated 20-25% of low-income urban neighborhoods nationally, with rates accelerating since 2000. While gentrification can bring investment, improved services, and reduced crime to previously disinvested areas, these benefits often accrue primarily to newcomers while existing residents bear the costs of displacement, cultural erasure, and community dissolution. The central policy challenge is capturing the benefits of neighborhood investment while protecting vulnerable residents from its harms.
