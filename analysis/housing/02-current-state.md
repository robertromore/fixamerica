# Housing: Current State

## Overview

America's housing market in 2024 is defined by crisis-level unaffordability, severe supply shortages, persistent homelessness, and entrenched segregation. Housing costs have outpaced income growth for decades, leaving nearly half of renters cost-burdened and homeownership increasingly unattainable for younger generations. The shortage of 3.8-5.5 million units drives prices ever higher while 650,000+ people experience homelessness on any given night. Despite 50+ years of fair housing law, segregation persists and the Black-white homeownership gap has widened since 1960.
