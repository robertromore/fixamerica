# Housing: Opposition Analysis

## Overview

Housing reform faces opposition from well-organized, well-funded interests that benefit from the status quo. From homeowners protecting property values to real estate industry groups defending profits to local officials avoiding political risk, multiple actors work to block changes that would increase supply, improve affordability, or desegregate communities. Understanding these opponents, their tactics, and their vulnerabilities is essential for reform success.

## Opposition Messaging

### "Neighborhood Character"

### Environmental Arguments

| Claim | Reality |
