# Rural Housing: Current State

## Overview

Rural America's housing landscape reflects decades of disinvestment, population decline, and policy neglect. While housing costs in rural areas are generally lower than urban markets, rural households face distinct challenges: older and deteriorating housing stock, reliance on manufactured housing with limited consumer protections, inadequate infrastructure, and severe shortages for vulnerable populations. This document examines the current state of rural housing across multiple dimensions.

## Rural Housing Stock Characteristics

### Age and Condition

Rural housing is significantly older than urban housing:

| Housing Age | Rural | Urban |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Built before 1960 | 30% | 22% |
| Built 1960-1979 | 26% | 24% |
| Built 1980-1999 | 26% | 28% |
| Built 2000 or later | 18% | 26% |

**Implications of older housing**:

- Higher prevalence of lead paint (pre-1978)
- Outdated electrical and plumbing systems
- Poor energy efficiency
- Deferred maintenance due to limited incomes
- Structural issues (foundation, roofing)

### Quality Indicators

Rural housing quality lags on multiple measures:

| Quality Indicator | Rural | Urban |
|------------------|-------|-------|
| Lacking complete plumbing | 3.0% | 0.4% |
| Lacking complete kitchen | 2.8% | 0.6% |
| Moderately or severely inadequate | 7.2% | 4.8% |
| Using well water | 43% | 3% |
| Using septic system | 45% | 8% |

**Regional variations**:

- Appalachia: Highest rates of housing inadequacy
- Lower Mississippi Delta: Severe substandard housing concentrations
- Border colonias: Extreme infrastructure deficiencies
- Remote Alaska: Most severe conditions nationally
- Tribal lands: Crisis-level inadequacy

### Housing Tenure

Rural areas have higher homeownership but face distinct challenges:

| Tenure | Rural | Urban |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Owner-occupied | 79% | 63% |
| Renter-occupied | 21% | 37% |
| Owner with mortgage | 52% | 61% |
| Owner without mortgage | 48% | 39% |

**Implications**:

- Higher free-and-clear ownership masks housing poverty
- Elderly homeowners on fixed incomes cannot maintain properties
- Limited rental options restrict workforce mobility
- Absentee landlords reduce rental stock quality

## Manufactured Housing

### Prevalence and Distribution

Manufactured housing serves as rural America's primary affordable housing:

- **5.5 million** rural households in manufactured homes
- **70%** of all manufactured homes are in rural areas
- **16%** of rural housing stock is manufactured (vs. 4% urban)
- **22 million** people live in manufactured housing

**Regional concentrations**:

| Region | Manufactured Housing Share |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Southeast | 18% |
| Southwest | 14% |
| Rural West | 12% |
| Rural Midwest | 10% |
| Rural Northeast | 8% |

### Cost Advantages and Limitations

Manufactured housing offers significant cost benefits:

| Housing Type | Median Price |
|--------------|-------------|
| Site-built single-family | $320,000 |
| Manufactured (single-wide) | $57,000 |
| Manufactured (double-wide) | $120,000 |
| Average manufactured | $81,000 |

**However, manufactured homeowners face**:

- **Chattel loans** at 8-12% interest (vs. 6-7% mortgages)
- **Limited appreciation** compared to site-built
- **Depreciation** when classified as personal property
- **Land tenure insecurity** on rented lots
- **Community closures** and displacement

### Land Tenure Issues

The majority of manufactured homeowners face insecure tenure:

- **66%** of manufactured homes are on rented land
- **8,000+** manufactured housing communities nationally
- Average lot rent: **$300-500/month** (60% increase over 20 years)
- **30-day notice** typical for rent increases
- **90-day notice** common for community closure

**Recent concerns**:

- Private equity acquisition of manufactured housing communities
- Rent increases of 10-20% annually in acquired communities
- Community closures for redevelopment
- Homeowners unable to move homes ($5,000-20,000 moving costs)
- Homes abandoned when lot rents become unaffordable

## USDA Rural Housing Programs

### Section 502 Direct Loans

The Section 502 direct loan program provides low-interest mortgages to very-low and low-income rural households:

**Program characteristics**:
