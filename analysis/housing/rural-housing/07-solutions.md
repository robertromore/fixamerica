# Rural Housing: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing rural housing challenges requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond simply funding existing programs. Solutions must address the unique market failures of rural areas, reform manufactured housing policy, fulfill trust responsibilities to tribal nations, protect vulnerable populations, and integrate housing with broader rural development strategies. This document presents evidence-based solutions across multiple dimensions.

## USDA Program Expansion and Reform

### Section 502 Direct Loan Expansion

**Current problem**: Program serves 7,000 households annually despite millions eligible

**Proposed reforms**:

1. **Funding increase**: Restore to 1975 levels (inflation-adjusted), approximately $15 billion annually
2. **Processing streamlining**: Reduce processing time from 90-120 days to 30 days
3. **Manufactured housing emphasis**: Explicit funding targets for manufactured homes on owned land
4. **Income targeting**: Maintain focus on very-low-income (below 50% AMI)

**Implementation approach**:

- Dedicated underwriters for each state
