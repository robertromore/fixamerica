# Rural Housing: Stakeholders

## Overview

Rural housing involves a complex web of stakeholders with varying interests, power, and resources. Unlike urban housing where large landlords, well-funded advocacy groups, and concentrated populations create clear power dynamics, rural housing stakeholders are dispersed, under-resourced, and often politically marginalized. This document maps the key stakeholders in rural housing policy and practice.
