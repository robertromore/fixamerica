# Rural Housing: History

## Overview

The history of rural housing policy reflects the broader arc of federal engagement with rural America: periods of ambitious investment followed by neglect, programs designed for mid-20th century conditions but never modernized, and chronic underfunding even when programs exist. Understanding this history is essential for recognizing why current programs are insufficient and what reforms are needed.

## Pre-Federal Era (Before 1930s)

### Frontier and Settlement Housing

Early American rural housing was largely self-built:

- **Homestead Act (1862)**: Required "improvements" (housing) for land claims
- **Sod houses and log cabins**: Dominant frontier construction
- **No standards or assistance**: Housing quality varied enormously
- **Tenant farming in South**: Sharecropper housing controlled by landowners

### Early 20th Century Conditions

Rural housing conditions by 1930:

| Condition | Rural | Urban |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Lacking indoor plumbing | 70% | 30% |
| No electricity | 90% | 10% |
| Dirt floors | 15% | <1% |
| Overcrowded | 20% | 15% |

**Regional variations**:

- Appalachia: Severe poverty, substandard housing
- Deep South: Sharecropper cabins, often one-room
- Great Plains: Dugouts and sod houses still common
- Southwest: Adobe construction, varying quality

## New Deal and Rural Electrification (1933-1945)

### Farm Security Administration

The FSA represented the first significant federal rural housing investment:

**Programs created**:

- **Rural Rehabilitation Loans**: Small loans for housing repairs
- **Farm tenant purchase program**: Loans for sharecroppers to buy farms
- **Migrant labor camps**: First federal farmworker housing
- **Rural housing construction**: Limited direct construction

**FSA accomplishments**:

- 13,000 families received farm purchase loans
- 95 migrant labor camps built
- Loan program reached 800,000 families
- Photographic documentation (Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans) created political support

**Limitations and end**:

- Program attacked as "socialist"
- Southern Democrats opposed helping Black sharecroppers
- Funding cut after 1943
- Transferred to USDA with reduced mission

### Rural Electrification Administration

The REA (1936) transformed rural housing:

**Impact**:

- Rural electrification went from 10% to 90% (1936-1950)
- Enabled electric water pumps, refrigeration, lighting
- Improved housing habitability
- Created electric cooperative infrastructure still operating

### Tennessee Valley Authority

TVA improved housing through regional development:

- Displaced 15,000 families for dam construction
- Built model communities for displaced families
- Demonstrated improved rural housing standards
- Regional approach not replicated elsewhere

## Post-War Rural Housing Development (1945-1965)

### Farmers Home Administration Creation

FmHA (1946) consolidated rural lending programs:

**Initial programs**:

- **Farm ownership loans**: Purchasing farms
- **Farm operating loans**: Working capital
- **Housing loans**: Added gradually

**Evolution**:

- 1949: Section 502 direct loans created
- 1962: Rural rental housing (Section 515) authorized
- Focus shifted from farm to rural community development

### Rural Housing Act of 1949

The Housing Act of 1949 included rural provisions:

**Key elements**:

- Section 502: Direct loans for rural homeownership
- Section 504: Repair loans and grants for low-income
- National housing goal: "a decent home for every American family"

**Initial implementation**:

- Modest funding ($30 million first year)
- Focused on owner-occupied housing
- Income limits relatively generous
- Geographic reach limited by administrative capacity

### Early Section 502 Performance

| Period | Annual Loans | Avg. Loan Size |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| 1950-1954 | 15,000 | $4,500 |
| 1955-1959 | 25,000 | $6,000 |
| 1960-1964 | 30,000 | $8,000 |

## Great Society Expansion (1965-1980)

### Rural Housing Transformed

The Johnson administration dramatically expanded rural housing:

**Section 515 Rural Rental Housing (1962-1980)**:

- Program authorized in 1962
- Major funding increases after 1968
- Peak construction: 30,000 units annually (1975-1980)
- Created current 380,000-unit portfolio

**Section 502 Direct Loan Growth**:

| Year | Loans | Volume |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1965 | 35,000 | $350M |
| 1970 | 65,000 | $850M |
| 1975 | 95,000 | $2.5B |
| 1980 | 85,000 | $3.5B |

### Housing and Community Development Act (1974)

Created Section 521 rental assistance:

- Voucher-like subsidies for Section 515 tenants
- Allowed deep income targeting
- Initially well-funded
- Enabled housing for very-low-income families

### Manufactured Housing Act (1974)

Federal standards for manufactured housing:

- **HUD code** established for construction standards
- Preempted state codes (created uniform national market)
- Standards significantly improved safety
- But did not address financing, land tenure, or consumer protection

## Reagan Era Retrenchment (1980-1992)

### Dramatic Funding Cuts

The Reagan administration slashed rural housing:

**Section 502 Direct Loans**:

| Year | Loans | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1980 | 85,000 | Baseline |
| 1984 | 35,000 | -59% |
| 1988 | 25,000 | -71% |

**Section 515 Construction**:

| Year | Units | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1980 | 30,000 | Baseline |
| 1984 | 15,000 | -50% |
| 1988 | 5,000 | -83% |
| 1995 | 0 | -100% |

### Policy Shifts

**Philosophical changes**:

- Housing seen as market commodity, not public good
- Shift from direct assistance to guarantees
- "Devolution" to states (without funding)
- Rural seen as less politically important

**Section 502 Guaranteed Loans created (1990)**:

- Private lender origination
- Government guarantee
- Served higher-income households
- Eventually eclipsed direct program

## Clinton Era Stability (1993-2000)

### Limited Recovery

Modest improvements under Clinton:

**Section 502 Direct**:

- Funding stabilized at 30,000-35,000 loans annually
- Real value continued to decline with inflation
- Processing improvements increased efficiency

**Section 515**:

- New construction essentially ended (1995-1996)
- Focus shifted to preservation
- Portfolio began net decline

### Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities

Place-based initiatives included rural housing:

- 3 rural Empowerment Zones
- 30 rural Enterprise Communities
- Flexible funding for housing and development
- Mixed results, limited scale

### NAHASDA (1996)

Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act:

- Replaced patchwork of tribal housing programs
- Block grant approach
- Self-determination for tribes
- Funding capped at $650 million (never increased)

## Bush/Obama Era (2001-2016)

### Further Erosion

Section 502 Direct declined further:

| Year | Loans | Volume (Nominal) |
|------|-------|------------------|
| 2001 | 38,000 | $3.2B |
| 2006 | 20,000 | $2.5B |
| 2010 | 12,000 | $2.0B |

### Section 515 Preservation Crisis

The rental portfolio crisis accelerated:

**Mortgage maturations**:

- Original 50-year mortgages began maturing (2005+)
- 20,000+ units lost to maturations
- No new construction to replace losses

**Prepayments**:

- Owners could prepay after 20 years
- Incentives to convert to market-rate
- Additional 30,000+ units lost

### Recovery Act (2009)

Temporary boost during recession:

- $130 million additional Section 502 funding
- $113 million for Section 504 repairs
- $11 million for Section 515 preservation
- Short-term relief, not sustained investment

### Housing and Economic Recovery Act (2008)

Minor rural provisions:

- Expanded loan limits
- Streamlined processing
- Did not address fundamental underfunding

## Trump Era (2017-2020)

### Proposed Eliminations

Budget proposals sought to eliminate:

- Section 502 Direct Loans (zero funding proposed)
- Section 504 Repair Loans
- Section 515 Rural Rental Housing

**Congressional response**:

- Congress rejected eliminations
- But funding remained flat
- No new policy initiatives

### Section 515 Crisis Deepens

Portfolio continued declining:

- Lost 15,000+ additional units
- Average property age reached 35+ years
- Rehabilitation backlog reached $5 billion
- No preservation strategy implemented

## Biden Era (2021-Present)

### American Rescue Plan

COVID relief included rural housing:

- Emergency rental assistance reached rural areas
- Homeowner assistance fund included rural
- Section 502 processing delays addressed
- Temporary funding increase

### Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act

Limited housing provisions:

- Broadband expansion (indirectly affects housing)
- Water/sewer improvements for rural areas
- No direct Section 502/515 increase

### Inflation Reduction Act (2022)

Climate provisions with housing implications:

- Energy efficiency incentives
- Some manufactured housing weatherization
- Environmental justice provisions in rural areas

### Current State

Where programs stand as of 2024:

| Program | Peak Funding | Current | Change |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Section 502 Direct | 95,000 loans (1975) | 7,000 loans | -93% |
| Section 515 | 30,000 units/year (1978) | 0 new | -100% |
| Section 521 | Growing portfolio | 267,000 households | Declining |
| NAHASDA | $650M (1998) | $654M | Flat (50% decline in real terms) |

## Lessons from History

### What Worked

1. **Sustained investment**: Peak program performance came with adequate funding
2. **Direct assistance**: Direct loans reached households private markets could not serve
3. **Production programs**: Section 515 created lasting affordable housing
4. **Tribal self-determination**: NAHASDA improved over predecessor programs

### What Failed

1. **Inconsistent commitment**: Programs vulnerable to political changes
2. **Failure to modernize**: Programs designed for 1960s never updated
3. **Inadequate preservation**: No strategy to protect created housing
4. **Underfunded programs**: Appropriations never matched authorizations

### Structural Problems Persisting

- Rural constituency has declining political power
- Housing programs compete with farm programs in USDA budget
- Urban focus in housing policy debates
- Manufactured housing excluded from many programs and policies
- Tribal housing never adequately funded despite trust responsibility
