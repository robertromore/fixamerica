# Rural Housing: Overview

## Executive Summary

Rural America faces a housing crisis that is often invisible in national policy discussions focused on high-cost urban markets. Approximately 60 million Americans live in rural communities where housing challenges differ fundamentally from urban areas: aging and deteriorating housing stock, limited access to conventional mortgage financing, manufactured housing as the primary form of affordable housing, and severe shortages for specific populations including farmworkers, Native Americans, and residents of persistent poverty counties.

The USDA Rural Housing Service, the primary federal agency serving rural housing needs, operates programs that reach only a fraction of eligible households. Section 502 direct loans serve approximately 7,000 households annually despite millions of eligible rural families. The Section 515 rural rental portfolio has lost over 100,000 units since 1990 due to mortgage maturations and prepayments, with no significant new construction to replace them. Meanwhile, rural homelessness remains severely undercounted because traditional point-in-time counts miss people doubled up, living in cars, or camping in remote areas.

Rural housing quality lags urban areas significantly. Rural homes are older on average, more likely to lack complete plumbing or kitchen facilities, more likely to rely on septic systems and wells that may be failing, and more likely to be mobile or manufactured homes. Approximately 5.5 million rural households live in manufactured housing, often on rented land with insecure tenure and limited consumer protections.

What makes rural housing particularly challenging is its intersection with rural decline more broadly. As hospitals close, schools consolidate, employers leave, and young people migrate to cities, the economic base that supports housing markets erodes. Addressing rural housing requires addressing rural economic development, healthcare access, broadband infrastructure, and climate resilience simultaneously.

Solutions exist but require political will and sustained investment. USDA programs could be dramatically expanded. Manufactured housing standards and financing could be reformed. Tribal housing could receive the investment it has been promised but never received. Farmworker housing could be brought up to basic habitability standards. But rural constituencies have diminishing political power, and rural housing lacks the advocacy infrastructure that urban housing issues enjoy.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Housing conditions**: Age, quality, utilities, and structural adequacy of rural housing
- **Manufactured housing**: Prevalence, quality, tenure, and consumer protection issues
- **USDA programs**: Section 502 homeownership, Section 515 rental, Section 521 vouchers, and related programs
- **Tribal housing**: Native American and Alaska Native housing challenges and programs
- **Persistent poverty counties**: The 391 counties with 20%+ poverty for 30+ years
- **Farmworker housing**: Migrant and seasonal agricultural worker housing conditions
- **Rural homelessness**: Hidden homelessness in rural areas
- **Small town housing**: Main street and small community housing challenges
- **Climate resilience**: Flood, fire, storm, and extreme weather impacts on rural housing
- **Infrastructure connections**: Broadband, water, sewer, and energy links to housing
- **Preservation**: Protecting existing affordable rural housing stock

## Key Findings

### The scale of rural housing need

- **60 million** Americans live in rural areas (18% of population)
- **5.5 million** rural households live in manufactured housing
- **391 counties** designated as persistent poverty (20%+ poverty for 30+ years)
- **30% of rural homes** were built before 1960
- **3% of rural homes** lack complete plumbing compared to 0.4% urban

### USDA programs are severely underfunded

- Section 502 direct loans serve **7,000 households annually** vs. millions eligible
- Section 515 rental portfolio has lost **100,000+ units** since 1990
- Section 521 rental assistance has **600,000+ applicants** but limited vouchers
- USDA housing programs receive roughly **$1.4 billion** annually vs. $50+ billion for HUD

### Tribal housing faces crisis conditions

- **68,000 unit** shortage on tribal lands
- **40% of tribal homes** are overcrowded or lack adequate facilities
- **11% of tribal homes** lack complete plumbing (vs. 0.4% national average)
- Average wait for tribal housing is **3-5 years**

### Manufactured housing is rural America's affordable housing

- **70% of manufactured homes** are in rural areas
- Median price: **$81,000** (vs. $320,000 site-built)
- **66% of manufactured homes** are on rented land
- Average lot rent has increased **60%** over 20 years while incomes stagnate

### Rural homelessness is hidden but significant

- Standard point-in-time counts **miss 40-50%** of rural homeless
- Rural homelessness more likely involves **doubling up with family**
- **Domestic violence** is leading cause of rural family homelessness
- Only **4%** of homeless services funding reaches rural areas

## The Path Forward

Addressing rural housing requires:

1. **Dramatic USDA funding increases** - Section 502 and 515 programs should be funded to meet actual need, not arbitrary budget caps

2. **Manufactured housing reform** - Improve construction standards, financing, tenure security, and consumer protections

3. **Tribal housing investment** - Honor trust responsibilities with adequate funding for NAHASDA and BIA housing programs

4. **Rural homelessness recognition** - Count rural homeless accurately and fund rural-appropriate services

5. **Preservation strategy** - Protect existing Section 515 units and rural affordable housing stock from loss

6. **Infrastructure integration** - Connect housing investments to broadband, water, sewer, and healthcare access

7. **Climate resilience** - Harden rural housing against increasing weather extremes

8. **Economic development linkage** - Integrate housing with strategies to strengthen rural economies

## Why This Analysis Matters

Rural housing represents a market failure that private markets cannot solve. Low population density, limited economic bases, and aging populations make rural housing unattractive to private developers and lenders. Without government intervention, rural communities will continue to lose housing stock, quality will continue to decline, and rural residents will face increasingly substandard living conditions.

The rural housing crisis also reflects broader rural decline. When housing deteriorates, it becomes harder to attract workers, businesses, teachers, and healthcare providers. Addressing rural housing is essential for addressing rural healthcare, rural education, and rural economic development. These issues cannot be solved in isolation.

Finally, rural housing matters because rural America feeds the nation, produces its energy, and provides its natural resources. The approximately 2 million farmworkers who harvest our food often live in substandard, overcrowded housing. The communities that support energy production and extraction face boom-bust cycles that destabilize housing markets. Ensuring adequate rural housing serves national interests beyond the rural residents themselves.
