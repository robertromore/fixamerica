# Rural Housing: Overview

Rural America faces a housing crisis that is often invisible in national policy discussions focused on high-cost urban markets. Approximately 60 million Americans live in rural communities where housing challenges differ fundamentally from urban areas: aging and deteriorating housing stock, limited access to conventional mortgage financing, manufactured housing as the primary form of affordable housing, and severe shortages for specific populations including farmworkers, Native Americans, and residents of persistent poverty counties.
