# Zoning Reform: Current State

## Overview

American zoning in 2024 presents a paradox: unprecedented recognition that exclusionary zoning drives housing unaffordability, yet continued dominance of restrictive single-family zoning in most jurisdictions. Reform momentum has accelerated dramatically since 2017, with over a dozen states passing preemption legislation, but implementation remains uneven and resistance fierce.

## The Current Zoning Landscape

### Single-Family Zoning Dominance

**Share of Residential Land Zoned Single-Family-Only**:

| City | SF-Only Share | Year |
|------|---------------|------|
| San Jose | 94% | 2019 |
| Charlotte | 84% | 2020 |
| Seattle | 81% | 2019 |
| Los Angeles | 75% | 2021 |
| Portland | 77% | 2019 |
| Arlington, VA | 72% | 2021 |
| Minneapolis | 70% (pre-2020) | 2018 |
| New York City | 15% | 2020 |

**National Pattern**: Outside of New York City and a handful of older cities with pre-automobile development patterns, single-family zoning dominates American residential land use.

### Minimum Lot Size Requirements

**Lot Size Minimums in Suburban Jurisdictions**:

| Category | Typical Range | Effect |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Urban infill | 2,500-5,000 sq ft | Moderately restrictive |
| Inner suburbs | 6,000-10,000 sq ft | Exclusionary |
| Outer suburbs | 0.5-1 acre | Highly exclusionary |
| Exurban/rural-fringe | 1-5 acres | Extremely exclusionary |
| Wealthy enclaves | 2-5+ acres | Maximum exclusion |

**Case Study**: Atherton, California maintains 1-acre minimum lots citywide, making it one of the wealthiest and most exclusive municipalities in America. Similar minimums exist in wealthy suburbs nationwide.

### Parking Requirements

**Typical Parking Minimums**:

| Use | Typical Requirement | Cost Impact |
|-----|---------------------|-------------|
| Single-family home | 2 spaces | $10,000-30,000 |
| Apartment (suburban) | 1.5-2 spaces/unit | $30,000-75,000/unit |
| Apartment (urban) | 1-1.5 spaces/unit | $50,000-100,000/unit |
| Retail | 4-5 spaces/1,000 sq ft | Major land consumption |
| Office | 3-4 spaces/1,000 sq ft | Subsidizes driving |

**Recent Reform Trend**: Over 50 cities have eliminated or reduced parking minimums since 2020, including major cities like San Francisco, Austin, and Anchorage.

### Height Limits and Density Caps

**Common Restrictions**:

| Zone Type | Typical Height Limit | Typical Density Cap |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Single-family | 35 feet (2-3 stories) | 1 unit per lot |
| Low-density residential | 35-45 feet | 8-15 units/acre |
| Medium-density | 45-65 feet | 30-50 units/acre |
| High-density | 85-200+ feet | 100+ units/acre |

**Problem**: Even in designated high-density zones, height limits and FAR restrictions often prevent economically viable development.

## Housing Production Data

### Impact of Reform

**California ADU Production**:

| Year | ADU Permits | % Change |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 2016 | 1,200 | Baseline |
| 2018 | 6,000 | +400% |
| 2020 | 15,000 | +150% |
| 2022 | 23,000 | +53% |
| 2023 | 25,000+ | +10% |

**Minneapolis Early Results** (2020-2023):

- 2-4 unit building permits: Up 200%+
- Total housing permits: Increased 40%
- Prices: Continued to rise (demand still outpaces supply)

### Persistent Shortfall

**National Housing Deficit Estimates**:

| Source | Estimate | Year |
|--------|----------|------|
| Freddie Mac | 3.8 million units | 2021 |
| Up For Growth | 3.8 million units | 2022 |
| National Association of Realtors | 5.5 million units | 2023 |
| Zillow | 4.5 million units | 2023 |

**Annual Production vs. Need**:

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| New household formation | ~1.5 million/year |
| New units needed (accounting for demolition) | ~1.6-1.8 million/year |
| Actual production (recent average) | ~1.4 million/year |
| Annual shortfall | ~200,000-400,000 units |

## Environmental Review as Barrier

### CEQA (California)

**Current Status**:

- Any project can be challenged under CEQA
- Litigation delays projects 2-5+ years
- Adds $50,000-$500,000 in costs
- Chilling effect on housing development
- Disproportionately used against housing vs. other projects

**Reform Efforts**:

| Reform | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Streamlining for infill housing | Partial success |
| CEQA exemptions for certain projects | Limited |
| SB 35 ministerial approval | Effective when triggered |
| Union labor requirement for streamlining | Controversial trade-off |

### NEPA (Federal)

**Impact on Housing**:

- Federal nexus triggers review (funding, permits, flood insurance)
- Multi-year delays common
- Layered with state requirements
- Biden administration reforms underway
- 2024 regulatory changes pending

## Process and Discretion

### Discretionary vs. By-Right Development

**Current Pattern**:

| Jurisdiction Type | By-Right Housing | Discretionary Housing |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Restrictive cities | <10% of projects | >90% of projects |
| Moderate cities | 30-50% of projects | 50-70% of projects |
| Reform-oriented | 60-80% of projects | 20-40% of projects |

**Impact of Discretion**:

- Adds 1-3 years to approval timeline
- Enables NIMBY challenges
- Increases uncertainty and risk
- Reduces housing production
- Favors well-connected developers

### Public Hearing Requirements

**Typical Process for Multi-Family Project**:

1. Pre-application meeting
2. Application submission
3. Environmental review (6-24 months)
4. Planning commission hearing(s)
5. Design review board
6. City council hearing(s)
7. Appeal period
8. Potential CEQA litigation

**Timeline**: 2-5 years from concept to permit
**Cost**: $100,000-$1 million+ in carrying costs

## Fair Housing and Segregation

### Current Segregation Levels

**Dissimilarity Index** (0 = integration, 100 = complete segregation):

| Metro Area | Black-White | Hispanic-White |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Milwaukee | 81 | 57 |
| Detroit | 79 | 46 |
| Chicago | 76 | 57 |
| Cleveland | 74 | 50 |
| Philadelphia | 69 | 55 |
| National Average | 62 | 48 |

### Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing

**Status**:

- Obama-era AFFH rule issued 2015
- Trump administration suspended 2020
- Biden administration reinstated 2021
- Limited enforcement to date
- Local jurisdictions slow to comply

## Market Conditions

### Price Trends

**Median Home Prices** (2024):

| Market | Median Price | % of Median Income Required |
|--------|--------------|----------------------------|
| San Jose | $1,500,000 | 140%+ |
| San Francisco | $1,200,000 | 120%+ |
| Los Angeles | $950,000 | 100%+ |
| Seattle | $800,000 | 85%+ |
| Denver | $600,000 | 75%+ |
| National | $417,000 | 55%+ |

### Rent Burdens

**Share of Renters Cost-Burdened** (>30% income on rent):

| Income Level | % Cost-Burdened |
|--------------|-----------------|
| <$30,000 | 83% |
| $30,000-50,000 | 57% |
| $50,000-75,000 | 28% |
| >$75,000 | 9% |
| All renters | 50% |

## Emerging Issues

### Climate and Zoning

**Wildfire Zones**: California and other states restricting development in high-fire-risk areas, pushing development toward existing urban areas.

**Flood Risk**: Updated FEMA maps and sea level rise projections affecting coastal zoning.

**Energy Codes**: New requirements for electrification, solar, EV charging adding costs.

### Post-Pandemic Trends

**Remote Work Impact**:

- Reduced demand for downtown office
- Increased demand for suburban/exurban housing
- Opportunities for office-to-residential conversion
- New zoning flexibility needed

**Commercial Vacancy**: Office vacancy rates 15-25% in major metros; conversion potential.
