# Zoning Reform: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Housing as Regional Necessity

Housing markets are regional; zoning decisions are local. Solutions must address this mismatch.

**Principles**:

- Regional housing needs require regional solutions
- Local governments cannot be trusted to zone adequately for housing
- State preemption is necessary to overcome local obstruction
- All communities must share responsibility for housing

### By-Right Over Discretion

Discretionary approval processes enable opposition and add cost and delay.

**Principles**:

- Housing meeting objective standards should be approved as-of-right
- Reduce opportunities for project-specific opposition
- Create certainty for housing investment
- Limit hearings to genuine policy questions

### Abundance Over Scarcity

The housing crisis requires significant increase in housing production.

**Principles**:

- More housing of all types is needed
- Market-rate and affordable housing are complements, not substitutes
- Removing barriers is as important as adding subsidies
- Allow the market to build what is demanded

### Equity and Inclusion

Zoning reform must address historical exclusion and current segregation.

**Principles**:

- All neighborhoods should accommodate diverse housing
- Fair housing requires opening exclusionary areas
- Low-income families need access to high-opportunity places
- Reform should not accelerate displacement in vulnerable communities

## Core Policy Solutions

### Legalize Missing Middle Housing

**Definition**: Duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, townhomes, courtyard apartments, small apartment buildings.

**Current Problem**: Banned in 75%+ of residential land in most cities.

**Solution**: Legalize 2-4+ units on all residential lots.

**Models**:

| Jurisdiction | Reform | Year |
|--------------|--------|------|
| Minneapolis | Triplexes on all SF lots | 2020 |
| Oregon | Duplexes statewide; 4-plexes in larger cities | 2019 |
| California SB 9 | Duplexes + lot splits on SF lots | 2021 |
| Montana SB 245 | Duplexes statewide | 2023 |

**Design Considerations**:

- Height limits (typically 35-45 feet)
- Lot coverage limits
- Form-based standards
- Contextual compatibility requirements

### Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)

**Definition**: Secondary housing units on single-family lots (backyard cottages, garage conversions, basement apartments).

**Benefits**:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Incremental density | Adds housing without changing neighborhood form |
| Homeowner wealth | Income for existing homeowners |
| Family housing | Multigenerational living |
| Affordable | Often rented at below-market rates |

**Best Practices**:

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| By-right approval | No discretionary review |
| No parking requirements | Especially near transit |
| No owner-occupancy requirement | Limits financing and production |
| Pre-approved plans | Reduce design costs |
| Financing assistance | ADU loans, grants |

**Results**: California ADU permits increased from ~1,200 (2016) to ~25,000 (2023) after reforms.

### Eliminate Single-Family-Only Zoning

**Action**: Allow multi-family housing in all residential zones.

**Implementation Options**:

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Full elimination | Minneapolis (triplexes everywhere) |
| Transit overlay | More density near transit stops |
| Graduated density | More units on larger lots |
| Form-based | Regulate form not use |

**Arguments**:

- Single-family zoning was tool of segregation
- No justification for prohibiting duplexes
- Diverse housing types serve diverse households
- Market should determine housing mix

### Reduce or Eliminate Parking Minimums

**Problem**: Parking requirements add $30,000-$100,000 per unit; consume land; induce driving.

**Reform Trend**: Over 50 cities have eliminated or reduced minimums since 2020.

| City | Action | Year |
|------|--------|------|
| San Francisco | Eliminated citywide | 2018 |
| Minneapolis | Eliminated citywide | 2021 |
| Austin | Eliminated downtown and transit areas | 2023 |
| Anchorage | Eliminated citywide | 2023 |
| San Jose | Eliminated citywide | 2023 |

**Best Practices**:

- Eliminate minimums entirely
- Or: drastically reduce (0.5 spaces/unit or less)
- Allow unbundled parking
- Permit in-lieu fees for shared parking

### Transit-Oriented Development

**Principle**: High-density housing near transit stations and corridors.

**Implementation**:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| TOD overlays | Higher density/height near transit |
| Parking elimination | Zero parking required near transit |
| By-right approval | Streamlined process for TOD |
| Transit investment | Coordinate housing and transit planning |

**Models**:

- California SB 35: Streamlined approval near transit
- Washington HB 2321: Required density near transit
- Arlington County, VA: Rosslyn-Ballston corridor

### Upzoning Commercial Corridors

**Opportunity**: Allow housing on underutilized commercial land.

**Benefits**:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Less conflict | Commercial areas have fewer NIMBY residents |
| Transit access | Corridors often on transit lines |
| Walkability | Services already present |
| Vacancy | Many commercial properties underutilized |

**Models**:

- California AB 2011: Housing on commercial land
- California AB 1490: Office-to-residential conversion
- Many local commercial corridor plans

### By-Right Approval and Streamlining

**Problem**: Discretionary approval adds 1-3+ years; enables opposition; creates uncertainty.

**Solution**: Ministerial (by-right) approval for housing meeting objective standards.

**Elements**:

| Reform | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Objective standards | Clear, measurable criteria |
| Ministerial review | Staff approval, no hearings |
| Shot clock | Approval deadlines (60-90 days) |
| Deemed approved | Automatic approval if deadline missed |
| Design standards | Replace discretionary design review |

**Model**: California SB 35 requires ministerial approval for projects meeting objective standards in non-compliant jurisdictions.

### State Preemption

**Rationale**: Local governments have incentives to restrict housing; state action required.

**Types**:

| Preemption Type | Example |
|-----------------|---------|
| Legalize specific uses | Oregon HB 2001 (duplexes) |
| Require density near transit | Washington HB 2321 |
| Streamline approval | California SB 35 |
| Housing element enforcement | California HCD enforcement |
| Override local restrictions | Montana SB 382 |

**Political Challenge**: State legislators represent local constituents who may oppose.

**Success Factors**:

- Housing crisis severity creates political will
- YIMBY and allied advocacy
- Governor leadership
- Coalition building

### CEQA/Environmental Review Reform

**Problem**: Environmental review used to delay and block housing regardless of environmental merit.

**Reforms**:

| Reform | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Categorical exemptions | No review for qualifying projects |
| Streamlined EIR | Abbreviated review for infill |
| Judicial reform | Limit litigation standing, fee-shifting |
| Tiered review | Program-level review reduces project-level |
| Statute of limitations | Shorten litigation timeline |

**Caution**: Environmental protections are valuable; reform should target abuse, not legitimate review.

## Complementary Policies

### Inclusionary Zoning

**Definition**: Require affordable units in market-rate developments.

**Trade-offs**:

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Creates affordable housing | Reduces overall production |
| No public subsidy needed | Increases market-rate prices |
| Integrates income levels | May make projects infeasible |

**Best Practices**:

- Modest requirements (10-20%)
- Density bonuses to offset
- In-lieu fees as alternative
- Apply to larger projects only

### Density Bonuses

**Mechanism**: Allow more density in exchange for affordable units or other benefits.

**Model**: California Density Bonus Law allows 35-80% more units for including affordable housing.

**Advantages**:

- Incentivizes affordable housing
- No direct subsidy
- Makes inclusionary requirements feasible
- Increases overall housing production

### Impact Fee Reform

**Problem**: Excessive impact fees can make housing infeasible.

**Reforms**:

| Reform | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Cap fees | Prevent excessive charges |
| Fee transparency | Require justification |
| Proportionality | Fees reflect actual costs |
| Exemptions | Reduce or waive for affordable housing |

### Social Housing and Public Development

**Approach**: Government or nonprofit development of housing.

**Models**:

| Model | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Public housing authorities | Limited funding; stigmatized history |
| Community land trusts | Nonprofit ownership; permanent affordability |
| Social housing | Vienna, Singapore models |
| Mixed-income public development | Montgomery County, MD |

**Advantages**:

- Direct affordability control
- Long-term stability
- Can serve lowest-income households

**Challenges**:

- Requires significant public funding
- Political opposition
- Limited capacity

### Fair Share Housing Requirements

**Principle**: All jurisdictions must accommodate their fair share of regional housing need.

**Model**: New Jersey Mount Laurel doctrine.

**Implementation**:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Regional housing needs | State determines total need |
| Allocation | Distribute need to jurisdictions |
| Planning requirement | Jurisdictions must zone to accommodate |
| Builder's remedy | If jurisdiction fails, developer can build |
| State enforcement | Consequences for non-compliance |

**California Model**: Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process, enforced by Housing and Community Development (HCD).

## What Has Worked Elsewhere

### Minneapolis 2040

**Reforms**:

- Eliminated single-family-only zoning
- Legalized triplexes on all residential lots
- Reduced parking requirements
- Allowed more density on corridors

**Results** (early):

- 2-4 unit permits up 200%+
- Total housing permits increased
- No observed neighborhood harm

### Oregon HB 2001

**Reforms**:

- Duplexes allowed in all cities >1,000
- Fourplexes allowed in cities >25,000
- ADUs streamlined

**Implementation**: Still early; local compliance varying.

### California ADU Reform

**Reforms**:

- By-right approval
- No parking near transit
- No owner-occupancy requirement
- Pre-approved plans

**Results**: ADU permits increased ~20x (1,200 to 25,000 annually).

### Tokyo, Japan

**Model**: National zoning system with 12 zones; residential allowed in most.

**Result**: Housing supply responds to demand; Tokyo more affordable than comparably-sized Western cities despite economic growth.

**Lesson**: Permissive zoning enables housing production to meet demand.

### Vienna, Austria

**Model**: ~60% of residents live in subsidized housing; extensive social housing program.

**Result**: Housing affordable and high-quality; mixed-income neighborhoods.

**Lesson**: Public investment can complement market housing.

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Market-Rate vs. Affordable Housing

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Market-rate focus | More total units; responds to demand | Doesn't serve lowest-income |
| Affordable focus | Directly serves need; deeper subsidy | Limited by funding; fewer total units |
| Both | Comprehensive; serves range of incomes | Requires multiple policy tools |

**Synthesis**: Both are needed; neither alone is sufficient.

### State vs. Local Control

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Local control | Responsive to local preferences | Enables exclusion; ignores regional need |
| State preemption | Addresses collective action problem | May not reflect local context; political backlash |
| State floor with local flexibility | Minimum standards; local adaptation | Complexity; potential for circumvention |

### Speed vs. Deliberation

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Streamlined approval | Faster; more certain; lower cost | Less community input |
| Extensive review | Community engagement; potential issues identified | Delay; obstruction; higher cost |
