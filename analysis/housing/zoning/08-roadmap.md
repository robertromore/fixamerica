# Zoning Reform: Roadmap

## Overview

Zoning reform requires coordinated action at state, regional, and local levels. This roadmap outlines a sequenced approach to building political power, passing legislation, and implementing reforms that produce housing.

## Strategic Framework

### Theory of Change

**Problem**: Local governments have incentives to exclude housing; regional housing markets are harmed by aggregated local decisions.

**Solution Path**:

1. Build political coalition demanding reform
2. Pass state legislation preempting local exclusion
3. Implement reforms with compliance mechanisms
4. Produce housing and demonstrate benefits
5. Expand reforms based on success

### Political Conditions for Reform

| Condition | Status | Trend |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Housing cost crisis visible | High | Increasing |
| Broad coalition | Building | Growing |
| YIMBY movement | Active | Strengthening |
| State legislative interest | Moderate-High | Increasing |
| Governor support | Varies by state | Mixed |
| Public opinion | Shifting | More supportive of building |

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-12)

### Coalition Development

**YIMBY Organization**:

**Message Development**:

| Audience | Core Message | Supporting Points |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| General public | Housing costs too much; we need more homes | Affordability data; personal stories |
| Environmentalists | Sprawl is climate disaster; density is solution | VMT data; emissions analysis |
| Fiscal conservatives | Sprawl costs more; infill is efficient | Infrastructure cost data |
| Civil rights advocates | Zoning perpetuates segregation | Historical data; opportunity mapping |
| Business | Workers can't afford housing | Recruitment challenges; wage pressure |

## Phase 2: Legislative Campaign (Months 12-24)

### Priority Legislation Sequence

**Year 1 Priorities** (most achievable):

| Bill | Content | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| ADU legalization | By-right ADUs statewide | Broadly popular; low opposition |
| Parking reform | Eliminate or reduce parking minimums | Technical; growing support |
| Approval deadlines | Shot clocks for housing approvals | Procedural; hard to oppose |
| CEQA/environmental reform | Exemptions for infill housing | Necessary for other reforms |

**Year 2 Priorities** (building on success):

| Bill | Content | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Missing middle legalization | Duplexes/fourplexes in all zones | Core reform; more controversial |
| Transit-oriented density | Required density near transit | Appeals to environmentalists |
| By-right approval | Ministerial approval for compliant projects | Major process reform |
| Housing element enforcement | Consequences for non-compliant cities | Accountability |

**Year 3 and Beyond** (comprehensive reform):

| Bill | Content | Rationale |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Eliminate SF-only zoning | Statewide upzoning | Transformative; requires political capital |
| Fair share requirements | Mandatory housing allocation | Ensures all communities contribute |
| Commercial corridor housing | Housing by-right on commercial land | Major new housing opportunity |
| Social housing authority | State role in direct housing provision | Long-term affordability |

### Legislative Strategy

**Committee Strategy**:

| Task | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Identify key committees | Map jurisdiction; relationship-build |
| Committee chair relationship | Early engagement; address concerns |
| Testimony coordination | Expert witnesses; affected residents |
| Amendment strategy | Prepare for amendments; set bright lines |

**Floor Strategy**:

| Phase | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| Whip count | Identify supporters, opponents, undecided |
| Undecided persuasion | Targeted advocacy; constituent pressure |
| Opposition management | Address concerns; minimize amendments |
| Vote mobilization | Ensure supporters present and voting |

**Governor Engagement**:

| Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| Brief governor's office | Early in process |
| Address administration concerns | Throughout |
| Build public support | Create political cover |
| Signature event planning | Upon passage |

## Phase 3: Implementation (Months 24-48)

### State Agency Setup

**Implementation Infrastructure**:

| Task | Timeline | Agency |
|------|----------|--------|
| Rulemaking | Months 24-30 | Housing agency |
| Guidance documents | Months 24-36 | Housing agency |
| Technical assistance | Months 30-48 | Housing agency |
| Compliance monitoring | Months 30+ | Housing agency |
| Enforcement mechanisms | Months 36+ | Attorney General |

### Local Compliance

**Compliance Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Local code audit | 6 months post-enactment | Identify conflicting provisions |
| Draft amendments | 9 months | Prepare code changes |
| Public process | 12 months | Required hearings |
| Code adoption | 18 months | Council/commission action |
| Full compliance | 24 months | Enforcement begins |

**Addressing Non-Compliance**:

| Trigger | Response | Escalation |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Missed deadline | Warning letter | Formal finding |
| Code violation | Technical assistance | Builder's remedy |
| Pattern of obstruction | Investigation | Court action |
| Willful non-compliance | State enforcement | Funding withholding |

### Builder's Remedy

**Mechanism**: If jurisdiction is non-compliant, developers can build housing meeting state standards regardless of local zoning.

**Implementation**:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Certification | State certifies non-compliance |
| Application | Developer submits to state |
| Review | State reviews against state standards |
| Approval | State issues approval |
| Local process | Ministerial permit at local level |

## Phase 4: Monitoring and Expansion (Months 48+)

### Tracking Progress

**Key Metrics**:

| Metric | Measurement | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Housing permits | Total permits; by housing type | Monthly |
| Housing production | Units completed | Quarterly |
| Compliance rate | Jurisdictions in compliance | Annually |
| Affordability | Median rent/price; cost burden | Annually |
| Segregation | Dissimilarity indices | Annually |

**Reporting**:

| Report | Content | Frequency |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Implementation dashboard | Real-time permit and compliance data | Continuous |
| Annual housing report | Comprehensive assessment | Annual |
| Non-compliance list | Jurisdictions failing obligations | Quarterly |
| Impact assessment | Outcomes of reform | Biennial |

### Iterative Reform

**Addressing Gaps**:

| Issue | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Loopholes discovered | Corrective legislation |
| Weak compliance | Strengthen enforcement |
| Insufficient production | Expand reforms |
| Unintended consequences | Targeted adjustments |

**Expansion Opportunities**:

| Reform | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| Deeper upzoning | If missing middle insufficient |
| Commercial conversion | If vacancy persists |
| Social housing | If market alone inadequate |
| Regional planning | If local compliance insufficient |

## Timeline Summary

| Expansion | Months 48+ | Results measured; reforms expanded |

## State-Specific Considerations

### High-Cost Coastal States (CA, WA, OR, MA, NY)

**Advantages**: Housing crisis is visible; political energy for reform; some precedents.

**Challenges**: Entrenched opposition; high land costs; CEQA-type laws.

**Priorities**: State preemption; environmental review reform; aggressive enforcement.

### Growing Sun Belt States (TX, FL, AZ, NC, GA)

**Advantages**: Less legacy restriction; growth creates opportunity.

**Challenges**: Conservative ideology; state preemption of local affordable housing tools; sprawl-oriented development pattern.

**Priorities**: Prevent new restrictions; unlock urban infill; transit-oriented development.

### Slow-Growth Midwest/Rust Belt (OH, MI, PA, IL)

**Advantages**: Lower baseline prices; less opposition in some areas.

**Challenges**: Less political urgency; suburban exclusion persists; urban disinvestment.

**Priorities**: Suburban missing middle; urban revival tools; regional equity.
