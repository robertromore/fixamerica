# Zoning Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

Zoning is America's most powerful tool of housing exclusion. Originally created to separate incompatible land uses, zoning has evolved into a system that restricts housing supply, drives up costs, entrenches segregation, and excludes millions from economic opportunity. Approximately 75% of residential land in American cities is zoned exclusively for single-family homes, legally prohibiting apartments, townhomes, and other housing types that would serve diverse populations and price points.

The consequences are severe: median home prices exceeding $400,000 nationally (over $1 million in coastal metros), renters spending 30-50% of income on housing, and persistent racial and economic segregation. Restrictive zoning costs the American economy an estimated $1.6 trillion annually in lost productivity and wages as workers cannot afford to live near high-opportunity job centers.

Reform is accelerating. California, Oregon, Montana, and other states have begun preempting local zoning to allow more housing. Minneapolis eliminated single-family-only zoning citywide. Yet resistance remains fierce, with homeowners, local governments, and neighborhood groups defending exclusionary practices under the banner of "local control" and "neighborhood character."

## Scope

### What This Subtopic Covers

- **Single-Family Zoning**: The dominant form of exclusionary zoning and its effects
- **Development Standards**: Lot sizes, setbacks, height limits, parking requirements, FAR
- **Density Restrictions**: Limits on units per acre, dwelling types, building forms
- **Process Requirements**: Discretionary review, conditional use permits, public hearings
- **Historic Preservation**: When preservation becomes a tool for exclusion
- **Environmental Review**: CEQA, NEPA, and procedural barriers to housing
- **ADUs and Missing Middle**: Efforts to add housing within existing neighborhoods
- **Reform Movements**: YIMBY organizing, state preemption, local reform efforts

### What This Subtopic Does Not Cover

- Affordable housing programs (see [Housing Solutions](../07-solutions.md))
- Homelessness policy (see [Homelessness](../homelessness/01-overview.md))
- Rent control and tenant protections (see [Tenant Protections](../tenant-protections/01-overview.md))
- Construction costs and labor (see [Housing Costs](../02-current-state.md))
- Federal housing programs (see [Housing Overview](../01-overview.md))

## Key Questions

1. **Why is housing so expensive?** What role does restrictive zoning play in constraining supply and driving prices beyond reach of middle-income families?

2. **How did zoning become exclusionary?** What transformed a public health tool into a mechanism for racial and economic segregation?

3. **Why can't localities just "zone for more housing"?** What political economy makes local governments systematically under-zone for housing?

4. **What reforms work?** Which approaches have successfully increased housing production and access?

5. **How can reform overcome opposition?** What strategies address the political power of incumbent homeowners and local governments?

## Why This Matters

**Housing Costs**: Zoning directly constrains housing supply; relaxing restrictions has been shown to reduce rents and prices

**Economic Opportunity**: Workers cannot access jobs when housing near employment centers is unaffordable

**Racial Equity**: Exclusionary zoning perpetuates the segregation that began with explicitly racial zoning and redlining

**Climate**: Low-density sprawl increases vehicle miles traveled, energy consumption, and carbon emissions

**Fiscal Health**: Single-family sprawl costs municipalities more in services than it generates in tax revenue

**Social Mobility**: Zoning keeps low-income families out of high-opportunity neighborhoods with good schools

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Land zoned single-family only | ~75% of residential land in major cities |
| Housing units prevented | Estimated millions of units below market demand |
| Cost to GDP | ~$1.6 trillion annually (Hsieh & Moretti) |
| Median home price | $417,000 nationally (2024) |
| Cost-burdened renters | 50% pay >30% income for rent |
| Severely burdened renters | 26% pay >50% income for rent |
| Housing deficit | 3.8-7 million unit shortfall nationally |
| Reform states | 15+ states have passed zoning preemption |

## The Problem in Context

### Types of Exclusionary Zoning

| Regulation | Exclusionary Effect |
|------------|---------------------|
| Single-family-only zoning | Prohibits all multi-family housing |
| Minimum lot sizes | Requires 1/4 acre to 5+ acres per home |
| Maximum density limits | Caps units per acre at low levels |
| Height limits | Prevents mid-rise and high-rise housing |
| Setback requirements | Reduces buildable area on lots |
| Parking minimums | Adds $30,000-$75,000 per unit cost |
| Floor area ratios (FAR) | Limits building size relative to lot |
| Design review | Discretionary denial of housing |

### Geographic Variation

**Most Restrictive Markets**:

- San Francisco Bay Area
- Greater Los Angeles
- New York metropolitan area
- Boston metropolitan area
- Washington, DC area
- Seattle metropolitan area

**States Leading Reform**:

- California (multiple bills since 2017)
- Oregon (statewide upzoning 2019)
- Montana (statewide reform 2023)
- Minnesota (Minneapolis eliminated SF-only zoning)
- Washington (multiple bills 2023-2024)
