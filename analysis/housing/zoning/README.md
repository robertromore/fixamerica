# Zoning Reform: Overview

Zoning is America's most powerful tool of housing exclusion. Originally created to separate incompatible land uses, zoning has evolved into a system that restricts housing supply, drives up costs, entrenches segregation, and excludes millions from economic opportunity. Approximately 75% of residential land in American cities is zoned exclusively for single-family homes, legally prohibiting apartments, townhomes, and other housing types that would serve diverse populations and price points.
