# Zoning Reform: Root Causes

## Overview

Exclusionary zoning persists not by accident but because it serves powerful interests and emerges from systematic political and economic dynamics. Understanding why restrictive zoning is so difficult to reform requires analyzing the incentive structures facing homeowners, local governments, and the political system.

## The Political Economy of Local Zoning

### Homeowner Incentives

**Housing as Investment**: For most Americans, their home is their largest asset. Homeowners have strong financial incentives to protect and increase property values.

| Factor | Homeowner Interest | Policy Implication |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Property values | Maximize | Restrict supply |
| Neighborhood stability | Preserve | Block change |
| School quality | Maintain | Exclude lower-income families |
| Tax burden | Minimize | Resist affordable housing |
| Traffic/parking | Reduce | Oppose density |

**Asymmetric Costs and Benefits**:

| Stakeholder | Costs of New Housing | Benefits of New Housing |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Existing homeowners | Concentrated, visible | Diffuse, uncertain |
| Would-be residents | Diffuse (blocked from existing) | Concentrated (if allowed in) |
| Region | Aggregate housing shortage | Lower prices, more mobility |

**Implication**: Those who benefit from exclusion are organized and present; those harmed are dispersed and often absent from local decisions.

### The Homevoter Hypothesis

**William Fischel's Theory**: Homeowners ("homevoters") dominate local politics because:

1. **Home = Largest Asset**: Strong motivation to protect value
2. **Local Control**: Zoning decisions made locally where homeowners vote
3. **Low Turnout**: Local elections favor motivated participants
4. **Organization**: Homeowner associations, neighborhood groups organize
5. **Information**: Homeowners track local development closely

**Result**: Local governments systematically cater to homeowner preferences, which means restricting housing supply.

### Local Government Fiscal Incentives

**The "Fiscalization" of Zoning**:

| Revenue Source | Relative Value | Zoning Preference |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Property tax (high-value homes) | High | Large lots, expensive homes |
| Sales tax | High | Commercial/retail |
| Property tax (apartments) | Lower per acre | Avoid |
| Affordable housing | Negative (services > taxes) | Avoid |

**Service Costs by Housing Type**:

| Housing Type | Service Cost | Tax Revenue | Net Fiscal Impact |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Large single-family | Moderate | High | Positive |
| Small single-family | Moderate | Moderate | Neutral |
| Multi-family | Higher (more residents) | Lower per unit | Often negative |
| Affordable housing | Highest (family services) | Lowest | Negative |

**Implication**: Local governments have fiscal incentives to zone for high-end housing and exclude affordable units.

## Structural Factors

### Fragmented Governance

**The Problem**:

| Metric | United States | Other Countries |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Local governments | 90,000+ | Far fewer |
| Housing markets | Regional | Decisions local |
| Externalities | Regional (traffic, jobs) | Costs local |
| Accountability | Local | Mismatched |

**Consequences**:

- No authority responsible for regional housing supply
- Municipalities can externalize housing burden to neighbors
- Race to the bottom in exclusion
- Regional needs unmet by local decisions

### The "Missing Constituency" Problem

**Who Participates in Zoning Decisions**:

| Group | Participation | Interest |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Existing homeowners | Very high | Block development |
| Renters | Low | May support development |
| Future residents | Zero (can't vote) | Would support development |
| Regional commuters | Near zero | Would support development |
| Developers | Present but distrusted | Support development |

**Result**: The people who would benefit most from new housing cannot participate in decisions about it.

### Low-Turnout Local Elections

**Participation Disparities**:

| Election Type | Turnout | Composition |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Presidential | 60-65% | Diverse |
| Midterm | 40-50% | Older, whiter |
| Local (on-cycle) | 30-40% | Homeowner-heavy |
| Local (off-cycle) | 10-20% | Very homeowner-heavy |

**Implication**: Zoning decisions made by unrepresentative, homeowner-dominated electorates.

## Ideological and Cultural Factors

### "Neighborhood Character" as Value

**Components**:

- Aesthetic preferences (architectural style, building scale)
- Density preferences (single-family ideal)
- Social homogeneity (implicit or explicit)
- Environmental character (trees, open space)
- Pace of change (stability preference)

**Weaponization**: "Character" arguments used to block housing regardless of actual impact.

### The American Dream as Exclusion

**The Single-Family Ideal**:

- Homeownership = Success
- Detached house with yard = Ideal
- Apartments = Transient, lower-class
- Renters = Less invested in community

**Historical Roots**: Post-WWII policies promoting suburban single-family ownership as national ideal.

### Racial and Class Anxieties

**Coded Language**:

| Stated Concern | Often Encodes |
|----------------|---------------|
| "Neighborhood character" | Demographic change |
| "School quality" | Class/racial composition |
| "Property values" | Exclusion of "undesirables" |
| "Traffic and parking" | Opposition to density |
| "Infrastructure capacity" | Opposition to growth |

**Research Finding**: Studies show opposition to affordable housing and density correlates with racial attitudes, controlling for other factors.

## Legal and Procedural Barriers

### Constitutional Framework

**Zoning as Police Power**: *Euclid v. Ambler* established zoning as valid exercise of state police power, giving broad deference to local restrictions.

**Challenges to Exclusionary Zoning**:

| Legal Theory | Standard | Success Rate |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| Equal Protection (federal) | Discriminatory intent | Very low |
| Fair Housing Act | Disparate impact | Moderate |
| State fair share | Varies by state | Limited to few states |
| Takings | Economic impact | Rare success |

**Result**: Legal challenges to exclusionary zoning rarely succeed.

### Procedural Requirements

**Barriers Built into Process**:

| Requirement | Ostensible Purpose | Effect |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Environmental review (CEQA) | Environmental protection | Delays housing 2-5 years |
| Public hearings | Community input | Platform for opposition |
| Design review | Aesthetic quality | Discretionary denial |
| Conditional use permits | Case-by-case review | Uncertainty, delay |
| Appeal rights | Due process | Extended opposition |

**Process as Outcome**: Even without explicit denial, process costs and delays prevent housing.

### The "Takings" Asymmetry

**Downzoning**: If government restricts what you can build, rarely compensable taking.

**Upzoning Resistance**: Homeowners claim upzoning changes "character" but have no legal right to neighbors' zoning.

**Result**: Legal framework protects existing restrictions but not housing production.

## Interest Group Dynamics

### Organized Opposition

**Well-Organized Groups**:

| Group | Resources | Activity |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Homeowner associations | Membership, dues, lawyers | Block projects |
| Neighborhood groups | Time, connections, votes | Attend hearings, lobby |
| Historic preservation groups | Legal expertise, prestige | Historic designation |
| Environmental groups | Legal capacity, CEQA litigation | Sue to block projects |
| School districts | Revenue concerns | Oppose family housing |

### Diffuse Support

**Weakly Organized**:

| Group | Challenge |
|-------|-----------|
| Renters | Mobile, less invested, lower turnout |
| Young adults | Not yet homeowners, may leave |
| Low-income families | Working multiple jobs, no time |
| Future residents | Can't participate in current decisions |
| Regional employers | Housing not core business |

### Developer-Community Conflict

**Developers as Advocates**:

- Only organized group consistently advocating for more housing
- Distrusted by communities
- Profit motive delegitimizes advocacy
- Often compromise for individual projects, not systemic change

## Information and Cognitive Factors

### Visibility Bias

**What People Notice**:

| Visible | Invisible |
|---------|-----------|
| Construction disruption | Housing people could afford |
| New traffic | Commuters priced out |
| Changed streetscape | Families doubled up |
| New neighbors | People who left region |

### Loss Aversion

**Psychological Pattern**: Losses loom larger than equivalent gains.

**Application to Zoning**:

| Perceived Loss | Perceived Gain |
|----------------|----------------|
| Neighborhood change | Property rights |
| Parking | Housing for others |
| School crowding | Regional affordability |
| Traffic | Economic access |

### The "They're Going to Ruin It" Narrative

**Pattern**:

1. Area becomes desirable
2. Housing costs rise
3. Proposals to add housing
4. Opponents claim change will "ruin" area
5. Irony: blocking housing makes area more expensive, accelerates displacement

## State-Level Failures

### Why States Haven't Acted Earlier

**Traditional Deference**: States historically delegated zoning to localities with minimal oversight.

**Political Challenge**:

| Factor | Obstacle |
|--------|----------|
| Suburban legislators | Represent homeowner constituents |
| Real estate lobby | Split (builders vs. agents protecting inventory) |
| Local control ideology | Strong in both parties |
| Complexity | Hard to make salient issue |

### The Collective Action Problem

**Regional Housing Markets**: Housing is a regional issue; people live in one city, work in another.

**Local Decisions**: Each locality can restrict housing, forcing burden onto neighbors.

**Race to the Bottom**: Municipalities compete to exclude housing.

**State Response**: Only state-level action can solve collective action problem.

## Federal Policy Failures

### Subsidizing Exclusion

**Federal Policies That Enable Exclusion**:

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Mortgage interest deduction | Subsidizes homeownership, raises prices |
| SALT deduction | Subsidizes high-tax (often exclusionary) jurisdictions |
| Highway funding | Enables sprawl |
| FHA/VA loan requirements | Historically excluded minorities |
| Community Development Block Grants | No housing production requirements |

### Weak Fair Housing Enforcement

**Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing** (AFFH):

- Required since 1968, rarely enforced
- Obama rule issued 2015, suspended by Trump
- Biden restored, but enforcement limited
- HUD lacks capacity and will for aggressive enforcement

**Disparate Impact Standard**: Available under Fair Housing Act but rarely used to challenge zoning.

## Why Reform Is Now Possible

### Changed Conditions

| Factor | Previous Era | Current Era |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Housing costs | High but manageable | Crisis-level |
| Affected population | Low-income, minorities | Broad middle class |
| Information | Limited | Research widely available |
| Political salience | Low | Growing |
| Reform constituency | Weak | YIMBY movement |

### Coalition Potential

**Groups Increasingly Supporting Reform**:

- Tech workers (San Francisco, Seattle)
- Environmentalists (climate/sprawl concerns)
- Social justice advocates (segregation, displacement)
- Business groups (employee housing)
- Some renters and young adults
