# Zoning Reform: Legislation

## Overview

Zoning reform operates primarily at state and local levels. Federal authority over local land use is limited, but Congress can use spending conditions and fair housing enforcement to influence outcomes. State legislation is the most powerful tool for comprehensive reform, preempting local exclusionary practices. This document provides model legislation at each level.

## Federal Legislation

### Housing Supply and Affordability Act

**Purpose**: Condition federal transportation and housing funds on state and local adoption of pro-housing policies.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Housing Supply and Affordability Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) Exclusionary zoning practices restrict housing supply and
drive unaffordability in regions across the United States.
(2) Housing costs burden working families, reduce economic
mobility, and perpetuate racial segregation.
(3) Local land use decisions have regional and national economic
impacts, including reduced labor mobility and productivity.
(4) Federal transportation and housing investments are undermined
when local governments restrict housing near transit and jobs.
(5) States and localities receiving federal funds should adopt
policies that support adequate housing supply.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Covered jurisdiction" means any State or unit of local
government receiving funds under programs specified in section 4.

(b) "Pro-housing policies" means policies that:
(1) Allow multi-family housing in residential zones;
(2) Permit accessory dwelling units by right;
(3) Eliminate or reduce parking minimums near transit;
(4) Provide for ministerial approval of housing meeting
objective standards; and
(5) Accommodate the jurisdiction's fair share of regional
housing need.

SEC. 4. HOUSING SUPPLY CONDITIONS ON FEDERAL FUNDS.

(a) TRANSPORTATION FUNDS.—Beginning 3 years after enactment, the
Secretary of Transportation shall reduce by 10% annually funds
provided under chapters 53 and 54 of title 49, United States Code,
to any covered jurisdiction that has not:
(1) Adopted pro-housing policies as defined in section 3; or
(2) Demonstrated substantial compliance with a state-approved
housing element or plan.

(b) COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS.—Beginning 3 years after
enactment, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall
reduce by 10% annually funds provided under title I of the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1974 to any covered jurisdiction
that has not adopted pro-housing policies.

(c) WAIVERS.—The Secretary may waive the requirements of this
section for jurisdictions demonstrating good faith efforts toward
compliance or facing extraordinary circumstances.

SEC. 5. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

(a) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall establish
a technical assistance program to help states and localities:
(1) Assess housing needs;
(2) Develop pro-housing zoning codes;
(3) Implement streamlined approval processes; and
(4) Monitor housing production outcomes.

(b) There is authorized to be appropriated $50,000,000 annually
for such program.

SEC. 6. REPORTING.

(a) Beginning 2 years after enactment, states receiving funds
under section 4 shall report annually to HUD:
(1) Housing permits issued by housing type;
(2) Zoning changes adopted;
(3) Regional housing needs allocations and progress; and
(4) Barriers to housing production.

(b) HUD shall publish an annual national report summarizing
state and local housing supply conditions.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect upon enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 4 uses funding conditions (Spending Clause authority) to incentivize reform
- Graduated reduction (10% annually) provides transition time
- Waiver provision offers flexibility for good-faith efforts
- Technical assistance helps jurisdictions comply
- Reporting creates accountability and data

**Potential Challenges**:

- Political opposition from suburban legislators
- Local government lobbying
- Implementation complexity
- Federalism concerns

**Refinements**:

- Could add positive incentives (bonus funding) alongside penalties
- Could tie more specifically to transit funding for transit-oriented housing
- Could create competitive grant program for reforming jurisdictions

### Fair Housing Zoning Enforcement Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen disparate impact enforcement against exclusionary zoning.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Fair Housing Zoning Enforcement Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) Exclusionary zoning perpetuates racial and economic
segregation in violation of the Fair Housing Act.
(2) Current enforcement mechanisms are insufficient to address
systemic exclusionary practices.
(3) Disparate impact analysis is essential for addressing
facially neutral policies with discriminatory effects.

SEC. 3. DISPARATE IMPACT STANDARD.

(a) Section 804 of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3604) is
amended by adding at the end the following:

"(g) DISPARATE IMPACT.—
(1) A zoning ordinance, land use regulation, or development
approval practice that has a disparate impact on the basis of
race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin,
or disability violates this section unless the jurisdiction
demonstrates that:
(A) The challenged practice is necessary to achieve a
substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest;
(B) That interest cannot be served by another practice
with less discriminatory effect; and
(C) The practice is not pretextual.

(2) The plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing
disparate impact through statistical or other evidence.

(3) Disparate impact may be shown through evidence including:
(A) Demographic composition compared to surrounding areas;
(B) Housing costs relative to area median income;
(C) Exclusion of housing types that serve protected classes;
(D) Patterns of denial of housing applications;
(E) Historical evidence of exclusionary intent."

SEC. 4. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

(a) Any person may bring a civil action for violations of this
Act in any United States district court.

(b) In any action under this section, the court may award:
(1) Injunctive relief, including requiring adoption of
alternative practices;
(2) Actual damages;
(3) Punitive damages;
(4) Reasonable attorney's fees and costs.

SEC. 5. DOJ ENFORCEMENT.

(a) The Attorney General may bring pattern-or-practice actions
against jurisdictions maintaining exclusionary zoning practices.

(b) The Attorney General shall prioritize investigation of
jurisdictions with:
(1) Persistent demographic imbalance;
(2) Excessive housing costs relative to region;
(3) History of denying multi-family housing; or
(4) Documented exclusionary practices.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect upon enactment and shall apply to
all claims filed after such date.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 3 codifies disparate impact standard specifically for zoning
- Burden-shifting framework balances plaintiff and defendant interests
- Section 4 creates meaningful private enforcement
- Section 5 empowers DOJ pattern-or-practice actions

## Regulatory Framework

### State Housing Agency Implementation Guidance

**Model Guidance for Missing Middle Housing Implementation**:

```text
[STATE HOUSING AGENCY]

GUIDANCE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF MISSING MIDDLE HOUSING ACT

1. PURPOSE

This guidance assists local governments in implementing the
Missing Middle Housing Act (the "Act") and provides
interpretation of key provisions.

2. APPLICABILITY

The Act applies to:
- All residential zones that allow single-family housing
- All cities and counties within [State]
- All development applications submitted after [effective date]

- Imposing project-specific conditions
- Conducting "compatibility" review
- Requiring additional studies or analyses

4. OBJECTIVE STANDARDS

Objective standards must:
- Be verifiable without personal judgment
- Apply uniformly to all projects
- Be published in advance
- Not be used to effectively prohibit development

Examples of objective standards:
- Maximum height in feet
- Minimum setbacks in feet
- Maximum lot coverage percentage

- Superior court (private right of action)
- Attorney General

Remedies for non-compliance:
- Order to approve project
- Injunction against enforcement of conflicting ordinance
- Attorney's fees for prevailing plaintiff
```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**State Authority**:

- States have plenary power over local governments
- Zoning is delegated state police power
- State may condition or withdraw delegation
- Home rule does not limit state authority over housing

**Federal Authority**:

- Spending Clause: Conditions on federal funds
- Commerce Clause: Housing affects interstate commerce
- 14th Amendment: Enforce equal protection
- Fair Housing Act: Congress may strengthen

### Preemption Framework

**State-Local Preemption**:

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Express preemption | "This Act preempts conflicting local ordinances" |
| Implied preemption | State occupies field of housing regulation |
| Conflict preemption | Local ordinance conflicts with state law |
| Floor preemption | State sets minimum; locals may exceed |

**Drafting Considerations**:

- Include express preemption clause
- Address "circumvention" attempts
- Specify relationship to local authority
- Provide enforcement mechanisms

### Fair Housing Compliance

**Obligations**:

- Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination
- Disparate impact standard applies to zoning
- Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing duty
- State may have additional requirements

**Design Considerations**:

- Ensure reforms do not disadvantage protected classes
- Consider displacement mitigation
- Include affordable housing provisions
- Document fair housing benefits

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Subjective design standards | Locals adopt "objective" standards that require subjective judgment | High |
| Excessive fees | Impact fees or permit fees that make development infeasible | High |
| Infrastructure denial | Refuse to provide water, sewer, or utility connections | Moderate |
| Slow-walking | Delay review without formally denying | High |
| Historic designation | Blanket historic designation to prevent development | Moderate |
| Environmental challenges | CEQA/SEPA litigation regardless of merit | High |
| Lot size manipulation | Require large lots that prevent missing middle | Moderate |
| Downzoning | Preemptively downzone before law takes effect | High |
| Covenant enforcement | HOA restrictions block units | Moderate |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Construction costs | Reform enables housing but doesn't reduce costs | Material, labor, land costs |
| Deep affordability | Market housing doesn't serve lowest incomes | Economics of development |
| Displacement | New development in some areas accelerates displacement | Gentrification dynamics |
| Infrastructure limits | Some areas genuinely lack capacity | Underinvestment |
| Local compliance | Many jurisdictions resist or delay | Political economy |
| Limited applicability | Exemptions may exclude significant areas | Political compromise |
| Enforcement capacity | State agencies lack staff to monitor | Budget constraints |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-circumvention provisions**: Explicitly prohibit practices designed to evade reform intent; allow state review of local standards for compliance.

2. **Fee limitations**: Cap permit and impact fees; require fee justification studies; provide exemptions for affordable housing.

3. **Infrastructure funding**: State grants for infrastructure; prohibit infrastructure denial as housing barrier; require infrastructure planning.

4. **Shot clock with teeth**: Automatic approval (deemed approved) if deadline missed; prevent re-starting clock through incomplete determinations.

5. **Historic preservation limits**: Limit historic designation to genuinely significant resources; require consideration of housing impacts; prohibit blanket district designations.

6. **Environmental streamlining**: Categorical exemptions for infill housing; CEQA/SEPA reform for housing; fee-shifting for frivolous environmental litigation.

7. **Anti-downzoning**: Prevent downzoning within specified period before law takes effect; require state approval for downzoning.

8. **HOA preemption**: State law preempts HOA restrictions that conflict with housing reform; require HOAs to permit ADUs and missing middle.

9. **State enforcement**: Dedicated enforcement unit; annual compliance reviews; public non-compliance lists; automatic builder's remedy for non-compliant jurisdictions.

10. **Displacement mitigation**: Require anti-displacement plans in vulnerable communities; fund tenant protections; require affordable housing in high-opportunity areas.

### General Implementation Concerns

**Political Sustainability**: Reforms may be rolled back when political conditions change; build broad coalition support.

**Local Capacity**: Some localities lack planning staff to implement reforms; provide technical assistance and model codes.

**Market Conditions**: Reform enables but does not guarantee housing production; monitor and address non-regulatory barriers.

**Equity Outcomes**: Track whether reform benefits all communities; adjust if disparate impacts emerge.

**Continuous Improvement**: Build in regular review and amendment process; learn from implementation experience.
