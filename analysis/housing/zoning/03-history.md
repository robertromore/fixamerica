# Zoning Reform: History

## Origins of Zoning

### Pre-Zoning Land Use Regulation

**Nuisance Law**: Before zoning, land use conflicts were resolved through common law nuisance doctrine. Property owners could sue neighbors whose uses interfered with their "quiet enjoyment" of property.

**Building Codes**: Cities regulated building height, construction materials, and fire safety through building codes, separate from land use regulation.

**Deed Restrictions**: Private covenants attached to deeds restricted uses, often including explicitly racial restrictions.

**Limitations**: These tools were reactive, case-by-case, and did not allow comprehensive planning.

### The First Zoning Ordinances

**Modesto, California (1885)**: First known ordinance segregating laundries (targeting Chinese operators) from other areas.

**Los Angeles (1908)**: Created separate "industrial districts," effectively the first use-based zoning.

**New York City (1916)**: First comprehensive zoning ordinance.

| Feature | New York 1916 Ordinance |
|---------|------------------------|
| Use districts | Residential, business, unrestricted |
| Height limits | Based on street width |
| Setbacks | Step-back requirements (creating characteristic NYC skyline) |
| Coverage | Entire city mapped |

**Catalyst**: The Equitable Building (1915) blocked light to neighboring buildings, creating demand for height and bulk controls.

## Racial Zoning Era (1910-1917)

### Explicitly Racial Ordinances

**Baltimore (1910)**: First city to adopt explicitly racial zoning, designating blocks as "white" or "colored."

**Spread**: Quickly adopted by other cities, especially in the South and border states.

| City | Year | Type |
|------|------|------|
| Baltimore | 1910 | Racial block designation |
| Richmond | 1911 | Similar to Baltimore |
| Atlanta | 1913 | Racial district mapping |
| Louisville | 1914 | Block-by-block designation |
| Birmingham | 1915 | Racial zoning |
| St. Louis | 1916 | Racial use restrictions |

### Buchanan v. Warley (1917)

**Case**: Louisville ordinance prohibited Black people from occupying homes on majority-white blocks (and vice versa). Black buyer challenged white seller's attempt to void sale.

**Holding**: Supreme Court struck down the ordinance as violation of property rights under Due Process Clause.

**Important**: Decision was based on white property owners' rights to sell, not Black buyers' rights to purchase.

**Impact**: Ended explicitly racial zoning but left door open for "neutral" zoning with racial effect.

## Euclidean Zoning (1926-Present)

### Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty (1926)

**Background**: Euclid, Ohio (Cleveland suburb) adopted comprehensive zoning in 1922. Ambler Realty owned 68 acres zoned for various uses; sued arguing zoning was unconstitutional taking.

**Holding**: Supreme Court upheld zoning as valid exercise of police power.

**Key Reasoning**:

| Principle | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Police power | States can regulate for health, safety, welfare |
| Nuisance analogy | Zoning prevents "nuisance-like" uses |
| Hierarchy of uses | Single-family homes highest, industry lowest |
| Separation | Different uses should be separated |

**Justice Sutherland's Language**: Apartments described as "mere parasite" that would destroy character of single-family neighborhoods.

### The "Euclidean" Model

**Characteristics**:

- Hierarchical use categories
- Cumulative zoning (higher uses allowed in lower zones)
- Mapped districts across entire jurisdiction
- Objective standards (in theory)
- Administrative enforcement

**Standard Categories** (from most to least restrictive):

1. Single-family residential (various densities)
2. Multi-family residential
3. Commercial
4. Industrial

## Racial Zoning by Other Means (1920s-1960s)

### Racially Restrictive Covenants

**Mechanism**: Private deed restrictions prohibiting sale or rental to Black families (and often other minorities).

**Prevalence**: Common in new subdivisions nationwide.

**Example Language**: "No part of said property hereby conveyed shall ever be used or occupied by any Hebrew or by any person of the Ethiopian, Malay or any Asiatic race."

**Federal Support**: FHA and HOLC required restrictive covenants for mortgage insurance.

### Shelley v. Kraemer (1948)

**Holding**: Racially restrictive covenants are not themselves unconstitutional, but judicial enforcement of them violates Equal Protection.

**Impact**: Covenants remained in deeds but became unenforceable.

### Neutral Zoning with Racial Intent

After explicit racial zoning was prohibited, cities used facially neutral tools:

| Tool | Ostensible Purpose | Exclusionary Effect |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Minimum lot sizes | "Prevent overcrowding" | Exclude lower-income (and Black) families |
| Single-family-only | "Preserve character" | Prevent multi-family housing |
| Setback requirements | "Light and air" | Increase costs |
| Prohibition of rentals | "Stability" | Exclude tenants |
| School district boundaries | "Local schools" | Reinforce segregation |

### FHA and Redlining

**Federal Housing Administration (1934)**:

- Insured mortgages to promote homeownership
- Required restrictive covenants until 1948
- Used "Underwriting Manual" with explicitly racist criteria
- Created "residential security maps" rating neighborhoods
- "Hazardous" (red) areas = Black neighborhoods
- Refused insurance in integrated or Black areas

**HOLC Maps**: Home Owners' Loan Corporation created color-coded maps:

| Rating | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| A | Green | Best/desirable |
| B | Blue | Still desirable |
| C | Yellow | Declining |
| D | Red | Hazardous |

**Legacy**: Redlined neighborhoods remain lower-wealth, less healthy, hotter (fewer trees) today.

## Suburban Explosion and Exclusionary Zoning (1945-1970)

### Postwar Suburbanization

**Drivers**:

- GI Bill homeownership subsidies
- FHA/VA mortgage insurance
- Highway construction
- White flight from cities
- Federal tax policies favoring homeownership

**Scale**: Suburban population grew from 36 million (1940) to 74 million (1970).

### The Exclusionary Toolkit Matures

**Large-Lot Zoning**: Many suburbs adopted 1-acre, 2-acre, even 5-acre minimum lot sizes.

**Growth Controls**: Moratoriums, building permit caps, adequate public facilities ordinances.

**Fiscal Zoning**: Zoning to maximize tax base while minimizing service costs (favoring commercial over residential, large homes over small).

| Jurisdiction | Minimum Lot | Effect |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Woodside, CA | 1-5 acres | <6,000 residents in wealthy enclave |
| Atherton, CA | 1 acre | Among wealthiest cities in US |
| Darien, CT | 1-4 acres | Remains 94% white |
| Scarsdale, NY | 0.5-1 acre | Median home >$1 million |

### Mount Laurel Doctrine (New Jersey)

**Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Township of Mount Laurel (1975)** ("Mount Laurel I"):

**Background**: Mount Laurel, NJ zoned 29.2% of land for industry, prohibited multi-family housing, required large lots.

**Holding**: New Jersey Supreme Court held that developing municipalities must provide "fair share" of regional housing need.

**Mount Laurel II (1983)**: Strengthened doctrine, created "builder's remedy" allowing developers to build if municipality failed to meet obligation.

**Impact**: Mixed. Created affordable housing in some communities but also led to workarounds and limited actual integration.

### Arlington Heights v. MHDC (1977)

**Background**: Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation sought to build integrated housing in Arlington Heights, IL. Village refused to rezone from single-family.

**Holding**: Facially neutral zoning does not violate Equal Protection unless discriminatory intent is proven, even if it has disparate impact.

**Impact**: Made civil rights challenges to exclusionary zoning extremely difficult.

## Modern Era (1970s-Present)

### Growth Management Era

**California Coastal Act (1972)**: Created Coastal Commission with permitting authority; became major barrier to housing.

**CEQA (1970)**: California Environmental Quality Act created environmental review requirement; increasingly used to block housing.

**Growth Limits**: Petaluma (1972) adopted first residential growth cap, upheld by courts.

### Environmental Review as Housing Barrier

**NEPA (1970)**: National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for federal actions.

**State "Little NEPAs"**: California, New York, and others adopted similar requirements.

| State | Law | Effect |
|-------|-----|--------|
| California | CEQA | Major barrier; projects tied up 2-5+ years |
| New York | SEQRA | Significant delays |
| Washington | SEPA | Moderate impact |
| Massachusetts | MEPA | Limited impact |

### Historic Preservation as Exclusion

**National Historic Preservation Act (1966)**: Created National Register and Section 106 review.

**Local Landmarks**: Cities increasingly designated historic districts and landmarks.

**Weaponization**: Historic designation used to prevent any changes to neighborhoods, blocking housing.

| City | Historic District Challenge |
|------|---------------------------|
| Washington, DC | Large portions designated, blocking development |
| San Francisco | Victorians protected even when rotting |
| New Orleans | Historic designation prevents density |
| Charleston, SC | Large district limits housing |

### YIMBY Movement Emergence (2014-Present)

**Origins**: San Francisco BARF (Bay Area Renters Federation) founded 2014.

**Growth**: YIMBY ("Yes In My Back Yard") groups formed nationwide.

**Key Milestones**:

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2014 | SFBARF founded |
| 2017 | California YIMBY formed |
| 2018 | Minneapolis 2040 process begins |
| 2019 | Oregon passes HB 2001 |
| 2020 | Minneapolis eliminates SF-only zoning |
| 2021 | California passes SB 9 |
| 2023 | Montana passes major reforms |

### State Preemption Wave

**Trigger**: Local governments consistently blocked housing, creating statewide crises.

**Response**: States began preempting local zoning authority.

| State | Year | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| California | 2016+ | Multiple ADU, SB 35, SB 9 reforms |
| Oregon | 2019 | HB 2001 statewide upzoning |
| Montana | 2023 | SB 382 statewide reform |
| Washington | 2023 | HB 1110 middle housing |
| Minnesota | 2023 | SF-only elimination in metro |
