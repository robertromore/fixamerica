# Zoning Reform: Stakeholders

## Who Benefits from the Status Quo

### Incumbent Homeowners

**Primary Beneficiaries**: Existing homeowners in desirable, supply-constrained areas.

**Benefits**:

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Asset appreciation | Supply constraints raise prices |
| Neighborhood stability | Zoning prevents change |
| School quality | Exclusion maintains socioeconomic composition |
| Tax base protection | High-value homes, low service demand |
| Political control | Dominate local government |

**Demographics**: Disproportionately older, whiter, wealthier than overall population.

**Wealth Accumulation**: Homeowners in restricted markets have seen extraordinary wealth gains:

| Market | Median Home Value (1990) | Median Home Value (2024) | Gain |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------|
| San Francisco | $290,000 | $1,200,000 | 314% |
| Los Angeles | $225,000 | $950,000 | 322% |
| Seattle | $145,000 | $800,000 | 452% |
| National | $100,000 | $417,000 | 317% |

### Real Estate Agents and Brokers

**Interest**: Higher prices = higher commissions (typically 5-6% of sale price).

**Position**: Often oppose new supply that might moderate prices.

**Influence**: National Association of Realtors is one of largest lobbying organizations.

### Local Government Officials

**Benefits of Restriction**:

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Voter satisfaction | Homeowners vote; they want exclusion |
| Fiscal stability | High-end homes provide good tax base |
| Simplicity | Blocking change easier than managing it |
| Campaign support | Homeowner groups support restrictive candidates |

### Neighborhood Associations

**Role**: Organized advocacy for existing residents' interests.

**Activities**:

- Attend planning meetings
- Oppose development applications
- Lobby city council
- Litigate when necessary

**Power**: Outsized influence due to organization and consistency of engagement.

### Historic Preservation Groups

**Interest**: Preserve historic structures and neighborhood character.

**Legitimate Role**: Protecting genuinely historic buildings.

**Problematic Extension**: Using preservation to block all change, including contextually appropriate infill.

**Examples**:

- San Francisco: Laundromats designated to block housing
- Georgetown (DC): Entire neighborhood restricted
- Santa Monica: Historic designation prevents affordable housing

### Environmental Groups (Some)

**CEQA Litigation**: Some environmental organizations (and unions using environmental law) sue to block housing projects.

**Rationale**: Environmental review requirements; some genuine concerns about impacts.

**Effect**: Housing blocked or delayed regardless of actual environmental merit.

**Note**: Many environmental groups now support housing density for climate reasons.

## Who Is Harmed

### Renters

**Population**: ~44 million renting households; ~35% of households.

**Harms**:

| Harm | Data |
|------|------|
| Rent burden | 50% of renters pay >30% income on rent |
| Severe burden | 26% pay >50% income on rent |
| Displacement | Rising rents force moves from communities |
| Instability | Less secure tenure than owners |
| Wealth gap | Cannot build equity through homeownership |

**Demographics**: Disproportionately younger, lower-income, Black and Hispanic.

### Aspiring Homeowners

**Blocked Entry**: High prices prevent homeownership for millions.

**Statistics**:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Median income needed for median home | $107,000 (national) |
| Homeownership rate decline (under 35) | 43% (2004) to 38% (2024) |
| Down payment years (median market) | 8-15 years of savings |
| First-time buyer share | Lowest in decades |

**Generational Impact**: Millennials and Gen Z face far harder path to ownership than previous generations.

### Low-Income Families

**Exclusion from Opportunity**:

| Resource | Exclusion Mechanism |
|----------|---------------------|
| Good schools | Priced out of district |
| Safe neighborhoods | Cannot afford entry |
| Job access | Housing near employment unaffordable |
| Wealth building | Blocked from ownership |

**Segregation**: Low-income families concentrated in high-poverty areas with fewer resources.

### Workers and Employers

**Worker Impacts**:

- Long commutes (1-2+ hours each way)
- Multiple jobs to afford housing
- Inability to take better jobs due to housing costs
- Health impacts of commuting and crowding

**Employer Impacts**:

- Difficulty recruiting workers
- Higher wages needed to compensate for housing costs
- Productivity losses from employee stress
- Relocation to lower-cost areas

### Regional Economies

**Aggregate Costs**:

| Cost | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| $1.6 trillion/year GDP loss | Workers unable to access high-productivity jobs (Hsieh & Moretti) |
| Reduced innovation | Less agglomeration and knowledge spillovers |
| Climate costs | Sprawl increases emissions |
| Infrastructure costs | Low-density development costly to serve |

### Black and Hispanic Families

**Disproportionate Harm**:

| Outcome | Disparity |
|---------|-----------|
| Homeownership gap | White 74%, Black 44%, Hispanic 48% |
| Wealth gap | Median white wealth $188K, Black $24K |
| Segregation | Persistent exclusion from opportunity areas |
| School quality | Concentrated in under-resourced districts |

**Historical Link**: Current exclusionary zoning perpetuates segregation that began with explicitly racial policies.

## Who Has Power to Change Things

### State Legislators

**Authority**: States grant zoning power to localities; can preempt or condition it.

**Recent Action**: California, Oregon, Montana, Washington legislators have passed major reforms.

**Constraints**:

- Suburban legislators represent homeowners
- Local control ideology strong
- Developer support can delegitimize

### Governors

**Role**: Sign or veto reform legislation; set agenda.

**Examples**:

| Governor | State | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Gavin Newsom | California | Signed multiple reform bills |
| Kate Brown | Oregon | Signed HB 2001 |
| Greg Gianforte | Montana | Signed 2023 reform package |

### City Councils and Planning Commissions

**Local Authority**: Make zoning decisions in most jurisdictions.

**Constraints**: Subject to intense homeowner pressure; electoral accountability to restrictive constituencies.

**Exceptions**: Some reform-minded councils (Minneapolis, Portland) have made significant changes.

### Federal Government

**Tools** (mostly unused):

| Tool | Potential |
|------|-----------|
| CDBG funding conditions | Require housing production |
| AFFH enforcement | Challenge exclusionary zoning |
| Transportation funding | Condition on transit-oriented housing |
| Tax policy | Reduce homeownership subsidies |

**Current Status**: Limited action; Biden administration has proposed but not enacted major reforms.

### Courts

**Role**: Interpret zoning authority, fair housing requirements.

**Constraints**: *Arlington Heights* intent standard makes challenges difficult; judicial deference to local zoning.

**Potential**: State courts can interpret state law more favorably (Mount Laurel doctrine in NJ).

## Potential Allies

### YIMBY Movement

**Organizations**:

| Group | Base | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| California YIMBY | California | State legislation |
| Open New York | New York | NYC and state reform |
| YIMBY Action | National | Coordination, messaging |
| Abundant Housing LA | Los Angeles | Local advocacy |
| Seattle For Everyone | Seattle | Local and state |

**Strengths**: Growing membership, policy expertise, tech funding, media savvy.

**Weaknesses**: Still building power; perceived as representing tech workers.

### Tech Companies

**Interest**: Employee recruitment and retention in high-cost metros.

**Action**: Some companies fund YIMBY groups, advocate for housing reform.

**Examples**: Google committed $1B for housing in Bay Area; Microsoft similar in Seattle.

**Limitations**: Corporate advocacy can delegitimize cause; housing not core business.

### Labor Unions

**Construction Unions**: Support housing that provides jobs; may oppose non-union projects.

**Service Unions**: SEIU and others represent workers priced out of cities; increasingly supportive.

**Tension**: Building trades sometimes use environmental law to block non-union housing.

### Environmental Organizations

**Climate Argument**: Dense infill housing reduces driving, energy use, land consumption.

**Supportive Groups**:

- Sierra Club (some chapters)
- Natural Resources Defense Council
- Climate advocacy organizations

**Obstacles**: Some local environmental groups still oppose density.

### Civil Rights Organizations

**Interest**: Housing segregation perpetuates inequality.

**Actors**:

| Organization | Position |
|--------------|----------|
| NAACP | Supports fair housing, mixed on density |
| National Urban League | Supports affordable housing |
| Local fair housing groups | Varied; some support reform |
| California Civil Rights Coalition | Supports zoning reform |

### Business Groups

**Interest**: Worker housing, commercial activity, regional economic growth.

**Actors**:

- Local chambers of commerce (varied)
- State business roundtables
- Individual employer advocacy

**Limitations**: May prioritize other issues; divided on housing.

### Faith Communities

**Interest**: Housing for congregants and community; social justice mission.

**Action**: Some churches building housing on their land; advocating for reform.

**Example**: California's SB 4 allows religious institutions to build housing.

### Academic Researchers

**Role**: Provide evidence base for reform; legitimize policy arguments.

**Key Researchers**:

- Edward Glaeser (Harvard)
- Joseph Gyourko (Wharton)
- Enrico Moretti (Berkeley)
- Paavo Monkkonen (UCLA)
- Shane Phillips (UCLA)

## Key Relationships

### Homeowner-Renter Tension

**Dynamic**: Zero-sum in short term (homeowner gains = renter losses); potentially positive-sum with more supply.

**Challenge**: Converting homeowners to support reform.

### Developer-Community Conflict

**Pattern**: Developers propose projects; neighbors oppose; conflict dominates.

**Problem**: Framing as "greedy developers vs. community" delegitimizes housing production.

**Potential**: Community benefit agreements; affordable housing requirements; design standards.

### State-Local Tension

**Traditional**: States defer to local zoning authority.

**Current**: States increasingly preempting local exclusion.

**Response**: Local governments claim "local control"; some comply, others resist.

### YIMBY-Affordable Housing Tension

**Debate**: Market-rate housing vs. subsidized affordable housing.

**YIMBY Position**: More supply of all types helps affordability; inclusionary requirements limit production.

**Affordable Housing Position**: Market-rate development accelerates displacement; need deep affordability.

**Synthesis**: Both are needed; not mutually exclusive.

### Environmental-Housing Tension

**Old Framing**: Density = environmental harm.

**New Framing**: Sprawl = climate disaster; infill = climate solution.

**Remaining Conflict**: CEQA litigation; some local groups oppose density.
