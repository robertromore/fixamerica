# Housing: Solutions

## Overview

Solving America's housing crisis requires a comprehensive approach addressing supply constraints, affordability gaps, discrimination, and homelessness. Solutions range from zoning reform to increase production, to tenant protections and rental assistance for stability, to fair housing enforcement for integration. This analysis presents the full spectrum of approaches with their evidence base, trade-offs, and political feasibility.

## Guiding Principles

### What Reform Should Achieve

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Adequate supply** | Enough homes for everyone who needs one |

| **Integration** | Desegregated, opportunity-rich neighborhoods |

### Evaluating Proposals

| Criterion | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Effectiveness** | Does evidence show this works? |
| **Scale** | How many people would benefit? |
| **Speed** | How quickly does it produce results? |
| **Equity** | Who benefits and who bears costs? |

## Supply-Side Solutions

### Zoning Reform

| Reform | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Legalize duplexes/ADUs** | Allow 2-4 units on all residential lots |

## Alternative Approaches

### Market Urbanist (YIMBY)

| Philosophy | Policies |
|------------|----------|
| **Supply focus** | Build more housing of all types |
| **Deregulation** | Remove zoning barriers |
| **Market mechanism** | Prices signal need |
| **Less government** | Reduce regulations, not expand programs |

**Assessment**: Effective for total supply; may not address affordability at lowest incomes without subsidy.

### Social Housing

| Philosophy | Policies |
|------------|----------|
| **Decommodification** | Remove housing from market |
| **Public ownership** | Government as landlord |
| **Universal provision** | Housing as right |
| **Mixed-income** | Avoid concentrated poverty |

**Assessment**: Proven effective internationally (Vienna, Singapore); politically challenging in U.S.

### Community Development

| Philosophy | Policies |
|------------|----------|
| **Local control** | Community-based organizations lead |
| **Asset building** | Homeownership pathways |
| **Place-based** | Invest in disinvested areas |
| **Nonprofit developers** | Mission-driven production |

**Assessment**: Builds community capacity; limited scale without major funding increase.

### Tenant Power

| Philosophy | Policies |
|------------|----------|
| **Tenant organizing** | Build renter political power |
| **Rent control** | Limit landlord extraction |
| **Tenant ownership** | Convert rentals to co-ops |
| **Anti-displacement** | Keep existing residents in place |

**Assessment**: Essential for stability; supply advocates argue may reduce construction.
