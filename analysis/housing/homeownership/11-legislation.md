# Homeownership: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Expanding homeownership access requires legislation at multiple levels addressing down payment barriers, credit access, appraisal bias, and the racial wealth gap. This document provides draft legislative text, implementation analysis, and identification of potential loopholes.

## Constitutional Considerations

### Federal Authority

Congress has broad authority to legislate on homeownership through:

| Constitutional Basis | Application |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Commerce Clause | Housing markets are interstate commerce |
| Spending Clause | Conditions on federal housing funds |
| 13th Amendment | Address badges of slavery including housing discrimination |
| 14th Amendment | Equal protection applies to government housing programs |

### State Authority

States have primary authority over:

- Real estate licensing and practice
- Appraisal regulation
- Property law
- Land use (delegated to localities)
- State housing finance agencies

## Federal Legislation

### First-Generation Homebuyer Act

**Purpose**: Provide targeted assistance to first-generation homebuyers who cannot receive family wealth transfers for down payments.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "First-Generation Homebuyer Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Twenty-eight percent of first-time homebuyers receive
    financial assistance from family members, averaging $58,000.
(2) First-generation homebuyers, whose parents did not own
    homes during their childhood, cannot receive such assistance.
(3) This creates a significant barrier to homeownership that
    perpetuates across generations.
(4) The racial homeownership gap has not narrowed since 1968
    despite fair housing laws.
(5) Targeted assistance to first-generation homebuyers can
    help address this persistent gap.

SEC. 3. FIRST-GENERATION HOMEBUYER TAX CREDIT.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of
    chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended
    by adding after section 36B the following new section:

"SEC. 36C. FIRST-GENERATION HOMEBUYER CREDIT.

"(a) ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT.—In the case of an individual who
    is a first-generation homebuyer, there shall be allowed as
    a credit against the tax imposed by this subtitle an amount
    equal to so much of the purchase price of a principal
    residence as does not exceed $25,000.

"(b) FIRST-GENERATION HOMEBUYER.—For purposes of this
    section—
    "(1) IN GENERAL.—The term 'first-generation homebuyer'
        means an individual who—
        "(A) has never owned a home, or has not owned a home
            within the preceding 3-year period;
        "(B) whose parents or legal guardians did not own
            a home at any time during the individual's
            childhood; and
        "(C) whose spouse, if any, meets the requirements
            of subparagraphs (A) and (B).
    "(2) CHILDHOOD.—For purposes of paragraph (1)(B),
        'childhood' means the period from birth through age 18.
    "(3) EXCEPTIONS.—An individual shall not fail to be
        treated as a first-generation homebuyer by reason of—
        "(A) ownership of a manufactured home that was not
            permanently affixed to real property;
        "(B) ownership of a partial interest in a home that
            was never the individual's principal residence; or
        "(C) parental ownership that lasted less than 3 years.

"(c) INCOME LIMITATION.—
    "(1) IN GENERAL.—The amount of the credit allowable
        under subsection (a) shall be reduced (but not below
        zero) by the amount which bears the same ratio to the
        credit as—
        "(A) the amount (if any) by which the taxpayer's
            adjusted gross income exceeds 150 percent of the
            area median income for the area in which the home
            is located, bears to
        "(B) 50 percent of such area median income.
    "(2) AREA MEDIAN INCOME.—For purposes of this section,
        the term 'area median income' means the median family
        income for the metropolitan statistical area or
        nonmetropolitan county, as determined by HUD.

"(d) REFUNDABILITY.—The credit under this section shall be
    allowed as a refundable credit.

"(e) TIMING.—
    "(1) CREDIT BEFORE CLOSING.—The Secretary shall
        establish procedures for taxpayers to receive the
        credit in advance of closing, in the form of—
        "(A) a direct payment to an escrow account; or
        "(B) a certificate that may be used by the lender
            to offset the down payment requirement.
    "(2) RECAPTURE.—If the taxpayer sells or transfers the
        home within 5 years of purchase (other than by reason
        of death), the credit shall be recaptured on a pro-rata
        basis.

"(f) DOCUMENTATION.—The Secretary shall prescribe regulations
    requiring documentation of first-generation status,
    including self-certification with penalties for perjury."
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section (a)**: Provides up to $25,000 refundable credit
- **Section (b)**: Defines first-generation as parents did not own during childhood
- **Section (c)**: Phases out at 150% AMI to target assistance
- **Section (d)**: Refundable ensures benefit regardless of tax liability
- **Section (e)**: Pre-closing access ensures usability for down payment
- **Section (f)**: Documentation requirements balance access and fraud prevention

**Challenges and Responses**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Documentation of parental status | Self-certification with penalties; parental death records for orphans |
| Cost | $5 billion annually; offset with MID reform |
| Fraud potential | IRS verification, recapture provisions |
| Administration | Use existing FHA infrastructure |

| Federal Action | Constitutional Basis |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Down payment assistance | Spending Clause |
| FHA loan standards | Regulate interstate mortgage market |
| Appraisal standards | Federally-related transactions |
| Credit scoring reform | Consumer financial protection |

**Equal Protection**

| Policy | Analysis |
|--------|----------|
| First-generation targeting | Facially neutral; not race-based |
| Area targeting | Based on geography, not race |
| SPCP safe harbor | ECOA explicitly authorizes |
| Diversity programs | Must be narrowly tailored |

### Preemption Issues

**Federal-State**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Appraisal standards | Federal floor, states can exceed |
| Credit reporting | FCRA preempts some state law |
| Fair lending | Federal law sets minimum |

**State-Local**

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Zoning authority | State can preempt |
| Down payment assistance | States can condition local funds |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

| Funding uncertainty | Annual appropriations may not meet demand | Budget process |
| HFA capacity | State agencies may lack staff | Administrative limits |
| Market distortion | May inflate prices in targeted areas | Supply constraints |
| Counseling bottleneck | Counselor shortage limits throughput | Program requirement |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **One-time use**: Lifetime limitation with national database
2. **Occupancy monitoring**: Require annual certification for 5 years; random audits
3. **Straw buyer penalties**: Criminal penalties and clawback provisions
4. **Dedicated funding**: Create housing trust fund rather than annual appropriations
5. **Capacity building**: Set aside 5% for HFA and counselor capacity

### Fair Appraisal Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Training box-checking | Minimal engagement with bias training | Medium |
| Comparable selection | Discretion still allows biased selection | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Existing appraiser bias | Training may not change behavior | Cultural change slow |
| Pipeline time | Diversifying profession takes years | Long training pipeline |
| AVM resistance | Profession will resist technology | Economic interest |
| State board resistance | Existing boards may resist federal oversight | Federalism |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Training quality standards**: Require interactive training with testing; certify providers

| Lender adoption | Voluntary adoption may be slow | Risk aversion |
| Model validation | Alternative models less tested | Limited data |
| Disparate impact risk | New models may create new disparities | Unintended consequences |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Mandate rent reporting**: Require landlords with federal assistance to report
2. **Phase in requirements**: Start with FHA, expand to conventional
3. **Model validation**: Require demographic testing before approval
4. **Regular review**: Annual analysis of outcomes by race/ethnicity
