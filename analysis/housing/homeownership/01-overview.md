# Homeownership: Overview

## Executive Summary

Homeownership remains the primary wealth-building mechanism for American families, yet access has become increasingly unequal. The national homeownership rate of 65.6% masks a devastating racial gap: 74% of white households own their homes compared to just 45% of Black households and 48% of Hispanic households. This 30-percentage-point gap between white and Black homeownership has barely narrowed since the Fair Housing Act passed in 1968. First-time buyers now face median home prices exceeding 7 times median income, down payments averaging $68,000, and mortgage rates that have doubled since 2021. Student debt delays homeownership by an average of 7 years. Without significant policy intervention, homeownership will increasingly become a privilege passed down through family wealth rather than an opportunity earned through work.

## The Core Problem

| Metric | Historical Context | Current Reality |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Homeownership rate | 69% peak (2004) | 65.6% (2024) |
| White homeownership | 74% | 74.5% |
| Black homeownership | 47% (1970) | 45.3% |
| Hispanic homeownership | 42% (1990) | 48.6% |
| First-time buyer age | 29 (1980s) | 36 (2024) |
| Median down payment | $12,000 (2000) | $68,000 (2024) |
| Price-to-income ratio | 3.5x (1980s) | 7.5x nationally |

## Why It Matters

**For Individuals and Families**

- Homeownership is the primary vehicle for middle-class wealth accumulation
- Homeowners have 40x the median net worth of renters ($396,200 vs. $10,400)
- Stable housing improves children's educational outcomes
- Home equity provides retirement security and emergency funds
- Homeownership enables generational wealth transfer

**For Racial Equity**

- The racial wealth gap is primarily a homeownership gap
- Black families were systematically excluded from post-WWII homeownership boom
- Discriminatory practices continue through algorithmic lending and appraisal bias
- Without intervention, the gap will persist for generations
- Home equity represents 67% of Black household wealth vs. 43% for white households

**For the Economy**

- Homeownership creates community stability and investment
- Homeowners spend more on home improvement, benefiting local economies
- Property taxes fund local schools and services
- Housing construction drives economic activity
- Declining homeownership concentrates wealth and reduces consumer spending

**For Society**

- Homeowners vote at higher rates and participate more in communities
- Stable neighborhoods reduce crime and improve social cohesion
- Declining homeownership for younger generations creates political instability
- Growing renter population faces insecurity and displacement
- Generational divide between owners and renters deepens social stratification

## Key Questions

1. Why has the racial homeownership gap persisted for over 50 years?
2. How do down payment barriers exclude first-generation buyers?
3. What role does student debt play in delaying homeownership?
4. How effective are current government programs at promoting homeownership?
5. Can shared equity models democratize homeownership?
6. How do we balance homeownership promotion with preventing another housing bubble?

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| First-time homebuyer | Person who has not owned a home in the past 3 years |
| First-generation homebuyer | Person whose parents did not own a home during their childhood |
| Down payment | Upfront cash required to purchase a home (typically 3-20%) |
| Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) | Insurance required when down payment is less than 20% |
| Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio | Mortgage amount divided by home value |
| Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio | Monthly debt payments divided by gross monthly income |
| FHA loan | Government-insured mortgage with lower down payment requirements |
| VA loan | Zero-down-payment mortgage for veterans |
| Closing costs | Fees required to finalize home purchase (2-5% of price) |
| Home equity | Home value minus outstanding mortgage balance |
| Underwater mortgage | When mortgage balance exceeds home value |
| Housing affordability index | Measures whether median income can afford median home |

## The Scale of the Crisis

**Homeownership Rate by Age Cohort**

| Age Group | 1990 | 2000 | 2010 | 2024 |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|
| Under 35 | 37.8% | 40.8% | 36.9% | 37.3% |
| 35-44 | 64.0% | 67.9% | 62.0% | 61.3% |
| 45-54 | 73.9% | 76.5% | 72.5% | 70.1% |
| 55-64 | 78.8% | 80.4% | 78.3% | 75.5% |
| 65+ | 76.3% | 80.4% | 81.1% | 79.2% |

**Racial Homeownership Gap Over Time**

| Year | White | Black | Gap |
|------|-------|-------|-----|
| 1960 | 65% | 38% | 27 pts |
| 1970 | 68% | 42% | 26 pts |
| 1980 | 68% | 44% | 24 pts |
| 1990 | 68% | 43% | 25 pts |
| 2000 | 73% | 47% | 26 pts |
| 2010 | 74% | 44% | 30 pts |
| 2024 | 74.5% | 45.3% | 29 pts |

**Down Payment Barriers**

| Down Payment % | Amount on $400K Home | Years to Save (Median Income) |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| 3% (FHA minimum) | $12,000 | 1.5 years |
| 5% (conventional) | $20,000 | 2.5 years |
| 10% | $40,000 | 5 years |
| 20% (no PMI) | $80,000 | 10 years |

## What's at Stake

**Current Reality**

- Millennial homeownership rate 8 percentage points below Baby Boomers at same age
- Black homeownership lower today than in 2000
- 43% of home purchases made without mortgage (cash buyers, investors)
- First-time buyers represent only 26% of purchases (historically 40%)
- Median student debt holder has 7-year delay in homebuying

**Without Reform**

- Homeownership becomes inheritance-dependent for most Americans
- Racial wealth gap widens as housing appreciation concentrates
- Young people locked into permanent renting
- Political backlash as "ownership society" becomes ownership oligarchy
- Retirement insecurity as renters lack home equity

## The Path Forward

Addressing homeownership barriers requires:

1. **Reducing down payment barriers** - Expanding down payment assistance, shared equity models
2. **Addressing the credit gap** - Reforming credit scoring, alternative data, special purpose credit programs
3. **Tackling appraisal bias** - Eliminating discrimination in home valuations
4. **Student debt solutions** - Income-driven repayment, targeted forgiveness
5. **Protecting existing owners** - Foreclosure prevention, maintenance assistance
6. **Building intergenerational wealth** - Baby bonds, trust funds for first-generation buyers
7. **Expanding successful programs** - FHA, VA, USDA mortgage programs

Success requires both expanding access and ensuring new homeowners can sustain ownership long-term.
