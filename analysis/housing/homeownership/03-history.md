# Homeownership: History

## Origins

### Pre-New Deal Housing

Before the 1930s, homeownership was difficult for most Americans:

**Early Mortgage Structure**

| Feature | Pre-1930s | Post-FHA (1934+) |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Down payment | 50%+ | 10-20% |
| Loan term | 3-5 years | 15-30 years |
| Amortization | None (balloon payment) | Fully amortizing |
| Interest rate | Variable, 6-8% | Fixed, 5-6% |
| Homeownership rate | 45% (1920) | 64% (1960) |

**Pre-Depression Reality**

- Mortgages required large down payments and short terms
- Balloon payments led to frequent defaults
- Only the wealthy or those with family wealth could own
- No standardized lending practices
- No government support for homeownership

### The New Deal Revolution

**Creation of Modern Mortgage System**

| Year | Institution | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 1932 | Federal Home Loan Bank | Provide liquidity to savings institutions |
| 1933 | Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) | Refinance distressed mortgages |
| 1934 | Federal Housing Administration (FHA) | Insure mortgages, set standards |
| 1938 | Fannie Mae | Create secondary mortgage market |

The FHA transformed housing finance by:

- Introducing 20-year fixed-rate amortizing mortgages
- Insuring lenders against default
- Standardizing construction and underwriting
- Lowering down payment requirements to 20%
- Later reducing to 10%, then 3.5%

## Key Turning Points

### Redlining and the HOLC Maps (1935-1940)

**The Creation of Discriminatory Maps**

The HOLC created "residential security maps" for 239 cities, rating neighborhoods A through D:

| Grade | Color | Description | Lending Eligibility |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| A | Green | "Best" - new, homogeneous | Fully eligible |
| B | Blue | "Still Desirable" - stable | Generally eligible |
| C | Yellow | "Definitely Declining" | Restricted |
| D | Red | "Hazardous" | Ineligible |

**Criteria for "Hazardous" Rating**

- Presence of Black residents (regardless of income)
- Presence of Jewish, Italian, or immigrant residents
- Older housing stock
- Industrial proximity
- Mixed land use

**Documented Impact**

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| 98% of FHA loans (1934-1962) went to white families | U.S. Commission on Civil Rights |
| Black neighborhoods received 2% of FHA-insured mortgages | National Archives |
| Redlined areas show 30% lower homeownership today | Federal Reserve (2021) |
| Redlined areas have $166,000 lower median home values | NCRC (2018) |

### GI Bill Exclusion (1944-1956)

**The Promise and the Betrayal**

The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (GI Bill) provided:

- Zero-down-payment home loans
- Below-market interest rates
- Long-term mortgages
- Access to education benefits

**Implementation Discrimination**

| Metric | White Veterans | Black Veterans |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Home loans received (1947-1950) | 67% of applicants | 2% of applicants |
| Suburbs built with VA/FHA loans | 98% white | 2% integrated |
| Average loan value | $7,500 | $3,200 |

**Mechanisms of Exclusion**

1. **Local VA offices** - Southern administrators refused Black applications
2. **Realtor discrimination** - Refused to show homes to Black buyers
3. **Restrictive covenants** - Deeds prohibited sale to minorities
4. **FHA underwriting** - Required racial homogeneity
5. **Bank discrimination** - Refused to lend in Black neighborhoods
6. **Builder exclusion** - Levittown and others barred Black buyers

**The Levittown Model**

| Community | Homes Built | Black Families (1960) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Levittown, NY | 17,447 | 0 |
| Levittown, PA | 17,311 | 1 |
| Levittown, NJ | 12,000 | 0 |

William Levitt: "We can solve a housing problem, or we can try to solve a racial problem, but we cannot combine the two."

### Fair Housing Act (1968)

**What It Prohibited**

- Discrimination in sale or rental of housing
- Discriminatory advertising
- Denial of mortgage financing
- Restrictive covenants (unenforceable)
- Steering and blockbusting

**Implementation Weakness**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Enforcement | HUD had no enforcement power until 1988 |
| Penalties | Minimal damages for violations |
| Burden of proof | On victims to prove intent |
| Testing | Limited government testing programs |
| Redlining | Not explicitly addressed until 1977 (CRA) |

### Community Reinvestment Act (1977)

**Purpose**: Address continued redlining by requiring banks to serve all communities where they take deposits.

**Key Provisions**

- Banks examined on lending in low-income communities
- "Satisfactory" rating required for mergers, expansions
- Public comment process for community input

**Limitations**

| Limitation | Consequence |
|------------|-------------|
| No lending targets | Banks met minimal thresholds |
| Rating inflation | 97% receive "Satisfactory" or better |
| Non-bank exemption | Mortgage companies not covered |
| No individual enforcement | Communities cannot sue |

### Subprime Lending Expansion (1990s-2000s)

**The Rise of Predatory Lending**

| Year | Subprime Share of Mortgages | Total Subprime Volume |
|------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| 1994 | 5% | $35 billion |
| 2000 | 13% | $160 billion |
| 2005 | 20% | $625 billion |
| 2006 | 23% | $600 billion |

**Predatory Practices**

- Adjustable rates with "teaser" periods
- Negative amortization loans
- No-documentation ("liar") loans
- Prepayment penalties trapping borrowers
- Loan flipping and excessive fees
- Yield spread premiums incentivizing bad loans

**Targeting of Minority Communities**

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Black borrowers 2.4x more likely to receive subprime loan | Center for Responsible Lending |
| Hispanic borrowers 1.9x more likely to receive subprime | HUD |
| High-income Black borrowers more likely to receive subprime than low-income whites | Federal Reserve |
| Wells Fargo called subprime loans "ghetto loans" | DOJ lawsuit testimony |

### The 2008 Foreclosure Crisis

**Disproportionate Impact**

| Group | Peak-to-Trough Home Value Loss | Foreclosure Rate (2007-2015) |
|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| White households | -22% | 4.5% |
| Black households | -31% | 7.9% |
| Hispanic households | -40% | 11.4% |

**Wealth Destruction**

| Impact | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Total home equity lost | $7 trillion |
| Black household wealth lost | 53% of total |
| Hispanic household wealth lost | 66% of total |
| White household wealth lost | 16% of total |
| Black homeownership rate drop | 49% to 44% |

**The "Recovery" Disparity**

| Metric (2007-2020) | White | Black | Hispanic |
|--------------------|-------|-------|----------|
| Homeownership recovery | Full | None | Partial |
| Home value recovery | +35% | +12% | +18% |
| Foreclosure-to-purchase ratio | 1:4 | 1:1.5 | 1:2 |

## Lessons from the Past

### What History Teaches Us

**1. Government Policy Created the Racial Homeownership Gap**

- The gap is not the result of market forces or individual choices
- Federal programs explicitly excluded minorities for decades
- The wealth from that exclusion compounded across generations

**2. Formal Equality Is Insufficient**

- Fair Housing Act passed in 1968
- The gap has not narrowed in 56 years
- Neutral policies perpetuate historical disadvantage

**3. Homeownership Expansion Can Be Done Well or Poorly**

- Post-WWII expansion: massive, but discriminatory
- Subprime expansion: inclusive in access, predatory in terms
- Both created long-term harm for excluded/exploited groups

**4. Predatory "Inclusion" Is Worse Than Exclusion**

- Subprime lending appeared to close the gap
- Actually stripped wealth through foreclosure
- Must distinguish access from exploitation

**5. Private Discrimination Continued After Laws Changed**

- Restrictive covenants remained in deeds
- Realtors continued steering
- Appraisers continued undervaluing minority homes
- Banks continued disinvestment

### The Cumulative Cost of Exclusion

**Estimated Wealth Lost to Discrimination**

| Era | Mechanism | Estimated Wealth Transfer |
|-----|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1934-1968 | FHA/VA exclusion | $212 billion (2024 dollars) |
| 1968-2008 | Continued discrimination | $350 billion |
| 2008-2015 | Foreclosure crisis | $200 billion from Black families |
| Appraisal bias | Ongoing undervaluation | $156 billion |
| **Total** | | **$900+ billion** |

This represents wealth that would have been built and transferred across generations.
