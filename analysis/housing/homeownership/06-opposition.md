## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### "Expanding Access Will Cause Another 2008"

**The Argument**

- 2008 crisis caused by irresponsible lending
- Loosening standards invites repeat
- Must maintain strict underwriting
- Better to exclude than to enable defaults

**The Rebuttal**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| 2008 was about access expansion | 2008 was about predatory terms, not borrower access |
| FHA borrowers caused crisis | FHA default rate was lower than private subprime |
| Strict standards prevent defaults | Credit scores poorly predict default for underserved groups |
| Current standards are optimal | Standards exclude qualified borrowers |

**Key Distinction**

- Access to sustainable mortgages ≠ access to predatory products
- Down payment assistance ≠ no-doc subprime loans
- Alternative credit data ≠ abandoning underwriting
- First-generation programs ≠ inflated appraisals

### "Down Payment Requirements Protect Borrowers"

**The Argument**

- Skin in the game prevents default
- Saving demonstrates readiness
- Low down payment = underwater risk
- 20% is the "safe" standard

**The Rebuttal**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Higher down payment = lower default | VA loans (0% down) have lowest default rates |
| Saving demonstrates readiness | Inherited wealth isn't earned |
| Need 20% for safety | Most buyers put down less than 20% |
| Standard should be 20% | Historical requirement was about lender protection, not borrower |

**Key Points**

- Ability to save depends on family wealth, not creditworthiness
- Monthly payment matters more than down payment
- Sustainable loans with assistance outperform subprime
- 20% requirement excludes most first-generation buyers

### "Credit Scores Are Objective Measures"

**The Argument**

- Scores are based on behavior, not identity
- Anyone can build good credit
- Alternatives would be less accurate
- Lower standards mean more defaults

**The Rebuttal**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Scores measure behavior only | Scores reflect access to credit, which is unequal |
| Anyone can build credit | Credit invisible = 45 million Americans |
| Alternatives less accurate | Rent payment, utility payment data improves accuracy |
| Current models optimal | Models not validated for underserved populations |

**Evidence**

- Rent payment history predicts mortgage performance well
- Medical debt (60% of collections) doesn't predict default
- Credit scores have 50-point racial gap after controlling for income
- Alternative data can safely expand access

### "Market Should Determine Home Values"

**The Argument**

- Appraisers are objective professionals
- Market comparables are neutral
- Intervening would distort values
- Bias claims are unfounded

**The Rebuttal**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Appraisers are objective | Same home valued 23% lower in Black neighborhoods |
| Comparables are neutral | Comparables from discriminated areas perpetuate discrimination |
| Intervention distorts market | Bias already distorts market |
| Bias claims unfounded | Extensive research documents systematic bias |

**Evidence**

- Freddie Mac: Black homeowners 2x likely to receive low appraisal
- Brookings: $156 billion in lost Black home equity from undervaluation
- "Whitewashing" studies: Removing race signals increases appraisals 3-7%

### "Government Programs Create Dependency"

**The Argument**

- Assistance should be temporary
- People should save independently
- Programs create moral hazard
- Private market is more efficient

**The Rebuttal**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| People should be independent | 28% of buyers get family gifts averaging $58,000 |
| Assistance creates dependency | Down payment assistance = one-time help to enter ownership |
| Private market is efficient | Private market systematically excludes qualified buyers |
| Programs are wasteful | Mortgage interest deduction costs $30B/year and mostly helps wealthy |

**Key Point**

Current policy already provides massive assistance to homebuyers - just poorly targeted:

| Program | Annual Cost | Primary Beneficiaries |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Mortgage interest deduction | $30 billion | Upper-income homeowners |
| Property tax deduction | $10 billion | Upper-income homeowners |
| Capital gains exclusion | $40 billion | Sellers of appreciated homes |
| Down payment assistance | $2.4 billion | First-time, low-income buyers |

### "Zoning Protects Community Character"

**The Argument**

- Neighborhoods have the right to self-determine
- Density brings problems
- Property values must be protected
- Local control is democratic

**The Rebuttal**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Community self-determination | Excludes those who would live there but can't |
| Density brings problems | Evidence shows mixed-income neighborhoods thrive |
| Property values threatened | Accessory dwelling units often increase property values |
| Local control is democratic | Local voters are disproportionately existing homeowners |
