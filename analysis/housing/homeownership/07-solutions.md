# Homeownership: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Criteria for Effective Solutions

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Target root causes | Address wealth gap, not just symptoms |
| Sustainable homeownership | Ensure buyers can maintain homes long-term |
| Prevent exploitation | Distinguish access from predatory inclusion |
| Build wealth | Focus on equity accumulation |
| Generational impact | Break cycles of exclusion |
| Racial equity | Explicitly address historical discrimination |

### Lessons from Past Failures

| Failure | Lesson | Application |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Subprime crisis | Access without protection harms borrowers | Require sustainable terms |
| Weak enforcement | Laws without teeth don't work | Build enforcement capacity |
| Trickle-down | Benefits don't flow to excluded groups | Target assistance directly |
| One-size-fits-all | Different barriers need different solutions | Tailored interventions |

## Policy Proposals

### Down Payment Assistance Programs

**Federal Down Payment Grant Program**

| Feature | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Grant amount | Up to $25,000 or 10% of purchase price |
| Eligibility | First-time buyers at 120% AMI or below |
| Targeting | Priority for first-generation homebuyers |
| Recapture | Pro-rated if sold within 5 years |
| Funding | $10 billion annually |

**Projected Impact**

- 400,000 additional first-time buyers annually
- Particular benefit to first-generation buyers
- Close $30,000 gap between first-gen and other buyers

**Existing State Models**

| State | Program | Assistance |
|-------|---------|------------|
| California | Dream for All | Up to 20% of purchase price |
| Maryland | SmartBuy | $30,000 + student debt payoff |
| Florida | Hometown Heroes | Up to $35,000 for essential workers |
| Texas | My First Texas Home | 5% of loan amount |
| Massachusetts | ONE Mortgage | 100% financing, no PMI |

### First-Generation Homebuyer Credit

**Proposed Tax Credit**

| Eligibility | Parents did not own home during childhood |
| Income limit | 150% of AMI phase-out |
| Stacking | Can combine with other assistance |
| Cost | $5 billion annually |

**Rationale**

- First-generation buyers cannot receive family gifts
- 28% of buyers receive average $58,000 family help
