# Homeownership: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The persistent homeownership gap and declining access for first-time buyers result from interconnected structural factors. No single cause explains the crisis; rather, multiple barriers reinforce each other.

### Causal Framework

```
Historical Exclusion → Wealth Gap → Down Payment Barrier → Continued Exclusion
         ↓                 ↓              ↓                      ↓
  No Family Wealth → No Gift → Can't Save → Higher Rent → Less Savings
         ↓                 ↓              ↓                      ↓
  Credit Gaps → Loan Denial → Continued Renting → No Equity Building
         ↓                 ↓              ↓                      ↓
  Less Home Equity → Less Wealth to Transfer → Next Generation Excluded
```

## Structural Barriers

### The Down Payment Wall

**Why Down Payments Exclude**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Median down payment | $68,000 (2024) |
| Years to save at 10% of median income | 8.7 years |
| First-generation buyer disadvantage | No family gift possible |
| Wealth gap effect | White families 8x more likely to help |

**Who Can Save a Down Payment?**

| Income Level | Years to Save 10% on Median Home | % of Households |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Under $50,000 | 15+ years | 35% |
| $50,000-$75,000 | 8-10 years | 22% |
| $75,000-$100,000 | 5-7 years | 18% |
| $100,000-$150,000 | 3-5 years | 15% |
| Over $150,000 | 1-3 years | 10% |

**The Family Wealth Multiplier**

| Down Payment Source | Homeownership Rate by Age 35 |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Saved independently | 34% |
| Family gift | 68% |
| Inheritance | 72% |

28% of first-time buyers receive family help averaging $58,000. This advantage perpetuates across generations.

### Credit System Barriers

**How Credit Scoring Excludes**

| Credit Factor | Weight | Disparate Impact |
|---------------|--------|------------------|
| Payment history | 35% | Penalizes missed payments during hardship |
| Credit utilization | 30% | Lower limits mean higher utilization |
| Length of history | 15% | Younger borrowers disadvantaged |
| Credit mix | 10% | Favors those with diverse debt |
| New credit | 10% | Penalizes shopping for best rate |

**Structural Credit Gaps**

| Factor | White | Black | Hispanic |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| Mean credit score | 727 | 677 | 694 |
| Credit invisible (no score) | 9% | 15% | 13% |
| Thin file (limited history) | 12% | 18% | 16% |
| Subprime score (<620) | 18% | 33% | 26% |

**Why Scores Differ**

1. **Medical debt** - Disproportionately affects minorities; often errors
2. **Student debt** - Higher balances reduce scores
3. **Banking access** - Unbanked households can't build history
4. **Predatory products** - Past subprime lending damaged credit
5. **Employment instability** - Job loss leads to missed payments
6. **Wealth buffer** - No emergency fund means more late payments

### Income and Debt Burdens

**Debt-to-Income Barriers**

| Debt Type | Average Monthly Payment | DTI Impact |
|-----------|------------------------|------------|
| Student loans | $393 | 6.0% of median income |
| Auto loans | $726 | 11.2% |
| Credit cards | $244 | 3.8% |
| Total non-housing | $1,363 | 21.0% |
| Available for housing (43% DTI) | | 22% of income |

**Student Debt's Specific Impact**

- $37,800 average student debt
- $393 average monthly payment
- Reduces purchasing power by $70,000
- Delays homeownership by 7 years on average
- Particularly impacts first-generation college graduates

See [Education: Student Debt](../../education/student-debt/01-overview.md) for detailed analysis.

### The Appraisal Gap

**How Appraisals Perpetuate Inequality**

| Issue | Mechanism | Impact |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Comparable sales | Use nearby sales | Undervalued areas stay undervalued |
| Appraiser demographics | 97% white, 77% male | Bias in subjective judgments |
| Neighborhood factors | Consider demographics | Majority-Black areas undervalued |
| Refinancing denial | Low appraisal blocks refinance | Can't access equity |
| Wealth suppression | Lower values = less equity | Gap compounds over time |

**Documented Appraisal Bias**

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Homes in Black neighborhoods undervalued 23% | Brookings Institution |
| Appraisal gap: $48,000 per home | Freddie Mac |
| Black homeowners 2x likely to receive appraisal below contract price | FHFA |
| "Whitewashing" raises appraisals by 3-7% | Indiana University study |

"Whitewashing": When Black homeowners remove family photos and cultural items, and have white friends present during appraisals, valuations increase.

### Housing Market Dynamics

**Supply-Side Exclusion**

| Factor | How It Excludes |
|--------|-----------------|
| Zoning restrictions | Limits affordable starter homes |
| Construction costs | New homes priced for move-up buyers |
| Land costs | Entry-level locations unaffordable |
| Builder preferences | Larger homes = higher profits |
| Investor competition | Cash offers outcompete first-time buyers |

**Starter Home Shortage**

| Year | Homes Under 1,400 sq ft (Share of New Construction) |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1980 | 35% |
| 1990 | 22% |
| 2000 | 12% |
| 2010 | 8% |
| 2024 | 4% |

Builders construct fewer starter homes because:

- Land costs require higher price points
- Regulatory costs are similar regardless of size
- Profit margins better on larger homes
- Investor demand for single-family rentals

**Investor Competition**

| Metric | 2019 | 2024 |
|--------|------|------|
| Investor share of home purchases | 18% | 28% |
| Institutional investor share | 3% | 8% |
| Cash purchase share | 22% | 32% |
| First-time buyer share | 33% | 26% |

Investors outcompete first-time buyers with:

- Cash offers (no financing contingency)
- Quick closings
- Above-asking bids
- Portfolio buying power

## Geographic Factors

### Opportunity Hoarding

**Exclusionary Communities**

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Large-lot zoning | Raises minimum price |
| Single-family only | Prevents affordable options |
| Minimum home size | Prevents starter homes |
| Architectural review | Increases costs |
| Impact fees | Adds $20,000-$50,000 per unit |

**The Exclusion-Appreciation Cycle**

1. Affluent community restricts housing supply
2. Limited supply → higher prices
3. Higher prices → more affluent buyers
4. More affluent residents → better schools
5. Better schools → higher demand
6. Higher demand → even higher prices
7. Cycle excludes lower-income, first-generation buyers

See [Housing: Zoning](../zoning/01-overview.md) for detailed analysis.

### Regional Disparities

**Affordability by Region**

| Region | Median Home | Median Income | Ratio | First-Time Buyer Access |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------|------------------------|
| Midwest | $265,000 | $70,000 | 3.8x | More accessible |
| South | $330,000 | $68,000 | 4.9x | Mixed |
| Northeast | $425,000 | $82,000 | 5.2x | Limited |
| West | $545,000 | $85,000 | 6.4x | Very limited |

**Metro vs. Rural**

| Location | Homeownership Rate | Median Price | Entry Barriers |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Urban core | 48% | $450,000 | Very high |
| Suburban | 72% | $380,000 | High |
| Exurban | 75% | $320,000 | Moderate |
| Rural | 78% | $220,000 | Lower |

## Generational Factors

### Millennials' Structural Disadvantage

| Factor | Boomer Reality (Age 30) | Millennial Reality (Age 30) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Real wages | Higher relative to costs | Stagnant relative to costs |
| College cost | $3,000/year (2024 dollars) | $25,000/year |
| Student debt | Rare | $37,800 average |
| Home price/income | 2.4x | 5.5x |
| Interest rates | 11% (but lower prices) | 7% (but higher prices) |
| Gig economy | Rare | 36% of workers |
| Job stability | Pensions common | 401k, if anything |

### First-Generation Homebuyer Barriers

**The Compounding Disadvantage**

| Parents' Status | Child's Outcomes |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Homeowner parents** | |
| - Can provide down payment gift | 28% receive gifts |
| - Wealth buffer enables risk-taking | Better credit scores |
| - Understanding of process | Navigate easier |
| - Network of professionals | Access to advice |
| - Backup housing option | Can take chances |
| **Renter parents** | |
| - No gift possible | 0% receive gifts |
| - Less wealth buffer | Lower credit scores |
| - Less process knowledge | More mistakes |
| - Fewer professional connections | Harder navigation |
| - No backup option | Risk-averse |

**First-Generation Buyer Statistics**

| Metric | First-Generation | Other First-Time |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Homeownership by 35 | 23% | 52% |
| Average age at first purchase | 39 | 33 |
| Average down payment | $24,000 | $58,000 |
| Gift from family | 0% | 38% |
| Use down payment assistance | 12% | 4% |

## Institutional Barriers

### Lending Industry Structure

**Why Lenders Prefer Certain Borrowers**

| Borrower Type | Lender Preference | Reason |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| High credit score | Strong | Lower default risk |
| Large down payment | Strong | More equity protection |
| Conventional loan | Strong | Less paperwork |
| Repeat buyer | Strong | Easier process |
| High income | Strong | Higher loan amounts = more profit |
| First-time buyer | Weak | More hand-holding required |
| FHA borrower | Weak | More paperwork, lower fees |
| Low down payment | Weak | Higher risk |

**The Steering Effect**

Loan officers are often incentivized to:

- Close loans quickly (repeat buyers easier)
- Maximize loan size (higher commissions)
- Avoid complex files (FHA, first-time)
- Push in-house products (not best for borrower)

### Real Estate Industry Barriers

**Realtor Practices**

| Practice | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Commission structure | Incentivizes higher prices |
| Steering | Directs buyers to certain neighborhoods |
| Pocket listings | Excludes buyers without connections |
| Dual agency | Conflicts of interest |
| Technology gap | Institutional buyers have advantages |

**Continued Steering Evidence**

| Study Finding | Source |
|---------------|--------|
| Black testers shown 17% fewer homes | HUD (2012) |
| Hispanic testers shown 18% fewer homes | HUD (2012) |
| Agents recommended different neighborhoods by race | National Fair Housing Alliance |
| Online algorithms replicate human bias | UC Berkeley (2023) |

## Feedback Loops

### How Barriers Reinforce Each Other

**Loop 1: Wealth-Credit-Access**

Historical exclusion → No family wealth → No down payment → Higher DTI → Lower credit score → Loan denial → No equity building → No wealth to transfer

**Loop 2: Neighborhood-Value-Investment**

Disinvestment → Lower values → Lower appraisals → Less equity → Less borrowing capacity → Less investment → Continued disinvestment

**Loop 3: Rent-Savings-Ownership**

Can't buy → Pay rent → Rent increases → Less savings → Larger gap to ownership → Continued renting → Landlord builds equity instead

**Loop 4: Generation-Generation**

Parents excluded → No homeownership → No wealth transfer → Child disadvantaged → Child excluded → No wealth transfer

### Breaking the Loops

Each barrier requires targeted intervention:

| Loop | Breaking Point | Required Intervention |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| Wealth-Credit | Down payment | Grants, shared equity |
| Neighborhood-Value | Appraisal | Bias elimination, investment |
| Rent-Savings | Rental costs | Rent assistance, supply |
| Generational | First-gen buyer | Baby bonds, targeted credit |

## Why Past Interventions Failed

### Fair Housing Act (1968)

| Limitation | Consequence |
|------------|-------------|
| No enforcement mechanism until 1988 | Continued discrimination |
| Relied on victim complaints | Most bias goes unreported |
| No remedy for accumulated harm | Gap preserved |
| Individual focus | Systemic patterns continued |

### Community Reinvestment Act (1977)

| Limitation | Consequence |
|------------|-------------|
| No lending targets | Minimal compliance |
| 97% pass rate | No meaningful pressure |
| Non-banks exempt | Mortgage companies not covered |
| Assessment area loophole | Can avoid low-income areas |

### Subprime "Expansion" (1990s-2000s)

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Access without protection | Predatory lending |
| High-cost loans | Wealth stripping |
| Unsustainable terms | Foreclosure crisis |
| Deregulation | No oversight |

The subprime era shows that access alone is insufficient; terms and sustainability matter.
