# Homeownership: Overview

Homeownership remains the primary wealth-building mechanism for American families, yet access has become increasingly unequal. The national homeownership rate of 65.6% masks a devastating racial gap: 74% of white households own their homes compared to just 45% of Black households and 48% of Hispanic households. This 30-percentage-point gap between white and Black homeownership has barely narrowed since the Fair Housing Act passed in 1968. First-time buyers now face median home prices exceeding 7 times median income, down payments averaging $68,000, and mortgage rates that have doubled since 2021. Student debt delays homeownership by an average of 7 years. Without significant policy intervention, homeownership will increasingly become a privilege passed down through family wealth rather than an opportunity earned through work.
