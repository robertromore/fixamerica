# Housing: History

## Overview

American housing policy has oscillated between promoting homeownership for white families, tolerating segregation, and episodic efforts to address affordability and access. From colonial land grants through New Deal housing programs, postwar suburbanization, urban renewal, fair housing legislation, and the 2008 financial crisis, housing policy has shaped—and been shaped by—broader struggles over race, class, and the meaning of the American Dream.

## What History Teaches

### Lessons from Policy Failures

| Failure | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| **Redlining** | Government can institutionalize discrimination |
| **Urban renewal** | Demolition doesn't solve poverty |
| **Highway construction** | Infrastructure choices have racial impacts |
| **Public housing decline** | Disinvestment destroys communities |
| **Subprime crisis** | Deregulation enables predation |
| **Weak fair housing** | Rights without enforcement mean little |

### Patterns That Persist

| Pattern | Historical Examples | Current Manifestation |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Racial exclusion | Covenants, redlining, steering | Algorithmic discrimination, NIMBYism |
| Subsidy to wealthy | Mortgage interest deduction | Tax benefits flow to higher incomes |
| Local control blocking access | Zoning, exclusionary suburbs | Single-family zoning, NIMBY opposition |
| Crisis as opportunity | Urban renewal, 2008 foreclosures | Investor purchases, displacement |
| Inadequate enforcement | Fair housing, CRA | Complaint-driven systems, weak penalties |

### What Has Worked

| Approach | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| **Direct production** | LIHTC, public housing (when funded) |
| **Vouchers** | Reduce homelessness, improve outcomes |
| **Antidiscrimination enforcement** | When aggressive, reduces discrimination |
| **Zoning reform** | Where enacted, increases production |
| **Inclusionary zoning** | Creates affordable units in strong markets |

### Recurring Mistakes

| Mistake | Instances |
|---------|-----------|
| Relying on private market | Every era |
| Underestimating racism | 1960s optimism, "post-racial" claims |
| Demolition over rehabilitation | Urban renewal, HOPE VI |
| Weak enforcement | Fair housing, CRA |
| Means-testing assistance | Creates cliffs, administrative burden |

| Public housing siting | 1937-1970s | Concentration in minority areas |
| Highway routing | 1956-1980s | Destruction of minority neighborhoods |

### Facially Neutral Policies with Discriminatory Effect

| Mechanism | Implementation | Effect |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Single-family zoning | Exclude apartments | Class and race exclusion |
| Minimum lot sizes | Require large parcels | Price exclusion |
| Parking requirements | Increase housing costs | Reduce affordability |
