# Homelessness: Overview

## Executive Summary

Homelessness in America represents one of the most visible failures of the nation's housing, healthcare, and social support systems. On any given night, over 650,000 people experience homelessness in the United States, with millions more cycling through episodes of homelessness each year. Despite being the wealthiest nation in history, the U.S. has struggled to address this crisis, which has grown substantially worse in the past decade, particularly on the West Coast.

The homelessness crisis is fundamentally a housing crisis. Research consistently demonstrates that the primary driver of homelessness rates is the gap between housing costs and incomes. While mental illness, substance use disorders, and other individual vulnerabilities contribute to who becomes homeless, they do not explain why homelessness rates vary so dramatically between regions with similar populations.

What makes this crisis particularly frustrating is that we know what works. The Housing First model, which prioritizes providing stable housing without preconditions, has demonstrated strong evidence of effectiveness. Communities like Houston, Texas have achieved dramatic reductions in homelessness through coordinated housing-focused strategies. Finland has virtually eliminated chronic homelessness using similar approaches at the national level.

Yet the U.S. continues to underfund solutions while overspending on crisis response. Emergency shelters, hospital emergency departments, jails, and law enforcement interventions cost more per person than permanent housing with supportive services. The current approach is not only inhumane but economically irrational.

Progress requires confronting uncomfortable truths: NIMBYism blocks housing and shelter construction, the shelter system often perpetuates rather than solves homelessness, criminalization pushes people further from services, and the fragmented response system wastes resources. Solving homelessness requires political will to invest in proven solutions and overcome local opposition.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Measurement and counting**: Point-in-time counts, their limitations, and who gets missed
- **Populations**: Chronic and episodic homelessness, families, youth, veterans, and other subpopulations
- **Causes**: Structural factors (housing costs, wages) and individual factors (mental health, substance use, domestic violence)
- **Current system**: Emergency shelters, transitional housing, outreach, and the Continuum of Care structure
- **What works**: Housing First, permanent supportive housing, rapid rehousing, and prevention
- **Barriers**: NIMBY opposition, criminalization policies, funding gaps, and coordination failures
- **Successful models**: Houston, Finland, Medicine Hat (Canada), and other examples
- **Policy options**: Federal legislation, state and local policies, and regulatory changes

## Key Questions

This analysis addresses the following questions:

1. **How many people experience homelessness, and how do we know?**
   - What do point-in-time counts capture and miss?
   - How many people experience homelessness over the course of a year?
   - What are the trends, and why is homelessness increasing in some areas?

2. **Who experiences homelessness, and why?**
   - What distinguishes chronic homelessness from transitional episodes?
   - How do family homelessness, youth homelessness, and veteran homelessness differ?
   - What role do mental illness, substance use, domestic violence, and incarceration play?

3. **What causes homelessness at the population level?**
   - Why do homelessness rates vary so dramatically between similar cities?
   - What is the relationship between housing costs, vacancy rates, and homelessness?
   - How have policy decisions (deinstitutionalization, welfare reform, housing disinvestment) contributed?

4. **What works to end homelessness?**
   - What is the evidence for Housing First versus treatment-first approaches?
   - What has made Houston, Finland, and other places successful?
   - What role do prevention programs play?

5. **What are the barriers to progress?**
   - How does NIMBY opposition block solutions?
   - Why do criminalization approaches persist despite evidence?
   - What makes coordination across agencies so difficult?

6. **What would it cost to end homelessness, and what do we currently spend?**
   - What is the cost of the current crisis response system?
   - What would Housing First and permanent supportive housing cost at scale?
   - What are the savings from reduced emergency services, incarceration, and healthcare?

## Key Findings

### The scale of the problem

- **653,104 people** were homeless on a single night in January 2023
- **1.5+ million** people use emergency shelters or transitional housing annually
- **40% increase** in unsheltered homelessness since 2015
- **70,000+ people** experience homelessness for the first time each month

### Homelessness is a housing problem

- Metropolitan areas with the highest housing costs have the highest homelessness rates
- A $100 increase in median rent is associated with a 9% increase in homelessness
- Homelessness rates correlate more strongly with housing market conditions than with mental illness or substance use rates

### We know what works

- **Housing First** reduces homelessness by 80-90% for program participants
- **Permanent supportive housing** reduces chronic homelessness and costs less than emergency response
- **Houston** reduced overall homelessness by 64% since 2011 through coordinated housing strategies
- **Finland** reduced chronic homelessness by 35% and street homelessness nearly to zero

### Current spending is inefficient

- A single homeless person costs taxpayers **$30,000-$50,000 annually** in emergency services
- Permanent supportive housing costs approximately **$20,000-$25,000 annually** per person
- The U.S. spends billions on crisis response that could be redirected to housing solutions

### Barriers persist despite evidence

- **NIMBY opposition** blocks 95% of proposed shelter and housing projects in some cities
- **Criminalization** (camping bans, sit-lie ordinances) moves people around without housing them
- **Fragmented systems** waste resources on coordination failures
- **Underfunding** leaves waiting lists for housing vouchers averaging 2+ years

## The Path Forward

Ending homelessness requires:

1. **Dramatic expansion of affordable housing supply** - Building and preserving housing affordable to extremely low-income households

2. **Universal access to permanent supportive housing** - Ensuring everyone with disabilities and long-term homelessness can access appropriate housing with services

3. **Robust prevention systems** - Intervening before homelessness occurs through emergency rental assistance, legal aid, and family support

4. **Coordinated entry and by-name lists** - Knowing every homeless person by name and matching them to housing resources

5. **Ending criminalization** - Replacing police-first responses with housing-first responses

6. **Overcoming NIMBYism** - Political courage to build housing and shelters despite local opposition

7. **Adequate and sustained funding** - Federal investment commensurate with the scale of the problem

## Why This Analysis Matters

Homelessness is solvable. This is not wishful thinking but a conclusion supported by evidence from communities that have achieved dramatic reductions. The question is not whether we can end homelessness, but whether we have the political will to do so.

Understanding the evidence matters because many common beliefs about homelessness are wrong:

- **Wrong**: Homelessness is primarily caused by mental illness and addiction
- **Right**: Homelessness is primarily caused by housing costs exceeding incomes

- **Wrong**: People need to get clean and stable before they can be housed
- **Right**: Housing enables stability and supports recovery

- **Wrong**: Helping homeless people attracts more homeless people
- **Right**: Most people become homeless where they already live

- **Wrong**: We have tried everything and nothing works
- **Right**: Evidence-based solutions work; we have not tried them at scale

This analysis aims to equip advocates, policymakers, and citizens with the evidence and tools needed to make progress on ending homelessness in America
