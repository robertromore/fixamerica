# Homelessness: Current State

## The Problem Today

The United States is experiencing its worst homelessness crisis in decades. Despite billions in federal spending and countless local initiatives, homelessness has increased substantially since 2015, with particularly dramatic rises in unsheltered homelessness on the West Coast. The COVID-19 pandemic temporarily slowed new entries into homelessness due to eviction moratoria, but those protections have expired while housing costs have surged, setting the stage for continued increases.

## Recent Developments

### Federal Policy (2021-2024)

- **American Rescue Plan (2021)**: $5 billion for Emergency Housing Vouchers
- **HOME-ARP (2021)**: $5 billion for homeless services and affordable housing
- **Eviction prevention**: $46 billion in emergency rental assistance
- **Voucher expansion**: 200,000 new Housing Choice Vouchers authorized

### Supreme Court Decision (2024)

*Grants Pass v. Johnson* (2024) ruled that cities can enforce camping bans even when shelter is unavailable. This reversed Ninth Circuit precedent and enabled increased criminalization of homelessness.

### Trends to Watch

- **Aging homeless population**: Median age increasing; more elderly homelessness
- **Family homelessness rebounding**: Post-pandemic increase beginning
- **Unsheltered growth**: Continuing despite investment
- **Criminalization expansion**: Post-*Grants Pass* enforcement increases
- **Housing costs**: Rent increases outpacing wage growth nationally
