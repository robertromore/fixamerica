# Homelessness: Opposition

## Overview

Efforts to address homelessness face significant opposition from multiple directions. Understanding these opposition arguments, their basis, and their weaknesses is essential for advancing effective solutions.

## NIMBY Opposition to Housing and Shelters

### The Pattern

Nearly every proposal to build homeless housing, shelters, or services faces neighborhood opposition. This "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) response is the single largest barrier to implementing known solutions.

**Typical NIMBY arguments**:

| Argument | Claimed Concern | Reality |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Property values | Housing prices will decline | Research shows minimal to no impact |
| Safety | Crime will increase | PSH residents have lower crime rates than general population |
| "Character" | Neighborhood will change | Often code for exclusion |
| Schools | Quality will decline | No evidence supports this |
| Traffic/parking | Congestion | Minor compared to other development |
| "Not appropriate here" | Site-specific objections | Applied universally |

### Evidence on Property Values

**Research findings**:

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Galster et al. (2003) | Supportive housing has no negative impact on property values |
| Furman Center (2008) | NYC supportive housing slightly increased nearby property values |
| Multiple Denver studies | No property value impact from homeless facilities |
| Meta-analysis | Consistent finding of no negative impact from well-managed facilities |

### The Catch-22

- Homeless people are visible on streets: "Do something!"
- Propose shelter or housing: "Not here!"
- Result: Nowhere is acceptable
- Homelessness continues: "Why can't you solve this?"

### Why NIMBY Persists

**Political economy**:

- Homeowners are organized, vote, donate
- Homeless people are not organized, often cannot vote
- Local officials responsive to vocal opposition
- Approval processes allow repeated objections
- One neighborhood's "win" pushes problem elsewhere

**Information asymmetry**:

- Visible homeless people are frightening to some
- Invisible success stories (housed people) are unremarkable
- Media covers complaints, not successes
- Stereotypes persist without correction

## Criminalization Advocacy

### The Enforcement-First Approach

Many residents, business owners, and politicians advocate for enforcement approaches to homelessness.

**Criminalization policies**:

| Policy | Description | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Camping bans | Prohibit sleeping outside | 72% of cities |
| Sit-lie ordinances | Prohibit sitting/lying in public | 55% of cities |
| Anti-loitering laws | Prohibit standing in public areas | 65% of cities |
| Vehicle dwelling bans | Prohibit sleeping in vehicles | 50%+ of cities |
| Food sharing restrictions | Limit feeding homeless people | 25%+ of cities |
| Property seizure | Confiscate belongings during sweeps | Common |

### Arguments for Criminalization

| Argument | Claimed Justification | Problem |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| "Compassion" | Forces people into services | Services often unavailable; trauma |
| Public safety | Reduces crime | Homeless people are victims, not perpetrators |
| Health | Addresses sanitation | Sweeps destroy belongings; no alternative |
| "Enabling" | Tolerating homelessness makes it worse | No evidence for this claim |
| Business protection | Preserves commerce | Short-term dispersal; long-term return |
| Quality of life | Improves conditions for housed | At expense of unhoused |

### Evidence Against Criminalization

**Research consistently shows criminalization does not reduce homelessness**:

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| DOJ Statement of Interest (2015) | Criminalizing sleeping when no shelter available is cruel and unusual |
| National Law Center reports | Criminalization increases barriers to housing |
| Cost studies | Incarceration costs far exceed housing |
| Recidivism data | Arrests do not deter homelessness |

**Why criminalization fails**:

1. Does not provide housing (the only solution)
2. Creates criminal records that block future housing
3. Costs more than housing solutions
4. Trauma worsens mental health and substance use
5. Moves people around without housing them
6. Destroys ID, medications, belongings needed for recovery

### *Grants Pass v. Johnson* (2024)

The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that cities can enforce camping bans even when no shelter is available, reversing Ninth Circuit precedent.

**Impact**:

- Removed constitutional constraint on enforcement
- Cities expanding criminalization
- Does not change evidence that criminalization fails
- Advocacy now focuses on political rather than legal strategies

## Treatment-First Opposition to Housing First

### The Philosophical Divide

Some advocates and providers believe housing should be contingent on treatment, sobriety, or "readiness."

**Treatment-first arguments**:

| Argument | Claim | Counter-evidence |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| "Enabling" | Housing without treatment enables addiction | Housing stability improves treatment engagement |
| "Readiness" | People must be ready for housing | Housing First shows people stabilize in housing |
| "Earned" | Housing should be earned | Housing is a basic need, not a reward |
| "Moral hazard" | Free housing discourages self-sufficiency | PSH residents often gain employment over time |
| "Limited resources" | Should prioritize motivated individuals | Chronically homeless use most crisis resources |

### Evidence for Housing First

**Rigorous research consistently supports Housing First**:

| Study/Program | Finding |
|---------------|---------|
| Pathways to Housing (original) | 88% housing retention vs. 47% treatment-first |
| At Home/Chez Soi (Canada) | Housing First effective across populations |
| DESC 1811 Eastlake (Seattle) | 95% retention; reduced drinking; cost savings |
| Multiple RCTs | Housing First superior on housing outcomes |
| HUD policy | Housing First adopted as evidence-based practice |

**Why Housing First works**:

1. Housing stability reduces crisis and survival stress
2. Stable address enables treatment, employment, benefits
3. Client choice improves engagement
4. Safety allows focus on recovery
5. Harm reduction prevents deaths while supporting change

## Cost and Fiscal Opposition

### "We Can't Afford It"

**The argument**: Homeless housing and services are too expensive.

**The reality**: We already spend more on ineffective crisis response.

| Spending Category | Cost per Person | Notes |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Emergency shelter | $15,000-20,000/year | Does not end homelessness |
| ER visits (chronic homeless) | $20,000-50,000/year | Costly; inadequate care |
| Jail/prison | $25,000-50,000/year | Creates more barriers |
| Police, courts | $5,000-15,000/year | Enforcement that moves problem |
| **Total crisis response** | **$50,000-150,000/year** | Per chronically homeless person |

**Permanent supportive housing**: $20,000-30,000/year with better outcomes

### Cost-Effectiveness Evidence

| Study | Location | Finding |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Culhane et al. | NYC | PSH pays for itself in reduced crisis services |
| DESC 1811 | Seattle | $2.5 million annual savings for 95 residents |
| Denver Housing First | Denver | 73% reduction in costs per person |
| Project 25 (Charlotte) | Charlotte | $2.4 million savings over 5 years |

### Federal Spending Opposition

**Arguments against federal homeless spending**:

- "Local problem, local responsibility"
- "Federal deficit concerns"
- "Programs don't work"
- "Moral hazard for cities"

**Counters**:

- Housing costs driven by federal policy (tax code, land use)
- Crisis costs borne by federal programs (Medicaid, VA)
- Federal programs (HUD-VASH, SSVF) have strong outcomes
- Local governments lack resources for national crisis

## Jurisdictional Opposition

### Local vs. Regional Responsibility

**The "magnet" argument**:

- "If we solve homelessness, more will come"
- "We'll become a regional destination"
- "Other cities should do their share"

**Evidence**:

- Most homeless people become homeless in the community where they are found
- Cross-jurisdiction moves are primarily for family, jobs (same as housed people)
- "Magnet effect" is not supported by research
- Argument is used to justify inaction

### State vs. Local Tension

**State positions**:

- Often unfunded mandates to localities
- Mental health responsibility without housing responsibility
- Housing finance tools without direct homeless programs

**Local complaints**:

- "State doesn't fund our efforts"
- "State policies (Medicaid, mental health) create homelessness"
- "We can't solve a state/national problem locally"

## Addressing Opposition Effectively

### Strategies for NIMBY

| Strategy | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Early engagement | Involve neighbors before announcing |
| Site selection criteria | Objective process for choosing locations |
| Good neighbor agreements | Formal commitments on operations |
| Success story tours | Show well-functioning facilities |
| Political courage | Leaders who will accept controversy |
| Streamlined approval | Reduce opportunities for delay |

### Strategies for Criminalization Advocates

| Strategy | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Cost arguments | Show enforcement costs more than solutions |
| Business engagement | Downtown business leaders supporting housing |
| Evidence presentation | Research on criminalization ineffectiveness |
| Alternative responses | Co-responder models, housing-focused outreach |
| Media narrative | Stories of people helped by housing |

### Building Coalition Support

- **Healthcare systems**: Cost savings from housing
- **Business**: Long-term solutions for downtown areas
- **Faith communities**: Moral imperative and direct service experience
- **Moderates**: Evidence-based, cost-effective approaches
- **Fiscal conservatives**: Reduced crisis spending
