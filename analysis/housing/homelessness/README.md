# Homelessness: Overview

Homelessness in America represents one of the most visible failures of the nation's housing, healthcare, and social support systems. On any given night, over 650,000 people experience homelessness in the United States, with millions more cycling through episodes of homelessness each year. Despite being the wealthiest nation in history, the U.S. has struggled to address this crisis, which has grown substantially worse in the past decade, particularly on the West Coast.
