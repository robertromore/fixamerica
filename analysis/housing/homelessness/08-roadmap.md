## Risk Mitigation

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Political change | Medium | Build bipartisan support; state/local leadership |
| Funding interruption | Medium | Multi-year appropriations; diverse funding streams |
| NIMBY blocking housing | High | State preemption; fair share; litigation |
| Workforce shortage | Medium | Wage increases; training pipeline; technology |
| Housing market worsening | High | Pair with supply investments; voucher expansion |

### Contingency Plans

- **If federal funding stalls**: State and local coalitions; philanthropy; Medicaid flexibilities
