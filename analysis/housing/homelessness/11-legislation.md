# Homelessness: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Addressing homelessness requires legislative action at federal, state, and local levels. This document presents draft legislation, regulatory frameworks, and legal analysis for ending homelessness, including identification of potential loopholes and shortcomings.

## Constitutional Framework

No constitutional amendments are required for homelessness legislation. Congress has established authority under:

- **Commerce Clause**: Regulation of housing markets and interstate commerce
- **Spending Power**: Conditional grants to states and localities
- **Taxing Power**: Tax credits for affordable housing development

**Constitutional limitations**:

- *Grants Pass v. Johnson* (2024): Cities may enforce camping bans even without shelter availability
- Takings Clause: Constraints on housing regulations
- Federalism: Primary police power rests with states

## Federal Legislation

### Ending Homelessness Act

**Purpose**: Establish a national commitment to ending homelessness within 10 years through evidence-based interventions and adequate funding.

**Draft Text**:

        night, including 143,000 chronically homeless individuals;
    (2) homelessness costs taxpayers $30,000-$50,000 per person annually in
        emergency services while permanent supportive housing costs $20,000-
        $25,000 annually with better outcomes;
    (3) evidence-based interventions including Housing First and permanent
        supportive housing reduce homelessness by 80-90 percent for participants;
    (4) communities such as Houston, Texas have demonstrated that coordinated
        Housing First strategies can reduce homelessness by 60 percent or more.

    States by 2035 through—
    (1) dramatically expanding permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing;

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Eighth Amendment** (*Grants Pass v. Johnson*, 2024):

- Camping bans are not cruel and unusual punishment
- Cities may enforce regardless of shelter availability
- Does not prevent policy choice against criminalization

**Due Process**:

- Property seizure during encampment sweeps requires due process
- Adequate notice and opportunity to retrieve belongings

**Equal Protection**:

- Disparate enforcement may violate equal protection
- Racial disparities in criminalization are litigable

### Preemption Questions

| Issue | Federal | State |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Fair housing | Federal floor; states may exceed | Enforcement authority |
| Zoning | Limited federal role | Primary state authority; can preempt local |
| Source of income | No federal protection | State legislation needed |
| Medicaid | Federal framework | State administration |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- HUD: CoC funding conditions; civil rights enforcement
- DOJ: Fair housing enforcement; civil rights
- State: Housing agency oversight; civil rights enforcement
- Private: Fair housing litigation; Section 1983 claims

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Housing First waiver abuse | Communities claim waivers to continue treatment-first | High |
| By-name list manipulation | Undercount to appear successful | Medium |
| Voucher discrimination | Landlords use pretextual rejections | High |
| Discharge to shelters | Institutions discharge to shelter, not housing | Medium |
| Local zoning workarounds | Cities use procedural delays despite by-right | High |
| Funding fungibility | Federal funds displace state/local spending | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Funding insufficient for scale | Solutions limited to pilot scale | Budget constraints |
| Market-dependent vouchers | Vouchers unusable in tight markets | Housing shortage |
| Voluntary services limitation | Some need intensive engagement | Respecting autonomy |
| Criminalization continues | Post-*Grants Pass* enforcement | Supreme Court ruling |
| Prevention targeting difficulty | Hard to identify who will become homeless | Data limitations |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Housing First waiver abuse**: Require outcome data demonstrating superior results before granting waivers; annual review; publish waiver data publicly.

2. **By-name list manipulation**: Third-party audits of by-name lists; standardized counting methodology; consequences for misreporting.

3. **Voucher discrimination**: Source of income protection with meaningful enforcement; testing programs; landlord incentives; damage mitigation funds.

4. **Discharge to shelters**: Require documentation of permanent housing placement or active housing plan; tie institutional funding to discharge outcomes.

5. **Local zoning workarounds**: State enforcement mechanisms; deemed approved provisions; private right of action; funding penalties.

6. **Funding fungibility**: Maintenance of effort requirements; state/local match requirements; supplement-not-supplant provisions.

7. **Criminalization continuation**: State legislation prohibiting criminalization; local policy advocacy; continued litigation under state constitutions.

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Capacity**: Workforce development for case managers, housing navigators
- **Data systems**: HMIS modernization; interoperability
- **Market conditions**: Housing supply must accompany demand-side assistance
- **Political durability**: Multi-year commitments across administrations
- **Coordination**: Fragmented systems require sustained leadership
