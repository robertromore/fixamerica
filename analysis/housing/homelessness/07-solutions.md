# Homelessness: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

Effective homelessness solutions are guided by evidence and core principles:

1. **Housing First**: Housing is the foundation; treatment and services are offered but not required
2. **Person-centered**: Respect individual choice, dignity, and autonomy
3. **Evidence-based**: Prioritize interventions with demonstrated effectiveness
4. **Cost-effective**: Invest in solutions that reduce total system costs
5. **Prevention-oriented**: Intervene before homelessness occurs when possible
6. **Harm reduction**: Reduce harm while supporting progress toward goals
7. **Equity-focused**: Address racial and demographic disparities
8. **System-wide**: Coordinate across housing, health, and social services

## Core Solutions

### Housing First

**Definition**: Providing permanent housing immediately without preconditions (sobriety, treatment compliance, income) and offering voluntary supportive services.

**Key elements**:

- Immediate access to housing
- No preconditions for entry
- Tenant rights and lease
- Voluntary supportive services
- Harm reduction approach
- Consumer choice

**Evidence**:

| Study | Population | Finding |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Pathways to Housing | Chronic homeless with mental illness | 88% retention vs. 47% treatment-first |
| At Home/Chez Soi (Canada) | Multiple populations | 73% stably housed at 2 years |
| HUD Family Options | Families | Rapid rehousing with subsidies most effective |
| Multiple RCTs | Various | Consistently superior housing outcomes |

**Why it works**:

- Maslow's hierarchy: Basic needs first
- Stable housing enables engagement with services
- Choice and autonomy improve outcomes
- Reduces trauma and crisis
- Cost-effective compared to alternatives

### Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH)

**Definition**: Long-term housing combined with ongoing supportive services for people with disabilities and long-term homelessness.

**Target population**: Chronically homeless individuals with disabilities (mental illness, substance use disorder, physical disability)

**Model elements**:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Housing | Scattered-site or project-based; tenant holds lease |
| Subsidy | Deep subsidy (tenant pays 30% of income) |
| Services | Case management, mental health, medical, life skills |
| Tenancy | No time limit; permanent housing |
| Approach | Harm reduction; voluntary services |

**Outcomes**:

| Metric | Typical Result |
|--------|----------------|
| Housing retention | 80-90% at one year |
| Reduction in ER visits | 50-60% |
| Reduction in hospitalizations | 40-50% |
| Reduction in jail days | 50-70% |
| Cost offset | Often neutral or savings vs. crisis care |

**Scale needed**: Estimated 400,000-500,000 PSH units needed nationally; current inventory approximately 350,000.

### Rapid Rehousing (RRH)

**Definition**: Short-term rental assistance and services to help people exit homelessness quickly and return to stable housing.

**Target population**: Families; individuals without chronic patterns or severe disabilities

**Model elements**:

- Housing search assistance
- Short-to-medium term rental subsidy (3-24 months)
- Case management
- Move-in assistance
- Declining subsidy model in some programs

**Outcomes**:

| Population | Housing Success Rate | Notes |
|------------|---------------------|-------|
| Families | 80-85% | Best outcomes |
| Single adults | 60-70% | Varies by support level |
| Youth | 70-80% | With appropriate services |

**Limitations**:

- Less effective for chronically homeless
- Success depends on housing market
- Some families return to homelessness
- Requires affordable housing availability

### Homelessness Prevention

**Definition**: Interventions that prevent housing loss before homelessness occurs.

**Types of prevention**:

| Type | Target | Interventions |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Primary | General population at risk | Affordable housing; living wages |
| Secondary | Immediate crisis | Emergency rental assistance; legal aid |
| Tertiary | Recent homeless | Rapid rehousing; shallow subsidy |

**Evidence-based prevention interventions**:

| Intervention | Effectiveness | Cost |
|--------------|---------------|------|
| Emergency rental assistance | 95%+ remain housed | $1,000-3,000/household |
| Legal representation in eviction | 80%+ avoid eviction | $1,500-2,500/case |
| Family reunification | Variable | Low cost |
| Discharge planning | Prevents institutional exits to streets | Program costs |

**Cost-effectiveness**: Prevention is 10-20x more cost-effective than addressing established homelessness.

## System-Wide Approaches

### Coordinated Entry

**Definition**: A centralized process for assessing, prioritizing, and matching homeless people to housing resources.

**Key elements**:

- Single point of access
- Standardized assessment (VI-SPDAT or similar)
- Prioritization based on vulnerability and need
- Real-time matching to available resources
- By-name list of all homeless individuals

**Benefits**:

- Fair, transparent prioritization
- Efficient resource allocation
- System-wide data
- Reduced provider shopping
- Identifies gaps in resources

**Challenges**:

- Assessment tools have bias issues
- Prioritization decisions are value-laden
- Can create bottlenecks
- Requires buy-in from all providers

### By-Name Lists

**Definition**: A real-time, comprehensive list of every homeless person in a community by name.

**Requirements**:

- Regular updating (weekly or more)
- Case conferencing on individuals
- Tracking of housing placements
- Quality data on each person
- HMIS integration

**Benefits**:

- Accountability for each individual
- Identifies people falling through cracks
- Enables targeted outreach
- Measures true progress

**Model**: Built for Zero campaign supports communities in developing by-name lists and achieving "functional zero" homelessness.

### Continuum of Care Coordination

The HUD Continuum of Care (CoC) system provides the framework for local homeless response.

**Effective CoC practices**:

- Unified funding priorities
- Coordinated entry with real prioritization
- Performance-based funding
- Cross-sector partnerships (health, justice, housing)
- Data-driven decision making
- Consumer involvement

## Specialized Interventions

### Veteran Homelessness

**What has worked**: The U.S. has achieved significant reductions in veteran homelessness.

| Program | Description | Outcomes |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| HUD-VASH | Housing vouchers + VA services | 100,000+ veterans housed |
| SSVF | Prevention and rapid rehousing | Millions served |
| GPD | Transitional housing | Bridge to permanent housing |

**Success factors**:

- Strong federal commitment and funding
- VA healthcare system for services
- Coordinated national strategy
- Dedicated resources

**Status**: Veteran homelessness down 55% since 2010; functional zero achieved in some communities.

### Family Homelessness

**Effective approaches**:

- Rapid rehousing with rental assistance
- Shallow subsidies (ongoing small subsidy)
- School-based identification and support
- Family preservation services
- Childcare assistance

**Key insight**: Most family homelessness is driven by poverty and housing costs, not individual pathology. Housing assistance is primary solution.

### Youth Homelessness

**Specialized needs**:

- Trauma-informed care (abuse, neglect common)
- Education and employment support
- LGBTQ+ affirming services (40%+ of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ+)
- Family reconnection (when safe)
- Host homes and transitional living

**Evidence-based models**:

- Transitional living programs
- Rapid rehousing adapted for youth
- Host home programs
- Permanent supportive housing for older youth

### Chronic Homelessness

**Solution**:
 Permanent supportive housing is the evidence-based solution for chronic homelessness.

**Implementation requirements**:

- Dedicated PSH units (project-based and scattered-site)
- Low-barrier entry
- Ongoing services funding
- Housing First approach
- Outreach to engage resistant individuals

### Medicine Hat, Canada

**First city to end chronic homelessness**:

- "Functional zero" achieved and maintained
- By-name list with rapid housing placement
- Strong community coordination
- Adequate resources

### Key Lessons from Successes

1. **Political will**: Leadership willing to prioritize and fund
2. **System coordination**: Unified strategy, not fragmented programs
3. **Housing First**: Evidence-based approach, not treatment-first
4. **Data**: By-name lists and accountability
5. **Resources**: Adequate funding for housing and services
6. **Prevention**: Stopping inflow, not just housing outflow

## Supply-Side Solutions

### Affordable Housing Production

The fundamental solution is more housing affordable to extremely low-income households.

| Strategy | Description | Scale Needed |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| LIHTC expansion | Tax credits for affordable development | Double production |
| National Housing Trust Fund | Capital for ELI housing | $40 billion+ |
| Public housing reinvestment | Preserve and expand | End disinvestment |
| Inclusionary zoning | Require affordable units | Local adoption |
| Social housing | Publicly-owned, income-mixed | New model needed |

### Voucher Expansion

**Housing Choice Vouchers** are the primary federal rental assistance program.

**Current state**:

- 2.3 million households served
- 6+ million eligible households unserved
- Waiting lists 2-10+ years

**Expansion needed**:

- Universal vouchers for eligible households
- Emergency Housing Vouchers made permanent
- Landlord incentives for participation
- Source of income protection (anti-discrimination)

## Trade-offs and Tensions

| Trade-off | Options | Considerations |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Target population | Highest need vs. most likely to succeed | Prioritize vulnerability; don't abandon anyone |
| Housing type | Scattered-site vs. project-based | Mix needed; client choice |
| Service intensity | High vs. low support | Match to need; avoid over/under-serving |
| Local vs. federal | Who pays? | Federal resources; local implementation |
| Speed vs. quality | Shelter vs. housing | Prioritize housing; improve shelter |
| Individual vs. systemic | Services vs. housing supply | Both needed; housing is foundation |
