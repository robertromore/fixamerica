# Homelessness: History

## From Skid Row to Modern Crisis

Homelessness in America has evolved dramatically over the past 150 years, from the "tramps" of the late 1800s to the diverse homeless population of today. Understanding this history reveals how policy decisions, economic transformations, and social changes created the current crisis.

## Timeline of American Homelessness

### 1870s-1930s: The Era of Transient Workers

**Context**: Industrial expansion, railroad construction, and agricultural labor created demand for mobile workers.

| Period | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| 1870s-1890s | "Tramps" - mobile workers following seasonal employment |
| 1890s-1920s | "Hobos" - working transients; organized subculture |
| Main Street Missions | Religious charity provided meals, beds in exchange for sermons |
| Skid Rows | Districts with cheap hotels, day labor, bars in major cities |

**Key features**:

- Predominantly male, white, working-age
- Viewed as legitimate (if stigmatized) labor arrangement
- Single-room occupancy hotels (SROs) provided permanent addresses
- Police tolerance of Skid Row districts

### 1930s: The Great Depression

**Scale**: Estimated 1-2 million homeless Americans at peak

**Characteristics**:

- First mass homelessness including families and women
- "Hoovervilles" - shantytowns in cities nationwide
- Widespread public sympathy (economic causes obvious)
- Transient camps along railroad lines

**Policy Response**:

- Federal Transient Program (1933-1935): First federal homeless assistance
- Civilian Conservation Corps provided housing with work
- New Deal housing programs began (though excluded many)
- Social Security (1935) created safety net for elderly, disabled

### 1940s-1970s: Skid Row Persistence

**Post-war period**: Homelessness declined but Skid Row continued

| Decade | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1940s | Veterans returned; some to Skid Row |
| 1950s | Skid Row population stable; aging demographic |
| 1960s | Urban renewal begins demolishing SROs |
| 1970s | Deinstitutionalization accelerates; Skid Row changes |

**The Skid Row population** (1950s-1970s):

- Estimated 100,000-200,000 nationally
- Older, white men; alcoholism common
- Located in specific urban districts
- Served by missions, cheap hotels, day labor

### 1980s: The New Homelessness

The modern homelessness crisis began in the early 1980s, fundamentally different from Skid Row.

**Key factors converging**:

1. **Deinstitutionalization** (1960s-1980s)
   - State psychiatric hospital population: 560,000 (1955) to 130,000 (1980)
   - Promised community mental health centers never fully funded
   - People discharged without housing or treatment options

2. **SRO Demolition**
   - 1 million SRO units lost 1970-1980
   - Urban renewal and gentrification eliminated cheap housing
   - No replacement affordable housing built

3. **Economic Recession** (1981-1982)
   - Unemployment peaked at 10.8%
   - Manufacturing jobs lost permanently
   - Poverty rate increased from 11.7% (1979) to 15.2% (1983)

4. **Federal Housing Cuts**
   - HUD budget: $32 billion (1978) to $8 billion (1988) in real terms
   - New public housing construction virtually ended
   - Section 8 waiting lists grew to years-long

5. **Welfare Restrictions**
   - General assistance programs cut in many states
   - Disability benefits harder to obtain
   - Safety net weakened

**The new homeless population**:

- Younger and more diverse than Skid Row era
- Included families with children for first time since Depression
- More severe mental illness (without institutional support)
- More visible (no SROs, no Skid Row tolerance)

### 1983-1990: Recognition and Response

**Growing visibility**:

- Media coverage increased dramatically (1983+)
- Advocates like Mitch Snyder brought national attention
- Churches opened shelters across the country
- Tent cities appeared in major cities

**Federal response**:

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1983 | Emergency Food and Shelter Program created |
| 1984 | HUD first counted homeless (estimated 250,000-350,000) |
| 1986 | Homeless Persons' Survival Act introduced |
| 1987 | McKinney Homeless Assistance Act passed |
| 1988 | Fair Housing Act amendments protect people with disabilities |

**McKinney Act (1987)** established:

- Emergency Shelter Grants
- Supportive Housing Program
- Shelter Plus Care
- Single Room Occupancy program
- Healthcare for the Homeless
- Education for homeless children

### 1990s: System Building

**Continuum of Care model** emerged:

- Local planning bodies coordinating services
- "Continuum" from outreach to shelter to transitional to permanent housing
- Competitive HUD grants for homeless programs
- Emphasis on "housing readiness" and treatment compliance

**Welfare Reform (1996)** created new pressures:

- Time limits on assistance
- Work requirements
- Reduced cash assistance
- Increased family homelessness in some areas

**The 1990s system**:

- Emergency shelter as primary response
- Transitional housing for "rehabilitation"
- Permanent housing only for those deemed "ready"
- Treatment and sobriety requirements common
- Waiting lists for housing grew

### 2000s: Housing First Emerges

**Pathways to Housing** (New York, 1992) pioneered Housing First:

- Housing provided without preconditions
- Treatment offered but not required
- 88% housing retention rates
- Research showed effectiveness

**Federal adoption began**:

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2002 | Bush administration adopted chronic homelessness goal |
| 2003 | HUD began funding Housing First programs |
| 2006 | Permanent supportive housing prioritized in CoC funding |
| 2009 | HEARTH Act reauthorized McKinney-Vento (passed 2009) |

**Chronic homelessness declined**:

- 2005: 175,914 chronically homeless
- 2010: 109,812 chronically homeless
- 37% reduction through permanent supportive housing

### 2010s: Mixed Progress

**Federal strategy strengthened**:

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2010 | Opening Doors: Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness |
| 2012 | Coordinated Entry required in CoCs |
| 2014 | Rapid rehousing prioritized for families |
| 2015 | Veteran homelessness goal achieved in some communities |

**Successes**:

- Veteran homelessness: 47,725 (2015) down from 75,609 (2009)
- Chronic homelessness: continued decline through 2016
- Family homelessness: declined significantly
- 100,000+ permanent supportive housing units created

**Challenges emerged**:

- Unsheltered homelessness began increasing (2015+)
- West Coast homelessness surged
- Housing costs outpaced wages
- Opioid crisis contributed to new homelessness

### 2020-Present: Pandemic and After

**COVID-19 impacts**:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Eviction moratoria | Prevented surge in new homelessness |
| Shelter outbreaks | Moved people to hotels, reduced density |
| Economic support | CARES Act, stimulus checks provided stability |
| Rental assistance | $46 billion prevented evictions |

**Post-pandemic**:

- Eviction moratoria ended (August 2021 federally)
- Rent prices surged nationally (20%+ in many markets)
- Unsheltered homelessness at record highs
- *Grants Pass v. Johnson* (2024) enabled criminalization
- Political backlash against homeless encampments

## Lessons from History

### What increased homelessness

1. **Housing policy failures**: SRO demolition, public housing cuts, affordable housing shortage
2. **Mental health system collapse**: Deinstitutionalization without community alternatives
3. **Economic shifts**: Deindustrialization, wage stagnation, recession
4. **Safety net cuts**: Welfare reform, disability restrictions, general assistance elimination
5. **Criminalization without alternatives**: Arresting people without providing housing

### What reduced homelessness

1. **Housing investment**: Permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless
2. **Coordinated strategy**: Focused campaigns like veteran homelessness reduction
3. **Evidence-based programs**: Housing First, rapid rehousing
4. **Prevention**: Eviction moratoria, rental assistance
5. **Political will**: Local and federal commitment to specific goals

### Why the crisis persists

The fundamental contradiction: We know what works (housing), but we have not built enough housing affordable to the lowest-income Americans. Every successful reduction has been partial because demand for affordable housing far exceeds supply.
