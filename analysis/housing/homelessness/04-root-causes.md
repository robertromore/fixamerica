# Homelessness: Root Causes

## The Fundamental Equation

Homelessness results from a mismatch between housing costs and household resources. While individual vulnerabilities determine *who* becomes homeless, structural factors determine *how many* people experience homelessness in any given community.

**The Core Finding**: Homelessness rates correlate more strongly with housing market conditions than with mental illness rates, substance use rates, or other individual factors. High-cost housing markets have more homelessness regardless of their mental health or substance use profiles.

## Structural Causes

### Housing Affordability Crisis

**The Primary Driver**: The gap between housing costs and incomes for the lowest-earning Americans.

| Metric | Data | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| Rent increase (2000-2023) | +176% | Outpaced wage growth |
| Extremely low-income (ELI) renters | 11 million | Below 30% Area Median Income |
| Affordable units for ELI | 7.4 million | Shortage of 3.6 million units |
| ELI renters severely burdened | 72% | Pay 50%+ of income for housing |
| Fair Market Rent (2BR national) | $1,430/month | Requires $27.50/hour full-time |

**Research evidence**:

- A $100 increase in median rent is associated with a 9% increase in homelessness
- Cities with rental vacancy rates below 5% have significantly higher homelessness rates
- The correlation between rent levels and homelessness is stronger than any other factor

### Wage Stagnation

The incomes of the lowest-earning workers have not kept pace with housing costs.

| Year | Minimum Wage | Rent Affordable at Min Wage | Actual Fair Market Rent |
|------|--------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| 1970 | $1.60 ($12.45 adj.) | $325/month | $108/month |
| 2000 | $5.15 | $268/month | $602/month |
| 2024 | $7.25 | $377/month | $1,430/month |

**The housing wage gap**:

- A full-time minimum wage worker can afford: $377/month
- Fair Market Rent for 1BR national average: $1,163/month
- Hours at minimum wage needed for 2BR: 99 hours/week
- No state has affordable housing for minimum wage workers

### Loss of Low-Cost Housing Stock

**Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Hotels**:

- 1970: 1 million+ SRO units nationally
- 2020: <100,000 SRO units
- Lost to urban renewal, gentrification, conversion

**Public Housing Decline**:

- Peak: 1.4 million units (1990s)
- 2024: ~900,000 units (demolitions, underfunding)
- Waiting lists: 3-10+ years in most cities

**Housing Choice Vouchers**:

- Serve only 1 in 4 eligible households
- Waiting lists average 2+ years; many closed
- Landlord discrimination limits usefulness in tight markets

### Income Inequality and Poverty

**Poverty as precondition**:

- 37 million Americans in poverty
- 18 million in deep poverty (<50% poverty line)
- Poverty rate for Black Americans: 19.5% (vs. 8.6% white)
- Poverty rate for people with disabilities: 25%+

**Income volatility**:

- Gig economy, irregular hours, unpredictable schedules
- One missed paycheck can trigger eviction
- No savings buffer: 40% cannot cover $400 emergency

## Individual Risk Factors

Individual factors do not cause homelessness but determine who, among those facing housing instability, falls into homelessness.

### Mental Illness

| Factor | Data | Relationship to Homelessness |
|--------|------|------------------------------|
| Severe mental illness in homeless pop. | 25-30% | Higher than general population (6%) |
| Mental illness in chronically homeless | 50%+ | Much higher in long-term population |
| Mental illness causing homelessness | Minority | Often develops/worsens after homelessness |
| Treatment access | Limited | 60% of homeless with MI untreated |

**Key insight**: Mental illness rates do not explain geographic variation in homelessness. San Francisco and Mississippi have similar mental illness rates but vastly different homelessness rates.

**Causal complexity**:

- Mental illness can impair ability to maintain housing/employment
- Homelessness causes and worsens mental illness (trauma, sleep deprivation)
- Untreated mental illness + housing instability = high risk
- Mental illness alone, with affordable housing, rarely causes homelessness

### Substance Use Disorders

| Factor | Data | Relationship |
|--------|------|--------------|
| SUD in homeless population | 30-40% | Higher than general population |
| Alcohol use disorder | 25%+ | Historically most common |
| Opioid use disorder | 15-25% | Increased dramatically 2010s |
| SUD causing homelessness | Minority | Often develops after homelessness |

**Key insight**: Substance use does not explain homelessness rates. West Virginia has the highest overdose rate but low homelessness; California has moderate overdose rates but highest homelessness.

**Causal complexity**:

- Addiction can deplete resources, strain relationships
- Homelessness increases substance use (coping, exposure)
- Many people with SUD remain housed if housing is affordable
- SUD + poverty + housing crisis = extreme vulnerability

### Domestic Violence

**Domestic violence as trigger**:

- 50%+ of homeless women report DV as direct cause
- 22% of homeless families cite DV
- Leaving abuse often means losing housing
- DV survivors face barriers (credit damage, PTSD, childcare)

**Shelter system response**:

- 14,000+ DV shelter beds nationally
- 60-70% of requests for shelter go unmet
- Average stay: 30-60 days
- Transition to permanent housing difficult

### Criminal Justice Involvement

**Incarceration as pathway**:

- 50,000+ people released from prison annually become homeless
- 10%+ of state prison releases go directly to shelters or streets
- Criminal record barriers: housing discrimination, employment limits
- Parole conditions conflict with shelter stays

**Criminalization cycle**:

- Homeless individuals arrested 2-3x per year average
- Arrests for: trespassing, loitering, camping, public intoxication
- Jail destabilizes housing, employment, benefits
- Criminal record makes future housing harder

### Foster Care and Aging Out

**Youth aging out**:

- 20,000+ youth age out of foster care annually
- 20-25% experience homelessness within 4 years
- Lack of family support, savings, credit history
- Higher rates of mental health issues, trauma

### Medical Debt and Illness

**Health as housing stability**:

- Medical bills contribute to 66% of bankruptcies
- Chronic illness limits work capacity
- Disability onset often precedes homelessness
- Health insurance gaps leave people vulnerable

## Systems Failures

### Inadequate Safety Net

| Program | Coverage Gap | Impact |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| TANF | Serves 21% of poor families (down from 68% in 1996) | Cash assistance unavailable |
| SSI | 29-month average wait; 70% initially denied | Disabled people without income |
| SNAP | Covers food only; benefits modest | Housing costs unaddressed |
| Medicaid | 2 million in coverage gap states | Mental health, SUD untreated |

### Housing System Gaps

| Gap | Scale | Consequence |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| Voucher shortage | 75% eligible unserved | No rent assistance |
| Public housing waitlist | 3-10+ years | No affordable housing |
| Supportive housing shortage | 500,000+ needed | Chronically homeless stay homeless |
| Shelter capacity | 40% homeless unsheltered | No immediate option |

### Discharge Planning Failures

**Institutions discharging to homelessness**:

| Institution | To Homelessness | Consequence |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Hospitals | 10%+ of homeless discharges | No follow-up care |
| Psychiatric facilities | 15%+ | Untreated illness, no housing |
| Jails/prisons | 10-15% | Criminal record barriers |
| Foster care | 20-25% within 4 years | No family support |

### Coordination Failures

- 400+ Continuums of Care with separate systems
- Fragmented funding streams (HUD, HHS, VA, FEMA)
- No unified data on homeless individuals
- Agencies compete rather than coordinate
- No single point of accountability

## Why High-Cost Cities Have More Homelessness

**The geographic puzzle**: Why does California have 28% of national homelessness with 12% of population?

**Evidence points to housing markets**:

| Factor | California | Texas | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|-------|----------------|
| Homelessness rate | 44/10,000 | 9/10,000 | 5x difference |
| Median rent | $2,000+ | $1,200 | Housing costs matter |
| Vacancy rate | 4% | 8% | Availability matters |
| Mental illness rate | 4.5% | 4.4% | Not explanatory |
| Poverty rate | 11% | 14% | Not explanatory |

**Research conclusions**:

- Per capita homelessness correlates with median rent at r=0.65+
- Correlates with vacancy rates inversely
- Does not correlate with mental illness, substance use, poverty rates

## The Feedback Loop

Homelessness is self-perpetuating:

1. **Housing loss** leads to shelter/street
2. **Trauma** of homelessness worsens mental health
3. **Survival stress** increases substance use
4. **Criminal system** involvement adds barriers
5. **Health deteriorates** from exposure, poor nutrition
6. **Employment** becomes harder (no address, no sleep)
7. **Records accumulate** (eviction, criminal, credit)
8. **Exit becomes harder** the longer it continues

**Breaking the cycle** requires intervention at multiple points, but housing is the essential foundation.
