## Responding to Homelessness in Your Community

### When You Encounter Someone Homeless

**Do**:

- Acknowledge them as a person
- Offer food, water, or money if you choose
- Provide information about local resources (carry 211 cards)
- Call 988 (not 911) if mental health crisis without danger
- Call 911 only if immediate safety threat

**Don't**:

- Assume they want to be there
- Lecture about choices
- Call police for non-emergency
- Make assumptions about substance use or mental illness
- Take photos without consent

### When a Shelter or Housing Is Proposed Nearby

**Counter-NIMBY talking points**:

| NIMBY Claim | Response |
|-------------|----------|
| "Property values will drop" | Research shows no impact from well-managed facilities |
| "Crime will increase" | PSH residents have lower crime rates than general population |
| "Not appropriate for this area" | Every neighborhood should share responsibility |
| "It will attract more homeless" | People become homeless where they lived; not drawn by services |
| "They should just get a job" | Most working-age homeless have worked; need stable address to work |

**Actions to take**:

- Attend public meetings; speak in support
- Organize supportive neighbors
- Write letters to decision-makers
- Counter misinformation on social media
- Connect with advocacy organizations for support

### Hosting Information Sessions

**How to organize**:

1. Invite local CoC representatives to present
2. Include someone with lived experience
3. Present local data and success stories
4. Have concrete action asks
5. Follow up with attendees

## Tracking Impact

## Common Questions

### "Why should I help when they won't help themselves?"

Most homeless people desperately want housing and actively seek it. The barriers they face (waiting lists, criminal records, lack of ID, mental illness) are systemic, not personal failures. Housing First evidence shows that providing housing enables people to address other issues.

### "Won't giving money enable addiction?"

Research does not support this. People make reasonable decisions about their needs. Cash gives dignity and flexibility. If concerned, give directly to organizations providing services, or give food/supplies.

### "Why are there so many homeless people if we spend so much?"

We do not spend enough on solutions that work (housing). Much spending goes to emergency response (shelters, hospitals, jails) that does not end homelessness. The gap between housing costs and low incomes has widened faster than investment.

### "What about people who refuse services?"

Very few people "refuse" services; they refuse inadequate or coercive services. Housing First engages resistant individuals by offering housing without preconditions. Even so, some people need longer engagement, which is why street outreach is important.
