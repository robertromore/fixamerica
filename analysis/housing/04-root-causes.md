# Housing: Root Causes

## Overview

America's housing crisis stems from interconnected structural, economic, political, and cultural factors that collectively suppress supply, drive up costs, perpetuate segregation, and leave millions without stable housing. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective solutions—addressing symptoms without tackling underlying causes will produce only temporary relief.

## Structural Causes

### Zoning and Land Use Regulation

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Single-family zoning** | 75% of residential land restricted to detached homes |
| **Density restrictions** | Caps on units per acre limit supply |
| **Height limits** | Prevent vertical development in high-demand areas |
| **Parking minimums** | Add $30,000-75,000 per unit in costs |
| **Setback requirements** | Reduce buildable area |
| **Lot size minimums** | Exclude smaller, affordable options |
| **Historic preservation** | Used to block any new construction |

### Fragmented Governance

| Problem | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Local control** | 19,000+ municipal governments with zoning authority |
| **Fiscal zoning** | Communities zone for tax base, not housing need |
| **Regional mismatch** | Housing markets are regional; governance is local |
| **NIMBY veto** | Small groups can block projects serving regional need |
| **State preemption gaps** | States rarely override local zoning |

### Development Process

| Barrier | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Permitting delays** | Average 2-5 years in high-cost metros |
| **Environmental review abuse** | CEQA/NEPA used to block housing |
| **Discretionary approval** | Political review of individual projects |
| **Lawsuit risk** | Neighbors can sue to delay/stop projects |
| **Infrastructure requirements** | Developers bear disproportionate costs |

### Housing Finance Structure

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **GSE dominance** | Fannie/Freddie shape market standards |
| **30-year mortgage** | Encourages homeownership over rental |
| **Tax code bias** | MID, capital gains exclusion favor owners |
| **Credit tightening** | Post-2008 restrictions limit access |
| **Down payment requirements** | Barrier for first-time buyers |

## Economic Causes

### Supply-Side Economics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Construction costs** | Labor +40%, materials +30% since 2019 |
| **Labor shortage** | 400,000+ construction worker deficit |
| **Land costs** | Artificially inflated by zoning scarcity |
| **Capital concentration** | Institutional investors dominate development |
| **Profit margins** | Builders focus on high-end for margins |

### Demand-Side Pressures

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Income inequality** | High earners bid up prices |
| **Wealth concentration** | Housing as investment vehicle |
| **Population growth** | Migration to high-cost metros |
| **Household formation** | Pent-up demand from millennials |
| **Remote work** | Expanded geographic demand |

### Investment and Speculation

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Investor purchases** | 15-25% of home sales |
| **Private equity** | Large-scale single-family rental |
| **Housing as asset class** | Appreciation > shelter function |
| **Foreign investment** | Capital parking in U.S. real estate |
| **Short-term rentals** | Airbnb removes housing from market |

### Labor Market Dynamics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Wage stagnation** | Income growth trails housing costs |
| **Job polarization** | Low-wage jobs don't support housing |
| **Benefits erosion** | Healthcare costs reduce housing budget |
| **Gig economy** | Unstable income, harder to qualify |
| **Geographic mismatch** | Jobs concentrate where housing is scarce |

## Political Causes

### Interest Group Politics

| Group | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Homeowners** | Vote, organize against density |
| **Realtors** | Lobby for homeownership policies |
| **Developers** | Mixed—want projects, not competition |
| **Landlords** | Oppose tenant protections |
| **Construction unions** | Support prevailing wage, limit labor supply |

### Electoral Incentives

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Homeowner voting** | 70%+ turnout vs. 40% for renters |
| **Local elections** | Low turnout, homeowner dominance |
| **Property tax reliance** | Officials protect home values |
| **NIMBY activism** | Vocal minority blocks projects |
| **Campaign finance** | Real estate industry contributions |

### Policy Failures

| Failure | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Tax expenditure imbalance** | $300B to homeowners, <$50B to renters |
| **Voucher underfunding** | Only 1 in 4 eligible households served |
| **Fair housing enforcement** | Weak, complaint-driven |
| **GSE conservatorship** | No reform since 2008 |
| **CRA weakening** | Reduced community investment |

### Federalism Dysfunction

| Problem | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Federal-state gap** | Federal funding, local control |
| **No national housing policy** | Fragmented, contradictory programs |
| **State passivity** | Most states defer to local zoning |
| **Court deference** | Zoning rarely challenged successfully |
| **Regional coordination** | Almost nonexistent |

---

## Cultural Causes

### Homeownership Ideology

| Belief | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **"American Dream"** | Homeownership as cultural imperative |
| **Wealth building** | Assumes appreciation, ignores costs |
| **Citizenship** | Owners seen as better citizens |
| **Stability** | Renting stigmatized as transient |
| **Success marker** | Social status tied to ownership |

### NIMBY Culture

| Factor | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Property rights framing** | Neighbors claim right to control area |
| **Fear of change** | Resistance to any neighborhood change |
| **Class/race anxiety** | Coded as "neighborhood character" |
| **Loss aversion** | Perceived losses > potential gains |
| **Individual vs. collective** | My property value > regional need |

### Racism and Segregation

| Mechanism | Current Form |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Historical legacy** | Redlining shaped current segregation |
| **Implicit bias** | Steering, differential treatment |
| **Exclusionary zoning** | Facially neutral, discriminatory effect |
| **School quality** | School segregation drives housing patterns |
| **Wealth gap** | Historical exclusion perpetuates inability to buy |

### Individualism and Markets

| Belief | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Housing as commodity** | Market should determine allocation |
| **Government skepticism** | Distrust of public housing, intervention |
| **Personal responsibility** | Homelessness as individual failure |
| **Deservingness** | Assistance only for "deserving" poor |
| **Local control** | Communities should decide own futures |

## Interconnections

### Reinforcing Cycles

Housing dysfunction involves multiple reinforcing feedback loops:

```text
Supply Restriction Cycle:
Zoning limits → Supply shortage → Prices rise → Homeowner gains →
Opposition to change → Zoning maintained → Shortage continues
```

```text
Segregation Perpetuation Cycle:
Historical exclusion → Wealth gap → Inability to buy in good areas →
Concentrated poverty → Disinvestment → Lower property values →
Less political power → Exclusion continues
```

```text
Affordability Spiral:
Low production → Price increases → Workers priced out →
Longer commutes → Sprawl → Infrastructure costs →
Higher taxes → Development fees → Lower production
```

### Cause Interactions

| Interaction | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Structural + Economic | Zoning scarcity raises land costs |
| Political + Cultural | NIMBY culture + homeowner voting = no reform |
| Economic + Cultural | Wealth building ideology drives speculation |
| Structural + Political | Local control enables exclusionary zoning |
| Cultural + Structural | Racism shapes zoning decisions |

### Why Problems Persist

| Reason | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Beneficiaries have power** | Homeowners vote, contribute, organize |
| **Harms are diffuse** | Priced-out people dispersed, unorganized |
| **Status quo bias** | Change is uncertain, current system known |
| **Complexity** | Many actors, no single solution |
| **Misaligned incentives** | Local costs, regional benefits |
| **Path dependence** | 100 years of policy embedded in landscape |

## Causal Hierarchy

### Primary Causes (Most Fundamental)

| Cause | Why Primary |
|-------|-------------|
| **Local zoning control** | Enables all other supply restrictions |
| **Homeowner political power** | Drives policy decisions |
| **Housing as investment** | Creates opposition to affordability |
| **Racial segregation legacy** | Shapes geography and policy |

### Secondary Causes (Derive from Primary)

| Cause | Derives From |
|-------|--------------|
| Supply shortage | Zoning + NIMBY |
| High costs | Shortage + investment demand |
| Segregation persistence | Legacy + exclusionary zoning |
| Homelessness | Cost burden + inadequate assistance |

### Tertiary Causes (Symptoms)

| Issue | Actually Caused By |
|-------|-------------------|
| Traffic/sprawl | Zoning restricts density where jobs are |
| Long commutes | Housing-job mismatch |
| School inequality | Residential segregation |
| Health disparities | Housing quality and stability |

---

## Why Market Alone Won't Solve It

| Market Failure | Explanation |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Inelastic supply** | Zoning prevents supply response to demand |
| **Externalities** | Housing decisions affect neighbors, region |
| **Public goods** | Stable housing benefits society broadly |
| **Information asymmetry** | Buyers/renters disadvantaged |
| **Market power** | Concentrated landlords, developers |
| **Merit good** | Society values housing beyond market allocation |
| **Discrimination** | Markets perpetuate historical exclusion |
