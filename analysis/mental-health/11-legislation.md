# Mental Health Policy: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative strategy for mental health reform proceeds on two parallel tracks: enforcing and strengthening existing federal law (primarily the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act) and enacting new legislation to address structural gaps that existing law does not cover (crisis system infrastructure, workforce expansion, Medicaid modernization, and youth mental health). This document presents draft federal legislation, state model legislation, a regulatory framework, and a comprehensive analysis of loopholes and shortcomings.

The approach is incremental by design. Mental health reform has historically failed not for lack of ambitious legislation but for lack of enforcement, funding, and sustained political commitment. The bills below are therefore structured to include mandatory appropriations, specific enforcement mechanisms, and sunset provisions that force Congressional reauthorization and review.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for the reforms proposed in this analysis.* The federal government has well-established authority to regulate health insurance under the Commerce Clause, to condition Medicaid funding under the Spending Clause, and to regulate telecommunications under the Commerce Clause. The primary legal challenges relate to ERISA preemption, Spending Clause conditions on states, and First Amendment limits on social media regulation -- all of which can be addressed within the existing constitutional framework.

## Federal Legislation

### The Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) by adding civil monetary penalties, a private right of action, mandatory insurer reporting, and dedicated enforcement staff.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Requires all group health plans and individual market issuers to submit annual comparative analyses demonstrating that non-quantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs) are applied no more stringently to mental health and substance use disorder (MH/SUD) benefits than to medical/surgical benefits
2. Authorizes the Department of Labor to impose civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 per violation per day for plans that fail to comply with parity requirements
3. Creates a private right of action allowing plan participants to sue for parity violations, with attorney's fees and injunctive relief
4. Mandates public disclosure of behavioral health denial rates, out-of-network utilization rates, and provider network adequacy metrics
5. Establishes a Parity Enforcement Office within the Department of Labor with a minimum of 200 dedicated compliance staff

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To strengthen enforcement of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici
Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 through
enhanced penalties, private enforcement rights, and mandatory
transparency requirements.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Mental Health Parity Enforcement
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity
and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA) requires group health
plans to cover mental health and substance use disorder benefits
at parity with medical and surgical benefits.

(2) According to the Milliman 2023 report, behavioral health
office visits are 5.4 times more likely to be rendered
out-of-network than medical/surgical office visits, indicating
persistent network inadequacy in violation of the Act.

(3) According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (2023),
prior authorization denial rates for mental health services are
approximately double those for medical/surgical services.

(4) Between 2010 and 2023, the Department of Labor issued fewer
than 50 formal parity enforcement actions, demonstrating that
existing enforcement mechanisms are inadequate.

(5) The treatment gap -- 52.8 percent of adults with any mental
illness do not receive treatment (SAMHSA, 2023) -- is driven in
significant part by insurer practices that violate the letter
and spirit of MHPAEA.

(6) Strengthened enforcement, including civil monetary penalties
and private enforcement rights, is necessary to achieve the
parity Congress intended when it enacted MHPAEA.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS.--The term "comparative analysis"
means a written analysis demonstrating, with respect to each
non-quantitative treatment limitation applied to mental health
and substance use disorder benefits, that such limitation is
comparable to, and applied no more stringently than, the
predominant non-quantitative treatment limitation applied to
substantially all medical and surgical benefits in the same
classification.

(2) NON-QUANTITATIVE TREATMENT LIMITATION.--The term
"non-quantitative treatment limitation" has the meaning given
such term in section 712(a)(3)(B) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1185a(a)(3)(B)).

(3) PLAN.--The term "plan" means a group health plan or a
health insurance issuer offering group or individual health
insurance coverage, as applicable.

(4) SECRETARY.--Unless otherwise specified, the term
"Secretary" means the Secretary of Labor, in coordination with
the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of
the Treasury.

SEC. 4. MANDATORY COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS SUBMISSION.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Not later than 1 year after the date of
enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, each plan
shall submit to the Secretary a comparative analysis with
respect to each non-quantitative treatment limitation applied
to mental health and substance use disorder benefits under
such plan.

    use disorder benefits and to medical and surgical benefits;
    (3) outcome data, including denial rates, appeal rates,
    and out-of-network utilization rates, for mental health
    and substance use disorder benefits compared to medical
    and surgical benefits;
    (4) a finding by the plan, supported by the data in
    paragraphs (2) and (3), that the limitation complies
    with the requirements of section 712 of the Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; and
    (5) the methodology and data sources used to reach the
    finding in paragraph (4).

    comparative analysis, the penalty shall be not more than
    $5,000 for each day during which the deficiency is not
    corrected.
    (3) PARITY VIOLATION.--For a substantive parity violation,
    the penalty shall be not more than $10,000 for each
    violation for each day during which such violation
    continues, with each affected participant or beneficiary
    constituting a separate violation.

(c) DUE PROCESS.--Before imposing a civil monetary penalty
under this section, the Secretary shall provide the plan with--
    (1) written notice of the alleged violation;
    (2) an opportunity to submit a corrective action plan
    within 90 days; and
    (3) a hearing before an administrative law judge if the
    plan contests the penalty.

SEC. 6. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

    (4) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after
the date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Comparative Analysis)**: This is the core enforcement mechanism. By requiring annual submissions with standardized data, DOL can systematically identify parity violations rather than relying on individual complaints. The 2023 MHPAEA proposed rules moved in this direction; this legislation codifies and strengthens the requirement.
- **Section 5 (Civil Monetary Penalties)**: The current MHPAEA lacks meaningful financial penalties for violations, which is why insurers can violate parity with impunity. Per-day, per-violation penalties of up to $10,000 create a financial incentive for compliance that does not currently exist.
- **Section 6 (Private Right of Action)**: Allowing individuals to sue for parity violations supplements government enforcement, which has proven insufficient. Attorney's fees provisions ensure that patients can find legal representation.
- **Section 8 (Parity Enforcement Office)**: Dedicating 200 staff to parity enforcement addresses the structural cause of enforcement failure: DOL has never had sufficient personnel to audit the nation's health plans for parity compliance.
- **Section 9 (Appropriations)**: $150-200 million annually is a fraction of the billions in avoided claims that insurers gain from parity violations. Civil monetary penalty revenue is expected to offset a significant portion of enforcement costs.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Secretary publishes standardized comparative analysis format | 180 days after enactment | DOL |
| Plans submit first comparative analyses | 1 year after enactment | Plans / DOL |
| Parity Enforcement Office fully staffed | 18 months after enactment | DOL |
| First public disclosure report published | 18 months after enactment | DOL |
| First civil monetary penalties imposed | 2 years after enactment | DOL |

**Regulatory Authority**: The Department of Labor, in coordination with HHS and Treasury, administers enforcement for employer-sponsored plans. HHS enforces for individual market plans. State insurance commissioners retain authority over state-regulated plans.

**Challenges**:

- **Insurance industry litigation**: Insurers will likely challenge civil monetary penalties and the private right of action in federal court. Strong legislative findings and clear Congressional intent are designed to withstand judicial review.
- **ERISA preemption**: The private right of action must be carefully structured to supplement, not conflict with, ERISA's existing remedies. The draft preserves ERISA's framework while adding remedies that ERISA currently lacks for parity violations.

**Refinements**:

- **Safe harbor provision**: Consider adding a safe harbor for plans that demonstrate good-faith compliance efforts even if their initial comparative analysis is deficient, to distinguish willful violators from plans making genuine efforts.
- **State coordination**: Formalize coordination between DOL and state insurance commissioners to avoid duplicative enforcement and share compliance data.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish a comprehensive national mental health crisis response
system and provide sustainable funding for crisis services.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Mental Health Crisis System Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline handled 5.7 million
contacts in 2023, a 58 percent increase from 2021 (SAMHSA, 2024).

(2) Only approximately 50 percent of the United States population
has access to a mobile crisis team response (NASMHPD, 2024).

(3) Crisis stabilization unit capacity is approximately one-third
of the level recommended by SAMHSA.

(4) An estimated 2 million people with serious mental illness are
booked into jails annually, many during mental health crises
(Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022).

(5) Emergency departments report psychiatric patients boarding for
an average of 24 or more hours while waiting for inpatient beds
(ACEP, 2023).

(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.--There are authorized
to be appropriated to carry out this section--
    (1) $1,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027
    through 2031.

(c) USE OF FUNDS.--Grant funds may be used for--
    (1) construction and operation of crisis stabilization
    units;
    (2) recruitment, training, and deployment of mobile
    crisis teams;
    (3) technology infrastructure for crisis call centers
    and dispatch systems;
    (4) data collection and reporting systems; and
    (5) training for crisis service personnel.

SEC. 5. MANDATORY MEDICAID CRISIS BENEFIT.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act
(42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)) is amended by adding the following:
    "(31) crisis services (as defined in section 3 of the
    Mental Health Crisis System Act of 2026), including
    crisis call center services, mobile crisis team services,
    and crisis stabilization services."

(b) ENHANCED MATCH.--Notwithstanding section 1905(b) of the
Social Security Act, the Federal medical assistance percentage
for crisis services described in subsection (a) shall be
85 percent for the first 5 fiscal years beginning after the
date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 6. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SURCHARGE.

(a) IN GENERAL.--The Federal Communications Commission shall,
not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this
Act, promulgate regulations establishing a monthly surcharge
of not less than $0.50 and not more than $1.00 on each
active telecommunications line, wireless subscription, and
voice-over-internet-protocol connection.

(b) CRISIS SERVICES FUND.--There is established in the
Treasury of the United States a fund, to be known as the
"Mental Health Crisis Services Fund," into which all
surcharge revenue collected under subsection (a) shall
be deposited.

(c) USE OF FUND.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available,
without further appropriation, for--
    (1) operation of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline;
    (2) grants to States for mobile crisis team operations;
    (3) operation and maintenance of crisis stabilization
    units; and
    (4) crisis system data infrastructure and reporting.

SEC. 7. NATIONAL STANDARDS.

(a) The Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance
Use shall, not later than 18 months after the date of
enactment of this Act, publish national standards for
crisis services, including--
    (1) staffing requirements for call centers, mobile
    crisis teams, and crisis stabilization units;
    (2) response time standards, including--
        (A) for urban areas, mobile crisis team arrival
        within 60 minutes of dispatch; and
        (B) for rural areas, mobile crisis team arrival
        within 90 minutes of dispatch, or telehealth-
        augmented response within 30 minutes;
    (3) training requirements for crisis service personnel;

shall submit to Congress a report on crisis system
implementation, performance, and recommendations.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Grants)**: $1 billion per year for 5 years provides the capital needed to build crisis infrastructure in every state. Georgia's model demonstrates that comprehensive crisis systems produce major diversions from emergency departments and jails.
- **Section 5 (Mandatory Medicaid Benefit)**: Making crisis services mandatory under Medicaid ensures sustainable operational funding beyond the initial infrastructure grants. The 85% enhanced FMAP for 5 years incentivizes rapid state adoption.
- **Section 6 (Telecom Surcharge)**: A dedicated, non-appropriations funding source modeled on existing 911 surcharges provides fiscal sustainability. At $0.50-$1.00 per line across approximately 400 million lines, this generates $2-4 billion annually -- sufficient to sustain 988 operations and mobile crisis teams.
- **Section 7 (National Standards)**: Response time standards (60 minutes urban, 90 minutes rural) establish measurable service expectations for the first time.

**Challenges**:

- **Telecom industry opposition**: Surcharge legislation faces lobbying from telecommunications companies. Counter-argument: the surcharge is comparable to existing 911 fees and is passed through to consumers.
- **State implementation variation**: Some states will adopt crisis systems faster than others. Enhanced FMAP and infrastructure grants incentivize participation.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Mental Health Workforce Act

**Purpose**: Expand the mental health workforce at the state level through scope-of-practice reform, licensure reciprocity, and reimbursement rate increases.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize licensure provisions based on existing scope-of-practice frameworks, Medicaid rate structures, and workforce distribution. States with existing full practice authority for nurse practitioners need only adopt the licensure reciprocity and rate provisions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State]
Mental Health Workforce Expansion Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(a) [State] has [X] designated Mental Health Professional
Shortage Areas, affecting [X] residents.

(b) The average wait time for a new psychiatric appointment
in [State] is [X] days.

(c) [X] percent of counties in [State] have no practicing
psychiatrist.

(d) Expanding the scope of practice for qualified mental
health professionals is necessary to address this shortage.

SECTION 3. FULL PRACTICE AUTHORITY FOR PSYCHIATRIC
NURSE PRACTITIONERS.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a
psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner who holds
a current license in [State] and has completed not fewer
than 2,000 hours of supervised clinical practice following
certification shall have authority to--
    (1) practice independently without a collaborative
    practice agreement with a physician;
    (2) prescribe, order, and administer medications,
    including controlled substances in Schedules II
    through V; and
    (3) admit, manage, and discharge patients from
    inpatient and outpatient settings.

SECTION 4. INTERSTATE LICENSURE RECIPROCITY.

(a) The [State licensing board] shall grant a license to
practice to any mental health professional who--
    (1) holds a current, unrestricted license in another
    State;
    (2) has no pending disciplinary actions; and
    (3) submits an application and pays applicable fees.

(b) Temporary practice permits shall be issued within 30
days of application for professionals meeting the criteria
in subsection (a).

SECTION 5. MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RATE INCREASE.

(a) Not later than 1 year after the effective date of
this Act, the [State Medicaid agency] shall increase
reimbursement rates for behavioral health services to
not less than 80 percent of the Medicare rate for
equivalent services.

(b) The [State Medicaid agency] shall report annually
to the Legislature on behavioral health reimbursement
rates compared to Medicare and medical/surgical
Medicaid rates.

SECTION 6. PEER SUPPORT SPECIALIST CERTIFICATION
AND COVERAGE.

(a) The [State] shall establish a certification program
for peer support specialists in mental health and
substance use recovery.

(b) Peer support specialist services shall be covered
under the State Medicaid program when provided by a
certified peer support specialist under the supervision
of a licensed behavioral health professional.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect [X] days after enactment.
```

### Model State 988 Crisis System Funding Act

**Purpose**: Establish a dedicated, sustainable state-level funding mechanism for 988 crisis services through a telecom surcharge.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State]
988 Crisis Services Funding Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SURCHARGE.

(a) There is hereby imposed a monthly surcharge of [$0.50
to $1.00] on each active telecommunications line, wireless
subscription, and voice-over-internet-protocol connection
with a billing address in [State].

(b) The surcharge shall be collected by telecommunications
providers and remitted to the [State] Treasurer monthly.

SECTION 3. CRISIS SERVICES FUND.

(a) There is established a [State] Mental Health Crisis
Services Fund.

(b) All surcharge revenue collected under Section 2 shall
be deposited in the Fund.

(c) Funds shall be used exclusively for--
    (1) operation of 988 call centers serving [State];
    (2) mobile crisis team deployment and operations;
    (3) crisis stabilization unit operations; and
    (4) crisis services data collection and reporting.

(d) No funds deposited in the Fund shall be diverted to
the State general fund or used for any purpose not
specified in subsection (c).

SECTION 4. REPORTING.

The [State mental health authority] shall report annually
to the Legislature on Fund revenue, expenditures, and
crisis system performance metrics including call answer
rates, mobile team response times, and diversion rates.

SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

**Adaptability Notes**: Colorado enacted a similar telecom surcharge in 2022, generating approximately $30 million annually for crisis services. States should calibrate the surcharge amount based on population, existing crisis capacity, and projected infrastructure needs. Anti-diversion language in Section 3(d) is essential to prevent legislatures from raiding the fund during budget shortfalls.

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agencies**:

- **Department of Labor (DOL)**: Enforcement of MHPAEA in employer-sponsored ERISA plans through the Parity Enforcement Office.
- **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / CMS**: Enforcement of MHPAEA in individual market plans; administration of Medicaid crisis benefit; CCBHC program; crisis system grants.
- **HHS / SAMHSA**: Administration of crisis system infrastructure grants; national standards development; performance dashboard.
- **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)**: Telecom surcharge implementation and collection.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **DOL Parity Comparative Analysis Standards**: Standardized format, data requirements, and evaluation criteria for annual insurer comparative analyses. Statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment of the Parity Enforcement Act.
2. **CMS Medicaid Crisis Benefit Rule**: State plan amendment requirements, covered services definitions, provider qualifications, and enhanced FMAP implementation. Statutory deadline: 1 year after enactment of the Crisis System Act.
3. **SAMHSA National Crisis Standards**: Staffing, response times, training, outcomes reporting, and quality standards for crisis services. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment.
4. **FCC Telecom Surcharge Regulations**: Collection methodology, remittance schedule, and enforcement for telecommunications providers. Statutory deadline: 1 year after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: DOL civil monetary penalties for parity violations (up to $10,000/day/violation). CMS penalties for Medicaid non-compliance. FCC penalties for surcharge collection failures.
- **Administrative Actions**: DOL compliance audits and corrective action orders. CMS withholding of Medicaid funding for non-compliant states. SAMHSA grant conditions and performance benchmarks.
- **Private Right of Action**: Individuals may sue for parity violations with attorney's fees. No private right of action for crisis system standards (enforcement through CMS and SAMHSA).
- **State Coordination**: DOL and HHS coordinate with state insurance commissioners and state mental health agencies on enforcement in state-regulated plans and Medicaid programs.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Federal regulation of health insurance under MHPAEA is well-established under the Commerce Clause, upheld implicitly through decades of ERISA and ACA litigation. The telecom surcharge is authorized under the Commerce Clause power over interstate telecommunications, consistent with existing 911 surcharge authority.

**Spending Clause (Medicaid Conditions)**: Making crisis services a mandatory Medicaid benefit constitutes a condition on federal Medicaid funding. Under *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), new Medicaid conditions must not be so coercive as to effectively compel state participation. The enhanced FMAP (85% federal match) and the limited scope of the new benefit (crisis services only) are designed to satisfy the *NFIB* standard by providing generous federal support and imposing a manageable burden.

**First Amendment (Social Media Regulation)**: Social media platform regulation for youth mental health raises First Amendment questions. Regulation targeting design features (infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications) rather than speech content is more likely to survive judicial review as regulation of commercial conduct. Age verification requirements are analogous to longstanding age-verification laws for alcohol, tobacco, and other products. The Supreme Court's ruling in *Packingham v. North Carolina*, 582 U.S. 98 (2017), affirmed the importance of internet access but did not foreclose regulation of commercial design features that harm minors.

### Preemption

**ERISA Preemption**: ERISA broadly preempts state laws that "relate to" employee benefit plans (29 U.S.C. 1144(a)), but includes a savings clause preserving state insurance regulation. The Parity Enforcement Act operates within ERISA's framework, adding remedies to the existing federal scheme rather than creating conflicting state obligations. The private right of action is structured as a federal cause of action under ERISA, not a state law claim.

**Medicaid Preemption**: Federal Medicaid requirements preempt conflicting state Medicaid provisions. States that do not amend their state plans to include crisis services would face withholding of federal Medicaid matching funds for behavioral health services.

### Enforcement and Compliance

**Parity Enforcement**: The layered enforcement structure -- DOL administrative enforcement, state insurance commissioner enforcement, and private right of action -- is designed to close the enforcement gap that has plagued MHPAEA since enactment. Civil monetary penalties create financial consequences for non-compliance that did not previously exist.

**Crisis System Compliance**: States receiving infrastructure grants must meet national standards within 3 years. States failing to meet Medicaid crisis benefit requirements face progressive withholding of enhanced FMAP funding.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Comparative analysis gaming | Plans submit superficially compliant analyses that use methodologies designed to obscure disparities, such as choosing favorable comparison categories | High | Require DOL to define specific methodological standards; mandate use of independent actuaries for analyses above a plan size threshold |
| Penalty absorption as cost of doing business | Large insurers absorb $10,000/day penalties as a business expense rather than changing practices, particularly when parity violations save more than the penalties cost | Medium | Add escalating penalty structure: penalties double for repeat violations within 3 years; authorize DOL to seek injunctive relief in federal court for persistent violators |
| Network adequacy loophole | Plans meet parity requirements on paper by listing providers in their directories who are not actually accepting new patients (ghost networks) | High | Require plans to verify provider availability quarterly; mandate secret-shopper audits; impose penalties for directory inaccuracy exceeding 15% |
| Telecom surcharge diversion | State legislatures redirect crisis fund revenue to general fund during budget shortfalls (common with 911 surcharge funds) | Medium | Federal legislation requires state anti-diversion provisions as a condition of receiving federal crisis grants; model state legislation includes anti-diversion language |
| Crisis service quality dilution | States meet mobile crisis team standards on paper by deploying undertrained or insufficient teams that arrive within time limits but lack clinical capacity | Medium | SAMHSA national standards include minimum staffing qualifications (licensed clinician required on each team); annual quality audits as condition of continued grant funding |
| Scope-of-practice workaround | Physician specialty groups lobby state legislatures to weaken or repeal scope-of-practice reform after initial passage | Medium | Federal incentive grants condition funding on maintenance of effort -- states that repeal scope-of-practice reforms lose federal workforce incentive funding |
| IMD exclusion replacement | If IMD exclusion is reformed, states could shift patients to large institutional settings, reversing deinstitutionalization progress | High | IMD reform legislation includes 60-day maximum stay, quality standards, discharge planning requirements, and community services maintenance-of-effort provisions |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Discretionary vs. mandatory appropriations for workforce programs | Workforce funding vulnerable to annual appropriations cuts; historically, mental health programs lose funding in budget fights | Political difficulty of mandatory spending in current fiscal environment | Structure workforce programs with mandatory appropriations; build bipartisan support through economic ROI arguments; tie reauthorization to measurable workforce metrics |
| State variation in crisis system adoption | Some states will adopt crisis systems slower than others, creating geographic disparities in access | Federalism and state resistance to federal mandates | Enhanced FMAP (85%) for 5 years incentivizes early adoption; performance dashboard publicly shames laggards; direct federal grants to community organizations in non-participating states |
| Workforce pipeline lead time | GME expansion produces new psychiatrists in 7-10 years; the crisis is immediate | Structural training pipeline constraints | Multi-track strategy: immediate scope-of-practice reform and telehealth expansion; medium-term Service Corps recruitment; long-term GME expansion |
| Private right of action volume | Large volume of parity lawsuits could burden federal courts and create inconsistent rulings | Inevitable consequence of decades of unenforced parity violations | DOL administrative enforcement as primary mechanism; private right of action as supplement; Congressional direction to Judicial Conference on case management |
| Social media regulation enforceability | Age verification technology is imperfect; minors may circumvent restrictions | Technical limitations of age verification | Liability on platforms (not users) for failure to implement commercially reasonable verification; FTC safe harbor for platforms using approved verification technologies |
| Rural crisis response feasibility | 90-minute mobile crisis team response times may be unachievable in remote rural areas | Geography and population density | Telehealth-augmented crisis response as alternative in areas where in-person response within 90 minutes is not feasible; satellite crisis stabilization units in regional centers |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-gaming amendments for comparative analysis**: Within 2 years of enactment, DOL shall publish specific actuarial methodological standards for comparative analyses, developed in consultation with the American Academy of Actuaries, and require plans above 50,000 participants to use independent actuaries certified by DOL.

2. **Escalating penalty structure**: Amend Section 5 of the Parity Enforcement Act to provide that civil monetary penalties shall be doubled for any plan found to have committed a parity violation within 3 years of a previous violation, and tripled for a third violation within 5 years.

3. **Ghost network enforcement**: Add a network accuracy provision requiring plans to verify that at least 85% of listed behavioral health providers are accepting new patients. DOL shall conduct secret-shopper audits of the 50 largest plans annually. Plans with directory inaccuracy exceeding 15% shall be subject to immediate corrective action and civil monetary penalties.

4. **Anti-diversion provisions for crisis funds**: Condition federal crisis infrastructure grants on states enacting anti-diversion legislation that prohibits transfer of crisis fund revenue to state general funds. States that divert funds shall be required to repay diverted amounts from state general funds within 2 fiscal years.

5. **IMD reform safeguards**: Any legislation reforming the IMD exclusion shall include: (a) a 60-day maximum length of stay for Medicaid-funded IMD admissions; (b) mandatory discharge planning beginning at admission; (c) community services maintenance-of-effort requirements preventing states from reducing community mental health funding after IMD reform; and (d) annual reporting on institutional vs. community service utilization.

6. **Sunset and reauthorization**: The Parity Enforcement Act and Crisis System Act shall be subject to reauthorization after 5 years, with reauthorization conditional on GAO evaluation of enforcement effectiveness and crisis system performance against national standards.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

Both major federal bills include 5-year authorization periods requiring Congressional reauthorization. Before reauthorization:

- GAO conducts a comprehensive evaluation of parity enforcement outcomes (denial rate changes, network adequacy improvements, enforcement action effectiveness)
- SAMHSA evaluates crisis system performance against national standards (response times, diversion rates, access coverage)
- The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducts an independent evaluation of overall mental health system performance changes

These evaluations inform reauthorization decisions and legislative refinements.
