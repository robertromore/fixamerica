# Peer Support Services: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current challenges facing peer support services in the United States are not the result of a single failure but of several long-term, interlocking trends. Despite bipartisan support, growing evidence, and increasing demand, peer support remains marginalized within the behavioral health system. The root causes include the dominance of the medical model, inadequate financing structures, professional guild protectionism, stigma against people with psychiatric histories, and the failure to invest in workforce infrastructure. These factors reinforce one another, creating a system that simultaneously expands peer roles while denying peer workers the wages, respect, and structural support necessary to sustain those roles.

## Medical Model Dominance

### The Hierarchy of Expertise

The American behavioral health system is built on a medical model that privileges credentialed expertise over experiential knowledge. Psychiatrists sit at the top of the authority hierarchy, followed by psychologists, social workers, and licensed counselors. Peer specialists -- whose primary qualification is personal experience with the conditions they address -- occupy the bottom rung. This hierarchy is not merely symbolic; it determines reimbursement rates, scope of practice authority, hiring decisions, and organizational culture.

**Evidence**: Peer specialists earn a median wage of $17.65/hour compared to $28.63 for substance abuse counselors and $42.95 for clinical social workers (BLS, 2023). Reimbursement rates for peer services are typically 30-50% lower than rates for equivalent services delivered by licensed professionals, even when outcomes are comparable.

### Diagnostic Gatekeeping

The medical model requires that services be tied to clinical diagnoses and medical necessity criteria. Peer support, which is fundamentally relational and recovery-oriented rather than symptom-focused, fits awkwardly within this framework. Medicaid billing for peer services often requires documentation of clinical symptoms, treatment plans signed by licensed clinicians, and measurable clinical outcomes -- all of which impose a clinical lens on a non-clinical intervention.

**Evidence**: A 2022 survey of peer specialists found that 67% reported spending more than 25% of their time on documentation required for billing purposes, time that could otherwise be spent providing direct support (National Association of Peer Supporters, 2022).

## Financing and Reimbursement Failures

### The Medicaid Patchwork

While CMS authorized Medicaid billing for peer services in 2007, the letter left implementation entirely to states. The result is a patchwork of 46 different billing structures with wildly different rates ($8.50 to $72.00 per 15-minute unit), covered service types, documentation requirements, and supervision mandates. Four states still do not bill Medicaid for peer services at all.

**Evidence**: A 2023 analysis by C4 Innovations found that Medicaid reimbursement rates in 14 states were insufficient to cover the fully loaded cost of employing a peer specialist (wages, benefits, supervision, training, and administrative overhead), meaning that organizations providing peer services in these states operate at a financial loss.

### Private Insurance Exclusion

Medicare covers peer services only for opioid use disorder treatment (under the SUPPORT Act, 2018), and most private insurers do not cover peer services at all. This means that working-age adults with private insurance -- and Medicare beneficiaries without opioid use disorders -- cannot access reimbursable peer support, limiting the market and the financial sustainability of peer service organizations.

**Evidence**: Fewer than 10% of commercial insurance plans include peer support services as a covered benefit (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023).

### Grant Dependence and Funding Instability

Peer-run organizations -- including peer respite programs, warmlines, and drop-in centers -- operate primarily on grants and state appropriations rather than insurance reimbursement. These funding sources are inherently unstable, subject to annual appropriations cycles and political priorities. The result is chronic organizational instability that undermines staff retention, program development, and long-term planning.

**Evidence**: SAMHSA peer support grants totaled $29 million in FY2024 -- a fraction of the $6.5 billion SAMHSA total budget. Peer-run organizations report an average operating budget of under $500,000, with 60% dependent on a single funding source (National Empowerment Center, 2023).

## Professional Guild Protectionism

### Scope of Practice Turf Wars

Licensed professional organizations -- including the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), American Psychological Association (APA), and American Counseling Association (ACA) -- have at times opposed the expansion of peer support services on the grounds that peers may perform activities that constitute unlicensed practice of counseling, therapy, or case management. These concerns are not entirely without merit, but they also reflect economic interests: expanding the peer workforce creates competition for limited behavioral health funding.

**Evidence**: In at least 6 states between 2018 and 2024, proposals to expand peer scope of practice or create new peer billing codes were opposed by licensed professional associations during legislative or regulatory proceedings (C4 Innovations legislative tracker, 2024).

### Supervision as Control

CMS requires that peer services be supervised by a "competent mental health professional," but it does not specify who qualifies or what supervision should look like. In practice, many states require supervision by a licensed clinician -- a social worker, psychologist, or counselor. This requirement, while intended to ensure quality, can function as a mechanism of professional control, placing peer workers under the authority of professionals who may not understand or value the peer role.

**Evidence**: In a 2022 survey, 41% of peer specialists reported that their supervisors had no training in peer support competencies or values, and 28% reported being asked by supervisors to perform tasks outside the peer role (e.g., clinical assessments or medication management) (Peer Workforce Survey, 2022).

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Licensed professional guilds (NASW, APA, ACA) | Maintain monopoly on billable behavioral health services | $280+ billion behavioral health market | Expanding peer billing codes reduces licensed professionals' market share |
| Managed care organizations (MCOs) | Lower reimbursement rates for peer services increase margins | Varies by state | Higher peer rates reduce profit; current low rates transfer savings to MCOs, not peer workers |
| Hospital systems | Peer respite diversion reduces inpatient admissions revenue | $2,264/day average inpatient rate | Each peer respite diversion is a lost admission; hospital opposition to peer alternatives |
| Training and certification vendors | Fragmented state systems create captive markets | $100-500 per certification trainee | National standards would reduce vendor monopolies in individual states |
| States with minimal infrastructure | Low investment preserves budget flexibility | Varies | Building comprehensive peer systems requires upfront investment |

### Perverse Incentives

The current financing structure creates several perverse incentives that undermine peer support effectiveness:

1. **Low Medicaid rates incentivize low wages**: Organizations receiving Medicaid rates of $10-15 per unit cannot afford to pay peer specialists living wages while covering overhead. The low rates perpetuate the low-wage workforce.

2. **Fee-for-service billing incentivizes volume over relationship**: Peer support is inherently relational and not easily quantified in 15-minute billable increments. Fee-for-service models push peer workers toward brief, documentable encounters rather than the sustained, flexible relationships that drive outcomes.

3. **Medical necessity requirements exclude prevention**: Medicaid's medical necessity standard means peer services are typically available only after someone has a diagnosed condition, excluding the preventive and early-intervention peer support that could reduce downstream costs.

4. **Criminal background exclusions shrink the talent pool**: Many state certification programs exclude individuals with certain criminal convictions -- precisely the population whose lived experience with both behavioral health conditions and the justice system makes them most effective as forensic peer specialists.

## Stigma and Institutional Culture

### The "Not Real Workers" Problem

Despite decades of progress, peer specialists continue to face workplace stigma. Clinical colleagues may view them as "not real" professionals, question their qualifications, or exclude them from clinical discussions and treatment planning. This stigma is compounded when peers disclose their own mental health or substance use histories in workplace settings, exposing them to judgment from colleagues who do not share the peer support value of mutual disclosure.

**Evidence**: A 2021 study in *Psychiatric Services* found that 52% of peer specialists reported experiencing stigma from clinical colleagues at least monthly, and 34% reported being excluded from team meetings where their service recipients' care was discussed (Vandewalle et al., 2021).

### Internalized Stigma and Self-Doubt

Peer specialists may internalize the medical model hierarchy, doubting their own competence or deferring unnecessarily to clinical authority. Organizations that do not actively cultivate peer identity and values may inadvertently reinforce this internalized stigma.

## Research and Evidence Gaps

### Underfunded Research

The evidence base for peer support, while growing, remains thinner than for most clinical interventions -- not because peer support is less effective, but because it receives far less research funding. NIH spending on peer support research totaled approximately $12 million in FY2023, compared to over $300 million for psychotherapy research (NIH RePORTER, 2024). This funding disparity makes it difficult to produce the large-scale randomized controlled trials that payers and policymakers demand before expanding coverage.

**Evidence**: A 2023 systematic review identified only 18 randomized controlled trials of mental health peer support services published in English, compared to over 500 RCTs for cognitive behavioral therapy (Cochrane Database, 2023).

### Methodological Challenges

Peer support is difficult to study using traditional clinical trial methods. The active ingredient is the relationship itself, which cannot be standardized or blinded. Outcomes that matter most to peer support recipients -- empowerment, hope, social connection, self-determination -- are difficult to measure with standard clinical instruments designed to detect symptom reduction.

## Why Reform Has Failed

Past efforts to strengthen peer support have achieved partial successes but have not overcome the fundamental structural barriers:

1. **CMS 2007 letter was permissive, not mandatory**: By authorizing rather than requiring Medicaid coverage of peer services, CMS left implementation to states, producing a patchwork system. States with the greatest need often had the least capacity to build peer infrastructure.

2. **SUPPORT Act was condition-specific**: The 2018 law's Medicare peer support provision applied only to opioid use disorder, failing to establish the principle that peer support is valuable across all behavioral health conditions.

3. **CCBHC mandates lack enforcement teeth**: While CCBHCs must provide peer services, the quality and integration of those services varies widely, and enforcement mechanisms focus on structural compliance rather than meaningful peer integration.

4. **Certification standardization efforts have stalled**: Multiple attempts to establish national peer specialist certification standards -- including efforts by SAMHSA, IC&RC, and the National Association of Peer Supporters -- have been blocked by states protecting their regulatory autonomy and by certification vendors protecting their markets.

5. **Advocacy organizations are under-resourced**: The peer support advocacy community -- organizations like the National Association of Peer Supporters, National Empowerment Center, and Copeland Center -- operates on budgets that are a fraction of those commanded by licensed professional guilds, limiting their capacity to influence policy at the state and federal levels.
