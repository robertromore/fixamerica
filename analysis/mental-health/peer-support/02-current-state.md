# Peer Support Services: Current State

## The Peer Workforce

The peer support workforce has expanded significantly since CMS authorized Medicaid reimbursement in 2007, but precise national counts remain elusive because the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does not track peer specialists as a distinct occupational category. The closest BLS classification -- community health workers (SOC 21-1094) -- encompasses a broader range of roles. Estimates from SAMHSA, workforce surveys, and state certification registries suggest the United States employs 30,000 to 35,000 individuals in designated peer support roles as of 2023.

### Workforce Demographics

| Characteristic | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Estimated total peer specialists (U.S.) | 30,000-35,000 | SAMHSA/Peers for Progress, 2023 |
| Female | 62% | National peer workforce survey, 2022 |
| Male | 35% | National peer workforce survey, 2022 |
| Non-binary/other gender identity | 3% | National peer workforce survey, 2022 |
| White (non-Hispanic) | 58% | National peer workforce survey, 2022 |
| Black/African American | 24% | National peer workforce survey, 2022 |
| Hispanic/Latino | 11% | National peer workforce survey, 2022 |
| Other race/ethnicity | 7% | National peer workforce survey, 2022 |
| Hold bachelor's degree or higher | 38% | National peer workforce survey, 2022 |
| Report criminal justice history | 29% | National peer workforce survey, 2022 |

### Wages and Employment

Peer specialists are among the lowest-paid workers in the behavioral health system, a fact that drives persistent turnover and recruitment challenges.

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Median hourly wage | $17.65 | Stable (adjusted for inflation: declining) | BLS SOC 21-1094, 2023 |
| Median annual salary | $36,712 | Stable | BLS SOC 21-1094, 2023 |
| 10th percentile hourly wage | $12.88 | Stable | BLS SOC 21-1094, 2023 |
| 90th percentile hourly wage | $28.19 | Stable | BLS SOC 21-1094, 2023 |
| Annual turnover rate | 30-50% | Stable/Worsening | Peer workforce surveys, 2022 |
| Part-time employment rate | 35% | Increasing | State workforce reports, 2023 |
| Employer-provided health insurance | 52% | Stable | National peer workforce survey, 2022 |

The wage gap between peer specialists and other behavioral health professionals is significant:

| Role | Median Annual Salary | Salary Ratio to Peer Specialist |
|---|---|---|
| Peer specialist | $36,712 | 1.0x |
| Substance abuse counselor | $49,710 | 1.35x |
| Social worker (BSW) | $55,350 | 1.51x |
| Licensed clinical social worker | $62,940 | 1.71x |
| Psychologist | $85,330 | 2.32x |
| Psychiatrist | $247,350 | 6.74x |

## Medicaid Billing and Reimbursement

### Federal Framework

CMS authorized Medicaid reimbursement for peer support services through State Medicaid Director Letter #07-011 (August 15, 2007). The letter established that peer support qualifies as a Medicaid-billable service when:

1. **Services are provided by peers**: Workers must have lived experience with mental health or substance use conditions
2. **Supervision is maintained**: A competent mental health professional must provide oversight
3. **State certification exists**: Providers must be certified through a state-recognized program
4. **Services are recovery-oriented**: Must be individualized and promote self-determination

### State Medicaid Coverage

| Coverage Status | Number of States | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| Medicaid billing approved | 46 | Increasing |
| State Plan Amendment filed | 43 | Increasing |
| 1915(i) Home and Community-Based waiver | 8 | Stable |
| 1115 Demonstration waiver | 6 | Increasing |
| No Medicaid billing for peer services | 4 | Decreasing |

### Reimbursement Rates

Medicaid reimbursement rates for peer support services vary dramatically across states:

| Rate Category | States | Rate Range (per 15-minute unit) | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| Below $15/unit | 8 | $8.50-$14.99 | Mississippi ($9.25), Alabama ($11.00) |
| $15-$25/unit | 18 | $15.00-$25.00 | Ohio ($18.75), Virginia ($20.50) |
| $25-$40/unit | 14 | $25.01-$40.00 | California ($32.00), New York ($35.50) |
| Above $40/unit | 6 | $40.01-$72.00 | Connecticut ($48.00), Massachusetts ($55.00) |

### Billing Challenges

Common barriers to effective Medicaid billing for peer services:

| Challenge | Prevalence | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Medical necessity documentation burden | High (38 states) | Reduces time available for direct service delivery |
| Service duration limits (per day/month) | Moderate (22 states) | Caps the intensity of support during crises |
| Exclusion of telephonic/text-based services | Declining (14 states still exclude) | Limits reach, especially in rural areas |
| Group service billing restrictions | Moderate (19 states) | Cannot bill for peer-led group activities |
| Requirement for co-signature by licensed clinician | Moderate (16 states) | Creates bottleneck and reinforces hierarchy |

## Peer-Run Organizations and Services

### Types of Peer-Run Services

| Service Type | Estimated Number | Description |

## Recent Trends

### Growth and Expansion (2018-2024)

- **Rapid state adoption**: 8 additional states approved Medicaid billing for peer services between 2018 and 2024
- **COVID-19 acceleration**: The pandemic expanded telehealth peer services, with 32 states adding telephonic/video peer support billing (2020-2022)
- **988 Lifeline integration**: The 2022 launch of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline created new roles for peers in crisis follow-up and mobile response teams
- **Veterans Affairs expansion**: VA peer specialist positions grew from 800 to over 1,200 between 2018 and 2024
- **CCBHC growth**: Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs), mandated to provide peer support, expanded from 10 demonstration states to over 500 clinics in 46 states by 2024

### Key Indicators

| Indicator | Current Value | 5-Year Trend | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| States with peer certification | 49 + D.C. | Up from 45 (2019) | Only Wyoming lacks formal program |
| States billing Medicaid for peers | 46 | Up from 38 (2019) | 4 states still without |
| VA peer specialist positions | 1,200+ | Up from 800 (2019) | Continued hiring post-PACT Act |
| CCBHC clinics providing peer services | 500+ | Up from 67 (2019) | Rapid expansion with federal funding |

| Peer workforce turnover | 30-50% | Stable/Worsening | Primary concern for sustainability |

## Emerging Challenges

### Workforce Sustainability Crisis

The behavioral health field faces a broader workforce shortage, and the peer support segment is particularly vulnerable. Low wages, limited benefits, and emotional toll create a revolving door that undermines service quality and continuity of care. The gap between peer wages and entry-level clinical positions continues to widen.

### Scope of Practice Conflicts

As peer roles expand into crisis services (988 response teams), primary care integration, and emergency department settings, conflicts with licensed professional scope-of-practice boundaries are intensifying. Several state licensing boards have raised concerns about peers performing activities that resemble counseling or case management.

### Technology and Telehealth Integration

While COVID-19 accelerated telehealth peer services, the digital divide creates access barriers for the populations most in need of peer support -- individuals experiencing homelessness, those in rural areas, and older adults with limited technology literacy.

### Certification Portability

Peer specialists who relocate face the burden of re-certification under different state requirements. The lack of reciprocity agreements or a national certification standard creates barriers to workforce mobility and limits the field's ability to address geographic shortages through interstate recruitment.

### Research Funding Gap

Despite growing adoption, federal research funding specifically for peer support services remains minimal. NIH spending on peer support research totaled approximately $12 million in FY2023, compared to over $300 million for psychotherapy research -- a ratio that does not reflect peer support's growing role in the behavioral health system.
