# Peer Support Services: Overview

## Overview

Peer support services represent a paradigm shift in behavioral health care delivery, centering the expertise of individuals with personal lived experience of mental health conditions, substance use disorders, or co-occurring disorders. Certified peer specialists, recovery coaches, and peer navigators use their own recovery journeys to provide emotional support, share knowledge, model self-advocacy, and help others navigate complex systems of care. Unlike clinical interventions, peer support operates through mutuality, shared experience, and the demonstration that recovery is possible -- a form of evidence that no textbook or credential can replicate.

The United States now employs an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 peer support workers across behavioral health settings, a figure that has grown rapidly since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued its 2007 letter authorizing Medicaid reimbursement for peer support services. As of 2024, 49 states and the District of Columbia have established peer specialist certification programs, and 46 states have approved Medicaid billing codes for peer-delivered services. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has identified peer support as an evidence-based practice and a core element of recovery-oriented systems of care.

Yet the promise of peer support remains substantially unfulfilled. The peer workforce suffers from annual turnover rates of 30-50%, driven by wages that average $17.65 per hour nationally, limited career advancement, and organizational cultures that too often treat peer workers as subordinate to clinical staff. Medicaid reimbursement rates vary wildly across states -- from under $15 per unit in some states to over $70 in others -- and many private insurers do not cover peer services at all. Peer-run organizations, which embody the most autonomous model of peer support, operate on shoestring budgets and remain excluded from most insurance billing structures.

The peer support field also faces a fundamental tension between professionalization and authenticity. As states impose increasingly stringent certification requirements -- some demanding 75 or more hours of training, background checks, and continuing education -- the field risks excluding the very individuals whose marginalized experiences make them most effective: people with criminal justice involvement, people in early recovery, and people from communities of color disproportionately affected by the mental health system's failures. Balancing quality standards with accessibility to the workforce is perhaps the defining challenge of the next decade.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of peer support services in the United States:

- **Certified Peer Specialists**: Training, certification standards, scope of practice, and workforce demographics across states
- **Medicaid and Insurance Reimbursement**: CMS guidelines, state plan amendments, billing codes, reimbursement rates, and private payer coverage
- **Peer-Run Organizations and Services**: Peer respite centers, warmlines, drop-in centers, peer-run crisis alternatives, and Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) programs
- **Workforce Development and Sustainability**: Wages, turnover, career ladders, supervision models, and integration into multidisciplinary teams
- **Evidence Base and Research**: Randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, SAMHSA toolkit findings, and research gaps
- **Equity and Access**: Racial disparities in the peer workforce, cultural responsiveness, rural access, and the impact of criminal background exclusions

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Professionalization vs. Accessibility**: Increasing certification requirements improve quality assurance but risk excluding individuals whose lived experience with incarceration, homelessness, or marginalization makes them most effective as peers. Higher bars to entry disproportionately affect people of color and those with limited formal education.

- **Clinical Integration vs. Autonomy**: Embedding peer workers in clinical teams improves coordination and sustainability but risks co-opting peer roles into quasi-clinical functions, undermining the non-hierarchical, mutual relationship that defines effective peer support.

- **Medicaid Reimbursement vs. Service Flexibility**: Billing through Medicaid provides sustainable funding but imposes documentation requirements, time-limited service models, and medical necessity criteria that conflict with the open-ended, relationship-based nature of peer support.

- **Evidence Standards vs. Innovation**: Demanding randomized controlled trial evidence before scaling peer services holds them to a higher standard than many established clinical practices, while the relational and contextual nature of peer support makes it inherently difficult to study with traditional methods.

- **State Variation vs. National Standards**: Allowing state-level experimentation has produced innovation but also created a patchwork system where certification, scope of practice, reimbursement, and quality vary dramatically, hindering workforce mobility and program consistency.

## Key Questions

1. How can peer support certification standards ensure quality without excluding the individuals whose lived experience makes them uniquely effective?
2. What reimbursement and financing models can sustain peer services without forcing them into the medical model frameworks they were designed to complement?
3. How should scope of practice be defined to protect both peer workers and the people they serve while preserving the distinctiveness of the peer role?
4. What evidence standards are appropriate for evaluating a service model rooted in shared experience, relationship, and mutuality rather than standardized clinical protocols?

## Vision of Success

A successful peer support system in the 21st century would feature:

- **Universal Coverage and Access**: Peer support services available and reimbursable in every state, through Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, and Veterans Health Administration, with no geographic or demographic gaps in access.
- **Living Wages and Career Pathways**: Peer specialists earning a median wage of at least $25 per hour, with clear career ladders into supervisory, training, and leadership roles, reducing annual turnover to below 15%.
- **Equitable Workforce**: A peer workforce that reflects the racial, ethnic, linguistic, and socioeconomic diversity of the populations it serves, with certification pathways accessible to people with criminal justice histories and limited formal education.
- **Integrated but Distinct**: Peer workers fully integrated into multidisciplinary behavioral health teams as valued members with a clearly defined, protected scope of practice that preserves the non-clinical, mutual nature of the peer relationship.
- **Robust Evidence Base**: A sustained federal research investment producing rigorous evidence on peer support effectiveness across populations, settings, and service models, with findings driving continuous improvement.
