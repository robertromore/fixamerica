# Peer Support Services: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Transforming peer support from an underfunded, fragmented add-on into a sustainable, evidence-backed component of the U.S. behavioral health system requires a phased strategy that builds infrastructure before scaling services. The roadmap proceeds through three phases: laying the policy and standards foundation (Phase 1), building workforce capacity and financing (Phase 2), and achieving full integration and scale (Phase 3). Each phase creates conditions necessary for the next, and early phases prioritize actions that generate political momentum and measurable cost savings to sustain support for longer-term reforms.

The theory of change is straightforward: national minimum standards plus adequate financing will stabilize the peer workforce, reducing turnover from 30-50% annually to below 20%. A stable workforce will deliver better services, generating stronger evidence and payer confidence. Stronger evidence will support coverage expansion, which will fund further workforce growth -- replacing the current vicious cycle of underfunding, turnover, weak evidence, and payer skepticism with a virtuous cycle of investment, stability, quality, and expansion.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Establish national minimum certification standards and core competency framework
- Secure CMS guidance mandating Medicaid coverage of peer services in all states
- Launch federal peer workforce development program
- Begin NIH/SAMHSA peer support research initiative

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Issue updated State Medicaid Director Letter mandating peer service coverage | CMS | Months 1-6 | CMS staff time; stakeholder consultation | Letter issued; all 50 states notified |
| Convene national certification standards committee | SAMHSA | Months 1-3 | $3 million for committee operations | Committee seated with peer worker, employer, state, and consumer representation |
| Publish national core competency framework for peer certification | SAMHSA certification committee | Months 3-18 | $5 million for development and stakeholder engagement | Framework published; public comment period completed |
| Issue HHS guidance on peer services as a parity-eligible behavioral health benefit | HHS/CMS | Months 6-12 | HHS staff time; legal analysis | Guidance published in Federal Register |
| Authorize and appropriate first-year funding for peer workforce development program | Congress | Months 1-18 | $50 million Year 1 appropriation | Legislation signed; funds available |
| Establish NIH/SAMHSA joint peer support research initiative | NIH (NIMH) / SAMHSA | Months 6-18 | $30 million Year 1 | Research initiative announced; first RFAs issued |
| Launch peer specialist loan forgiveness pilot through HRSA | HRSA | Months 12-24 | $10 million Year 1 | Pilot accepting applications in 5+ states |
| Commission baseline peer workforce survey | SAMHSA / BLS | Months 6-12 | $2 million | Survey instrument developed; data collection initiated |

### Legislative Requirements

- **Peer Support Workforce Sustainability Act** (new authorization): Authorizes $150 million annually for peer workforce development through HRSA, including training grants, career ladder programs, scholarships, and mentorship
- **CMS Medicaid amendment**: Requires all state Medicaid programs to cover peer support services and establishes rate adequacy review process
- **NIH research authorization**: Directs NIMH to establish a peer support services research program at $50 million annually

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, the policy foundation will be in place: a national competency framework ready for state adoption, CMS guidance requiring universal Medicaid coverage, initial research funding flowing, and the workforce development infrastructure being built. The peer workforce should begin stabilizing as the signal of federal commitment encourages states and employers to invest in retention.

## Phase 2: Workforce Capacity and Financing (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Achieve state compliance with national minimum certification standards
- Implement Medicaid rate floor at 75% of substance abuse counselor rate
- Expand Medicare peer support coverage to all behavioral health conditions
- Open 50 new peer respite programs (doubling the national total from ~50 to ~100)
- Begin private insurance coverage mandates through ACA essential health benefit updates

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| States align certification programs with national minimum standards | State behavioral health authorities | Years 2-4 | SAMHSA technical assistance ($8 million) | 40+ states in compliance by Year 4 |
| Congress legislates Medicaid rate floor for peer services | Congress / CMS | Year 3 | $200-$350 million annually in additional federal matching | Legislation enacted; CMS implementing |
| Expand Medicare peer support coverage to all behavioral health conditions | Congress / CMS | Years 3-4 | $150-$250 million annually | Medicare billing codes active for all BH conditions |
| Award first round of peer respite expansion grants | SAMHSA | Year 3 | $25 million Year 3 capital and operating grants | 20 new peer respite programs funded |
| Conduct first national rate adequacy review | CMS / states | Year 3 | $5 million for actuarial analysis | Rate adequacy reports published for all 50 states |
| Graduate first cohort of peer supervisor training program | HRSA grantees | Year 3 | Included in workforce development funding | 500 new certified peer supervisors |
| Publish first major peer support RCT results | NIH-funded researchers | Year 4-5 | Included in research program funding | 10+ peer-reviewed publications from funded trials |
| Implement private insurance coverage guidance | HHS / state regulators | Year 4-5 | HHS staff time; state insurance department coordination | 40%+ commercial plans covering peer services |

### Legislative Requirements

- **Medicare behavioral health peer support expansion** (Social Security Act amendment): Extends peer support coverage from opioid-specific to all behavioral health conditions for Medicare beneficiaries
- **Medicaid Rate Adequacy Act** (new): Establishes federal floor for peer service reimbursement at 75% of state substance abuse counselor rate
- **ACA essential health benefit update**: Includes peer support services in essential health benefit benchmark
- **Peer Respite Expansion Act** (new authorization): Authorizes $75 million annually for peer respite center development

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, the financing architecture will be in place across Medicaid, Medicare, and the beginnings of private insurance coverage. The peer workforce should grow from 30,000-35,000 to approximately 50,000, with median wages rising toward $22-$23 per hour as rate increases flow through to worker compensation. Annual turnover should decline to 25-30% as wages and career pathways improve. The peer respite network should be doubling, and the first rigorous multi-site trial results should be available to support further expansion.

---

## Phase 3: Scale and Integration (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Achieve full national certification reciprocity across all 50 states
- Grow peer workforce to 75,000+ with annual turnover below 20%
- Reach 250 operating peer respite programs diverting 50,000+ hospitalizations annually
- Achieve 80%+ private insurance coverage of peer services
- Produce comprehensive evidence base from 50+ randomized controlled trials

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Achieve full 50-state certification reciprocity | States / SAMHSA | Year 6-7 | SAMHSA technical assistance; interstate compact support | 50-state reciprocity operational |
| Peer workforce reaches 75,000+ nationally | Employers / workforce programs | Year 8-10 | Sustained workforce development funding | BLS/SAMHSA survey confirms 75,000+ |
| 250 peer respite programs operating nationally | SAMHSA / states | Year 7-10 | Continued grant funding + Medicaid transition | 250 programs verified; 50,000+ hospitalizations diverted annually |
| Peer specialist median wage reaches $25/hour | Market / Medicaid rates | Year 8-10 | Rate adequacy enforcement | BLS data confirms $25+ median |
| Publish comprehensive peer support evidence review | NIH / SAMHSA | Year 8 | Research program funding | Systematic review of 50+ RCTs published |

| Conduct 10-year program evaluation | GAO / SAMHSA | Year 10 | $5 million for evaluation | Evaluation report delivered to Congress |

### Expected Outcomes

By Year 10, peer support will be a recognized, funded, and evidence-based component of the American behavioral health system. The workforce will have tripled in size, wages will support career sustainability, certification will be portable across states, and the evidence base will be robust enough to end the recurring debate about whether peer services "work." Peer respite programs will demonstrate a proven, cost-effective alternative to psychiatric hospitalization at national scale.

## Governance and Oversight

### Federal Coordination

A Peer Support Services Interagency Working Group, chaired by SAMHSA and including CMS, HRSA, NIH, VA, and the Department of Labor, will coordinate implementation across federal agencies. The working group will meet quarterly and publish an annual progress report.

### Congressional Oversight

The Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee will receive annual reports on implementation milestones. GAO will conduct a comprehensive program evaluation at Year 5 and Year 10.

### Stakeholder Advisory

A federally chartered Peer Support Advisory Committee, with a majority of members being current or former peer specialists, will advise SAMHSA on implementation decisions, standards development, and research priorities.

### State Implementation

States will submit annual compliance reports to CMS demonstrating certification alignment with national standards and rate adequacy. SAMHSA will provide technical assistance to states not meeting milestones.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Congressional Appropriations Shortfalls

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build bipartisan support by emphasizing cost savings ($10,000-$18,000 per diverted hospitalization). Pursue incremental appropriations through existing SAMHSA and HRSA reauthorization vehicles rather than relying solely on new standalone legislation.

**Contingency Plan**: If full appropriations are not available, prioritize certification standards and CMS guidance (low cost) over grant programs (high cost), and seek philanthropic bridge funding for workforce development pilots.

### Risk 2: State Resistance to National Standards

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design standards as a minimum floor with explicit state flexibility for additional requirements. Engage state behavioral health authorities early through NASADAD (National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors) and NASMHPD (National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors). Offer technical assistance and transition periods rather than imposing sudden mandates.

**Contingency Plan**: If legislative mandates fail, pursue voluntary national standards through IC&RC or another credentialing body, coupled with CMS conditions of participation that incentivize adoption.

### Risk 3: Managed Care Organizations Resist Rate Increases

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Require actuarial demonstration that rate increases are offset by reductions in emergency department utilization and inpatient hospitalization. Structure rate requirements as rate floors within Medicaid managed care contracts. Build evidence through pilot projects in willing MCOs.

**Contingency Plan**: If MCO resistance prevents rate adequacy, shift peer services to fee-for-service Medicaid carve-outs in states where managed care networks are unwilling to pay adequate rates.

### Risk 4: Workforce Supply Cannot Keep Pace with Demand

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Front-load workforce development investments in Phase 1. Target recruitment in communities with large pools of potential peers (recovery community organizations, reentry programs, veteran service organizations). Expand training program capacity through online and hybrid models.

**Contingency Plan**: If domestic recruitment is insufficient, extend timeline for peer respite and service expansion targets rather than lowering quality standards to fill positions.

### Risk 5: Evidence Base Remains Inconclusive

**Likelihood**: Low-Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Fund large, well-powered multi-site trials designed to detect clinically meaningful effects. Diversify evidence approaches to include implementation science, health economics, and qualitative research alongside RCTs. Develop peer-specific outcome measures that capture the unique value of peer services.

**Contingency Plan**: If RCTs produce mixed results, use economic analyses (cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit) and qualitative evidence to support continued investment. Adjust service models based on implementation science findings about what works and for whom.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Cost | Funding Source | Notes |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Years 1-2) | $200 million | SAMHSA/HRSA/NIH appropriations | Standards development, workforce program launch, research initiation |
| Phase 2 (Years 3-5) | $1.2-$1.8 billion | Medicaid matching, Medicare expansion, SAMHSA grants | Rate floor implementation is largest cost; offset by hospitalization savings |
| Phase 3 (Years 6-10) | $2.0-$3.0 billion | Sustained appropriations + insurance billing transition | Growing workforce costs offset by growing savings from diverted hospitalization |
| **Total (10 years)** | **$3.4-$5.0 billion** | | **Offset by estimated $5-$8 billion in avoided inpatient costs** |

### Personnel

- **Federal**: Approximately 50 new FTEs across SAMHSA, CMS, HRSA, and NIH for program administration, technical assistance, and research management
- **State**: Each state will need 2-5 additional staff for certification program administration, rate adequacy reviews, and federal reporting
- **Workforce**: Net addition of 40,000-45,000 peer specialists over 10 years (from 30,000-35,000 to 75,000+)

### Infrastructure

- **Training capacity**: Expansion of peer specialist training programs from approximately 200 to 500 nationally, including online/hybrid options for rural areas
- **Peer respite facilities**: 200 new residential sites requiring capital investment (average $500,000 per site = $100 million total)
- **Technology**: National peer workforce registry and certification tracking system ($10 million development; $2 million annual maintenance)
- **Research infrastructure**: 10+ academic-community research partnerships for multi-site trials
