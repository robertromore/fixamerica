# Peer Support Services: Stakeholders

The peer support landscape is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with distinct interests, resources, and degrees of power over the direction of peer workforce policy.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Peer support workers | Directly affected by wages, certification, scope of practice, and workplace culture | 30,000-35,000 nationally | Living wages, career advancement, professional respect, clear scope of practice |
| People receiving peer services | Quality, availability, and continuity of peer support affects their recovery | ~1 million annually | Access to effective peer support, choice, cultural responsiveness |
| People with unmet behavioral health needs | Peer support could fill gaps in a system with severe clinician shortages | 57.8 million adults with mental illness (SAMHSA, 2022) | Access to any form of behavioral health support |
| People with substance use disorders | Peer recovery support is a core component of addiction treatment and long-term recovery | 46.3 million with SUD (SAMHSA, 2022) | Recovery support services, relapse prevention, community reintegration |
| Family members of people with mental illness | Family peer specialists provide support; peer services affect loved ones' recovery | 8.5 million family caregivers (NAMI, 2023) | Support for their family member, information, respite |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Veterans**: The VA employs over 1,200 peer specialists; peer support is a core component of VA mental health services. Veterans with mental health conditions and their families are affected by program quality and access.
- **Criminal justice-involved populations**: Forensic peer specialists support reentry and diversion programs. People with co-occurring mental health and justice involvement benefit from peer workers who share similar backgrounds.
- **Youth and transition-age young adults**: Young people with mental health conditions are increasingly served by youth peer specialists, particularly in school and community settings.
- **Rural communities**: Geographic access to any behavioral health services is limited in rural areas; peer support could help fill gaps but is disproportionately concentrated in urban areas.
- **Communities of color**: Racial disparities in mental health access make culturally responsive peer support especially valuable, but the peer workforce does not yet reflect the diversity of populations served.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) | Sets federal Medicaid/Medicare policy for peer services | Can mandate or authorize coverage, set conditions of participation | $1.5 trillion Medicaid/Medicare budget (FY2024) | High |
| SAMHSA | Federal agency for behavioral health policy, funding, and technical assistance | Administers $6.5 billion budget (FY2024); sets evidence-based practice standards | $29 million in peer support grants (FY2024) | High |
| State Medicaid agencies | Determine reimbursement rates, billing codes, covered services | Control state Medicaid budgets; file State Plan Amendments | Varies by state | High |
| State behavioral health authorities | Oversee certification programs, scope of practice, quality standards | Regulatory authority over peer workforce | Varies by state | High |
| U.S. Congress | Authorizes and funds federal programs; passes legislation | Legislative authority; power of the purse | $6.5 billion SAMHSA authorization (FY2024) | High |
| Veterans Health Administration | Operates largest peer specialist employer program | Hires, trains, and supervises VA peer specialists | 1,200+ peer positions; VA health budget of $118 billion (FY2024) | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **National Association of Peer Supporters (N.A.P.S.)**: The primary national membership organization for peer workers. Develops practice guidelines, advocates for policy changes, and promotes national certification standards. Operates on a limited budget relative to its mission.
- **National Council for Mental Wellbeing**: Represents community behavioral health organizations; advocates for peer service expansion and CCBHC funding. Influential in congressional advocacy.
- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: The largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization (600,000+ members). Supports peer services as part of comprehensive care, though primary focus is on clinical treatment access and insurance parity.
- **Copeland Center for Wellness and Recovery**: Maintains WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan) training and certification; key developer of peer-led interventions. Founded by Mary Ellen Copeland.
- **National Empowerment Center**: Consumer-run organization advocating for peer-controlled alternatives to traditional mental health services. Provides training and technical assistance for peer respite and other peer-run programs.
- **C4 Innovations**: Research and consulting organization specializing in peer workforce development; provides technical assistance on certification, Medicaid billing, and program design.
- **International Credentialing and Reciprocity Consortium (IC&RC)**: Offers national peer recovery support specialist credential used by some states; advocates for certification portability.

### Influencers

- **Licensed professional associations (NASW, APA, ACA)**: Influence scope of practice regulations and reimbursement policy through lobbying. Have historically been cautious or resistant toward peer workforce expansion when it overlaps with licensed services.
- **Managed care organizations (MCOs)**: Administer Medicaid benefits in most states. Their coverage decisions, prior authorization requirements, and reimbursement rates directly affect peer service availability.
- **Academic researchers**: Shape the evidence base that payers and policymakers use to make coverage decisions. Peer support research is concentrated in a small number of academic centers.
- **Foundations**: Philanthropic organizations (e.g., California Health Care Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation) have funded peer support innovation, research, and advocacy beyond what government funding supports.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Peer workers + consumer advocacy organizations + family advocacy organizations | Expanding peer services, improving quality, increasing access | Strong |
| State Medicaid agencies + MCOs + peer organizations | Cost-effective alternatives to expensive clinical services (ED diversion, hospitalization reduction) | Moderate |
| SAMHSA + CCBHC clinics + peer organizations | Meeting CCBHC peer service requirements with quality workforce | Strong |
| Veterans groups + VA + peer organizations | Effective veteran mental health services delivered by people who understand military culture | Strong |
| Rural health advocates + telehealth organizations + peer organizations | Expanding behavioral health access in underserved areas through technology-enabled peer services | Moderate |
| Criminal justice reform organizations + forensic peer organizations | Reducing recidivism, improving reentry outcomes, diversion from incarceration | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Peer workers vs. licensed professionals**: Peer workers seek expanded scope of practice and higher reimbursement; licensed professionals seek to maintain scope-of-practice boundaries and protect their market position.
- **Peer organizations vs. MCOs**: Peer organizations want higher reimbursement rates to fund living wages; MCOs benefit from low rates that reduce costs.
- **Peer autonomy advocates vs. clinical integration proponents**: Some peer leaders advocate for autonomous peer-run services outside the clinical system; others see integration into clinical teams as the path to sustainability and scale.
- **State sovereignty proponents vs. national standards advocates**: States resist national certification standards that would override their regulatory authority; peer workers and employers want portability and consistency.
- **Quality assurance advocates vs. accessibility advocates**: Higher certification requirements improve quality but may exclude the most marginalized individuals from the workforce.

This hierarchy determines who can bill, who supervises whom, who participates in treatment decisions, and whose expertise is valued. Peer specialists consistently occupy the bottom tier in authority, compensation, and organizational influence.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on peer support policy:

- **Lobbying**: Licensed professional associations (NASW, APA) spend significantly on state-level lobbying to protect scope-of-practice boundaries. The National Council for Mental Wellbeing lobbies Congress on CCBHC and community mental health funding. Peer-specific organizations have limited lobbying capacity due to budget constraints.
- **Campaign Contributions**: Mental health policy receives modest campaign contributions compared to healthcare broadly. Behavioral health PACs are small; peer organizations have essentially no PAC activity.
- **Regulatory Participation**: State behavioral health authorities and Medicaid agencies shape peer support through rulemaking. Peer organizations participate in public comment periods but often lack the staffing to provide detailed technical comments on complex regulations.
- **Research and Evidence**: Academic researchers influence policy by producing (or not producing) evidence that payers demand. The peer support research community is small and underfunded, limiting its policy influence compared to researchers studying pharmaceutical or psychotherapy interventions.
- **Public Advocacy**: NAMI, Mental Health America, and peer organizations use public awareness campaigns, storytelling, and media to build support for peer services. The personal narratives of peer specialists and the people they serve are among the most compelling advocacy tools in behavioral health.
- **Technical Assistance**: Organizations like C4 Innovations, SAMHSA's technical assistance centers, and the Copeland Center shape implementation through training, consultation, and model development, influencing how peer services are structured even when they do not directly control policy.
