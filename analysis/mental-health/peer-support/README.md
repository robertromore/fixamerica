# Peer Support Services

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of peer support services in the mental health and substance use recovery systems, including certified peer specialists, recovery support services, the lived experience workforce, peer-run organizations, and the policy infrastructure that shapes their development.

## Overview

Peer support in mental health and substance use recovery refers to the provision of services by individuals who have personal lived experience with mental health conditions, substance use disorders, or both. These workers -- variously titled certified peer specialists, recovery support specialists, or peer recovery coaches -- use their own recovery journeys to build rapport, model recovery, and provide practical guidance that clinical professionals often cannot. The peer support workforce has grown from a grassroots consumer movement into a recognized component of the behavioral health system, with 49 states and the District of Columbia now offering some form of peer specialist certification.

Despite significant momentum, peer support services face persistent structural barriers. Low wages averaging $17-19 per hour, inconsistent Medicaid reimbursement across states, ambiguous scope-of-practice boundaries, and inadequate integration into clinical teams undermine workforce stability and service quality. The evidence base, while growing, remains limited by underfunding of rigorous research. At the same time, the peer workforce represents one of the most promising strategies for expanding behavioral health capacity during a severe clinician shortage, reducing emergency department utilization, and addressing racial and socioeconomic disparities in mental health care access.

This analysis examines the current peer support landscape, its historical roots in the consumer/survivor movement, the systemic barriers preventing full integration, and evidence-based strategies for building a sustainable, effective peer workforce. It explores certification standards, Medicaid billing mechanisms, peer-run alternatives such as respite programs, and legislative frameworks at both the federal and state levels.
