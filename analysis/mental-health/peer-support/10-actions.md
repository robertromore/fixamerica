# Peer Support Services: What You Can Do

Peer support services represent one of the most promising and cost-effective innovations in behavioral health, yet the peer workforce remains underpaid, undertrained, and underutilized because it lacks the organized political constituency that clinical professions enjoy. Citizens, whether they have personal experience with mental health conditions or not, can play a critical role in advocating for the policy changes needed to build a sustainable, evidence-based peer support system.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the National Association of Peer Supporters (N.A.P.S.) Practice Guidelines to understand what peer support is and how it differs from clinical services: <https://www.peersupportworks.org/practice-guidelines>
- Follow SAMHSA's peer support resources page for updates on federal policy, training opportunities, and research: <https://www.samhsa.gov/brss-tacs/recovery-support-tools/peers>
- Subscribe to the National Council for Mental Wellbeing newsletter for updates on CCBHC expansion and community behavioral health policy: <https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/>
- Track your state's peer specialist certification requirements, Medicaid billing status, and reimbursement rates through NASHP's state policy tracker: <https://www.nashp.org/>

### Make Personal Changes

- If you have lived experience with a mental health condition or substance use disorder, consider becoming a certified peer specialist. Training programs are available in 49 states and D.C., with most requiring 75 hours of coursework. Contact your state behavioral health authority for certification information.
- If you are in recovery, share your story publicly when you are comfortable doing so. Personal narratives are the most powerful advocacy tool for peer support -- they demonstrate that recovery is real and that people with lived experience have expertise to offer.
- If you receive behavioral health services, ask your provider whether peer support services are available. Consumer demand drives service development.
- Create or participate in a Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP) group in your community. WRAP is a peer-led, evidence-based self-management tool available at no cost: <https://www.copelandcenter.com/>

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge your U.S. senators and representatives to support federal legislation for peer workforce development, Medicaid rate adequacy, and Medicare expansion of peer services. Key congressional committees include Senate HELP and House Energy and Commerce.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS, SAMHSA, or your state Medicaid agency proposes rules affecting peer services, submit public comments. Federal comment opportunities are posted at <https://www.regulations.gov/>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When your local newspaper covers mental health topics, write letters highlighting peer support as a cost-effective, evidence-based service that deserves adequate funding. Cite the $200-$400 per day cost of peer respite versus $2,264 per day for psychiatric inpatient care (HCUP, 2022).
- **Share Information**: Use social media to amplify peer support research findings, personal recovery stories, and policy developments. Tag organizations like NAMI, N.A.P.S., and Mental Health America to broaden reach.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a peer support advocacy coalition in your community, bringing together people with lived experience, family members, behavioral health providers, and civic leaders to advocate for local peer service expansion.
- Host a community screening of documentaries about the mental health consumer/survivor movement, followed by discussion about peer support in your area. *Beyond the Medical Model* and other recovery-focused films are available through the National Empowerment Center.
- Partner with your local community mental health center or CCBHC to establish or expand peer support services. More than 500 CCBHCs are required to provide peer services -- ask whether yours has adequate peer staffing.
- Organize a peer respite feasibility study in your community. Only ~50 peer respite programs currently operate nationally; new programs are needed in every region. The National Empowerment Center provides technical assistance for new programs.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect with your local NAMI affiliate (600,000+ members nationally) to include peer workforce advocacy in their policy agenda. Many NAMI chapters already support peer services but may not prioritize workforce issues.
- Partner with recovery community organizations (RCOs) in your area. Faces and Voices of Recovery maintains a directory of RCOs: <https://facesandvoicesofrecovery.org/>
- Engage faith-based organizations in peer support advocacy. Many congregations operate informal peer support through pastoral care and support groups; connecting these efforts with the formal peer workforce can build unlikely alliances across political lines.
- Work with local law enforcement to advocate for peer specialists on mobile crisis response teams. Police departments that use peers report reduced use-of-force incidents and repeat 911 calls -- a compelling argument for law enforcement allies.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During congressional budget season (February-October), when SAMHSA and HRSA appropriations are being set
- When your state legislature considers Medicaid budget bills or behavioral health workforce legislation
- When CMS issues proposed rules affecting Medicaid behavioral health coverage
- During State Plan Amendment or waiver renewal processes in your state
- When the Senate HELP Committee or House Energy and Commerce Committee holds hearings on mental health policy

```
Subject: Support Federal Investment in Peer Support Services

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge your support for
federal legislation to strengthen peer support services in our behavioral
health system. Peer specialists -- people who use their own recovery
experience to help others -- are among the most effective and cost-efficient
workers in mental health and addiction services, yet they earn a median wage
of just $17.65 per hour and face annual turnover rates of 30-50%.

I ask you to support legislation that would:
- Establish national minimum certification standards for peer specialists
  with interstate reciprocity
- Require Medicaid coverage of peer services in all states with adequate
  reimbursement rates
- Expand Medicare coverage of peer support to all behavioral health
  conditions, not just opioid treatment
- Fund peer workforce development through HRSA at $150 million annually

Peer respite programs cost $200-$400 per day compared to $2,264 per day for
psychiatric hospitalization, and studies show peer services reduce emergency
department visits by 9-23%. Investing in the peer workforce saves money
while improving outcomes for the 57.8 million Americans with mental illness.

Thank you for your consideration of this critical behavioral health issue.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling to
ask [Representative/Senator] [Last Name] to support federal investment in
peer support services for mental health and addiction. Peer specialists are
the most underpaid workers in behavioral health, earning just $17.65 per
hour, and we need national certification standards, Medicaid rate adequacy,
and workforce development funding. Can you please note my support for peer
workforce legislation?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Peer Support Workforce Sustainability Act** (proposed): Would authorize $150 million annually for peer workforce development through HRSA. Urge your representatives to introduce and co-sponsor this legislation.
- **Medicare peer support expansion** (building on SUPPORT Act, P.L. 115-271): The SUPPORT Act authorized Medicare coverage of peer services for opioid treatment only. Urge expansion to all behavioral health conditions.
- **CCBHC reauthorization and expansion**: Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics are required to provide peer services. Support full CCBHC reauthorization with adequate peer workforce funding.
- **State-level Medicaid rate increases**: Contact your state legislators and Medicaid agency to advocate for peer service reimbursement rates at or above 75% of the substance abuse counselor rate in your state.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support federal funding for peer support workforce development, including training grants, career ladder programs, and loan forgiveness for peer specialists?"
2. "Will you advocate for Medicaid reimbursement rates that allow peer specialists to earn a living wage of at least $25 per hour?"
3. "Do you support expanding Medicare coverage of peer support services beyond opioid treatment to all behavioral health conditions?"
4. "What is your position on national minimum certification standards for peer specialists with interstate reciprocity?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who serve on or seek appointment to the Senate HELP Committee, House Energy and Commerce Committee, or state health and human services committees -- these are the committees where peer support legislation moves.
- Examine candidates' positions on behavioral health funding, Medicaid expansion, and community mental health investment. Candidates who support these broader priorities are more likely to support peer workforce investment.

## Professional Actions

- **For behavioral health clinicians**: Advocate within your organization for equitable treatment of peer specialists. Support peer workers' inclusion in treatment team meetings, case conferences, and organizational decision-making. Volunteer to provide supervision for peer specialists if your license qualifies.
- **For healthcare administrators**: Review your organization's peer specialist wages and ensure they align with the goal of $25/hour. If your organization bills Medicaid for peer services, verify that reimbursement revenue flows to peer wages and benefits rather than being absorbed into general overhead.
- **For researchers**: Prioritize peer support research in your portfolio. Only 18 RCTs of mental health peer support have been published; the field needs large, well-powered trials. Include peer researchers and peer advisory boards in study design.
- **For educators**: Integrate peer support content into social work, counseling, nursing, and medical school curricula. Future clinicians need to understand the peer role and how to collaborate effectively with peer specialists.
- **For employers**: Offer peer specialist positions with full benefits, clear job descriptions, career advancement pathways, and qualified supervision. High turnover is expensive; investing in peer worker retention saves money and improves service quality.
- **For state policymakers**: Review your state's peer specialist certification requirements for barriers that disproportionately exclude people of color, people with criminal justice histories, and people in early recovery. Conduct a rate adequacy analysis comparing peer reimbursement to the cost of delivering services.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing peer support services with others, emphasize:

1. **Cost-effectiveness**: "Peer respite costs $200-$400 per day compared to $2,264 for psychiatric inpatient care, and studies show peer services reduce emergency department visits by 9-23%. Investing in peers saves money." (HCUP, 2022; meta-analysis, 2021)
2. **Workforce crisis**: "The United States has 30,000-35,000 peer specialists earning a median of $17.65 per hour -- less than many retail workers -- with annual turnover of 30-50%. We cannot build a sustainable service on poverty wages." (BLS, 2023; peer workforce surveys, 2022)
3. **Bipartisan appeal**: "Peer support is community-based mutual aid, not big government. It empowers individuals, reduces dependency on expensive institutions, and reflects the conservative value of personal responsibility alongside the liberal value of expanding access to care."
4. **Evidence base**: "SAMHSA has recognized peer support as an evidence-based practice since 2005. Meta-analyses show reductions in hospitalization (18-36%) and emergency department use (9-23%). The VA employs over 1,200 peer specialists with consistently positive outcomes."

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Peer specialists are untrained volunteers" | Peer specialists must complete 40-100+ hours of competency-based training, pass a written exam (35 states), complete supervised experience, and maintain continuing education | SAMHSA certification tracker, 2024 |
| "People with mental illness cannot reliably help others" | Studies show peer-delivered services have safety profiles comparable to other paraprofessional services, with serious adverse events in less than 1% of encounters | Chinman et al., 2020 |
| "Peer support replaces real treatment" | Peer support complements clinical care; it is not a substitute. Peers help with recovery, navigation, and self-advocacy -- roles clinicians are not trained for | SAMHSA Core Competencies, 2015 |
| "There is no evidence peer support works" | 18 RCTs, multiple meta-analyses, and decades of program evaluation data demonstrate effectiveness in reducing hospitalization, improving recovery, and lowering costs | Lloyd-Evans et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2018 |
| "Peer support is too expensive to expand" | Peer support generates net savings by diverting $10,000-$18,000 in inpatient costs per diverted hospitalization; the $29 million SAMHSA spends on peer grants is a fraction of the $6.5 billion SAMHSA budget | SAMHSA FY2024; economic analyses, 2022 |
