# Peer Support Services: Solutions

Strengthening peer support services requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses workforce sustainability, financing, certification, integration, and research simultaneously. Piecemeal reforms have produced incremental gains over the past two decades, but a coordinated federal-state strategy is needed to realize peer support's full potential as a component of the behavioral health system.

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Peer support must remain grounded in lived experience, mutuality, and self-determination -- not become a low-cost substitute for clinical care
- The peer workforce deserves living wages, career pathways, and professional respect comparable to other paraprofessional health workers
- National standards should establish a quality floor while preserving state flexibility for innovation and adaptation
- Financing reform must include Medicaid rate adequacy, Medicare expansion, and private insurance coverage mandates
- Research investment should match the growing role of peer support in the behavioral health system

### Theory of Change

Federal legislation establishing national minimum certification standards and mandatory Medicaid/Medicare coverage, combined with appropriations for workforce development and research, will create sustainable financing and quality infrastructure. This infrastructure will reduce turnover, improve service quality, strengthen the evidence base, and build payer confidence -- creating a virtuous cycle that replaces the current vicious cycle of underfunding, high turnover, weak evidence, and payer skepticism.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: National Minimum Certification Standards

**Description**: Establish federal minimum standards for peer specialist certification while preserving state authority to add requirements. The national standard would include: minimum 75 hours of competency-based training aligned with SAMHSA's core competencies; a standardized written examination developed by a national credentialing body; 250 hours of supervised practical experience; 20 hours of continuing education annually; and reciprocity agreements enabling certified specialists to practice across state lines. States could add specialized credentials (forensic, youth, family, veteran) and additional requirements.

**Evidence Base**: The International Credentialing and Reciprocity Consortium (IC&RC) and National Association of Peer Supporters (N.A.P.S.) have developed competency frameworks that provide a foundation for national standards. Georgia's certification model, the most replicated in the country, uses 75 hours of training and a written exam. A 2022 study found that states with more rigorous certification requirements reported lower rates of scope-of-practice complaints and higher employer satisfaction (C4 Innovations, 2022).

**Implementation**: Congress directs SAMHSA to convene a national certification standards committee including peer workers, employers, state authorities, credentialing organizations, and consumer advocates. The committee develops standards within 18 months; states have 3 years to align certification programs with the national minimum.

**Cost/Resources**: $15 million over 3 years for standards development, stakeholder engagement, and technical assistance to states.

**Timeline**: Standards development (18 months), state implementation (3 years), full compliance (5 years).

**Challenges**: State resistance to federal standards; opposition from certification vendors in states with lower current requirements; potential exclusion of currently certified peers who do not meet new standards (grandfather provisions needed).

**Impact Metrics**: Interstate credential reciprocity rate (target: 90%+ within 5 years); employer satisfaction with peer preparation (target: 80%+); scope-of-practice complaint rate (target: 50% reduction).

### Solution 2: Medicaid Rate Adequacy and Coverage Mandates

**Description**: Require all state Medicaid programs to cover peer support services and establish a federal floor for reimbursement rates. The rate floor would be set at 75% of the state's substance abuse counselor rate, ensuring that peer services are reimbursed at levels sufficient to fund living wages, benefits, supervision, and administrative costs. CMS would issue updated guidance requiring states to conduct annual rate adequacy reviews for peer services and adjust rates when they fall below the cost of delivering services.

**Evidence Base**: A 2023 C4 Innovations analysis found that Medicaid rates in 14 states were insufficient to cover the fully loaded cost of employing peer specialists. States with higher reimbursement rates (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York) report lower peer workforce turnover and higher service quality metrics. Georgia's rate increase from $12 to $22 per 15-minute unit in 2019 was followed by a 23% reduction in peer turnover within two years.

**Implementation**: CMS issues updated State Medicaid Director Letter requiring coverage. Congress legislates the rate floor through Medicaid amendment. States have 2 years to comply.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $200-$350 million annually in additional federal Medicaid matching funds, offset by reductions in emergency department utilization and hospitalization.

**Timeline**: CMS guidance (6 months), legislative action (1-2 years), state implementation (2-3 years).

**Challenges**: Opposition from states concerned about Medicaid budget impact; managed care organizations may resist rate increases; need to ensure rate increases flow to worker wages rather than organizational overhead.

**Impact Metrics**: Peer specialist median wage (target: $25/hour within 5 years); annual turnover rate (target: below 20%); states meeting rate adequacy standard (target: 100%).

### Solution 3: Medicare Expansion for Peer Services

**Description**: Expand Medicare coverage of peer support services beyond the current opioid-specific authorization under the SUPPORT Act to cover peer services for all behavioral health conditions. This would make peer services available to Medicare beneficiaries with depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other mental health conditions -- not just those with opioid use disorders.

**Evidence Base**: The SUPPORT Act's peer support provision for opioid treatment has been implemented successfully, demonstrating that Medicare can effectively cover peer services. VA peer specialist programs serve veterans with the full range of mental health conditions with positive outcomes. There is no clinical or policy rationale for restricting Medicare peer support to a single condition.

**Implementation**: Congress amends the Social Security Act to add peer support services as a covered Medicare benefit for behavioral health conditions. CMS develops billing codes and provider enrollment standards.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $150-$250 million annually in additional Medicare spending, offset by reductions in hospital readmissions and emergency department visits among Medicare beneficiaries with mental health conditions.

**Timeline**: Legislative action (1-2 years), CMS rulemaking (1 year), full implementation (3 years).

**Challenges**: Congressional Budget Office scoring may overestimate costs if savings from reduced hospitalization are not fully captured; Medicare physician payment rules may require adaptation for peer service billing.

**Impact Metrics**: Medicare beneficiaries receiving peer services (target: 500,000 within 5 years); hospital readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries with SMI (target: 15% reduction).

### Solution 4: Private Insurance Coverage Requirements

**Description**: Require private health insurance plans to cover peer support services as an essential health benefit under the ACA. Peer services would be subject to the same mental health parity requirements as other behavioral health services under the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA).

**Evidence Base**: Fewer than 10% of commercial insurance plans currently cover peer services (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023). Mental health parity law requires that insurers not impose more restrictive coverage limitations on behavioral health services than on medical/surgical services, but the exclusion of peer support from benefit designs has not been challenged under parity. Economic analyses of peer support consistently show positive or neutral cost impacts.

**Implementation**: HHS issues guidance clarifying that peer support qualifies as a behavioral health benefit subject to parity. Congress includes peer services in essential health benefit updates.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal federal cost; private insurance premium impacts estimated at $0.50-$1.50 per member per month.

**Timeline**: HHS guidance (1 year), legislative action if needed (2-3 years), plan compliance (1 year after regulation).

**Challenges**: Insurance industry opposition to new mandated benefits; definitional questions about which peer services qualify; need for credentialing standards before private payers will cover services.

**Impact Metrics**: Commercial plans covering peer services (target: 80%+ within 5 years); privately insured individuals accessing peer support (target: 250,000 annually).

### Solution 5: Peer Workforce Development Investment

**Description**: Create a dedicated federal peer support workforce development program, funded at $150 million annually, to support training program expansion, career ladder development, supervision training, loan forgiveness for peer specialists pursuing advanced credentials, and targeted recruitment in underserved communities. The program would include competitive grants to states and organizations, scholarships for peer specialist training, and a national peer specialist mentorship initiative.

**Evidence Base**: The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) operates workforce development programs for physicians, nurses, and other health professionals that have demonstrated effectiveness in expanding supply and improving distribution. No equivalent program exists for peer specialists. The peer workforce needs targeted investment comparable to other behavioral health workforce categories.

**Implementation**: Congress authorizes and appropriates funding through HRSA. SAMHSA provides technical assistance. Grants distributed competitively to states and organizations.

**Cost/Resources**: $150 million annually ($50 million for training grants, $30 million for career ladder programs, $25 million for supervision training, $25 million for scholarships, $20 million for recruitment and mentorship).

**Timeline**: Authorization (1-2 years), first grant cycle (1 year after appropriation), full program operation (3 years).

**Challenges**: Competition for limited appropriations; need to design programs that reach the most marginalized potential peer workers, not only those with existing educational advantages.

**Impact Metrics**: New peer specialists certified annually (target: 10,000); peer specialist diversity (target: workforce demographics match community demographics within 5 years); career advancement rate (target: 25% of peers advance to supervisory/leadership roles within 5 years).

### Solution 6: Peer Respite and Peer-Run Services Expansion

**Description**: Create a dedicated federal grant program for peer respite centers and peer-run organizations, funded at $75 million annually for 10 years. The program would support the development of 200 new peer respite programs (quadrupling the current number from ~50), expansion of warmlines to all 50 states, and capacity building for peer-run drop-in centers and recovery community organizations. Funding would include capital grants for facility development and operating grants for the first 5 years, after which programs would transition to Medicaid and insurance reimbursement.

**Evidence Base**: Existing peer respite programs divert 60-70% of guests from psychiatric hospitalization (peer respite outcome studies, 2021). At a daily cost of $200-$400 compared to $2,264 for psychiatric inpatient care (HCUP, 2022), peer respite generates $10,000-$18,000 in savings per diverted hospitalization. Warmlines reduce crisis escalation and emergency service utilization. The challenge is that only ~50 peer respite programs and ~70 warmlines currently operate nationally.

**Implementation**: SAMHSA administers competitive grants. States must provide 25% match. Programs must be governed by people with lived experience.

**Cost/Resources**: $75 million annually for 10 years ($750 million total). Capital grants average $500,000 per site; operating grants average $300,000 annually.

**Timeline**: First grants awarded (Year 1), 50 new programs (Year 3), 200 new programs (Year 7), full transition to insurance billing (Year 10).

**Challenges**: Zoning and community opposition to residential programs; recruiting qualified peer leadership for new programs; transitioning from grant funding to sustainable reimbursement.

**Impact Metrics**: Operating peer respite programs (target: 250 by Year 10); annual hospitalizations diverted (target: 50,000); cost savings per year (target: $500 million in avoided inpatient costs).

### Solution 7: Dedicated Federal Peer Support Research Program

**Description**: Establish a dedicated NIH/SAMHSA joint research program for peer support services, funded at $50 million annually. The program would support large-scale multi-site randomized trials, implementation science research, health economics studies, and the development of peer-specific outcome measures. A research advisory committee including peer workers and consumer researchers would guide priorities.

**Evidence Base**: NIH spending on peer support research totaled approximately $12 million in FY2023, compared to over $300 million for psychotherapy research (NIH RePORTER, 2024). Only 18 RCTs of mental health peer support have been published. The evidence gap is the most frequently cited justification for limiting peer service expansion and coverage.

**Implementation**: NIH creates a peer support research initiative within NIMH. SAMHSA funds practice-based research and implementation studies. Annual funding allocated through competitive grants.

**Cost/Resources**: $50 million annually ($30 million NIH, $20 million SAMHSA).

**Timeline**: Program established (Year 1), first major trials initiated (Year 2), initial results (Year 5), comprehensive evidence base (Year 10).

**Challenges**: Academic culture that undervalues peer-delivered services as a research topic; difficulty recruiting principal investigators with peer support expertise; methodological challenges of studying relational interventions.

**Impact Metrics**: Peer support RCTs published (target: 50+ within 10 years); peer-specific outcome measures validated (target: 5+); research-to-practice translation (target: evidence-based guidelines updated every 3 years).

## International Models

### United Kingdom: NHS Peer Support Worker Programme

**Description**: The UK's National Health Service has integrated peer support workers into mental health trusts (regional health authorities) across England since 2010. Peers receive standardized training through the Implementing Recovery through Organizational Change (ImROC) framework and are employed directly by NHS trusts at wages comparable to other healthcare support workers (Band 3-4 on the NHS pay scale, approximately $24,000-$28,000/year).

**Results**: A 2019 NHS England evaluation found that trusts employing peer workers reported 20% reductions in inpatient bed days, improved patient satisfaction scores, and positive impacts on organizational recovery orientation. By 2023, over 2,000 peer workers were employed across NHS mental health services.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The NHS model demonstrates that peer workers can be integrated into a large, complex health system with standardized roles, wages, and career pathways. The U.S. would need to adapt this to its multi-payer system, but the VA's peer specialist program already demonstrates similar integration in a large government health system.

### Australia: Peer Workforce Development Framework

**Description**: Australia's National Mental Health Commission developed a national peer workforce framework in 2019 that defines competencies, career pathways, and organizational standards for peer work. States and territories align their certification programs with the national framework while retaining implementation flexibility.

**Results**: Australia's peer workforce grew from approximately 1,500 in 2015 to over 4,000 in 2023, with annual retention rates above 80% in states that adopted living wage standards. The national framework enabled workforce portability across states.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Australia's federated model -- national standards with state implementation -- is directly relevant to the U.S. federal system. The Australian approach of separating competency standards (national) from certification administration (state) could be replicated.

### New Zealand: Peer Support and Te Whare Tapa Wha

**Description**: New Zealand integrates peer support with its indigenous Maori health framework (Te Whare Tapa Wha), recognizing cultural and spiritual dimensions of wellbeing alongside mental, physical, and social health. Peer workers are trained in culturally responsive practices and serve diverse populations.

**Results**: New Zealand's peer workforce demonstrates above-average retention rates and high consumer satisfaction, attributed partly to the holistic, culturally grounded framework that aligns well with peer support values of whole-person wellness.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The New Zealand model offers lessons for integrating peer support with cultural responsiveness, particularly relevant for serving Native American/Alaska Native, Latino, and African American communities in the U.S. where culturally specific peer approaches may be more effective than standardized models.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Georgia Peer Support Program**: The nation's first comprehensive state peer specialist program (2001-present) has served as the model for programs nationwide. Georgia's experience demonstrates that a well-designed state program can achieve workforce stability when reimbursement rates are adequate.
- **VA Peer Specialist Program**: The VA's program (1,200+ peer specialists) provides the largest-scale demonstration of peer integration into a complex health system. Internal evaluations show reduced hospitalization and improved engagement among veterans served by peers.
- **Pathways to Housing (New York)**: This Housing First program integrates peer specialists into assertive community treatment teams serving people experiencing chronic homelessness and serious mental illness. Peer-delivered services are associated with improved housing retention and reduced emergency department utilization.
- **CCBHC Demonstration**: Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (500+ sites in 46 states) are required to provide peer support services, creating the largest mandatory integration of peer services into community behavioral health care.
