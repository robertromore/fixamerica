# Peer Support Services: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative strategy for peer support reform operates at three levels: federal legislation to establish national minimum standards, financing mandates, and workforce investment; state model legislation to align certification programs and ensure Medicaid rate adequacy; and regulatory action through CMS and SAMHSA to implement coverage requirements and quality standards. No constitutional amendments are required, as the Commerce Clause, Spending Clause, and existing Medicaid/Medicare statutory authority provide ample constitutional basis for federal action.

The approach is incremental in structure -- building from CMS guidance through authorization to appropriation -- but transformative in ambition, aiming to convert peer support from a fragmented, underfunded add-on into a recognized, sustainable component of the behavioral health system.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for peer support reform. Federal authority to act in this area is well established through the Commerce Clause (interstate health workforce regulation), the Spending Clause (Medicaid and Medicare conditions of participation), and existing statutory authority under the Public Health Service Act, Social Security Act, and Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.*

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish national minimum standards for peer specialist certification,
create a federal peer support workforce development program, and fund
peer support services research.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Peer Support Workforce Sustainability
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to SAMHSA (2023), the United States employs an
    estimated 30,000 to 35,000 peer support specialists across
    behavioral health settings, a workforce that has grown rapidly
    since CMS authorized Medicaid reimbursement in 2007.

(2) The Bureau of Labor Statistics (2023) reports a median hourly
    wage of $17.65 for community health workers, the closest
    occupational proxy for peer specialists, while peer workforce
    surveys document annual turnover rates of 30 to 50 percent.

(3) As of 2024, 49 States and the District of Columbia have
    established peer specialist certification programs, but
    requirements vary from 40 to over 100 hours of training,
    with no interstate reciprocity, limiting workforce mobility
    and creating inconsistent quality standards.

(4) Meta-analyses of peer support randomized controlled trials
    demonstrate reductions in emergency department utilization of
    9 to 23 percent and hospital readmissions of 18 to 36 percent,
    and SAMHSA has recognized peer support as an evidence-based
    practice since 2005.

(5) The peer support evidence base remains limited, with only 18
    published randomized controlled trials as of 2023, compared to
    over 300 for psychotherapy, and NIH spending on peer support
    research totaled approximately $12 million in fiscal year 2023.

(6) A stable, well-trained, adequately compensated peer workforce
    is essential to reducing behavioral health workforce shortages,
    lowering costs, and improving outcomes for the 57.8 million
    adults with mental illness and 46.3 million with substance use
    disorders in the United States.

    (8) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2029 for such program;
    (9) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2030 for such program; and
    (10) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2031 for such program.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the congressional record with specific data on workforce size, wages, turnover, evidence base, and the gap between peer support's potential and current investment. Findings use data consistent with SAMHSA, BLS, and NIH sources cited throughout this analysis.
- **Section 4 (Certification Standards)**: Sets a 75-hour training floor, standardized exam, 250 hours supervised experience, and 20 hours annual CE -- aligned with the most common state requirements. The criminal background provision prevents categorical exclusion, addressing the equity concern that 29% of the current peer workforce reports criminal justice history. Reciprocity enables workforce portability. Grandfathering protects existing peers.
- **Section 5 (Workforce Development)**: Modeled on existing HRSA workforce programs (National Health Service Corps, nurse training grants). Targets the specific pipeline problems: training capacity, career ladders, supervisor preparation, diversity, and rural access.
- **Section 6 (Research Program)**: Addresses the research gap ($12 million NIH spending vs. $300 million for psychotherapy) with a dedicated $50 million annual program. Includes the peer-specific methodologies needed: implementation science, health economics, and peer-developed outcome measures.
- **Section 8 (Appropriations)**: $200 million annually ($150 million workforce + $50 million research) for 5 years = $1 billion total authorization. This is approximately 3% of the SAMHSA budget ($6.5 billion FY2024).

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Advisory committee seated | 90 days after enactment | SAMHSA |
| Draft national minimum standards published | 12 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| Public comment period closes | 15 months after enactment | SAMHSA/Public |
| Final standards published | 18 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| First workforce development grants awarded | 18 months after enactment | HRSA |
| First research RFAs issued | 12 months after enactment | NIH/SAMHSA |
| National registry operational | 24 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| State certification alignment deadline | 3 years after standards publication | States |

**Regulatory Authority**: SAMHSA administers certification standards; HRSA administers workforce development grants; NIH administers research program. CMS coordinates on Medicaid and Medicare implications.

**Challenges**:

- **State sovereignty concerns**: States may resist federal certification mandates as overreach into their regulatory domain
- **Appropriations risk**: Authorization does not guarantee appropriation; competing budget priorities may reduce actual funding
- **Scope of criminal background provision**: States with strict background check laws may challenge the limitation on categorical exclusions

**Refinements**:

- **Incentive model**: If mandates provoke excessive state resistance, convert to an incentive model where states receive enhanced Medicaid matching (e.g., 90% FMAP for peer services) if they adopt national standards
- **Phased appropriations**: If full $200 million is not available, prioritize standards development and research ($65 million) over grant programs

### The Peer Support Coverage and Rate Adequacy Act

**Purpose**: Require Medicaid coverage of peer support services in all states, establish a federal floor for reimbursement rates, expand Medicare peer support coverage to all behavioral health conditions, and mandate private insurance coverage of peer services as an essential health benefit.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Universal Medicaid coverage mandate for peer services
2. Reimbursement rate floor at 75% of state substance abuse counselor rate
3. Medicare expansion from opioid-specific to all behavioral health conditions
4. Private insurance coverage mandate through essential health benefit update

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To require coverage of peer support services under Medicaid, Medicare,
and private health insurance, and to establish reimbursement rate
adequacy standards.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Peer Support Coverage and Rate
Adequacy Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. MEDICAID COVERAGE OF PEER SUPPORT SERVICES.

(a) MANDATORY COVERAGE.--Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act
    (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)) is amended by adding at the end the
    following new paragraph:

    "(31) Peer support services (as defined in subsection (jj))
    provided by a certified peer specialist."

(b) DEFINITION.--Section 1905 of the Social Security Act is amended
    by adding at the end the following:

    "(jj) PEER SUPPORT SERVICES.--The term 'peer support services'
    means non-clinical, recovery-oriented supportive services
    delivered by an individual who--
    (1) has personal lived experience with a mental health condition,
        substance use disorder, or co-occurring disorder; and
    (2) is certified under a State-recognized certification program
        that meets the national minimum standards established under
        section 4 of the Peer Support Workforce Sustainability Act."

(c) RATE ADEQUACY.--
    (1) FLOOR.--The reimbursement rate for peer support services
        under a State plan under this title shall not be less than
        75 percent of the State's reimbursement rate for substance
        abuse counseling services.
    (2) REVIEW.--Each State shall conduct an annual rate adequacy
        review for peer support services and submit the results to
        the Secretary.
    (3) ADJUSTMENT.--If the Secretary determines that a State's
        peer support reimbursement rate is insufficient to cover
        the cost of employing peer specialists at a wage of not
        less than 150 percent of the applicable Federal or State
        minimum wage (whichever is higher), the Secretary shall
        require the State to adjust its rate.

(d) EFFECTIVE DATE.--The amendments made by this section shall apply
    to services furnished on or after the date that is 2 years
    after the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 3. MEDICARE EXPANSION OF PEER SUPPORT SERVICES.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Section 1861 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
    1395x) is amended to include peer support services as a covered
    benefit for all behavioral health conditions, expanding the
    authorization under section 1014 of the SUPPORT for Patients
    and Communities Act (Public Law 115-271) from opioid use
    disorders to mental health conditions, substance use disorders,
    and co-occurring disorders.

(b) BILLING.--The Secretary shall establish appropriate billing
    codes for peer support services furnished to Medicare
    beneficiaries with behavioral health conditions.

(c) PROVIDER ENROLLMENT.--The Secretary shall establish provider
    enrollment standards for peer specialists furnishing services
    to Medicare beneficiaries.

SEC. 4. PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE.

(a) ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFIT.--The Secretary shall include peer
    support services within the behavioral health essential health
    benefits required under section 1302(b)(1)(E) of the Patient
    Protection and Affordable Care Act.

(b) PARITY.--Peer support services shall be subject to the
    requirements of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity
    Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343).

SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary
to carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Medicaid)**: Adds peer support as a mandatory Medicaid benefit, ending the current system where 4 states still do not cover peer services. The rate floor at 75% of the substance abuse counselor rate directly addresses the wage gap that drives 30-50% turnover. The wage floor provision (150% of minimum wage) prevents states from setting rates so low that they cannot support living wages.
- **Section 3 (Medicare)**: Extends the SUPPORT Act's peer support authorization from opioid-only to all behavioral health conditions. This is a logical extension of existing authority with minimal additional administrative burden.
- **Section 4 (Private Insurance)**: Classifies peer services as an essential health benefit subject to mental health parity, closing the gap where fewer than 10% of commercial plans cover peer services.

**Challenges**:

- **CBO scoring**: Medicaid and Medicare cost estimates may be significant; savings from hospitalization reduction may not be fully captured in scoring
- **MCO resistance**: Managed care organizations may resist rate floor requirements
- **Insurance industry opposition**: Private insurers will oppose new mandated benefits

**Refinements**:

- **Phase in private insurance mandate**: Allow 3-year transition for commercial plans to develop provider networks and billing systems
- **CMS demonstration waiver**: If full mandate is not politically feasible, authorize CMS demonstration projects in willing states to generate evidence for future expansion

## State Model Legislation

### Model Peer Support Services Act

**Purpose**: Provide a template for state legislation aligning certification standards with national minimums, ensuring Medicaid rate adequacy, and protecting peer scope of practice.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize training hour requirements (above the 75-hour minimum), specify their own certifying body, and adjust rate adequacy provisions to their Medicaid payment structures. States with existing strong programs (Georgia, Pennsylvania, Connecticut) may need minimal modification.

**Draft Text**:

```text

    higher.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], except that section 5 shall
take effect on [date 12 months later] to allow time for State plan
amendment filing.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: SAMHSA (certification standards and workforce development); CMS (Medicaid and Medicare coverage); HRSA (workforce grants)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **National Minimum Certification Standards Rule**: SAMHSA must publish proposed and final rules within 18 months of enactment, defining competency domains, examination specifications, training curriculum requirements, supervision standards, and reciprocity procedures.
2. **Medicaid Peer Support Coverage and Rate Rule**: CMS must issue an updated State Medicaid Director Letter and subsequent regulation defining coverage requirements, rate adequacy standards, and state compliance procedures within 12 months of enactment.
3. **Medicare Peer Support Billing Codes**: CMS must establish HCPCS billing codes for peer support services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries with behavioral health conditions within 18 months of enactment.
4. **Essential Health Benefit Update**: HHS must amend essential health benefit regulations to include peer support services within 24 months of enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Medicaid compliance**: States that fail to cover peer services or meet rate adequacy standards face potential loss of enhanced Medicaid matching funds. CMS conducts annual compliance reviews.
- **Certification reciprocity**: States that refuse to honor reciprocity provisions risk loss of SAMHSA workforce development grant eligibility.
- **Private right of action**: Individuals denied peer services by Medicaid or private insurance may file complaints with state insurance commissioners and CMS.
- **Administrative penalties**: Insurers that violate parity requirements for peer services face enforcement under MHPAEA, including civil monetary penalties.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Federal regulation of peer specialist certification standards is supported by the Commerce Clause because the behavioral health workforce operates in an interstate market. Peer specialists seek employment across state lines, and the lack of certification reciprocity impedes interstate commerce. *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), established broad federal authority to regulate activities with substantial effects on interstate commerce.

**Spending Clause Authority**: The Medicaid coverage mandate is supported by the Spending Clause, as Congress may condition federal Medicaid matching funds on state compliance with coverage requirements. However, *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), limits Congress's ability to use Medicaid conditions that are coercive. The peer support mandate is a modest incremental requirement within the existing Medicaid structure, distinguishable from the ACA Medicaid expansion at issue in *NFIB*.

**Tenth Amendment**: States may argue that federal certification standards intrude on their regulatory authority over health professions. The legislation addresses this by setting minimum standards rather than preempting state programs, preserving state flexibility to add requirements, and conditioning federal funding rather than imposing direct mandates.

### Preemption

The federal legislation establishes minimum standards that do not preempt more stringent state requirements. States retain authority to set higher training hour requirements, additional specialized credentials, and state-specific examination components. The Medicaid rate floor preempts lower state rates but does not prevent states from setting higher rates. Private insurance coverage requirements apply to plans subject to federal regulation under ERISA and the ACA; self-funded ERISA plans may require separate treatment.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through three mechanisms: (1) CMS annual compliance reviews for Medicaid coverage and rate adequacy; (2) SAMHSA certification of state programs as meeting national standards, with reciprocity contingent on certification; and (3) private complaints to state insurance commissioners and CMS for coverage denials. GAO conducts program evaluations at Year 5 and Year 10.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Rate floor based on percentage of counselor rate | States could lower their substance abuse counselor rate to minimize the peer rate floor | Medium | Add absolute minimum rate floor (e.g., no less than $18 per 15-minute unit) in addition to percentage-based floor |
| Grandfathering of existing certifications | Peer specialists with minimal training under current programs may remain certified indefinitely without meeting higher standards | Low | Require grandfathered peers to complete bridge training (difference between old and new requirements) within 3 years of renewal |
| State "equivalent" certifications that do not meet standards | States could declare existing programs "equivalent" without substantive alignment | Medium | Require SAMHSA to certify state program equivalence through formal review process, not state self-declaration |
| MCOs absorbing rate increases in overhead | Rate increases may not flow through to peer worker wages if MCOs or provider organizations retain the additional revenue | High | Require that at least 70% of any rate increase be passed through to direct peer worker compensation (wages and benefits) |
| Criminal background "relevance" determinations | States could interpret "relevant" criminal history broadly to exclude large numbers of potential peers | Medium | Publish federal guidance with specific examples of criminal histories that are and are not relevant to peer specialist roles; establish appeals process |
| Essential health benefit compliance through minimal coverage | Private insurers could technically cover peer services while imposing visit limits, prior authorization, or network restrictions that effectively deny access | High | Require parity compliance reviews specifically covering peer services; prohibit prior authorization for initial peer assessments |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| No dedicated funding for peer respite expansion | Peer respite programs remain dependent on separate grant legislation | Legislation focuses on workforce and coverage, not facility development | Pass complementary Peer Respite Expansion Act with $75 million annual authorization |
| Medicare billing code development timeline | Delays in CMS rulemaking could postpone Medicare coverage for 2+ years after enactment | Complex CMS billing code development process | Include statutory deadline of 18 months for billing code establishment with Congressional reporting requirement if deadline missed |
| Self-funded ERISA plans exempt from state insurance mandates | Large employer self-funded plans may not be required to cover peer services | ERISA preemption of state insurance regulation | Federal legislation must explicitly include self-funded ERISA plans under peer service coverage mandate |
| Limited research on peer support for specific populations | Evidence base is strongest for general adult mental health; weaker for youth, elderly, specific diagnoses | Research funding has not targeted population-specific studies | Research program priorities must include population-specific studies with set-asides |
| No mechanism for peer worker collective bargaining | Peer workers in many states lack union representation or collective bargaining rights | Peer workers classified as independent contractors by some employers | Include provisions clarifying that peer specialists employed by health organizations are employees entitled to labor protections |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Rate pass-through requirement**: Amend Section 2(c) to require states to include rate pass-through provisions in Medicaid managed care contracts, ensuring at least 70% of peer service rate increases flow to direct worker compensation.
2. **SAMHSA certification review**: Add provision requiring SAMHSA to conduct on-site reviews of state certification programs within 2 years of national standards publication, rather than relying on state self-reporting of compliance.
3. **Bridge training requirement**: Amend grandfathering provision to require existing certified peers to complete a bridge training program addressing any gap between their original training and the national minimum within 3 years.
4. **Absolute rate minimum**: Add statutory minimum of $18 per 15-minute unit regardless of the percentage-based floor, preventing states from gaming the rate floor through counselor rate manipulation.
5. **ERISA clarification**: Explicitly include self-funded employer plans in the peer support coverage mandate through amendment to ERISA Section 514.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The national certification standards should be reviewed and updated every 5 years by the Peer Support Standards Advisory Committee, with formal public comment periods. The workforce development program authorization should be reauthorized every 5 years, with reauthorization contingent on GAO evaluation of program effectiveness. The research program should have a 10-year initial authorization with mandatory mid-term review at Year 5 to assess whether the evidence base is developing as anticipated.
