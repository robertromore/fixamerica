# Peer Support Services: History

## Historical Development

The peer support movement in mental health did not emerge from the professional behavioral health establishment. It arose from the people the system was supposed to serve -- and often failed. The movement's roots lie in the psychiatric survivor and consumer movements of the 1970s, drawing on traditions of mutual aid that predate modern psychiatry by centuries. Its trajectory from radical grassroots activism to Medicaid-billable service reflects both remarkable progress and enduring tensions about who controls the narrative of mental health recovery.

### Mutual Aid Origins (Pre-1970): Peer Support Before the Movement

- **Alcoholics Anonymous (1935)**: The founding of AA established the foundational model of peer-based recovery support -- one person with lived experience helping another. The Twelve Step model demonstrated that non-professional, experiential expertise could sustain long-term recovery, a concept that would later transfer to mental health.
- **Fountain House (1948)**: Founded in New York City by former patients of Rockland State Hospital, Fountain House pioneered the "clubhouse model" -- a community of mutual support where people with serious mental illness worked alongside staff as equals. By the 1970s, the model had spread internationally.
- **Recovery Incorporated (1937)**: Founded by psychiatrist Abraham Low, this self-help group for people with psychiatric conditions emphasized cognitive self-management techniques led by peers, predating cognitive behavioral therapy by decades.
- **Historical context**: Mutual aid societies, settlement houses, and religious communities had long provided informal peer support for people in distress. The formal peer support movement drew on these traditions while explicitly rejecting the medical model's authority over personal experience.

### The Consumer/Survivor Movement (1970-1990): Radical Roots

- **Deinstitutionalization backdrop**: As state psychiatric hospitals discharged hundreds of thousands of patients in the 1960s and 1970s -- often into homelessness and inadequate community care -- former patients organized to demand voice, choice, and alternatives to coercive treatment.
- **Mental Patients' Liberation Project (1971)**: Founded in New York City, this was among the first organized groups of psychiatric survivors demanding civil rights, self-determination, and an end to forced treatment. Similar groups formed in Portland (Insane Liberation Front, 1970), Boston, and San Francisco.
- **Judi Chamberlin and *On Our Own* (1978)**: Chamberlin's landmark book articulated a comprehensive vision of patient-controlled alternatives to the psychiatric system. She argued that people with psychiatric histories possessed unique expertise and that peer-run services were not merely supplements to professional care but fundamentally superior for some purposes.
- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI, 1979)**: While primarily a family advocacy organization, NAMI's founding reflected the broader mobilization of people affected by mental illness, including consumers who would later advocate for peer roles within NAMI's structure.
- **Alternatives Conference (1985)**: SAMHSA's predecessor agency began funding annual national conferences organized by and for mental health consumers, providing a crucial convening space for the movement. The Alternatives Conference ran from 1985 to 2012.
- **Community Support Program**: NIMH's Community Support Program (established 1977) provided early federal recognition that consumer involvement in service planning and delivery was essential, though it stopped short of funding consumer-delivered services.

### Formalization and Federal Recognition (1990-2007): From Movement to Workforce

- **Americans with Disabilities Act (1990)**: The ADA prohibited discrimination against people with psychiatric disabilities in employment, laying groundwork for the argument that people with mental health histories should not be excluded from behavioral health jobs.
- **Consumer-Operated Service Programs (COSPs)**: In 1998, SAMHSA funded a multi-site study of consumer-operated service programs -- the first major federal research investment in peer-delivered services. The study, published in 2006 (Campbell et al.), found that COSP participation produced significant improvements in empowerment and well-being compared to traditional services alone.
- **New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003)**: President George W. Bush's New Freedom Commission issued a transformative report calling for a recovery-oriented mental health system. The report explicitly recommended expanding "the role of individuals in recovery" as providers of services, marking the highest-level federal endorsement of peer support to date.
- **Georgia's Certified Peer Specialist Program (2001)**: Georgia became the first state to develop a comprehensive peer specialist certification program and to seek Medicaid reimbursement for peer-delivered services. The Georgia model -- developed by Larry Fricks and colleagues at the Georgia Mental Health Consumer Network -- became the template for state programs nationwide.
- **SAMHSA Recovery Support Strategic Initiative (2005)**: SAMHSA formally adopted a recovery-oriented framework that identified peer support as a core component, publishing the first working definition of recovery that centered lived experience.
- **Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP, 1997)**: Mary Ellen Copeland developed WRAP, a structured self-management and crisis planning tool created by and for people with mental health conditions. WRAP became one of the first peer-developed interventions recognized by SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices.

### Medicaid Integration and Rapid Growth (2007-2018): Mainstreaming Peer Support

- **CMS State Medicaid Director Letter #07-011 (August 15, 2007)**: This landmark letter from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services authorized states to bill Medicaid for peer support services, provided that states established certification programs and clinical supervision requirements. The letter was the single most consequential policy development in peer support history, transforming peer workers from volunteer or grant-funded roles into a sustainable, reimbursable workforce.
- **Rapid state adoption (2007-2015)**: Following the CMS letter, states moved quickly to establish or formalize certification programs and file State Plan Amendments (SPAs) to bill Medicaid. By 2015, 38 states had approved Medicaid billing for peer services.
- **Affordable Care Act (2010)**: The ACA expanded Medicaid eligibility to millions of Americans, increasing the population eligible for peer services. Section 5313 authorized grants for community health workers, a category that included peer specialists.
- **Veterans Affairs Peer Specialist Program (2007-2012)**: The VA launched its peer specialist program in 2007, hiring veterans with mental health or substance use recovery experience to support other veterans. By 2012, the program employed over 800 peer specialists across VA medical centers, establishing peers as a recognized workforce category in the largest integrated healthcare system in the nation.
- **SAMHSA Bringing Recovery Supports to Scale (BRSS TACS, 2011)**: This technical assistance center provided states and organizations with tools to implement peer support services, develop certification programs, and navigate Medicaid billing requirements. BRSS TACS operated until 2022.
- **International Credentialing and Reciprocity Consortium (IC&RC)**: IC&RC began offering a national peer recovery support specialist credential, providing a portable certification that some states recognized. However, adoption remained limited due to state sovereignty over certification standards.

### Expansion and Contemporary Challenges (2018-Present): Scaling Under Pressure

- **SUPPORT Act (2018)**: The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act required Medicare coverage of opioid use disorder treatment services delivered by peer support specialists, marking the first time peer services were authorized under Medicare (for a specific condition).
- **COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2022)**: The pandemic simultaneously expanded demand for peer services (as mental health crises surged) and created new delivery mechanisms (telehealth peer support). Thirty-two states authorized telephonic or video-based peer services during this period. However, the pandemic also devastated the peer workforce through burnout, low wages, and lack of protective equipment in community settings.
- **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (2022)**: The launch of the 988 system created new roles for peer specialists in crisis follow-up, warm handoffs, and mobile response teams. SAMHSA guidance identified peers as essential members of crisis continuum staffing.
- **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022)**: This legislation provided $250 million in new funding for community mental health services, including peer support, and expanded Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) that are required to provide peer services.
- **Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (2017-present)**: The CCBHC model, initially authorized in 2014 and expanded through demonstration programs, requires peer support services as a condition of certification. As of 2024, over 500 CCBHCs operate in 46 states, creating guaranteed employment settings for peer specialists.
- **Ongoing workforce crisis**: Despite expansion of roles and settings, peer specialist wages have not kept pace with inflation, and annual turnover rates of 30-50% threaten the sustainability of the entire model.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Grassroots Innovation Precedes Institutional Adoption

Every major advance in peer support -- from AA's mutual aid model to Georgia's certification program to WRAP -- originated outside the formal behavioral health establishment. Peer innovations were developed by people with lived experience, often in opposition to professional orthodoxy, and were subsequently adopted by institutions only after proving their value. This pattern suggests that the most productive policy approach is to create conditions for grassroots experimentation rather than imposing top-down program designs.

### Pattern 2: Federal Policy Catalyzes State Action

The 2007 CMS letter triggered more state-level peer support infrastructure development than two decades of advocacy had achieved. Similarly, the SUPPORT Act (2018) and CCBHC expansion created structural incentives that accelerated peer workforce growth. This demonstrates that federal policy signals -- particularly those tied to funding -- are the most powerful levers for scaling peer support, even though implementation necessarily occurs at the state and local levels.

### Pattern 3: Professionalization Creates Both Opportunity and Risk

The trajectory from radical consumer movement to Medicaid-billable service has brought financial sustainability and institutional recognition but has also created tensions. Certification requirements, clinical supervision mandates, and documentation burdens risk transforming peer support from a mutual, non-hierarchical relationship into a quasi-clinical service that mirrors the professional system it was designed to complement. Each step toward professionalization requires vigilance to preserve the core values of mutuality, self-determination, and experiential expertise.

### Pattern 4: Workforce Sustainability Lags Behind Role Expansion

The history of peer support shows a recurring pattern: new roles and settings for peer workers are created faster than the infrastructure to sustain them. The VA program, CCBHC requirements, 988 integration, and emergency department peer programs have all expanded demand for peer specialists without corresponding investments in wages, career pathways, and organizational support. This supply-demand imbalance threatens to undermine the quality and reputation of the peer model.
