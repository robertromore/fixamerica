# School-Based Mental Health: Current State

## Student Mental Health Prevalence

The youth mental health crisis that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic has not abated. Multiple federal data sources confirm elevated rates of psychological distress, suicidal behavior, and clinical disorders among school-age children and adolescents.

### Prevalence Data

Youth mental health burden is unevenly distributed across racial, gender, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic lines.

| Population | Key Finding | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Female students | 53% reported persistent sadness/hopelessness vs. 29% of male students | CDC YRBS, 2024 |
| LGBTQ+ students | 65% reported persistent sadness/hopelessness; 22% attempted suicide | CDC YRBS, 2024 |
| Black youth (ages 10-24) | Suicide rate increased 36.6% from 2018 to 2023 | CDC WONDER, 2024 |
| American Indian/Alaska Native youth | Highest suicide rate among youth: 20.9 per 100,000 (2023) | CDC WONDER, 2024 |
| Students in poverty | 2.5x more likely to experience 2+ adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) | NSCH, 2023 |
| Rural students | 35% less likely to receive school-based mental health services | NCES Rural Education Report, 2023 |

### Workforce Demographics and Pipeline

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total school counselors (FTEs) | ~128,800 | BLS/ASCA, 2024 |
| Total school psychologists (FTEs) | ~44,000 | NASP, 2024 |
| Total school social workers (FTEs) | ~30,100 | BLS, 2024 |
| Unfilled school counselor positions | ~19,000 | EdWeek Research Center, 2024 |
| Unfilled school psychologist positions | ~9,500 | NASP Workforce Survey, 2023 |

| Annual school psychology graduates | ~2,700 | NASP, 2023 |

### Workforce Challenges

- **Compensation Gap**: School psychologists earn a median of $84,940 compared to $106,510 for clinical psychologists in non-school settings, a 25% gap (BLS, 2024)
- **Diversity Deficit**: 86% of school psychologists are white, while 54% of public school students are students of color (NASP, 2023; NCES, 2024)
- **Training Bottleneck**: Only ~2,700 new school psychologists graduate annually, while retirement and turnover remove ~3,100 per year (NASP, 2023)
- **Role Overload**: ASCA reports that 72% of school counselors spend more than 20% of their time on non-counseling duties such as test coordination, scheduling, and administrative tasks (ASCA, 2024)

## Federal Funding Landscape

### Current Federal Funding Streams

| Program | Authorization | FY2024 Funding | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| ESSA Title IV-A (Student Support and Academic Enrichment) | ESSA, 2015 | $1.28 billion | Safe/healthy students; includes mental health |
| IDEA Part B (Grants to States) | IDEA, 2004 | $14.4 billion | Special education; includes related mental health services |
| Bipartisan Safer Communities Act - School Mental Health | Pub. L. 117-159, 2022 | ~$200 million/yr (of $1B over 5 years) | School-based mental health professionals and services |
| BSCA - Community Mental Health Services for Children | Pub. L. 117-159, 2022 | ~$80 million/yr | Community-based mental health services for youth |
| Project AWARE (Advancing Wellness and Resilience in Education) | SAMHSA | $131 million (FY2024) | Youth mental health awareness and support |
| School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program | Dept. of Education | $140 million (FY2024) | Hiring school mental health professionals |
| Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grant | Dept. of Education | $31 million (FY2024) | Training pipelines for school mental health |
| Medicaid in Schools (school-based services) | Medicaid statute | ~$5.6 billion (FY2023 est.) | Reimbursement for health services in schools |

### ESSER Fund Expiration

The Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) funds represented the largest-ever single investment in school mental health, but these funds were temporary.

| ESSER Round | Total Funding | Mental Health Allocation (est.) | Expiration |
|---|---|---|---|
| ESSER I (CARES Act, 2020) | $13.2 billion | ~$1.3 billion (est. 10%) | September 2022 |
| ESSER II (CRRSA, 2021) | $54.3 billion | ~$5.4 billion (est. 10%) | September 2023 |
| ESSER III (ARP, 2021) | $122.0 billion | ~$12.2 billion (est. 10%) | September 2024 |
| **Total ESSER** | **$189.5 billion** | **~$18.9 billion** | **Expired** |

*Note: ESSER did not earmark specific mental health percentages; estimates based on district spending reports compiled by FutureEd (Georgetown University, 2024).*

The expiration of ESSER III in September 2024 created an "ESSER cliff" affecting mental health staffing. The EdWeek Research Center (2024) estimated that 27% of districts that hired mental health staff using ESSER funds were unable to retain those positions after expiration.

## Service Delivery Models

### Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS)

MTSS provides a framework for organizing school mental health services into three tiers of increasing intensity.

| Tier | Target Population | Examples | Implementation Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1: Universal | All students (100%) | SEL curricula, mental health literacy, positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS) | ~72% of schools report some Tier 1 programs (NCES, 2024) |
| Tier 2: Targeted | At-risk students (~15-20%) | Small group counseling, check-in/check-out systems, mentoring programs | ~56% of schools report Tier 2 services (NCES, 2024) |
| Tier 3: Intensive | High-need students (~3-5%) | Individual therapy, crisis intervention, psychiatric referral, IEP-based services | ~41% of schools report access to Tier 3 services (NCES, 2024) |

### School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total SBHCs nationally | ~3,000 | School-Based Health Alliance, 2023 |
| Schools served by SBHCs | ~2,600 | School-Based Health Alliance, 2023 |
| SBHCs offering mental health services | 70% | School-Based Health Alliance, 2023 |
| Students served annually by SBHCs | ~6.3 million | School-Based Health Alliance, 2023 |
| SBHCs in Title I schools | 58% | School-Based Health Alliance, 2023 |
| Average SBHC mental health visits per year | ~12,500 per center | SBHA National Census, 2022 |

### Threat Assessment Programs

Following the Parkland Commission recommendations and BSCA provisions, behavioral threat assessment teams have expanded significantly.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| States requiring or recommending threat assessment teams | 38 states (2024) | Everytown for Gun Safety, 2024 |
| Schools with formal threat assessment teams | ~64% of secondary schools | NCES School Survey on Safety, 2024 |
| BSCA-funded threat assessment training programs | 42 state programs | DOJ/DOE Joint Report, 2024 |

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Key Federal Laws

| Law/Regulation | Year | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)** | 1975/2004 | Requires free appropriate public education (FAPE) including related mental health services for eligible students |
| **Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act** | 1973 | Prohibits disability discrimination; mandates accommodations including mental health supports |
| **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)** | 1974 | Governs access to and privacy of student education records including mental health records |
| **Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA)** | 1978 | Requires parental consent for surveys on sensitive topics including mental health |
| **Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)** | 2015 | Title IV-A funds safe/healthy school environments; Title II supports professional development |
| **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (BSCA)** | 2022 | $1 billion for school mental health; under-21 background check improvements; threat assessment funding |
| **Mental Health Reform Act** | 2022 (part of BSCA) | Reauthorized and expanded SAMHSA school mental health programs |

### FERPA and Student Mental Health Records

FERPA creates specific challenges for school mental health practice:

- **Education Records**: Mental health records created by school employees acting in their professional capacity (e.g., school counselors) are education records subject to FERPA
- **Treatment Records Exception**: Records made by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or recognized professional maintained for treatment purposes are exempt from FERPA, but only if not disclosed to anyone other than the treating provider
- **Health/Safety Emergency Exception**: Schools may disclose records without consent if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect health or safety of the student or others
- **Parental Access**: Parents generally have the right to inspect student education records until the student turns 18 or enrolls in postsecondary education

## Geographic Variation

### Urban-Rural Disparities

| Metric | Urban Schools | Suburban Schools | Rural Schools | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Student-to-counselor ratio | 348:1 | 364:1 | 441:1 | ASCA, 2024 |
| Schools with any SBHC | 14% | 7% | 4% | SBHA, 2023 |
| Schools with licensed mental health provider on staff | 78% | 71% | 52% | NCES, 2024 |
| Schools using telemental health | 38% | 29% | 46% | NCES, 2024 |
| Access to community referral resources (within 30 min) | 89% | 82% | 41% | HRSA HPSA data, 2024 |

Rural schools show notably higher adoption of telemental health services (46%) compared to urban (38%) and suburban (29%) schools, reflecting the use of technology to compensate for geographic access barriers (NCES, 2024).

### State Policy Variation

States differ widely in their school mental health requirements:

| Policy Area | States Requiring | States Recommending | No Policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Student-to-counselor ratio mandate | 5 | 12 | 33 |
| SEL standards in K-12 | 27 + D.C. | 8 | 15 |
| Mental health education in curriculum | 23 | 11 | 16 |
| Suicide prevention training for staff | 32 | 9 | 9 |
| Threat assessment teams in schools | 21 (mandate) | 17 (recommend) | 12 |
| School-based Medicaid billing | 50 + D.C. (all states allow) | -- | -- |

## Recent Trends

### Post-Pandemic Developments (2020-2025)

- **ESSER-Funded Expansion (2021-2024)**: Approximately 60% of districts used ESSER funds to hire mental health staff or expand services; these positions are now at risk as funds expired (FutureEd, 2024)
- **SEL Backlash (2021-present)**: At least 14 states introduced legislation to restrict or prohibit social-emotional learning curricula, with 4 enacting restrictions as of 2024 (Education Week, 2024)
- **Telehealth Expansion**: School-based telemental health programs increased from 12% of schools pre-pandemic to 35% in 2024, driven by provider shortages and federal flexibilities (NCES, 2024)
- **Medicaid Billing Reform**: CMS issued a 2023 final rule expanding Medicaid school-based services reimbursement by removing the requirement that services be tied to IEP/IFSP plans, potentially increasing revenue by $1.5-2 billion annually (CMS, 2023)
- **BSCA Implementation**: As of January 2025, the Department of Education has awarded $840 million of the $1 billion authorized under BSCA school mental health provisions to over 300 grantees in 48 states (Dept. of Education, 2025)

### Youth Mental Health Trends (5-Year View)

| Indicator | 2019 Value | 2023 Value | Change | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HS students with persistent sadness/hopelessness | 37% | 40% | +3 pp | Peak of 42% in 2021 |
| HS students considering suicide | 19% | 20% | +1 pp | Peak of 22% in 2021 |
| Anxiety diagnoses, ages 3-17 | 7.1% (2016) | 9.4% | +2.3 pp | Steady increase |
| Youth suicide rate, ages 10-24 | 10.7 per 100k | 11.1 per 100k | +3.7% | Male rate 3.8x female rate |
| Children on psychotropic medication | 7.5% | 8.9% | +1.4 pp | Sharp increase ages 6-12 |

## Emerging Challenges

### Social Media and Digital Mental Health

The U.S. Surgeon General's 2023 advisory on social media and youth mental health identified "a profound risk of harm" to adolescent mental health. Schools increasingly face the intersection of social media-driven crises (cyberbullying, sextortion, social comparison) and in-school behavioral responses, yet lack clear authority or tools to address online harms.

### Artificial Intelligence in Schools

AI-driven screening tools (e.g., Bark, Gaggle, GoGuardian) are used in over 12,000 school districts to monitor student communications for signs of self-harm, violence, or substance use (CDT, 2024). These tools raise significant privacy, accuracy, and equity concerns, with studies showing higher false-positive rates for Black and LGBTQ+ students (Cardona-Rivera et al., 2024).

### Workforce Sustainability After ESSER

The expiration of ESSER funds in September 2024 created immediate staffing pressures. The National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE, 2024) estimated that states faced a combined loss of ~18,000 school-based mental health positions funded by temporary federal money. Districts that relied on ESSER for over 40% of their mental health staffing face the sharpest reductions.

### Climate Anxiety and Eco-Distress

Research from the American Psychological Association (2023) identified climate anxiety as an emerging mental health concern among K-12 students, with 45% of young people (ages 16-25) reporting that climate change negatively affects their daily functioning and feelings about the future (Hickman et al., 2021; replicated in U.S. samples, APA 2023).
