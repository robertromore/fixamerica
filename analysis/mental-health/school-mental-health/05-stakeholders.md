# School-Based Mental Health: Stakeholders

The school mental health system is shaped by the interactions of students, families, educators, mental health professionals, policymakers, advocacy organizations, and the private sector, each with distinct interests, resources, and levels of power.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| K-12 public school students | Direct recipients of (or denied) mental health services; academic, behavioral, and emotional outcomes depend on service availability | 49.6 million (NCES, 2024) | Access to timely, confidential, culturally responsive mental health support |
| Students with disabilities (IEPs) | Entitled to mental health "related services" under IDEA; face eligibility determination, service adequacy, and transition challenges | 7.5 million (~15% of students) (NCES, 2024) | Adequate and consistent delivery of IEP-mandated mental health services |
| LGBTQ+ students | Disproportionately affected by mental health challenges; 65% report persistent sadness/hopelessness (CDC YRBS, 2024); face unique barriers to accessing supportive services | ~3.5 million (est. 7% of students, Williams Institute, 2023) | Safe, affirming school environments; confidential access to mental health services without mandatory parental disclosure |
| Students in poverty (Title I eligible) | Higher rates of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), trauma exposure, and unmet mental health needs; least access to community alternatives | ~26 million (~52% of students qualify for free/reduced lunch, NCES, 2024) | Free, accessible mental health services at school; wraparound support services |
| Parents and families | Responsible for children's health decisions; affected by parental consent/notification policies; diverse values regarding mental health intervention | ~37 million households with school-age children (Census, 2023) | Informed about and involved in their child's mental health care; alignment of school programming with family values |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Classroom teachers**: Bear the daily burden of student mental health crises in instructional settings; 77% of teachers report spending time each week addressing student mental health issues (RAND, 2023); directly impacted by student behavioral disruption and their own vicarious trauma
- **School administrators (principals and superintendents)**: Responsible for allocating building-level resources, managing staff, and navigating community politics around mental health programming; liable for safety failures
- **Higher education institutions**: Train the school mental health workforce; their capacity determines the pipeline of new professionals
- **Juvenile justice system**: Receives referrals from schools for behavioral issues; overlaps with school mental health through school-to-prison pipeline dynamics
- **Health insurers and managed care organizations**: Bear costs when school-based services are unavailable and students present in emergency departments or community clinics
- **Employers (long-term)**: Workforce readiness depends on mental health outcomes; untreated youth mental health conditions reduce future economic productivity

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Authorizes and funds federal school mental health programs (IDEA, ESSA, BSCA) | Legislative and appropriations power | Federal budget | High |
| U.S. Department of Education | Administers BSCA grants, ESSA Title IV-A, IDEA Part B; issues guidance on FERPA, mental health services | Regulatory and grant-making authority | ~$16 billion in relevant programs (FY2024) | High |
| State legislatures | Set school staffing mandates, SEL curriculum requirements, parental consent laws, mental health education requirements | Legislative authority over K-12 education | State education budgets (varies widely) | High |
| State education agencies (SEAs) | Implement federal programs, distribute state funds, set certification standards for school mental health professionals | Regulatory and administrative authority | Varies by state | Medium-High |
| Local school boards | Adopt mental health policies, approve budgets, hire superintendents, respond to community concerns about programming | Local governance authority over public schools | Local property tax revenue and per-pupil allocations | Medium-High |
| Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) | Sets rules for school-based Medicaid billing; 2023 rule expanded reimbursement eligibility | Federal regulatory authority over Medicaid | ~$5.6 billion in school Medicaid (FY2023 est.) | Medium |
| SAMHSA | Administers Project AWARE, mental health block grants, and technical assistance programs | Grant-making and program development | $131 million (Project AWARE, FY2024) | Medium |

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Professional associations (ASCA, NASP, SSWAA, NASN) + teachers' unions (AFT, NEA) | Increased school mental health staffing and protected role definitions | Strong -- consistent advocacy and aligned membership interests |
| Mental health advocacy orgs (NAMI, MHA) + school safety orgs (Sandy Hook Promise, Everytown) | Expanded school mental health services and funding | Strong -- overlapping policy agendas post-Uvalde |
| Bipartisan legislators (those who supported BSCA) + school districts + professional associations | Sustainable federal funding for school mental health | Moderate -- agreement on need but divergence on scope and approach |
| Parents + school boards + educators | Student safety and wellbeing | Moderate -- broad agreement on goals but disagreement on methods (SEL, screening, consent) |
| CMS + school districts + school-based health centers | Expanded Medicaid school-based billing | Strong -- shared financial interest in maximizing reimbursement |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Parents' rights advocates vs. school mental health professionals**: Parents' rights groups demand opt-in consent for all mental health services and full parental notification; clinicians argue that mandatory parental notification can endanger students at risk of abuse or in crisis
- **Academic accountability advocates vs. school counselors**: Administrators focused on test scores prefer to use counselors for test coordination and scheduling; counselors and professional associations insist on protected time for counseling services
- **Privacy advocates vs. threat assessment teams**: FERPA protections and student privacy principles conflict with the information-sharing needs of behavioral threat assessment teams charged with preventing school violence
- **SEL supporters vs. SEL opponents**: CASEL and evidence-based SEL proponents argue for universal implementation; conservative parents' organizations view SEL as ideological programming and demand parental opt-out or curriculum restrictions
- **Federal mandates vs. local control advocates**: Federal funding comes with compliance requirements that some state officials and school boards view as overreach into local education governance

### The School Mental Health Iron Triangle

The school mental health policy space features an informal iron triangle connecting:

1. **Congressional education and health committees**: Authorize and fund school mental health programs
2. **Department of Education and SAMHSA**: Administer grants and issue guidance
3. **Professional associations (ASCA, NASP, SSWAA) and advocacy organizations (NAMI, School-Based Health Alliance)**: Lobby for expanded funding and provide data to support legislative action

This triangle has been effective at securing incremental funding increases (e.g., BSCA, ESSA Title IV-A) but has been unable to achieve transformative funding levels or overcome the fragmented multi-stream structure.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on policy:

- **Lobbying**: ASCA, NASP, and NAMI collectively spend approximately $3.2 million annually on federal lobbying for school mental health legislation (OpenSecrets, 2024). Teachers' unions (AFT, NEA) spend significantly more ($40+ million combined across all education issues) but include school mental health in their broader education agenda
- **Campaign Contributions**: Education-related PACs contribute modestly to congressional campaigns; school mental health is rarely a top-tier campaign issue but has gained salience since Uvalde
- **Public Advocacy**: Sandy Hook Promise and Everytown for Gun Safety run high-profile media campaigns linking school safety to mental health; anti-SEL organizations use social media and parent networks to mobilize opposition at school board meetings
- **Expertise and Data**: NASP and NCSMH produce workforce studies and program evaluations that directly shape legislative findings sections; CASEL's SEL evidence base informs state curriculum standards; the CDC's YRBS provides the most-cited data on youth mental health prevalence
- **School Board Elections**: Since 2021, school mental health programming (particularly SEL) has become a factor in school board races, with organized campaigns to elect candidates who oppose or support specific mental health programming approaches
- **Litigation**: Disability rights organizations and individual families use IDEA due process hearings and federal court litigation to enforce mental health service obligations, creating case law that shapes school district practices
