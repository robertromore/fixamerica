# School-Based Mental Health

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of mental health services and supports within the K-12 education system, including school counselors, school psychologists, school social workers, school-based health centers, and the policies governing student mental health identification, intervention, and treatment.

## Overview

The mental health of America's 49.6 million public school students has become one of the defining policy challenges of the 2020s. Schools serve as the primary point of mental health contact for many children and adolescents, with an estimated 80% of youth who receive mental health services accessing them through schools (NCES, 2023). Yet chronic understaffing, fragmented funding streams, contentious debates over social-emotional learning curricula, and unresolved tensions between parental rights and student welfare have left school-based mental health systems unable to meet surging demand.

This analysis examines the workforce pipeline for school counselors, psychologists, and social workers; the regulatory frameworks including IDEA, Section 504, and FERPA; federal funding mechanisms such as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds; and the implementation of evidence-based approaches including multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS) and trauma-informed practices. It explores the political dimensions of school mental health -- from social-emotional learning (SEL) debates to parental consent requirements -- and proposes a comprehensive policy framework for ensuring every student has access to adequate mental health support.
