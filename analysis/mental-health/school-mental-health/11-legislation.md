# School-Based Mental Health: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to school mental health reform requires both federal and state action, combining new authorizations with optimization of existing programs. The strategy is primarily incremental rather than constitutional, building on established federal authority under the Spending Clause and existing statutory frameworks (IDEA, ESSA, BSCA, Medicaid). Federal legislation establishes the workforce pipeline, funding mechanisms, and accountability standards, while state model legislation addresses staffing mandates, parental consent frameworks, and counselor role protections that are more appropriately enacted at the state level. No constitutional amendments are required.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for this reform.* School mental health policy operates within well-established federal authority under the Spending Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1) -- the same constitutional basis as IDEA, ESSA, and Medicaid. Federal conditions on voluntary grant programs do not implicate Tenth Amendment concerns as established in *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), provided conditions are not coercive under *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012).

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish a comprehensive framework for expanding the school-based
mental health workforce, protecting school counselor clinical roles,
and creating sustainable funding for school mental health services.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "School Mental Health Workforce and
Services Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey (2024), 40
    percent of high school students reported persistent feelings of
    sadness or hopelessness in 2023, 20 percent seriously considered
    suicide, and 10 percent attempted suicide in the prior 12 months.

(2) An estimated 80 percent of children who receive mental health
    services access them at school, making schools the primary point
    of mental health contact for American youth (NCES, 2023).

(3) The national student-to-school-counselor ratio of 385:1
    exceeds the American School Counselor Association's recommended
    maximum of 250:1, and the student-to-school-psychologist ratio
    of 1,127:1 exceeds the National Association of School
    Psychologists' recommended 500:1 (ASCA, 2024; NASP, 2024).

(4) Emergency department visits for mental health crises among
    children aged 5 to 17 increased 28 percent between 2019 and
    2023 (HHS, 2024).

(5) Schools nationally leave an estimated $2,000,000,000 to
    $4,000,000,000 annually in unclaimed Medicaid reimbursements
    for services already provided, primarily due to administrative
    barriers (Avalere Health, 2023).

(6) The expiration of ESSER funds in September 2024 resulted in the
    loss of approximately 18,000 school-based mental health
    positions funded by temporary federal money (NASBE, 2024).

(7) Research demonstrates that every $1 invested in school-based
    mental health services generates an estimated $11 return through
    reduced emergency department visits, juvenile justice
    involvement, and special education costs (Belfield et al., 2015).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL.--The term "school mental
    health professional" means a school counselor, school
    psychologist, school social worker, or school-based marriage and
    family therapist who is licensed or certified under State law.

(2) HIGH-NEED LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY.--The term "high-need local
    educational agency" means a local educational agency--
    (A) in which not less than 50 percent of enrolled students are

        B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et
        seq.); or
    (B) that is located in a Mental Health Professional Shortage
        Area as designated by the Health Resources and Services
        Administration; or

        400:1 or the student-to-school-psychologist ratio exceeds
        1,500:1.

(3) ASCA NATIONAL MODEL.--The term "ASCA National Model" means the
    comprehensive school counseling program framework established by
    the American School Counselor Association, or successor
    framework.

(4) EVIDENCE-BASED.--The term "evidence-based" has the meaning
    given the term in section 8101(21) of the Elementary and

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual basis for congressional action using current data on youth mental health prevalence, workforce shortages, and economic impacts. These findings support the exercise of Spending Clause authority.
- **Section 4 (Service Corps)**: Creates the scholarship pipeline with service obligations modeled on the National Health Service Corps. Priority for underrepresented groups addresses the workforce diversity deficit (86% of school psychologists are white vs. 54% of students being students of color).
- **Section 5 (Protected Roles)**: Conditions Title IV-A funding (an existing voluntary federal program) on protected counselor roles, following the *South Dakota v. Dole* framework. The 3-year implementation timeline provides transition time.
- **Section 7 (Compensation)**: State matching requirement ensures shared investment and reduces political opposition to federal salary interventions.
- **Section 10 (Appropriations)**: Ramped authorization reflects the phased implementation timeline, with full funding reached in Year 5.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| DOE publishes proposed rules for Corps scholarships | 180 days after enactment | Department of Education |
| First scholarship awards | 1 year after enactment | DOE / HRSA |
| States notified of protected counselor role requirements | 1 year after enactment | DOE |
| Partnership grant RFP issued | 1 year after enactment | DOE / SAMHSA |
| State compliance with protected counselor role requirements | 3 years after enactment | State education agencies |
| First Corps graduates enter workforce | 4-5 years after enactment | Training programs |

**Regulatory Authority**: The Department of Education would administer the Corps, protected role requirements, and partnership grants. HRSA would provide technical assistance on workforce distribution. CMS would coordinate Medicaid billing optimization (under existing authority).

**Challenges**:

- **Appropriations risk**: Authorization does not guarantee funding. Annual appropriations must match authorization levels for the program to succeed
- **Training capacity lag**: Graduate program expansion requires accreditation processes that take 2-3 years, creating lag before the pipeline can fully scale
- **State resistance**: Some states may decline Title IV-A funding rather than adopt protected counselor role requirements

**Refinements**:

- **Alternative certification pathways**: Add provisions for experienced community mental health professionals to receive expedited credentialing for school-based practice, supplementing the graduate pipeline
- **Maintenance of effort**: Include state maintenance-of-effort requirements to prevent states from reducing their own school mental health investments as federal funding increases

## State Model Legislation

### Model School Mental Health Staffing and Services Act

**Purpose**: Establish state-level requirements for school mental health professional staffing ratios, parental consent frameworks, and Medicaid billing optimization.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize staffing ratio targets based on current levels and fiscal capacity, with all states required to adopt a glide path toward ASCA/NASP recommended ratios. Parental consent provisions should be adapted to existing state minor consent laws. Medicaid provisions require coordination with state Medicaid agency.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] School
Mental Health Staffing and Services Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(a) The student-to-school-counselor ratio in [State] is [X]:1,
    exceeding the nationally recommended ratio of 250:1.

(b) [State-specific data on youth mental health prevalence].

(c) Research demonstrates that lower student-to-counselor ratios
    are associated with improved student attendance, behavior, and
    academic achievement.

SECTION 3. STAFFING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) Each school district shall, within 5 years of the effective
    date of this Act, achieve a student-to-school-counselor ratio
    of no more than 250:1 and a student-to-school-psychologist
    ratio of no more than 500:1.

(b) The State Board of Education shall establish interim annual
    ratio targets for each district based on current staffing
    levels.

(c) Districts that fail to meet interim targets shall submit
    corrective action plans to the State Board of Education.

    coordination, student scheduling unrelated to academic
    counseling, or disciplinary enforcement duties.

SECTION 5. TIERED PARENTAL CONSENT FRAMEWORK.

(a) TIER 1 (UNIVERSAL PROGRAMS).--For classroom-based mental
    health literacy and social-emotional learning programs, school
    districts shall provide written notification to parents at the
    beginning of each school year and shall offer an opt-out
    procedure. All curriculum materials shall be publicly available
    for parental review.

(b) TIER 2 (TARGETED SERVICES).--For targeted group counseling,
    mentoring, or behavioral intervention programs, school
    districts shall obtain active written parental consent before

    therapy services, school districts shall obtain active written
    parental consent before initiating services.

(d) SAFETY EXCEPTION.--A licensed school mental health professional
    may provide crisis intervention services without prior parental
    consent when there is reasonable belief of imminent risk of
    self-harm or harm to others. Parents shall be notified within
    24 hours of crisis intervention unless notification would
    endanger the student, as determined by the licensed
    professional.

SECTION 6. MEDICAID BILLING OPTIMIZATION.

(a) The [State Medicaid Agency] shall, within 1 year of the
    effective date of this Act, submit a State Plan Amendment to
    CMS to implement the expanded school-based services
    reimbursement authority under the 2023 CMS final rule.

(b) The State Board of Education, in coordination with the [State
    Medicaid Agency], shall provide technical assistance and
    billing infrastructure support to all school districts.

(c) Not less than 85 percent of Medicaid revenue generated from
    school-based services shall be directed to direct mental health
    service delivery rather than administrative costs.

SECTION 7. APPROPRIATIONS.

There is appropriated from the [State General Fund] the sum of
$[amount] for the first fiscal year following the effective date
of this Act for the purpose of implementing this Act, including
transition grants to school districts for staffing, billing
infrastructure, and training.

SECTION 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: U.S. Department of Education (Corps scholarships, protected counselor roles, partnership grants). CMS (Medicaid billing coordination). SAMHSA (mental health literacy curriculum, technical assistance).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Corps Scholarship Regulations**: Define scholarship amounts, application procedures, service obligation terms, deferment and forgiveness provisions, and penalties for non-compliance. Statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment.
2. **Protected Counselor Role Standards**: Define allowable and prohibited counselor activities, compliance monitoring procedures, and enforcement mechanisms for Title IV-A conditions. Statutory deadline: 1 year after enactment.
3. **Partnership Grant Program Rules**: Define eligible partnerships, allowable uses of funds, reporting requirements, and evaluation standards. Statutory deadline: 1 year after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Funding conditions**: Non-compliant states risk loss of Title IV-A funding for the protected counselor role requirement, following established precedent under IDEA and ESSA
- **Administrative monitoring**: Annual compliance reporting through existing ESSA consolidated state plans
- **Private right of action**: IDEA's existing private right of action and due process procedures remain available for students denied mental health related services
- **Inspector General oversight**: DOE Office of Inspector General empowered to audit Corps scholarship compliance and grant expenditures

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: Federal school mental health legislation operates under Congress's Spending Clause power (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1), conditioned on states' voluntary acceptance of federal funds. This is the same constitutional basis as IDEA (enacted 1975, upheld repeatedly), ESSA, and Medicaid. Under *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), conditions must be (1) related to the federal interest in the program, (2) unambiguous, and (3) not coercive. The protected counselor role requirement is directly related to the federal interest in effective use of Title IV-A funds for student mental health.

**Coercion Analysis**: Under *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), conditions that are so punitive as to leave states no real choice are unconstitutional. The Title IV-A protected counselor role condition affects only one funding stream (~$1.28 billion nationally), representing a small fraction of total state education budgets. This falls well within the permissible range under *Dole* and does not approach the coercion threshold identified in *NFIB*.

**Parental Rights**: The tiered consent framework respects the parental rights recognized in *Troxel v. Granville*, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), by providing parental notification, opt-out, and active consent at appropriate tiers. The narrow safety exception for imminent harm is supported by the state's parens patriae authority and analogous to existing exceptions in child abuse reporting mandates.

### Preemption

Federal legislation would establish minimum standards but would not preempt state laws providing greater protections for students or parents. States that already exceed the federal protected counselor role standard or that have more protective parental consent frameworks would not be affected. Express savings clauses should preserve state authority over education governance, licensure, and scope of practice for school mental health professionals.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance monitoring would be integrated into existing ESSA consolidated state plan reporting, minimizing additional administrative burden. The DOE's existing compliance infrastructure for IDEA and ESSA would be leveraged rather than creating new enforcement bureaucracy. States would self-report on staffing ratios, counselor time allocation, and Medicaid billing participation annually.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| "80% time" calculation gaming | Districts could define "indirect student services" broadly to include administrative tasks, meeting the 80% threshold without actually protecting counselor clinical time | High | Regulatory definition of allowable "indirect services" aligned with ASCA National Model categories; require annual time-use audits for a random sample of districts |
| Service commitment evasion | Corps scholarship recipients could serve the minimum 4 years in high-need districts then immediately relocate to wealthier districts | Medium | Add a graduated service incentive: additional loan forgiveness or bonus for service beyond 4 years; establish continuing education credits tied to ongoing high-need service |
| Competitive grant capture by well-resourced districts | Partnership grants could be disproportionately captured by districts with sophisticated grant-writing capacity, as has occurred with BSCA grants | High | Require that at least 60% of partnership grants be awarded to high-need LEAs; provide grant-writing technical assistance to under-resourced districts; use simplified application processes for small districts |
| Medicaid billing without service expansion | Districts could optimize billing for existing services without expanding service capacity, converting the revenue stream into a general fund supplement | Medium | Require that at least 85% of new Medicaid revenue be directed to direct mental health services; mandate annual reporting on service volume alongside billing revenue |
| State opt-out from Title IV-A | States opposed to protected counselor roles could decline Title IV-A funding entirely rather than comply, losing the funding but avoiding the mandate | Low | Title IV-A represents a relatively small portion of federal education funding; states that decline would lose both the mandate and the funding. Alternative: incentive-based approach through bonus grants for compliant states |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| 4-5 year workforce pipeline lag | No significant improvement in staffing ratios until Year 4-5 of implementation | Graduate training requirements (3 years for school psychology plus 1-year internship) | Bridge funding to retain ESSER-hired staff; telehealth expansion for immediate capacity; alternative certification for experienced community MH professionals |
| State match requirement disadvantages low-revenue states | States with limited fiscal capacity may be unable to match federal compensation supplements, leaving their school MH professionals uncompensated relative to wealthier states | Federal matching structure designed to share costs | Tiered matching: 50% match for states above median income; 25% match for states below median; 0% match for states in lowest quartile of fiscal capacity |
| Rural provider shortage persists | Even with scholarships, some rural areas may lack sufficient applicants willing to serve | Geographic isolation, limited professional community, housing costs | Add rural-specific incentives (housing allowances, telehealth equipment grants, reduced service commitment for extreme shortage areas); fund hub-and-spoke models connecting rural schools to regional MH centers |
| Political vulnerability of SEL/mental health literacy | Mental health literacy curriculum may face the same political backlash as SEL despite efforts to depoliticize | Broader cultural polarization affecting all school-based programming | Statutory requirement for transparent, nonpartisan curriculum development; mandatory parental review periods; local adaptation provisions; sunset and reauthorization review |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Time-use audit requirement**: Add regulatory provision requiring annual time-use surveys of school counselors in a statistically representative sample of districts in each state, with results published in the annual DOE report to Congress. Districts found non-compliant would receive technical assistance before facing funding consequences.

2. **Graduated service incentives**: Amend Corps scholarship provisions to include additional benefits for service beyond the 4-year minimum: $5,000 annual bonus for years 5-7 of service in high-need settings; complete forgiveness of any remaining educational debt after 7 years of continuous high-need service.

3. **Equity set-aside for partnership grants**: Add statutory requirement that not less than 60% of partnership grant funds be awarded to high-need LEAs, with a simplified application process for districts with fewer than 5,000 enrolled students.

4. **Revenue allocation requirement**: Add regulatory provision requiring districts that increase Medicaid billing revenue to demonstrate corresponding increases in mental health service volume (measured in service hours or student contacts) proportional to revenue increases.

5. **Fiscal capacity-adjusted matching**: Amend the compensation supplement matching requirement to use a tiered structure based on state fiscal capacity, ensuring that the lowest-resourced states can participate without prohibitive matching requirements.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Corps scholarship program should be authorized for an initial 10-year period with mandatory GAO evaluation at Year 5 and Year 8. The evaluation should assess progress toward ratio targets, geographic distribution of graduates, retention rates, and cost-effectiveness compared to alternative workforce strategies. Reauthorization should be required after 10 years, with the Year 8 evaluation informing reauthorization decisions.

The partnership grant program should include a 7-year sunset with evaluation at Year 4 to assess whether partnerships are sustainable beyond grant funding and whether school-community integration is occurring as intended.
