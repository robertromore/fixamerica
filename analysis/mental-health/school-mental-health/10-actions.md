# School-Based Mental Health: What You Can Do

Schools are the de facto front line of the youth mental health system, with 80% of children who receive mental health services accessing them at school (NCES, 2023). Yet the national student-to-school-counselor ratio stands at 385:1 -- 54% above the recommended 250:1 -- and the student-to-school-psychologist ratio of 1,127:1 is more than double the recommended 500:1. Citizen engagement at the local, state, and federal levels is essential to closing these gaps, sustaining funding, and ensuring every student has access to adequate mental health support.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data at <https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/> to understand the scope of the youth mental health crisis in your state and community
- Check your state's student-to-counselor ratio using ASCA's annual data at <https://www.schoolcounselor.org/ratios> to see how your state compares to the 250:1 recommendation
- Follow the National Center for School Mental Health's publications at <https://www.schoolmentalhealth.org> for research updates on evidence-based school mental health practices
- Subscribe to Education Week's mental health coverage at <https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-mental-health> for ongoing policy and implementation reporting

### Make Personal Changes

- Learn the warning signs of youth mental health distress: sudden behavioral changes, withdrawal from activities, declining grades, expressions of hopelessness, and giving away possessions
- Complete a Youth Mental Health First Aid course through the National Council for Mental Wellbeing at <https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org> (8-hour training available online and in-person)
- If you are a parent, talk openly with your children about mental health, model help-seeking behavior, and familiarize yourself with the mental health services available at your child's school
- Reduce stigma by discussing mental health as a normal part of health in family conversations, community settings, and social interactions

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Contact your U.S. Senators and Representative to advocate for BSCA reauthorization and the School Mental Health Workforce Act; contact your state legislators to support school counselor ratio mandates and Medicaid billing optimization
- **Attend School Board Meetings**: School boards set local mental health policies, approve budgets for counseling staff, and adopt SEL curricula. Regular attendance and public comment are essential for influencing these decisions
- **Submit Public Comments**: When your state education agency proposes changes to mental health staffing requirements, SEL standards, or Medicaid billing policies, submit public comments during the notice-and-comment period
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Local newspaper op-eds about school mental health staffing shortages, the ESSER cliff, or the cost of inaction reach decision-makers and shape community opinion
- **Share Information**: Share CDC YRBS data, local school counselor ratios, and evidence on school mental health effectiveness with neighbors, fellow parents, and community members through social media and in-person conversations

---

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a parent-community school mental health task force that works with school administrators to assess current mental health service capacity, identify gaps, and advocate for improvements
- Host community forums featuring school counselors, psychologists, and local mental health providers to educate families about available services and build trust between schools and communities
- Partner with local community mental health centers (CMHCs) or federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) to explore school-community partnership models that embed mental health providers in school buildings
- Volunteer with local chapters of NAMI, Mental Health America, or Sandy Hook Promise to support school mental health advocacy and parent education programs

### Build Coalitions

- Connect school mental health advocacy with school safety advocacy -- the bipartisan coalition that passed the BSCA demonstrates that school safety framing can bridge partisan divides
- Engage local law enforcement, particularly school resource officers, as allies in advocating for mental health alternatives to disciplinary responses for student behavioral crises
- Partner with faith-based organizations that share concern for children's wellbeing while respecting diverse perspectives on parental authority and program content
- Build relationships with local business leaders who understand the workforce implications of untreated youth mental health conditions (estimated $247 billion annual economic burden)

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During federal appropriations season (typically February-September), when school mental health funding levels are being determined
- When BSCA reauthorization legislation is introduced or committee markups are scheduled (expected 2026-2027)
- When your state legislature considers school counselor ratio mandates, SEL curriculum requirements, or parental consent legislation
- After school mental health crises in your community or state, when elected officials are most receptive to constituent input

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support School Mental Health Funding and Workforce Investment

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City] writing to urge you to support
federal investment in school-based mental health services. In our
state, the student-to-school-counselor ratio is [X]:1, far exceeding
the recommended 250:1. One in five high school students seriously
considered suicide in the past year (CDC, 2024), yet our schools
lack the professionals to identify and support struggling students.

I ask you to:
1. Support reauthorization and expansion of the Bipartisan Safer
   Communities Act school mental health provisions
2. Co-sponsor legislation to create a National School Mental Health
   Workforce Pipeline program
3. Protect Title IV-A funding in annual appropriations

In our community, [personal observation about school mental health
needs -- wait times, counselor caseloads, or impact on students].

Investing in school mental health is both a moral imperative and a
fiscal responsibility, with research showing an $11 return for
every $1 invested in school-based services.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm
calling about school mental health funding. Our state's student-to-
counselor ratio is [X]:1, well above the recommended 250:1. I'd
like the [Representative/Senator] to support reauthorization of the
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and increased Title IV-A funding
for school mental health services. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act Reauthorization**: The BSCA's $1 billion in school mental health funding (FY2023-FY2027) needs reauthorization and expansion. Contact members of the Senate HELP Committee and House Education and Workforce Committee to advocate for reauthorization at $2 billion over 5 years
- **Mental Health in Schools Act (reintroduced in various forms)**: Would create a dedicated federal grant program for school mental health workforce expansion. Contact your representatives to co-sponsor
- **Full IDEA Funding**: The federal government has never met its commitment to fund 40% of special education costs (current share: ~14%). Full funding would free significant resources for school mental health services currently absorbed by IDEA compliance costs
- **State-level counselor ratio mandates**: Only 5 states currently mandate specific student-to-counselor ratios. Advocate for your state to adopt the ASCA-recommended 250:1 maximum

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your plan to address the school mental health workforce shortage? Will you support dedicated federal funding for school counselor and psychologist training pipelines?"
2. "Do you support reauthorizing and expanding the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act's school mental health provisions? If not, what alternative do you propose?"
3. "How would you balance parental rights in school mental health with ensuring students in crisis can receive timely help?"
4. "Will you support Medicaid billing optimization so schools can sustainably fund mental health services without relying on temporary grants?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who have concrete plans for school mental health workforce investment, not just general statements about "supporting mental health"
- Evaluate whether candidates supported or opposed the BSCA (2022) and Title IV-A appropriations
- Pay attention to school board candidates' positions on school counselor staffing, SEL curricula, and mental health service funding -- these local decisions directly affect your community's schools

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing school mental health with others, emphasize:

1. **The scale of the crisis**: 40% of high school students report persistent sadness or hopelessness, 20% have seriously considered suicide, and emergency department visits for youth mental health crises increased 28% between 2019 and 2023 (CDC, 2024; HHS, 2024)
2. **Schools as the front line**: 80% of children who receive mental health services access them at school (NCES, 2023). For many families, particularly in rural areas and low-income communities, school-based services are the only accessible option
3. **The workforce gap**: The national student-to-counselor ratio of 385:1 exceeds the recommended 250:1 by 54%, and the psychologist ratio of 1,127:1 exceeds the recommended 500:1 by 125% (ASCA, 2024; NASP, 2024)
4. **The return on investment**: Every $1 invested in school-based mental health services generates an estimated $11 return through reduced emergency department visits, juvenile justice involvement, and special education costs (Belfield et al., 2015)
5. **Bipartisan precedent**: The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act passed with Republican and Democratic support in 2022, demonstrating that school mental health investment can transcend partisan divides when framed around student safety

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Schools should teach, not do therapy" | Mental health and academic achievement are inseparable; SEL programs improve academics by 11 percentile points. Schools are already the primary mental health access point for youth | Durlak et al., 2011; NCES, 2023 |
| "Parents should handle their kids' mental health, not schools" | 78% of parents support school mental health services; for families in underserved areas, school is the only accessible point of contact with the mental health system | NAMI, 2023; NCES, 2023 |
| "We can't afford to hire more counselors" | Schools leave $2-4 billion annually in unclaimed Medicaid reimbursements; every $1 invested returns $11; the cost of inaction ($247 billion/year in youth mental health burden) far exceeds the cost of prevention | Avalere Health, 2023; Belfield et al., 2015; Dieleman et al., 2020 |
| "SEL is political indoctrination" | Core SEL competencies (self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, responsible decision-making) are evidence-based and have been validated across diverse cultural and political contexts in 213+ studies | CASEL, 2024; Durlak et al., 2011 |
| "Mental health screening is surveillance" | Evidence-based screening uses validated clinical instruments with parental consent, not communications monitoring. Screening identifies students in need before crises develop, analogous to vision and hearing screenings already conducted in schools | NASP, 2024 |
