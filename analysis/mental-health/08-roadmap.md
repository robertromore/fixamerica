# Mental Health Policy: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The mental health reform agenda outlined in [Solutions](07-solutions.md) requires a phased implementation strategy that builds political momentum through early wins, expands system capacity in the middle phase, and achieves transformative outcomes over a decade. The strategy is designed around a central insight from the history of mental health reform: legislation without sustained funding and enforcement produces the appearance of change without the reality. Each phase therefore pairs new legal authorities with the funding, workforce, and infrastructure needed to make them effective.

The three phases build on each other sequentially. Phase 1 (Years 1-2) focuses on enforcement of existing law, crisis system investment, and workforce pipeline activation -- actions that can begin immediately with executive and legislative action and generate visible results within 24 months. Phase 2 (Years 3-5) builds on Phase 1 capacity to undertake structural Medicaid reform, scale integrated care models, and expand youth mental health services. Phase 3 (Years 6-10) completes the transformation by closing the workforce gap, achieving universal crisis access, and establishing the data infrastructure for continuous system improvement.

---

## Governance and Oversight

### Federal Coordination

Establish an **Interagency Mental Health Policy Council** chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use (SAMHSA) with membership from CMS, DOL, HRSA, HUD, DOJ, ED, VA, and OMB. The Council meets quarterly to coordinate implementation across agencies, resolve inter-agency conflicts, and report progress to the White House Domestic Policy Council.

### Congressional Oversight

The Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee conduct annual hearings on roadmap implementation, using National Mental Health Performance Dashboard data to evaluate progress against milestones. GAO conducts biennial audits of federal mental health spending effectiveness.

### State Accountability

States receiving enhanced FMAP or crisis system grants submit annual performance reports using standardized metrics. SAMHSA publishes an annual **State Mental Health Report Card** ranking states on access, outcomes, workforce, and crisis system performance. States in the bottom quintile are required to submit corrective action plans.

### Independent Evaluation

Commission a 5-year and 10-year independent evaluation by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, with authority to access data from all federal agencies. Results are published publicly and inform reauthorization decisions.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Congressional Appropriations Failure

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: High -- without sustained funding, the reform agenda collapses as every previous mental health reform has.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Structure key programs with mandatory appropriations (not subject to annual appropriation fights). Use dedicated revenue sources -- telecom surcharge for 988, insurer assessments for parity enforcement -- that do not compete with other discretionary spending. Build bipartisan support through the economic case: $600 billion annual cost of untreated mental illness vs. $25-30 billion annual cost of the reform agenda.

**Contingency Plan**: If full mandatory funding is not achievable, prioritize parity enforcement (revenue-positive) and crisis system investment (Medicaid-fundable) as the two highest-impact, most fundable elements.

### Risk 2: Workforce Pipeline Cannot Scale Fast Enough

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High -- access reforms are meaningless without providers to deliver care.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Pursue workforce expansion on multiple tracks simultaneously: GME expansion (long lead time, high impact), Service Corps recruitment of existing graduates (faster), peer support specialist training (fastest), scope-of-practice reform (immediate capacity unlocked), and telehealth expansion (extends reach of existing providers). Use enhanced Medicaid reimbursement to retain existing providers and attract new entrants.

**Contingency Plan**: If psychiatrist production lags, accelerate scope-of-practice reform and CoCM scaling to extend the capacity of available psychiatrists through consultation models. Expand psychiatric NP and PA programs as the fastest alternative pipeline.

### Risk 3: Insurance Industry Litigation Delays Parity Enforcement

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium -- litigation could delay enforcement by 2-3 years.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Draft MHPAEA amendments with strong legislative findings and clear Congressional intent to withstand judicial review. Structure civil monetary penalties with appropriate due process protections. Support DOL with dedicated legal staff for parity litigation.

**Contingency Plan**: While federal litigation proceeds, support state attorneys general and insurance commissioners in pursuing parallel state-level enforcement actions. Publicize insurer parity violation data to create reputational pressure.

### Risk 4: State Resistance to Medicaid Reforms

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium -- non-participating states would create geographic gaps in access.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Pair all Medicaid mandates with enhanced FMAP (80/20 or higher) for the first 5 years to minimize state costs. Design reforms to be maximally flexible at the state level while maintaining minimum standards. Use the CCBHC prospective payment model, which has proven attractive to states because it provides reliable federal funding.

**Contingency Plan**: For states that refuse to participate, use Section 1115 waivers and direct federal grants to community organizations to maintain access for residents. Publicize state-level performance data to create political pressure.

### Risk 5: Political Opposition Blocks Social Media Regulation

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Low-Medium -- youth mental health strategy has multiple components; social media regulation is one element.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Frame regulation as child safety (comparable to toy safety, food labeling, and tobacco restrictions) rather than content censorship. Build bipartisan support through parental advocacy groups. Support the Kids Online Safety Act or similar legislation with strong Republican co-sponsorship.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal regulation stalls, support state-level social media laws (already advancing in California, Utah, and other states) and FTC enforcement using existing unfair and deceptive practices authority.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Annual Cost | Funding Sources | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Years 1-2) | $12-15 billion/year | Mandatory appropriations; crisis grants; telecom surcharge; existing Medicaid authority | Front-loaded investment in workforce and crisis infrastructure |
| Phase 2 (Years 3-5) | $20-25 billion/year | Mandatory appropriations; enhanced FMAP; Medicaid mandatory benefits; HUD capital grants | Structural Medicaid reforms and housing investment |
| Phase 3 (Years 6-10) | $25-30 billion/year | Sustained mandatory appropriations; Medicaid; school funding; HUD | Full system operation at scale |
| **10-Year Total** | **$200-250 billion** | | Partially offset by savings in ED, criminal justice, and disability costs |

**Context**: Total U.S. mental health spending is $280.5 billion annually (2020). The reform agenda represents approximately a 10% increase in total spending, invested primarily in workforce, crisis services, housing, and enforcement. The estimated $600 billion annual cost of untreated mental illness (including lost productivity, healthcare, criminal justice, and social services) suggests that even modest improvements in treatment rates would produce savings exceeding the investment.

### Personnel

| Category | Phase 1 Need | Phase 2 Need | Phase 3 Need |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| DOL parity auditors | 200 new hires | 100 additional | Maintain at 300 |
| National Mental Health Service Corps participants | 5,000 | 15,000 | 25,000 |
| New psychiatry residents (cumulative slots) | 200 | 600 | 1,000 |
| Behavioral health care managers (CoCM) | 2,000 | 10,000 | 25,000 |
| Mobile crisis team staff | 5,000 | 15,000 | 20,000 |
| School counselors and clinicians | 10,000 | 50,000 | 100,000 |
| Certified peer support specialists | 10,000 | 25,000 | 50,000 |

### Infrastructure

- **Crisis stabilization units**: Approximately 1,650 units needed nationally (1 per 200,000 population); current capacity is approximately 550. Phase 1 builds 200 additional units; Phase 2 adds 500; Phase 3 adds 400.
- **Technology systems**: National Mental Health Performance Dashboard ($200M build, $50M/yr operations); 988 call center technology upgrades ($100M); insurer reporting systems ($100-200M across reporting entities).
- **Permanent supportive housing**: 100,000 new units over 10 years, requiring land acquisition, construction/renovation, and ongoing operating subsidies. Average cost: $150,000-$250,000 per unit for construction; $15,000-$25,000 per unit per year for operations.
