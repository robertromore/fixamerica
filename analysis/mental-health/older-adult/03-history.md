# Older Adult Mental Health: History

## Historical Development

The treatment of older adults with mental health conditions in the United States has evolved through distinct eras, shaped by institutional practices, scientific advances, legislative action, and shifting cultural attitudes toward aging and mental illness. For much of American history, older adults with mental health conditions were consigned to custodial institutions with little hope of treatment. The modern era has brought significant improvements in clinical knowledge but has failed to build the systems necessary to deliver that knowledge to the people who need it.

### The Institutional Era (Pre-1950s): Warehousing and Neglect

- **Almshouses and poorhouses**: Before the 20th century, older adults with mental illness were typically housed in local almshouses alongside the indigent, disabled, and orphaned. No distinction was made between psychiatric and age-related conditions. Conditions were generally squalid.
- **State mental hospitals**: Beginning in the mid-1800s with the advocacy of Dorothea Dix, state mental hospitals absorbed many older adults. By the early 20th century, approximately 30% of state hospital residents were aged 65 and older, many with what we now recognize as dementia rather than primary psychiatric illness (Grob, 1994).
- **Social Security Act of 1935**: The establishment of Old-Age Assistance payments inadvertently reinforced institutional placement by providing payments to older adults in public facilities. Many states transferred elderly residents from state hospitals to newly created nursing homes to shift costs from state to federal budgets.
- **No geriatric specialty**: Geriatric psychiatry did not exist as a recognized discipline. Older adults received the same treatments as younger patients, including insulin coma therapy, electroconvulsive therapy (often without modern safeguards), and extended custodial confinement.

### Deinstitutionalization and Medicare (1950s-1970s): Shifting Populations

- **Psychopharmacological revolution**: The introduction of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) in 1954 enabled the discharge of many psychiatric patients, including older adults, from state hospitals. Between 1955 and 1980, state mental hospital populations declined from 559,000 to 138,000 nationally.
- **Medicare and Medicaid (1965)**: The passage of Medicare and Medicaid fundamentally restructured financing for older adult care. Medicare included psychiatric benefits but with significant limitations, including the 190-day lifetime limit for freestanding psychiatric hospitals and a 50% coinsurance rate for outpatient mental health services (compared to 20% for medical services). These discriminatory provisions reflected the assumption that mental health care was less medically necessary.
- **Nursing home expansion**: Medicaid's coverage of nursing home care created a massive financial incentive to move older adults from state psychiatric hospitals to nursing homes. Between 1963 and 1975, the nursing home population grew from approximately 500,000 to 1.3 million. Many of these individuals had primary psychiatric diagnoses but received no mental health treatment in their new settings.
- **Community Mental Health Act (1963)**: President Kennedy signed legislation funding community mental health centers, but these centers focused almost exclusively on younger adults. Older adults were systematically excluded from community mental health services, a pattern that persisted for decades.

### The Regulatory Response (1980s-1990s): OBRA and Early Reform

- **Emergence of geriatric psychiatry**: The American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry was founded in 1978, and geriatric psychiatry was recognized as an official subspecialty by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in 1989, establishing board certification requirements and a training infrastructure.
- **OBRA 1987 (Nursing Home Reform Act)**: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 represented the most significant nursing home reform in American history. Prompted by a landmark Institute of Medicine report documenting pervasive abuse and neglect, OBRA 1987 required:
    - Pre-admission screening for mental illness (PASARR - Pre-Admission Screening and Annual Resident Review)
    - Reduction of unnecessary psychotropic medication use
    - Comprehensive care planning
    - Rights protections for residents
    - State survey and certification standards
- **OBRA 1990 mental health parity attempt**: Congress reduced the Medicare outpatient mental health coinsurance from 50% to 37.5%, a partial step toward parity with medical services. However, the discriminatory differential persisted for another two decades.
- **Decade of the Brain (1990s)**: Federal investment in neuroscience research expanded understanding of late-life depression, dementia, and the neurobiological basis of mental illness in older adults. The NIMH launched studies demonstrating that older adults respond to evidence-based treatments, including psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, when they can access them.

### The Parity and Integration Era (2000s-2010s): Legislative Progress

- **Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA, 2008)**: Congress finally achieved Medicare mental health payment parity by phasing out the discriminatory 50% coinsurance for outpatient mental health services, reducing it to the standard 20% by 2014. This eliminated the most visible financial barrier to outpatient mental health care for Medicare beneficiaries.
- **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA, 2008)**: While primarily affecting employer-sponsored insurance, MHPAEA established the principle that mental health benefits must be comparable to medical/surgical benefits. Its impact on older adults was indirect but shaped expectations about equitable coverage.
- **Affordable Care Act (ACA, 2010)**: The ACA expanded mental health coverage requirements for younger populations and funded behavioral health integration programs, but its direct impact on Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+ was limited. The law did establish the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, which includes depression screening.
- **CMS National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care (2012)**: CMS launched a multiyear initiative targeting antipsychotic medication reduction in nursing homes, achieving a reduction from 23.9% to approximately 15% by 2018. This represented the most successful federal initiative to improve mental health care quality in nursing homes.
- **IMPACT study and collaborative care**: The landmark IMPACT trial (2002) demonstrated that collaborative care for late-life depression, integrating a depression care manager into primary care, doubled the effectiveness of treatment. This evidence base spawned the development of Medicare billing codes (CoCM codes 99492-99494) that were finalized in 2017, enabling reimbursement for collaborative care models.

### The COVID-19 Era and Beyond (2020-Present): Crisis and Partial Response

- **COVID-19 pandemic impact**: The pandemic devastated older adult mental health. Nursing home residents experienced prolonged lockdowns, isolation from families, and mass death. Community-dwelling older adults faced social isolation at unprecedented levels. Depression and anxiety rates among older adults approximately doubled during 2020-2021 (CDC, 2022).
- **Telehealth expansion**: The Public Health Emergency declaration waived Medicare telehealth restrictions, allowing older adults to receive mental health services via video and telephone from their homes. Telehealth mental health visits among Medicare beneficiaries surged from 0.8 million in 2019 to 10.1 million in 2020 (OIG, 2022).
- **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022)**: Authorized Medicare coverage for marriage and family therapists and licensed mental health counselors, effective January 2024, expanding the provider network accessible to older adults.
- **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (2022)**: The national transition to 988 as the mental health crisis number included provisions for specialized services, though infrastructure specifically for older adults remains limited.
- **Ongoing workforce crisis**: Despite growing recognition of the problem, the geriatric psychiatry workforce has continued to stagnate. Several fellowship programs have closed, and the fill rate remains below 60%.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Cost-Shifting Over Care

Throughout American history, policy changes affecting older adult mental health have been driven more by fiscal considerations than by clinical evidence or patient welfare. The transfer of older adults from state hospitals to nursing homes in the 1960s-1970s was motivated by states seeking to shift costs to the federal Medicaid program, not by evidence that nursing homes would provide better psychiatric care. The 190-day psychiatric hospital limit in Medicare reflected Congressional anxiety about open-ended costs, not clinical judgment about appropriate treatment duration. This pattern suggests that reform advocates must frame proposals in fiscal terms, demonstrating that investment in mental health care reduces overall healthcare costs, to succeed politically.

### Pattern 2: Regulatory Reform Without Resource Investment

OBRA 1987 established important requirements for nursing home mental health care, but chronic underfunding of survey and enforcement mechanisms has limited its real-world impact. Similarly, Medicare mental health parity was achieved on paper in 2008-2014, but without adequate provider supply, beneficiaries face de facto access barriers. Legislation without corresponding workforce investment and enforcement funding produces rights without remedies.

### Pattern 3: Crisis as Catalyst

Major advances in older adult mental health policy have followed crises or scandals. OBRA 1987 followed a devastating IOM report on nursing home conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed telehealth expansion that had been debated for a decade. The ongoing opioid crisis has increased attention to substance misuse among older adults. This pattern suggests that advocacy efforts should be prepared to leverage crisis moments with pre-developed policy proposals.

### Pattern 4: The Ageism Barrier

Across every era, older adult mental health has received lower priority than mental health services for younger populations. Community mental health centers excluded older adults. Suicide prevention initiatives have historically focused on youth. Research funding for geriatric psychiatry has lagged behind child and adolescent psychiatry. This persistent pattern of ageism, the assumption that mental suffering is a natural part of aging, may be the single most important barrier to reform and the hardest to address through legislation alone.
