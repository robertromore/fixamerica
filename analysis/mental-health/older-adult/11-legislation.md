# Older Adult Mental Health: Legislation

## Overview

Legislation addressing the older adult mental health crisis must operate at multiple levels: federal statutory reform of Medicare benefits and workforce programs, state-level model legislation for Medicaid enhancement and scope of practice modernization, and regulatory action through CMS rulemaking for nursing home quality standards. The legislative approach is comprehensive rather than incremental, reflecting the systemic nature of the crisis. No single bill can address workforce pipeline collapse, insurance coverage gaps, nursing home quality failures, and social isolation simultaneously, but a coordinated legislative package can create the conditions for systemic improvement. All draft legislation below builds on existing statutory authority and amends current law rather than creating entirely new frameworks.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for these reforms.* Older adult mental health reform operates within well-established Congressional authority under the Spending Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1), which authorizes Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the Commerce Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 3), which supports regulation of healthcare markets and workforce programs. The reforms proposed here amend existing federal programs rather than expanding federal power into new domains.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To improve mental health care for older Americans by eliminating
discriminatory Medicare limitations, expanding the geriatric mental
health workforce, establishing quality standards for nursing home
mental health care, and permanently authorizing telemental health
services.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Older Adult Mental Health
Improvement Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA, 2023), approximately 20 percent of
Americans aged 65 and older, an estimated 11.6 million
individuals, experience some form of mental health condition.

(2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC WISQARS, 2022), adults aged 85 and older have the highest
suicide rate of any age group in the United States at 22.4 per
100,000, and older white men aged 85 and older have a suicide
rate of 55.2 per 100,000.

(3) According to the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry
(AAGP, 2023), there are fewer than 1,800 board-certified
geriatric psychiatrists in the United States, a ratio of
approximately 1 geriatric psychiatrist per 27,000 older adults.

(4) According to the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP,
2023), only 57 percent of geriatric psychiatry fellowship
positions were filled in 2023, indicating that financial and
structural disincentives are suppressing workforce growth.

(5) According to CMS Nursing Home Compare data (2023), 65 percent
of the 1.3 million nursing home residents have a mental health
diagnosis, yet fewer than 30 percent of nursing homes have
adequate mental health staffing.

(6) The Medicare 190-day lifetime limit on inpatient care in
freestanding psychiatric hospitals, codified at 42 U.S.C. 1395d,
is a discriminatory provision that has no parallel for any other
medical condition and has been recommended for repeal by the
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC, 2023).

(7) Evidence-based collaborative care models for late-life
depression have been demonstrated to double treatment response
rates and save $3,363 per patient over four years (Unutzer et al.,
JAMA, 2002; Unutzer et al., 2008).

(2) COLLABORATIVE CARE MODEL.—The term "collaborative care model"
means a team-based approach to treating mental health conditions in
primary care settings, involving a primary care provider, a care
manager, and a consulting psychiatrist, as described in the
Collaborative Care Model billing codes (CPT 99492, 99493, 99494).

(3) OLDER ADULT.—The term "older adult" means an individual aged
65 years or older.

medically necessary as determined by the individual's treating
physician, subject to the same utilization review requirements
applicable to inpatient hospital services generally under this
title".

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment made by subsection (a) shall
apply to inpatient psychiatric hospital services furnished on or
after January 1 of the first calendar year beginning after the
date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 5. GERIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT REFORM.

(a) REIMBURSEMENT PARITY.—Not later than 1 year after the date
of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall adjust the Medicare
Physician Fee Schedule to ensure that reimbursement rates for
psychiatric evaluation and management services provided to
individuals aged 65 and older are not less than 95 percent of the
average commercial insurance reimbursement rate for the same
services, as determined by analysis of commercial claims data.

(b) COLLABORATIVE CARE INCENTIVE.—The Secretary shall establish
an enhanced reimbursement rate, not less than 115 percent of the
standard Medicare rate, for Collaborative Care Model services
(CPT 99492, 99493, 99494) provided to Medicare beneficiaries
aged 65 and older, for a period of 5 years following the date
of enactment.

    facility serving a predominantly Medicare population.
    (2) ELIGIBLE PROFESSIONALS.—Eligible professionals include
    geriatric psychiatrists, psychologists with geriatric
    specialization, clinical social workers with geriatric
    certification, and psychiatric nurse practitioners with
    geriatric training.
    (3) PRIORITY.—The Secretary shall give priority to
    applicants serving in rural areas and areas with the
    highest ratios of older adults to geriatric mental health
    professionals.

(c) FELLOWSHIP FUNDING.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall provide supplemental
    funding to accredited geriatric psychiatry fellowship
    programs to cover the full cost of training, including
    stipend supplements sufficient to reduce the financial
    penalty of subspecialization.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (190-Day Repeal)**: Eliminates the last statutory discrimination against mental health within Medicare. Affects a small but severely ill population. CBO score estimated at $200-400 million over 10 years based on MedPAC analysis.
- **Section 5 (Reimbursement Reform)**: Addresses the root cause of the 54% psychiatrist Medicare participation rate by closing the 25% gap between Medicare and commercial reimbursement. The CoCM incentive accelerates adoption of the evidence-based IMPACT model.
- **Section 6 (Workforce Development)**: The most critical provision for long-term system capacity. Loan forgiveness addresses the $203,000 average medical school debt that steers residents away from geriatric subspecialization. The mandatory rotation requirement addresses the finding that 68% of medical students report minimal or no exposure to geriatric psychiatry.
- **Section 7 (Nursing Home Standards)**: Establishes enforceable mental health access and quality standards for the 1.3 million nursing home residents. The 72-hour access requirement can be met through telehealth, reducing the cost burden on rural facilities. The antipsychotic prescribing target builds on the successful CMS National Partnership model.
- **Section 8 (Telemental Health)**: Makes permanent the COVID-era flexibilities that demonstrated older adults can effectively use telehealth. Audio-only authorization is critical for the 22% of adults 65+ who do not use the internet.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Reimbursement parity analysis published | 12 months after enactment | CMS |
| First loan forgiveness awards | 18 months after enactment | HRSA |
| Telemental health permanent authorization effective | 6 months after enactment | CMS |
| Nursing home NPRM published | 12 months after enactment | CMS |
| Nursing home final rule published | 24 months after enactment | CMS |
| Nursing home compliance phase-in complete | 5 years after enactment | CMS; state survey agencies |
| Mandatory geriatric rotation implemented | 3 years after enactment | ACGME; residency programs |

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS has primary regulatory authority for Sections 4, 5, 7, and 8. HRSA administers Section 6. The ACGME implements the residency rotation requirement as a condition of accreditation tied to Medicare GME funding.

**Challenges**:

- **CBO scoring**: Reimbursement increases and workforce investments are scorable costs; downstream savings from improved care are harder to score within the 10-year budget window
- **Nursing home industry opposition**: AHCA will oppose mandated mental health access standards as unfunded mandates; phasing and telehealth flexibility mitigate this
- **Medical education resistance**: Mandatory geriatric rotations may face opposition from residency programs with limited geriatric faculty

**Refinements**:

- **Budget neutrality option**: Consider pairing reimbursement increases with Medicare Advantage network adequacy penalties that generate offsetting savings
- **Rural flexibility**: Expand telehealth exceptions for rural nursing homes and allow psychiatric consultation models in place of direct provider access where workforce is unavailable
- **Sunset clause**: Include a 10-year reauthorization requirement for the workforce program to ensure Congressional review and continued appropriation

## State Model Legislation

### Model Geriatric Mental Health Access Act

**Purpose**: To expand the geriatric mental health workforce at the state level through scope of practice modernization and state-funded training incentives.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize based on existing scope of practice laws, Medicaid program structure, and workforce availability. States with existing full-practice-authority for nurse practitioners may omit Section 3. States with robust loan forgiveness programs may adjust funding levels.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Geriatric
Mental Health Access Act of 2025".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds and declares:

(a) The population of [State] aged 65 and older has reached
[state-specific number] and is projected to grow by [X] percent
over the next decade.

(b) Fewer than [state-specific number] geriatric mental health
professionals practice in [State], creating a ratio of
approximately 1:[ratio] per older adult.

(c) [State-specific data on older adult suicide rate, depression
prevalence, or nursing home mental health conditions].

SECTION 3. SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR GERIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH.

(a) Psychiatric nurse practitioners with geriatric training
and national certification shall be authorized to practice
independently, including prescribing psychotropic medications,
without physician supervision requirements, for patients aged
65 and older.

(b) Licensed clinical social workers with geriatric certification
shall be authorized to provide psychotherapy and mental health
assessments to patients aged 65 and older in all settings,
including skilled nursing facilities, without additional
facility-specific licensure requirements.

SECTION 4. STATE GERIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH LOAN FORGIVENESS.

(a) There is established a [State] Geriatric Mental Health Loan
Forgiveness Program within the [State Health Department/Higher
Education Authority].

(b) The program shall provide loan forgiveness of up to $100,000
for mental health professionals who commit to 3 years of
practice serving older adults in designated shortage areas
within [State].

(c) The [State] shall appropriate $[amount] annually to fund
this program, sufficient for not fewer than [number] awards
per year.

SECTION 5. MEDICAID GERIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH ENHANCEMENT.

(a) The [State Medicaid Agency] shall submit a State Plan
Amendment or Section 1115 waiver to the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services to cover collaborative care management
services for Medicaid beneficiaries aged 65 and older.

(b) The [State Medicaid Agency] shall increase reimbursement
rates for mental health services provided to Medicaid
beneficiaries aged 65 and older by not less than 15 percent
above the current rate schedule.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], 90 days after enactment.
```

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for Medicare coverage, reimbursement, and nursing home standards. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for workforce programs. SAMHSA for crisis services.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Geriatric Psychiatric Reimbursement Parity Rule**: CMS must analyze commercial claims data, determine parity rates, and update the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.
2. **Nursing Home Mental Health Access Standards**: CMS must promulgate rules defining the 72-hour access requirement, assessment protocols, antipsychotic prescribing targets, and training standards. Phase-in over 3 years.
3. **Telemental Health Permanent Authorization**: CMS must update regulations under 42 CFR Part 410 to codify permanent telehealth authority for older adults, including audio-only modality.
4. **Loan Forgiveness Program Regulations**: HRSA must establish application processes, eligibility criteria, service obligation terms, and default consequences.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Nursing homes failing to meet mental health access standards after the phase-in period are subject to civil monetary penalties under existing CMS enforcement authority (42 CFR Part 488).
- **Administrative Actions**: CMS may impose conditions of participation, require corrective action plans, or terminate Medicare/Medicaid certification for persistent non-compliance.
- **Private Right of Action**: Nursing home residents and their families retain the right to bring actions under the Nursing Home Reform Act for failure to provide adequate care, including mental health services.
- **Reimbursement Consequences**: Facilities with antipsychotic prescribing rates above 15% for 2 consecutive reporting periods face enhanced monitoring and potential payment adjustments.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: All provisions of this legislation operate through the Spending Clause, conditioning receipt of federal Medicare and Medicaid funds on compliance with program requirements. This is the same constitutional authority that supports existing Medicare and Medicaid program requirements and is well-established in Supreme Court precedent (*South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987); *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), upholding the Medicaid expansion as a valid exercise of Spending Clause power for existing program participants).

**Takings Concerns**: The reimbursement reform provisions increase Medicare payment rates and therefore do not raise takings concerns. The nursing home staffing requirements operate as conditions of voluntary participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

**Due Process**: Nursing home enforcement provisions include phase-in periods, technical assistance, corrective action plans, and administrative appeals, satisfying procedural due process requirements.

### Preemption

Federal nursing home mental health standards would establish a floor, not a ceiling. States may impose more stringent requirements. The legislation should include an explicit savings clause preserving state authority to exceed federal minimum standards. Medicare telehealth provisions preempt state laws that would restrict telemental health for Medicare beneficiaries but do not affect state licensing requirements for providers.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is monitored through existing CMS survey and certification processes for nursing homes, Medicare claims data analysis for reimbursement and telehealth provisions, and HRSA program auditing for workforce programs. State survey agencies conduct nursing home inspections and report findings to CMS. The legislation should include funding to expand state survey agency capacity for mental health-specific review.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Telehealth access standard allows nursing homes to meet mental health access requirement without any on-site presence | Facilities could provide minimal telepsychiatry consultations that meet the letter of the 72-hour rule without meaningful ongoing care | Medium | Require that telehealth-only mental health access be supplemented by quarterly on-site visits; define minimum consultation duration and follow-up requirements |
| Antipsychotic prescribing target excludes residents with diagnosed psychotic disorders | Facilities could increase schizophrenia and psychotic disorder diagnoses to exempt more residents from the prescribing metric | High | Require that all new psychotic disorder diagnoses in nursing home residents be confirmed by an independent geriatric psychiatrist or neurologist within 60 days |
| Loan forgiveness requires "full-time practice serving Medicare populations" without defining minimum Medicare patient panel | Recipients could technically comply while serving predominantly commercial patients at facilities with some Medicare beneficiaries | Medium | Define eligible practice as one where at least 50% of the provider's patient panel consists of Medicare beneficiaries or individuals aged 65+ |
| Collaborative care enhanced reimbursement could incentivize billing without fidelity to the IMPACT model | Practices could bill CoCM codes without implementing the full collaborative care team (care manager, consulting psychiatrist, measurement-based care) | Medium | Require practices billing enhanced CoCM rates to demonstrate model fidelity through annual attestation and periodic audit, including documentation of care manager activities and psychiatric consultation frequency |
| Nursing home staff training requirement specifies hours but not content quality | Facilities could meet the 16-hour requirement with low-quality, off-the-shelf training that does not meaningfully change practice | Low | Require CMS to certify approved training curricula and mandate that training include competency assessment components |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Workforce growth takes 5-8 years from training investment to practicing providers | Short-term access gaps persist even with immediate legislation | Medical education pipeline length; fellowship training requirements | Bridge with telehealth, scope of practice reform, and collaborative care models that extend specialist expertise to more patients |
| Bill does not address social isolation prevention | Major driver of older adult mental health conditions remains unaddressed by this legislation | Social isolation prevention falls under OAA rather than Medicare; separate legislative vehicle needed | Pair with OAA reauthorization including dedicated social isolation prevention title |
| Medicare Advantage plans may evade network adequacy requirements through narrow definitions | MA enrollees (51% of Medicare beneficiaries) may not benefit from reimbursement increases if plans do not pass through higher rates to providers | MA plan contracting is private and not subject to direct federal rate-setting | Strengthen MA network adequacy rules in separate CMS rulemaking; require MA plans to demonstrate access to geriatric mental health specialists within defined time and distance standards |
| Rural workforce challenges may persist despite loan forgiveness | Rural areas lack the institutional infrastructure (hospitals, clinics) to support geriatric mental health professionals even with debt relief | Structural rural healthcare infrastructure deficits beyond the scope of this legislation | Supplement with hub-and-spoke telepsychiatry models, PACE Rural Health demonstrations, and mobile mental health services |
| Nursing home antipsychotic monitoring may drive substitution to other sedating medications | Benzodiazepine and mood stabilizer use increased as antipsychotic use declined; new metrics may produce similar substitution effects | Facilities have financial incentive to sedate rather than staff | Expand monitoring to include all psychotropic prescribing classes; require comprehensive medication review metrics |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Diagnostic gaming protection**: Add statutory requirement that any new psychotic disorder diagnosis in a nursing home resident must be confirmed by an independent specialist within 60 days and documented with specific diagnostic criteria. Amend Section 7(c) to include this safeguard.
2. **CoCM fidelity assurance**: Direct CMS to establish a Collaborative Care Model certification process, requiring practices billing enhanced rates to demonstrate team composition, measurement-based care protocols, and psychiatric consultation frequency consistent with the IMPACT evidence base. Add to Section 5(b).
3. **Psychotropic substitution monitoring**: Amend Section 7(c) to expand antipsychotic prescribing monitoring to include all sedating psychotropic medications (benzodiazepines, antianxiety agents, sedative-hypnotics) and require facilities to track and report rates for all classes.
4. **MA network adequacy enforcement**: Within 2 years of enactment, CMS shall promulgate rules requiring Medicare Advantage plans to demonstrate that enrollees can access a geriatric mental health professional within 30 miles and 14 days for routine appointments and 72 hours for urgent referrals.
5. **Rural access backup**: For counties designated as Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas with insufficient workforce to meet the nursing home access standard, CMS shall establish a hub-and-spoke telepsychiatry backup system using academic medical center partnerships, funded through the workforce development appropriation.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The workforce development program (Section 6) should include a 10-year sunset clause requiring Congressional reauthorization, with a mandatory GAO evaluation at Year 7 assessing whether workforce targets are being met and recommending adjustments. The nursing home mental health standards (Section 7) should be subject to review at Year 5, with CMS authorized to adjust targets and phase-in schedules based on implementation experience. The CoCM enhanced reimbursement (Section 5(b)) has a built-in 5-year sunset to incentivize rapid adoption while allowing assessment of long-term reimbursement levels.
