# Older Adult Mental Health

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of mental health challenges facing Americans aged 65 and older, including late-life depression, social isolation, dementia-related behavioral symptoms, suicide risk, elder abuse, and systemic gaps in geriatric mental health care.

## Overview

Older adults represent one of the most underserved populations in the American mental health system. Despite having the highest suicide rate of any age group, adults aged 65 and older are the least likely to receive mental health treatment. An estimated 5.6 million older Americans live with depression, yet fewer than half receive any treatment, and only a fraction receive evidence-based care. The geriatric psychiatry workforce has declined even as the population aged 65 and older has grown to over 58 million, creating a crisis of unmet need.

This analysis examines the convergence of clinical, social, and systemic factors that leave older adults without adequate mental health support. It covers the geriatric psychiatry workforce shortage, Medicare coverage gaps, social isolation and loneliness, nursing home mental health care, dementia-related behavioral health, polypharmacy risks, elder abuse, bereavement and grief, Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), and the disproportionate burden of suicide among older men. It explores how ageism, fragmented care systems, and inadequate reimbursement perpetuate these problems and proposes reforms spanning workforce development, insurance restructuring, community-based programs, and legislative action.
