# Older Adult Mental Health: Stakeholders

The landscape of older adult mental health is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with its own interests, resources, and capacity to influence policy. The challenge of reform lies in aligning the priorities of vulnerable populations with limited political voice, an overstretched workforce, and powerful institutional actors whose economic interests may conflict with optimal care.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Older adults with mental health conditions | Direct recipients of (or denied access to) care; experience suffering, disability, and premature death from untreated conditions | ~11.6 million (20% of 58.4 million adults 65+) | Access to affordable, evidence-based treatment; dignity; autonomy; social connection |
| Older adults with dementia and behavioral symptoms | Require specialized behavioral health services often delivered through medication rather than psychosocial intervention | 6.7 million with Alzheimer's/related dementias | Person-centered care; reduced chemical restraint; caregiver support; safety |
| Family caregivers of older adults with mental health conditions | Bear physical, emotional, and financial costs of caregiving; high rates of depression (40%), anxiety, and burnout | ~11.5 million dementia caregivers; millions more caring for older adults with depression/other conditions | Respite care; education; mental health support for themselves; financial assistance; workplace accommodations |
| Nursing home residents with mental health diagnoses | Subject to institutional care quality; high rates of depression, overmedication, and social isolation | ~845,000 (65% of 1.3 million nursing home residents) | Adequate mental health staffing; psychosocial activities; protection from inappropriate medication; dignity |
| Socially isolated older adults | Experience loneliness and disconnection that drives depression, cognitive decline, and mortality | ~14 million community-dwelling adults 65+ | Transportation; social programming; community connection; affordable housing near services |
| Older adults at risk of suicide | Disproportionately high completion rates; least likely to seek help; most lethal means (firearms) | Highest rate: white men 85+ (55.2 per 100,000) | Crisis services adapted to older adults; lethal means counseling; connected healthcare; reduced stigma |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Adult children of aging parents**: Approximately 53 million Americans serve as informal caregivers to aging family members (AARP/National Alliance for Caregiving, 2020). They navigate complex systems to secure mental health care for parents, often across state lines.
- **Grandchildren raised by grandparents**: Approximately 2.6 million children are raised by grandparents (Census Bureau, 2023). Grandparent mental health directly affects child welfare and educational outcomes.
- **Community-dwelling older adults without diagnosed conditions**: The broader population of older adults benefits from community mental health infrastructure, social connection programs, and destigmatization, even if they do not currently have a diagnosis.
- **Healthcare system at large**: Untreated mental health conditions in older adults drive up utilization of emergency departments, hospitalizations, and primary care visits, creating costs borne across the system.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Congress (Senate Finance, HELP; House Ways & Means, Energy & Commerce) | Legislates Medicare/Medicaid benefits, OAA reauthorization, workforce funding | Authorization and appropriation of federal mental health programs | Controls $12.3 billion+ Medicare mental health spending; $2.3 billion OAA | High |
| Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) | Administers Medicare/Medicaid; sets reimbursement rates and quality standards | Regulatory authority over coverage, payment, nursing home oversight | Approximately $1.5 trillion total Medicare/Medicaid budget; ~1,500 survey staff | High |
| Administration for Community Living (ACL) | Administers Older Americans Act programs | Distributes OAA funding to states and AAAs; oversees elder abuse programs | $2.3 billion (FY2024) budget; network of 56 state/territory agencies | Medium |
| State Medicaid agencies | Administer Medicaid, including nursing home coverage and home/community-based services | Set Medicaid eligibility, covered services, and provider rates at state level | Combined state/federal Medicaid spending ~$800 billion; varies by state | High |
| State mental health authorities | Administer state mental health systems, including community mental health centers | Allocate state mental health funding; license providers; set standards | Average state mental health agency budget ~$2.5 billion; varies widely | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry (AAGP)**: Primary professional organization for geriatric psychiatrists. Advocates for workforce development, reimbursement reform, and training programs. Approximately 2,000 members. Publishes *The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry*.
- **American Geriatrics Society (AGS)**: Multidisciplinary organization of healthcare professionals dedicated to improving care for older adults. Publishes the Beers Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults. Over 6,000 members.
- **Alzheimer's Association**: The largest voluntary health organization for Alzheimer's disease. Annual revenue exceeding $350 million. Funds research, provides caregiver support, and advocates for increased federal funding. Significant political influence through grassroots network and congressional lobbying.
- **AARP**: The largest organization for Americans aged 50+, with approximately 38 million members. Extensive lobbying capacity and political influence. Has historically focused on Social Security, Medicare drug costs, and caregiving rather than mental health specifically, but increasing engagement on social isolation and loneliness.
- **National Council on Aging (NCOA)**: Advocacy organization focused on economic security and health for older adults. Administers evidence-based health programs through community organizations. Has championed mental health screening integration in aging services.
- **LeadingAge**: Association of nonprofit aging services providers, including nursing homes, assisted living, and community-based organizations. Over 5,000 member organizations. Advocates for workforce investment and regulatory reform.
- **American Health Care Association (AHCA)**: Association of for-profit and other long-term care facilities. Represents approximately 14,000 nursing homes. Advocates for reimbursement increases and regulatory flexibility. May oppose mandated staffing ratios.

### Influencers

- **National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)**: Sets research priorities and funds studies on older adult mental health. Research findings shape clinical practice and policy. Spent approximately $90 million on aging-related mental health research in FY2023.
- **Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC)**: Independent Congressional advisory body on Medicare payment policy. Recommendations on reimbursement rates, benefit design, and access influence Congressional action. Has recommended eliminating the 190-day psychiatric hospital limit.
- **National PACE Association**: Advocacy organization for Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly. Promotes PACE expansion as a model for integrated care. Represents 156 PACE organizations serving approximately 65,000 participants.
- **Pharmaceutical industry**: Drug manufacturers of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics have a significant economic interest in older adult prescribing patterns. Industry lobbying and direct-to-provider marketing influence treatment choices.
- **Academic medical centers**: Major research universities with geriatric psychiatry programs (including University of Pittsburgh, Duke, UCLA, Johns Hopkins) produce the research evidence, train the workforce, and develop the clinical models that shape policy options.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| AAGP + AGS + Alzheimer's Association | Increased federal funding for geriatric mental health research, training, and services | Strong |
| AARP + NCOA + LeadingAge | Expanded OAA funding and community-based social isolation programs | Strong |
| Family caregiver organizations + Alzheimer's Association + PACE | Integrated care models that reduce caregiver burden and improve outcomes | Moderate |
| CMS + quality advocacy organizations + consumer groups | Reduced inappropriate antipsychotic use in nursing homes | Strong (demonstrated success) |
| Telehealth companies + rural health advocates + AAGP | Expanded Medicare telehealth for geriatric mental health | Strong |
| State Medicaid agencies + ACL + AAAs | Home and community-based services as alternatives to institutional care | Moderate (fiscal constraints limit) |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Nursing home industry vs. quality advocates**: Nursing home operators (represented by AHCA) seek regulatory flexibility and resist mandated mental health staffing requirements, which increase costs. Quality advocates and consumer organizations push for enforceable standards that ensure residents receive adequate mental health care.
- **Pharmaceutical industry vs. deprescribing advocates**: Pharmaceutical companies benefit from high rates of psychotropic prescribing in older adults. Geriatricians, pharmacists, and patient safety advocates increasingly promote deprescribing initiatives that reduce inappropriate medication use, directly threatening revenue.
- **Medicare Advantage plans vs. mental health access advocates**: Medicare Advantage plans (serving over 50% of Medicare beneficiaries) control costs partly through narrow provider networks and prior authorization requirements that can restrict mental health access. Mental health parity advocates push for network adequacy requirements and limits on prior authorization for behavioral health services.
- **Fiscal conservatives vs. program expansionists**: Those focused on Medicare's long-term solvency resist benefit expansions, while advocates argue that investing in mental health reduces downstream costs.

### The Geriatric Care Iron Triangle

A structural dynamic analogous to the classic "iron triangle" operates in older adult mental health:

- **Congressional aging committees** (Senate Special Committee on Aging, relevant subcommittees) respond to organized constituencies
- **CMS and ACL** administer programs and influence spending within statutory authority
- **Industry and provider groups** (AHCA, pharmaceutical companies, large health systems) lobby for favorable reimbursement and regulatory treatment

This triangle tends to produce incremental adjustments that serve organized interests rather than the transformative reform needed to address the older adult mental health crisis. Older adults with mental health conditions, the primary stakeholders, have the weakest voice within this structure.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on policy:

- **Lobbying**: AHCA and pharmaceutical industry spend a combined $50+ million annually on federal lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023). AARP spent $8.6 million on lobbying in 2023. The AAGP operates on a far smaller budget, limiting its advocacy capacity relative to industry.
- **Campaign contributions**: The healthcare sector is consistently the largest source of campaign contributions. Long-term care and pharmaceutical interests direct contributions to members of relevant committees, particularly Senate Finance and House Ways & Means.
- **Revolving door**: Former CMS administrators and Congressional health staff frequently join healthcare industry lobbying firms or consulting practices, creating relationships that advantage industry perspectives in policy discussions.
- **Public advocacy**: The Alzheimer's Association's grassroots advocacy network, the most mobilized constituency in geriatric care, has been effective in securing increased NIH funding for Alzheimer's research (from $566 million in FY2015 to $3.7 billion in FY2024). Mental health advocacy has not achieved comparable grassroots mobilization.
- **Expertise and information**: Academic researchers and professional organizations like AAGP and AGS provide evidence that shapes policy options. However, the translation of evidence into policy is slow and often filtered through interest group priorities.
