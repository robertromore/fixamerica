# Older Adult Mental Health: What You Can Do

Older adult mental health is a policy area where individual, community, and political action can make a tangible difference. Approximately 11.6 million Americans aged 65 and older experience mental health conditions, yet fewer than half receive any treatment. The gap between need and care is driven by workforce shortages, insurance barriers, stigma, and social isolation, all of which are amenable to citizen engagement. Whether you are an older adult, a family caregiver, a healthcare professional, or a concerned citizen, there are concrete steps you can take.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the National Academies report *Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System* (2020) for a comprehensive evidence base on the health impacts of isolation
- Follow KFF Health News (<https://kffhealthnews.org/>) for ongoing Medicare mental health policy coverage
- Review the Alzheimer's Association annual *Facts and Figures* report (<https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures>) for the latest data on dementia prevalence and caregiver burden
- Subscribe to the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry newsletter (<https://www.aagponline.org/>) for workforce and policy updates

### Make Personal Changes

- **Check on older adults in your life**: Regular contact with older family members, neighbors, and community members reduces isolation. A weekly phone call or visit can be a meaningful intervention.
- **Talk openly about mental health**: Help reduce stigma by discussing mental health with older adults in your life as you would discuss any other health condition. Use language that normalizes help-seeking.
- **Learn the warning signs**: Depression in older adults often presents as fatigue, pain, appetite changes, or withdrawal rather than expressed sadness. Learn to recognize atypical presentations. The PHQ-2 screening tool (two questions) can guide a conversation.
- **Ensure medication safety**: If you help manage medications for an older adult, review the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria list of potentially inappropriate medications and discuss concerns with their provider.
- **Secure firearms safely**: If an older adult in your life owns firearms and is experiencing depression or suicidal thoughts, have a compassionate conversation about temporary safe storage. Contact the Means Matter program (<https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/>) for guidance.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge your members of Congress to support Medicare mental health parity, geriatric workforce funding, and OAA reauthorization with social isolation provisions. Use the specific talking points below.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS proposes rules on nursing home quality standards or Medicare telehealth policy, submit comments supporting strong mental health provisions. Federal Register notices are posted at <https://www.regulations.gov/>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Local newspapers are read by elected officials. Write about the older adult mental health crisis in your community, using local data and personal stories.
- **Share Information**: Share data on older adult mental health, social isolation, and suicide prevention on social media and in community settings. The National Academies report and CDC suicide data are public and shareable.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- **Start or support a senior visitor program**: Many communities lack organized programs to visit isolated older adults. Work with your local Area Agency on Aging (find yours at <https://eldercare.acl.gov/>) to establish or expand visitation programs.
- **Connect senior centers with mental health services**: Advocate for your local senior center to offer mental health screening, support groups, and referrals. The Older Americans Act allows funding for these services, but few centers provide them.
- **Create intergenerational programs**: Partner with schools, colleges, and youth organizations to create programs that bring older adults and younger people together. Intergenerational contact reduces isolation and benefits both groups.
- **Organize transportation for older adults**: Transportation barriers are a leading cause of isolation and missed mental health appointments. Coordinate volunteer driver programs or advocate for expanded paratransit services.
- **Host community conversations on aging and mental health**: Use the PBS documentary *The Quiet Epidemic* or similar media as a conversation starter. Invite local geriatric providers and aging services professionals.

### Build Coalitions

- **Connect aging and mental health organizations**: In many communities, aging services (senior centers, AAAs, Meals on Wheels) and mental health services (community mental health centers, crisis services) operate in silos. Bring leaders from both sectors together to identify collaboration opportunities.
- **Engage faith communities**: Religious congregations are often the last social institution connecting isolated older adults. Work with clergy and lay leaders to train them as mental health gatekeepers and to integrate screening and referral into pastoral care.
- **Partner with libraries**: Public libraries are trusted community institutions that serve older adults. Advocate for libraries to host mental health programming, telehealth kiosks, and digital literacy training.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During Medicare and Medicaid budget negotiations (typically annual appropriations cycle, October-December)
- When the Older Americans Act is up for reauthorization
- When CMS proposes rules affecting nursing home quality standards or Medicare telehealth
- When geriatric workforce legislation is introduced or pending in committee

**What to Say - Template Email**:

Subject: Support Older Adult Mental Health Funding and Reform

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State] writing to urge your support for federal action on older adult mental health. Approximately 11.6 million Americans aged 65 and older experience mental health conditions, yet fewer than half receive treatment. Adults aged 85 and older have the highest suicide rate of any age group (22.4 per 100,000), and we have fewer than 1,800 geriatric psychiatrists in the entire country.

I urge you to support:

1. Increased funding for geriatric mental health workforce development through HRSA, including loan forgiveness for geriatric psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers.
2. Repeal of the 190-day lifetime limit on Medicare inpatient psychiatric hospital care, which discriminates against mental health.
3. Permanent authorization of Medicare telemental health services, including audio-only visits, for older adults.
4. Dedicated social isolation prevention funding in the Older Americans Act reauthorization.

These investments save money by preventing the emergency visits, hospitalizations, and institutional placements that result from untreated mental illness. The IMPACT collaborative care model has been shown to save $3,363 per patient over four years.

[Optional: personal story about an older adult in your life affected by mental health conditions or care access barriers.]

Thank you for your service and attention to this critical issue.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling about older adult mental health. Adults aged 85 and older have the highest suicide rate in America, and we have only 1,800 geriatric psychiatrists for 58 million older adults. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to support geriatric mental health workforce funding, Medicare telehealth permanence, and social isolation prevention programs. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Older Americans Act Reauthorization**: Advocate for inclusion of dedicated social isolation prevention funding and explicit mental health screening authorization. Contact members of the Senate HELP Committee and House Education and Labor Committee.
- **Medicare mental health parity bills**: Support legislation to repeal the 190-day inpatient psychiatric hospital limit. Contact Senate Finance Committee and House Ways & Means Committee members.
- **Geriatric workforce legislation**: Support bills expanding HRSA loan forgiveness for geriatric mental health professionals and funding for geriatric psychiatry fellowship positions.
- **Telehealth permanence**: Support legislation making permanent the COVID-era telehealth flexibilities for Medicare mental health services, including audio-only visits.
- **Nursing home quality**: Support CMS rulemaking on minimum staffing standards and advocate for inclusion of mental health access requirements.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your plan to address the shortage of geriatric mental health professionals? We have fewer than 1,800 geriatric psychiatrists for 58 million older Americans."
2. "Do you support repealing the 190-day Medicare lifetime limit on inpatient psychiatric hospital care, which discriminates against people with mental illness?"
3. "How would you address social isolation among older adults, which affects approximately 14 million Americans and costs Medicare an estimated $6.7 billion per year?"
4. "Do you support permanent Medicare telehealth authorization, including audio-only visits for older adults without broadband access?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who specifically mention older adult mental health, not just mental health generally
- Check positions on Medicare expansion, OAA funding, and nursing home quality
- Review endorsements from AARP, AAGP, and Alzheimer's Association
- Ask about committee assignments: Senate Finance, HELP, Special Committee on Aging; House Ways & Means, Energy & Commerce, and Appropriations are the most relevant committees

## Professional Actions

- **For Healthcare Providers**: Integrate depression screening (PHQ-9) into every older adult visit. Learn to use the Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) billing codes (CPT 99492-99494). If you are a primary care provider, seek training in basic geropsychiatry through AAGP's continuing education programs.
- **For Social Workers**: Advocate within your agency for mental health screening as part of all older adult intake assessments. Connect clients to community mental health resources. Pursue geriatric social work certification (CSW-G) to build expertise.
- **For Nursing Home Administrators**: Establish telemental health partnerships with academic geriatric psychiatry programs. Train all direct care staff in person-centered dementia care. Review antipsychotic prescribing rates against national benchmarks. Participate in the CMS National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care.
- **For Educators**: If you teach in a medical, nursing, social work, or psychology program, advocate for required geriatric mental health content. Expose students to geriatric clinical settings, which research shows triples interest in the field (AAGP, 2021).
- **For Clergy and Faith Leaders**: Participate in gatekeeper training (QPR or equivalent) to recognize mental health warning signs in older congregants. Create pastoral care programs that include mental health screening and referral. Partner with local mental health providers for consultation.
- **For Employers**: If your organization employs caregivers of older adults, provide employee assistance programs with geriatric-specific mental health resources. Support flexible work arrangements for employees managing elder care.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing older adult mental health with others, emphasize:

1. **The crisis is measurable**: 11.6 million older Americans experience mental health conditions, yet fewer than half receive treatment. Adults aged 85+ have the highest suicide rate of any age group at 22.4 per 100,000 (CDC, 2022).
2. **The workforce does not exist**: There are fewer than 1,800 board-certified geriatric psychiatrists for 58 million older adults, a ratio of approximately 1:27,000. Only 57% of fellowship positions are filled (NRMP, 2023).
3. **Treatment works and saves money**: The IMPACT collaborative care model doubles depression treatment response and saves $3,363 per patient over four years. Social isolation adds an estimated $6.7 billion annually to Medicare spending (National Academies, 2020).
4. **This affects everyone**: If you are fortunate enough to reach old age, this system will serve you. If you have parents or grandparents, it affects them now. Investing in older adult mental health is investing in our own futures.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Depression is a normal part of aging" | Depression is not a normal part of aging. It is a treatable medical condition. Only 1-5% of community-dwelling older adults have major depression, though rates are much higher in institutional settings. | NIMH, 2023 |
| "Older adults won't use mental health services" | When services are accessible and delivered in trusted settings (primary care, home-based), older adults engage. The IMPACT model achieved high engagement rates. Barriers are systemic, not individual. | Unutzer et al., JAMA, 2002 |
| "We can't afford to expand Medicare mental health benefits" | Untreated mental illness in older adults costs far more than treatment. Avoidable hospitalizations ($12,000-$25,000 each), unnecessary ED visits ($2,500-$5,000), and premature institutionalization ($90,000+/year) dwarf the cost of outpatient treatment. | MedPAC, 2023; Unutzer et al., 2008 |
| "Social isolation is a personal problem, not a policy problem" | Social isolation adds $6.7 billion annually to Medicare spending. The health impact is comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes per day. Government-funded programs (OAA, senior centers, transportation) reduce isolation. | National Academies, 2020 |
| "Nursing homes provide adequate mental health care" | 65% of nursing home residents have a mental health diagnosis, yet fewer than 30% of facilities have adequate mental health staffing. Antipsychotic medications are used as chemical restraints in place of proper care. | CMS, 2023; OIG, 2023 |
