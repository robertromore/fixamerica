# Older Adult Mental Health: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Reform of the older adult mental health system requires a phased strategy that builds from achievable administrative and legislative wins toward fundamental structural transformation. The approach recognizes three realities: (1) the workforce shortage cannot be solved quickly, so interim solutions (telehealth, collaborative care, scope of practice reform) must bridge the gap; (2) Medicare reform requires Congressional action and must be sequenced to build political support through early evidence of cost savings; and (3) community-level social infrastructure takes years to build but yields the greatest long-term returns in prevention and population health.

Each phase builds on the preceding one. Phase 1 establishes the administrative foundations and quick wins that generate evidence and political momentum. Phase 2 enacts the major legislative reforms that require Congressional action and appropriations. Phase 3 scales proven models to the national level and achieves the measurable population health targets that define success.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation and Quick Wins (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Secure permanent Medicare telemental health authorization for older adults
- Launch geriatric mental health workforce pipeline investments
- Initiate nursing home mental health quality improvement through CMS rulemaking
- Establish the 988 older adult crisis track
- Begin social prescribing pilot programs

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Permanent telemental health authorization with audio-only parity | Congress; CMS rulemaking | Months 1-12 | Legislative staff time; CMS regulatory capacity | Bill signed; rule published |
| Launch 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline older adult track | SAMHSA | Months 3-15 | $100 million Year 1; 500+ trained counselors | Track operational; call volume targets met |
| First cohort of geriatric mental health loan forgiveness awards | HRSA | Months 6-18 | $150 million; application infrastructure | 250+ awards in first cohort |
| CMS proposed rule on nursing home mental health access | CMS | Months 6-12 | CMS regulatory staff; public comment process | NPRM published in Federal Register |
| Social prescribing pilot launch in 100 Medicare practices | CMMI (CMS Innovation Center) | Months 9-24 | $100 million; practice recruitment; evaluation design | 100 practices enrolled; referral protocols established |
| Digital Bridge pilot: 100,000 tablets to low-income older adults | ACL with FCC coordination | Months 6-18 | $50 million; device procurement; digital literacy trainers | Devices distributed; training completed |
| Geriatric psychiatry mandatory rotation NPRM | ACGME with CMS | Months 6-18 | Regulatory development; stakeholder engagement | Proposed standard published |

### Legislative Requirements

- Consolidated Appropriations or standalone bill permanently authorizing Medicare telemental health flexibilities (based on expiring COVID-era waivers)
- Appropriations for HRSA geriatric mental health workforce programs ($450 million)
- SAMHSA reauthorization or supplemental appropriation for 988 older adult track
- CMMI authority for social prescribing pilot (existing Innovation Center authority may suffice)

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Year 2, the following should be achieved: permanent telemental health access for all Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+; a functioning crisis line track for older adults; the first wave of geriatric mental health professionals entering loan forgiveness commitments; published proposed rules for nursing home mental health standards; and operational social prescribing pilots generating early data. These actions require relatively modest new appropriations and can largely be accomplished through executive branch action and bipartisan legislation.

| Final rule: nursing home mental health access standards | CMS | Year 3 | Survey agency capacity; facility compliance support | Final rule published; phase-in begins |
| PACE regulatory streamlining and Rural Health Model | CMS; Congress | Years 3-5 | $500 million in start-up grants; regulatory reform | 50 new PACE programs approved; Rural Model launched |
| Hub-and-spoke telepsychiatry networks | HRSA; academic medical centers | Years 3-5 | $100 million annually; partner recruitment | Networks operational in all 10 HHS regions |
| Mandatory CoCM implementation incentives | CMS | Years 3-4 | Enhanced reimbursement; practice transformation grants | 15% of Medicare primary care practices billing CoCM codes |
| National gatekeeper training program rollout | ACL; SAMHSA | Years 3-5 | $75 million annually; training curriculum development | 250,000 community members trained |
| Medicare network adequacy standards for MA mental health | CMS rulemaking | Year 3-4 | Regulatory capacity; MA plan compliance monitoring | Standards published and enforced |

### Legislative Requirements

- Medicare Geriatric Mental Health Parity and Access Act (comprehensive bill including 190-day repeal, reimbursement reform, CoCM incentives, MA network adequacy)
- Older Americans Act Reauthorization with Social Connection title
- PACE Expansion Act (regulatory reform and startup grants)
- Appropriations for all new programs

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Year 5, the structural reforms necessary for a functional older adult mental health system should be enacted and in early implementation. Medicare should provide equitable mental health coverage without discriminatory limits. Nursing homes should be subject to enforceable mental health access standards. The OAA should include dedicated social isolation prevention funding reaching communities nationwide. PACE should be expanding into new geographic areas. The geriatric mental health workforce pipeline should show measurable growth, with fellowship fill rates approaching 80% and the first cohorts of loan-forgiveness providers completing their commitments.

---

## Phase 3: Scaling and Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Achieve national workforce targets for geriatric mental health professionals
- Scale PACE enrollment to 500,000
- Achieve population-level reductions in social isolation, nursing home antipsychotic use, and older adult suicide
- Establish sustainable financing that makes older adult mental health a permanent system feature

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Second-wave workforce pipeline graduation | HRSA; medical schools | Years 6-8 | Sustained funding; program maintenance | 3,000+ board-certified geriatric psychiatrists |
| PACE enrollment reaches 500,000 | CMS; National PACE Association | Years 6-10 | Continued start-up grants; state regulatory cooperation | 500 PACE organizations; 500,000 enrollees |
| Social isolation prevention at scale | ACL; AAAs; community organizations | Years 6-10 | Sustained OAA appropriations | Social isolation prevalence below 15% |
| Nursing home full compliance with mental health standards | CMS; state survey agencies | Years 5-7 | Enforcement capacity; technical assistance | 95% facility compliance; antipsychotic rate below 10% |
| CoCM at scale in primary care | CMS; primary care practices | Years 6-10 | Sustained reimbursement incentives | 25% of Medicare primary care practices billing CoCM |

| Older adult suicide reduction target | CDC; SAMHSA; CMS | Year 10 | Sustained prevention investment | 25% reduction from baseline |

### Expected Outcomes

By Year 10, the older adult mental health system should show measurable transformation. The geriatric psychiatrist-to-patient ratio should approach 1:10,000. PACE enrollment should demonstrate that integrated care can serve a significant portion of the eligible population. Social isolation prevalence should have declined meaningfully. Nursing home residents should receive mental health care as a standard component of their care rather than through chemical restraint. The older adult suicide rate should be declining. Crucially, the system should be self-sustaining, with evidence of cost savings reinforcing political support for continued investment.

| 988 older adult calls | Year 3 | Annual call volume | Minimal | 250,000 | 500,000 | 750,000 |

## Governance and Oversight

Effective implementation requires clear governance structures:

- **Interagency Coordinating Committee on Older Adult Mental Health**: Chaired by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, with representatives from CMS, ACL, HRSA, SAMHSA, NIMH, VA, and DOD. Meets quarterly to coordinate cross-agency implementation and resolve conflicts.
- **Congressional oversight**: Senate Special Committee on Aging and relevant authorizing committees (Senate Finance, HELP; House Ways & Means, Energy & Commerce) hold annual hearings on implementation progress, using the success metrics table as a scorecard.
- **Independent evaluation**: GAO and the HHS Office of Inspector General conduct biennial evaluations of program effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and implementation fidelity.
- **Stakeholder advisory council**: AAGP, AGS, AARP, Alzheimer's Association, NCOA, and consumer representatives provide ongoing input through a federally chartered advisory committee.
- **Public reporting**: HHS publishes an annual Older Adult Mental Health Report Card tracking all success metrics, with data available at the state and county level where applicable.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Congressional Failure to Appropriate Funds

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design programs with multiple funding pathways (mandatory vs. discretionary; CMMI authority vs. new legislation). Build bipartisan support by demonstrating cost savings from Phase 1 quick wins before requesting larger Phase 2 appropriations. Attach mental health provisions to must-pass legislation (OAA reauthorization, Medicare extenders).

**Contingency Plan**: If Congressional funding stalls, maximize executive branch action through CMS rulemaking, CMMI demonstration authority, and reallocation within existing SAMHSA and HRSA budgets. Pursue state-level reforms in willing states to build evidence base.

### Risk 2: Workforce Pipeline Lag

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Workforce growth takes 5-8 years from training investment to practicing providers. Bridge the gap with telehealth (connecting existing geriatric psychiatrists to more patients), scope of practice expansion (allowing NPs and clinical social workers to practice independently), collaborative care models (leveraging psychiatrist expertise through consultation rather than direct care), and task-shifting (training primary care providers in basic geropsychiatry).

**Contingency Plan**: If fellowship fill rates do not improve despite loan forgiveness, consider creating a new mid-career geriatric mental health credential for experienced mental health professionals, bypassing the traditional fellowship pathway.

### Risk 3: Nursing Home Industry Opposition Blocks Standards

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Pair mandates with Medicaid rate increases and technical assistance. Phase in requirements over 3-5 years. Create telehealth exceptions for rural facilities. Focus on access to consultation (which can be remote) rather than on-site FTEs. Engage LeadingAge (nonprofit providers) as an ally distinct from AHCA (for-profit providers).

**Contingency Plan**: If industry succeeds in blocking federal standards, pursue state-level nursing home mental health requirements in states with receptive legislatures, building a patchwork that creates competitive pressure for federal action.

### Risk 4: Technology Divide Limits Telehealth Impact

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Digital Bridge program addresses device and broadband gaps. Audio-only visits preserve access for the least technologically connected. Library and senior center telehealth kiosks provide community access points. Digital literacy training included in all telehealth expansion programs.

**Contingency Plan**: If digital adoption remains low among the oldest old, invest more heavily in mobile mental health services (providers traveling to patients) and hub-and-spoke models that bring geriatric expertise to local primary care offices in person.

### Risk 5: Political Administration Change Reverses Progress

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Embed reforms in statute rather than executive action wherever possible. Build bipartisan support by framing older adult mental health as a seniors' and veterans' issue rather than a progressive health policy issue. Create constituency-building programs (PACE, social prescribing) that generate visible benefits in Congressional districts, making reversal politically costly.

**Contingency Plan**: Protect administrative gains through notice-and-comment rulemaking (harder to reverse than guidance). Document cost savings to make reversal fiscally as well as politically costly. Maintain advocacy coalition readiness for rapid response to proposed rollbacks.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Annual Cost | Funding Source | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Yrs 1-2) | $1.5 billion/year | Discretionary appropriations; CMMI authority; existing HRSA/SAMHSA programs | Relatively modest; can be partially funded through reallocation |
| Phase 2 (Yrs 3-5) | $4-5 billion/year | New authorizations; Medicare statutory changes; OAA reauthorization | Largest investment phase; requires Congressional action |
| Phase 3 (Yrs 6-10) | $3-4 billion/year | Sustained appropriations; Medicare savings reinvestment | Cost stabilizes as prevention reduces downstream spending |
| **Total (10 years)** | **$35-45 billion** | | Offset by estimated $50-70 billion in reduced Medicare hospitalization, ED, and institutional costs |

### Personnel
