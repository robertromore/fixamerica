# Older Adult Mental Health: Solutions

Addressing the older adult mental health crisis requires a multi-faceted approach that simultaneously expands the workforce pipeline, reforms financing and coverage, builds community-level social infrastructure, improves institutional care quality, and leverages technology to extend access. No single intervention can overcome the interlocking failures documented in the preceding analyses; reform must be systemic.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- **Age equity**: Older adults deserve the same quality of and access to mental health care as younger populations; ageism in clinical practice, research, and policy must be confronted directly
- **Integration over fragmentation**: Mental health care for older adults must be embedded in primary care, aging services, and long-term care settings rather than siloed in specialty systems most older adults never reach
- **Prevention and early intervention**: Investing in social connection, screening, and early treatment is more effective and less costly than responding to crises, hospitalizations, and institutional placement
- **Evidence-based but pragmatic**: Reforms should be grounded in clinical evidence (IMPACT model, PROSPECT trial, PACE outcomes) while recognizing that perfect evidence is not available for every policy question and waiting for it costs lives
- **Person-centered**: Older adults must be treated as autonomous agents with preferences, values, and goals, not as passive recipients of services determined by providers or systems

### Theory of Change

The fundamental barrier to adequate older adult mental health care is a self-reinforcing cycle: low political priority leads to inadequate funding, which produces workforce shortages and coverage gaps, which result in poor outcomes, which are then attributed to "normal aging" rather than system failure, reinforcing low priority. Breaking this cycle requires simultaneous action on multiple fronts: increasing the supply of trained providers, ensuring financial access through Medicare and Medicaid reform, building the social infrastructure that prevents mental health crises, and shifting cultural attitudes about aging and mental illness. Early wins from targeted investments (collaborative care, telehealth, PACE expansion) can generate evidence of cost savings and improved outcomes that builds political support for sustained investment.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Geriatric Mental Health Workforce Expansion Act

**Description**: Establish a comprehensive federal program to increase the supply of geriatric mental health professionals across all disciplines. The program would include: (a) full funding of all available geriatric psychiatry fellowship positions through HRSA direct graduate medical education support; (b) loan forgiveness of up to $200,000 for geriatric psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and psychiatric nurse practitioners who commit to 5 years of practice serving Medicare populations; (c) mandatory geriatric psychiatry rotations in all psychiatry residency programs receiving federal GME funding; (d) creation of 50 new geriatric psychiatry fellowship positions at institutions serving rural and underserved areas; and (e) geriatric mental health training grants for social work, nursing, and psychology graduate programs.

**Evidence Base**: The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) loan repayment program has demonstrated that financial incentives successfully direct providers to underserved areas and specialties, with 82% of NHSC participants continuing to serve in shortage areas after their obligation ends (HRSA, 2023). The AAGP has documented that medical students exposed to geriatric psychiatry rotations are three times more likely to pursue the subspecialty (AAGP, 2021). The current 57% fellowship fill rate (NRMP, 2023) indicates that financial disincentives, not lack of positions, are the primary barrier.

**Implementation**: Requires Congressional authorization and appropriation through the HRSA workforce programs. GME rotation requirements would be implemented through CMS conditions of participation for teaching hospitals. Fellowship funding would flow through existing HRSA mechanisms.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $450 million annually: $150 million for loan forgiveness (750 providers at $200,000 each over 5-year commitments), $100 million for fellowship positions and GME supplements, $100 million for training grants, $100 million for program administration and evaluation.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; first loan forgiveness awards in Year 2; mandatory rotations phased in over Years 2-4; measurable workforce growth by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Opposition from medical education establishments resistant to new rotation mandates; competition with other specialty workforce needs for limited funding; 5-8 year lag between training investment and practicing providers.

**Impact Metrics**: Fellowship fill rate (target: 90% within 5 years); number of board-certified geriatric psychiatrists (target: 3,000 within 10 years); geriatric mental health specialist-to-population ratio (target: 1:10,000 within 10 years).

### Solution 2: Medicare Geriatric Mental Health Parity and Access Act

**Description**: Eliminate remaining structural barriers to mental health care within Medicare through: (a) repeal of the 190-day lifetime limit on inpatient care in freestanding psychiatric hospitals (42 U.S.C. 1395d); (b) increased Medicare reimbursement rates for geriatric psychiatric services to at least 95% of commercial insurance averages; (c) mandatory coverage of collaborative care management (CoCM) codes with enhanced reimbursement incentives for primary care practices that implement the IMPACT model; (d) elimination of the in-person visit requirement for established telemental health patients aged 65+; (e) coverage of community health worker and peer support specialist services for older adult mental health; and (f) network adequacy standards for Medicare Advantage plans requiring demonstrated access to geriatric mental health specialists.

**Evidence Base**: The IMPACT collaborative care model has been shown in randomized controlled trials to double depression treatment response rates and save $3,363 per patient over four years through reduced medical costs (Unutzer et al., 2008). MedPAC has repeatedly recommended eliminating the 190-day limit (MedPAC, 2023). Currently, only 54% of psychiatrists accept Medicare (AMA, 2023) and fewer than 5% of primary care practices bill CoCM codes (CMS, 2024), indicating that the current benefit structure fails to support evidence-based care delivery.

**Implementation**: Requires Medicare statutory amendments through Congress. CMS rulemaking for reimbursement rate adjustments and network adequacy standards. CoCM implementation supported through practice transformation grants.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated net cost of $2-3 billion annually in the first 5 years, declining as collaborative care and prevention reduce downstream spending. The 190-day limit repeal affects a small population (estimated CBO score: $200-400 million over 10 years). Reimbursement increases are the largest cost component but are offset by increased provider participation and reduced emergency and inpatient utilization.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; CMS rulemaking in Years 1-2; full implementation by Year 3; cost savings measurable by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Scoring by the Congressional Budget Office, which may not fully credit downstream savings; opposition from Medicare Advantage insurers to network adequacy mandates; resistance from fiscal conservatives to any Medicare benefit expansion.

**Impact Metrics**: Psychiatrist Medicare participation rate (target: 70% within 5 years); CoCM billing prevalence (target: 25% of primary care practices serving Medicare patients within 5 years); Medicare beneficiary mental health service utilization rate (target: 15% from current 10.5%).

### Solution 3: National Social Isolation Prevention Program

**Description**: Establish a federally funded, locally administered program to reduce social isolation among older adults through: (a) a new dedicated OAA Title (or Title III amendment) providing $500 million annually for community-based social isolation prevention; (b) social prescribing pilots in 100 Medicare primary care practices, where providers refer socially isolated patients to community activities with follow-up; (c) expansion of transportation services for older adults to reach social, medical, and community destinations; (d) intergenerational programming grants linking senior centers with schools, universities, and youth organizations; and (e) technology-assisted social connection programs (digital literacy training, tablet lending, virtual social groups) for homebound older adults.

**Evidence Base**: The UK's national social prescribing program has demonstrated a 28% reduction in primary care visits and significant improvements in patient-reported wellbeing (NHS England, 2023). The National Academies estimated that social isolation adds approximately $6.7 billion annually to Medicare spending through increased healthcare utilization (National Academies, 2020). Evidence-based programs such as PEARLS (Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives) have shown significant depression reduction among socially isolated older adults in randomized trials (Ciechanowski et al., *American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry*, 2004).

**Implementation**: Funding channeled through existing OAA infrastructure (ACL to State Units on Aging to Area Agencies on Aging). Social prescribing pilots administered through CMS Innovation Center (CMMI). Transportation expansion coordinated with DOT and FTA transit programs.

**Cost/Resources**: $500 million annually for community programs; $100 million for social prescribing pilots; $200 million for transportation expansion; $50 million for technology programs. Total: approximately $850 million per year.

**Timeline**: OAA reauthorization in Year 1-2; program launch in Year 2-3; full implementation by Year 4; measurable population-level impact by Year 6.

**Challenges**: Measuring "social isolation reduction" is methodologically difficult; local program quality will vary; sustainability depends on continued appropriations; some philosophical opposition to government involvement in social connection.

**Impact Metrics**: Prevalence of social isolation among community-dwelling older adults (target: reduction from 24% to 15% within 8 years); senior center participation rates; transportation access metrics; Medicare utilization reductions in participating communities.

### Solution 4: Nursing Home Mental Health Quality Standards

**Description**: Strengthen mental health care requirements in nursing homes through: (a) mandating that every nursing home provide access to a licensed mental health professional (on-site or via telehealth) within 72 hours of a referral; (b) requiring mental health assessments for all new admissions and quarterly for all residents; (c) setting a national target of less than 10% antipsychotic prescribing rate with financial penalties for facilities consistently above 15%; (d) requiring dementia-specific behavioral health training for all direct care staff (minimum 16 hours annually); and (e) creating a Nursing Home Mental Health Quality Improvement Program with technical assistance for underperforming facilities.

**Evidence Base**: CMS's National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care reduced antipsychotic use from 23.9% to 14.2% through education and transparency (CMS, 2024), demonstrating that quality improvement is achievable. The OBRA 1987 requirements for psychiatric screening and medication review established the principle of federal mental health standards in nursing homes but enforcement has been inadequate. Research shows that staff trained in person-centered dementia care (e.g., STAR-VA program) achieve 30-40% reductions in behavioral symptoms without medication (Teri et al., *Journal of the American Geriatrics Society*, 2005).

**Implementation**: CMS rulemaking under existing statutory authority (Nursing Home Reform Act). Phase in over 3 years. Technical assistance funded through CMS quality improvement organizations (QIOs).

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $2-4 billion annually in additional facility costs for staffing and training. CMS technical assistance: $200 million annually. Cost partially offset by reduced hospitalizations, falls, and regulatory penalties.

**Timeline**: Proposed rule in Year 1; final rule in Year 2; phased implementation Years 2-5; full compliance by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Nursing home industry opposition to unfunded mandates; rural facility capacity constraints; workforce shortages limiting availability of mental health professionals; enforcement capacity of state survey agencies.

**Impact Metrics**: Antipsychotic prescribing rate (target: below 10% nationally within 5 years); facility mental health access compliance rate; resident depression screening rates; staff training completion rates.

### Solution 5: PACE Expansion and Integrated Care Models

**Description**: Dramatically expand PACE (Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) and similar integrated care models through: (a) setting a national goal of enrolling 500,000 individuals in PACE by 2035 (from current ~65,000); (b) reducing regulatory barriers to PACE startup, including simplified application processes and reduced capital requirements for new programs; (c) creating a PACE Rural Health Model allowing modified program structures for low-population-density areas; (d) establishing PACE-Like Innovation Grants for organizations developing new integrated care models that combine medical, mental health, and social services for older adults; and (e) requiring all PACE programs to include a behavioral health specialist on their interdisciplinary team.

**Evidence Base**: PACE participants experience 50% fewer hospitalizations and 20% fewer emergency department visits compared with matched non-PACE populations, with higher satisfaction rates (National PACE Association, 2023). PACE programs include mental health as a core service, avoiding the fragmentation that characterizes fee-for-service Medicare. Currently, only ~65,000 of an estimated 3.5 million eligible individuals are enrolled (National PACE Association, 2024), representing massive unmet potential.

**Implementation**: Requires Congressional action to reduce regulatory barriers and authorize expansion incentives. CMS Innovation Center for PACE Rural Health Model. HHS grants for PACE-Like programs.

**Cost/Resources**: PACE costs approximately $4,000-5,000 per member per month but replaces both Medicare and Medicaid spending. CBO scoring should reflect net savings from reduced hospitalizations and nursing home admissions. Start-up grants: $500 million over 5 years.

**Timeline**: Legislative authorization in Year 1-2; regulatory streamlining in Year 2-3; new programs launching in Year 3-5; enrollment target by Year 10.

**Challenges**: PACE's per-capita cost makes CBO scoring difficult despite documented savings; slow organizational development timeline (3-5 years per new program); limited applicability in very rural areas; enrollment requires dual Medicare-Medicaid eligibility, limiting the population served.

**Impact Metrics**: PACE enrollment (target: 500,000 by 2035); number of PACE organizations (target: 500 from current 156); hospitalization rates among PACE participants; participant and caregiver satisfaction.

### Solution 6: Geriatric Suicide Prevention Initiative

**Description**: Establish a targeted national initiative to reduce suicide among older adults through: (a) a dedicated older adult track within the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline with counselors trained in late-life depression, chronic illness, and bereavement; (b) universal depression screening for all Medicare beneficiaries at annual wellness visits with mandated follow-up referral protocols; (c) lethal means counseling programs integrated into primary care and home health settings, with voluntary firearm storage partnerships; (d) a national gatekeeper training program educating postal workers, utility workers, clergy, and other community members who interact with isolated older adults to recognize warning signs; and (e) funding for research on late-life suicide prevention interventions through NIMH.

**Evidence Base**: The PROSPECT study demonstrated that collaborative care for suicidal older adults in primary care reduced suicidal ideation by 2.2 times compared with usual care (Bruce et al., *JAMA*, 2004). Gatekeeper training programs (e.g., QPR - Question, Persuade, Refer) have shown effectiveness in increasing referrals and reducing suicide attempts in older adult populations (Burnette et al., *Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior*, 2015). The 72% firearm completion rate among older adult suicides (CDC WISQARS, 2022) indicates that means restriction is a high-impact intervention.

**Implementation**: 988 older adult track through SAMHSA. Screening mandates through CMS regulation. Gatekeeper training through ACL and SAMHSA grants. Research funding through NIMH.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $300 million annually: $100 million for 988 expansion; $50 million for screening implementation; $75 million for gatekeeper training; $75 million for research.

**Timeline**: 988 older adult track in Year 1-2; screening mandate in Year 2; gatekeeper training rollout Years 2-4; research programs ongoing.

**Challenges**: Stigma among older adults may limit help-seeking even when services are available; firearm means counseling is politically sensitive; measuring suicide prevention is inherently difficult (proving a negative); workforce limitations may slow screening follow-up.

**Impact Metrics**: Older adult suicide rate (target: 25% reduction within 10 years); 988 utilization by adults aged 65+ (target: proportional to population share); depression screening rates at Medicare wellness visits (target: 90%); gatekeeper training completion (target: 500,000 trained individuals within 5 years).

### Solution 7: Medicare Telemental Health Permanent Access Program

**Description**: Make permanent and expand telehealth mental health access for older adults through: (a) eliminating all geographic restrictions on Medicare telemental health for beneficiaries aged 65+; (b) permanently authorizing audio-only (telephone) mental health visits at full reimbursement for beneficiaries without broadband or video capability; (c) funding a Digital Bridge program providing tablets, broadband subsidies, and digital literacy training to low-income older adults; (d) establishing telehealth hub-and-spoke networks connecting geriatric psychiatrists at academic medical centers with primary care practices in underserved areas; and (e) developing and validating telepsychiatry protocols specifically designed for older adults with cognitive impairment, vision or hearing limitations, and limited technology experience.

**Evidence Base**: Medicare telemental health visits surged from 0.8 million in 2019 to 10.1 million in 2020 (OIG, 2022), demonstrating both demand and feasibility. Studies show that telepsychiatry produces outcomes equivalent to in-person care for depression and anxiety treatment in older adults (Hubley et al., *American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry*, 2016). Audio-only visits reach older adults who lack broadband, devices, or digital literacy, and their elimination would disproportionately affect rural and low-income populations.

**Implementation**: Congressional action to make telehealth flexibilities permanent. CMS rulemaking for reimbursement parity. FCC coordination for broadband subsidies. HRSA grants for Digital Bridge and hub-and-spoke networks.

**Cost/Resources**: $400 million annually: $200 million for Digital Bridge (devices, broadband, training); $100 million for hub-and-spoke networks; $50 million for protocol development and validation; $50 million for program evaluation. Telehealth reimbursement costs offset by reduced no-show rates, reduced travel costs, and avoided emergency utilization.

**Timeline**: Permanent authorization in Year 1; Digital Bridge launch in Year 1-2; hub-and-spoke networks in Years 2-4; full program maturity by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Digital divide persists among the oldest old (22% of adults 65+ do not use the internet); cognitive impairment limits technology use; not all conditions are appropriate for telehealth; broadband infrastructure gaps in rural areas; some providers prefer in-person care.

**Impact Metrics**: Telemental health utilization among Medicare beneficiaries 65+ (target: 20% of all mental health visits); Digital Bridge device distribution (target: 2 million tablets in 5 years); geographic access parity metrics; patient satisfaction with telehealth.

## International Models

### United Kingdom: National Social Prescribing Program

**Description**: Since 2019, NHS England has funded over 3,000 social prescribing link workers embedded in primary care networks. These workers connect patients, including a substantial proportion of older adults, to community activities, groups, and services that address social isolation, loneliness, and mental health needs. Social prescribing is now available to all NHS patients and is a core component of the NHS Long Term Plan.

**Results**: NHS England reports that 1.4 million people were referred to social prescribing in 2022-2023. Evaluations show a 28% reduction in GP consultations, significant improvements in patient-reported wellbeing, and reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms. Older adults are the largest beneficiary group, comprising approximately 40% of referrals (NHS England, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The model could be adapted through Medicare billing codes for social prescribing link workers or community health workers, channeling referrals through the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit. The decentralized AAA network could serve as the community service backbone. Key adaptation challenges include the U.S. lack of a unified primary care system and the fragmentation of community services across multiple funding streams.

### Australia: Better Access Initiative

**Description**: Australia's Better Access program, established in 2006, provides Medicare-rebated mental health services including up to 10 individual sessions per year with psychologists, social workers, and occupational therapists, accessed through GP referral. The program includes specific provisions for older adults in residential aged care facilities.

**Results**: Better Access has increased mental health service utilization among older Australians by approximately 40% since implementation. The aged care component has demonstrated improved depression outcomes in residential facilities through regular psychological services (Australian Government Department of Health, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The GP-referral model parallels the collaborative care approach already supported by Medicare CoCM codes. Expanding the U.S. model to include more provider types (as the 2024 MFT/LMHC coverage begins to do) and setting a clear session entitlement would move toward the Australian approach.

### Netherlands: Integrated Neighborhood Care Teams

**Description**: The Netherlands has implemented integrated neighborhood care teams that include primary care physicians, nurses, social workers, and mental health professionals serving defined geographic populations. For older adults, these teams coordinate physical health, mental health, social services, and home care, eliminating the fragmentation that characterizes U.S. care delivery.

**Results**: Evaluations show reduced hospitalizations, improved mental health outcomes, and higher patient satisfaction compared with fragmented care models. The approach is particularly effective for older adults with comorbid physical and mental health conditions (RIVM, 2022).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The PACE model is the closest U.S. analog but serves only dual-eligible individuals. Extending integrated team-based care to all Medicare beneficiaries through accountable care organization (ACO) enhancements or new CMS demonstration programs would move toward the Dutch model.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **IMPACT Collaborative Care**: Originally demonstrated at the University of Washington, IMPACT has been replicated in over 300 settings. The model embeds a depression care manager in primary care, coordinating with a consulting psychiatrist. Doubling of treatment response rates and net savings of $3,363 per patient over four years have been consistently demonstrated (Unutzer et al., 2008).
- **PEARLS (Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives)**: An evidence-based home-based depression treatment program for socially isolated older adults. Randomized trials showed significant depression reduction and improved quality of life. Currently implemented in approximately 30 communities (Evidence-Based Leadership Council, 2023).
- **STAR-VA (Staff Training in Assisted Living Residences)**: A behavioral intervention training program for nursing home and assisted living staff that reduces behavioral symptoms of dementia without medication. Studies show 30-40% reduction in agitation and aggression (Teri et al., 2005). Adapted for VA settings with strong results.
- **Friendship Line (Institute on Aging)**: The only accredited crisis line in the U.S. dedicated to older adults. Handles over 100,000 calls annually. Has demonstrated reductions in suicidal ideation and loneliness among callers (Institute on Aging, 2023). Could serve as a model for the proposed 988 older adult track.
- **Senior REACH (Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health)**: A multisite randomized trial demonstrating that structured caregiver interventions reduce caregiver depression by 30% and delay institutional placement of care recipients. Evidence supports integration into AAA service delivery (Belle et al., *JAMA*, 2006).
