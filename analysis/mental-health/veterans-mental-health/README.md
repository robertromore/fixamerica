# Veterans Mental Health

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of mental health services, challenges, and reform opportunities for the approximately 18.6 million U.S. military veterans who have served their country and now face unique psychological and neurological health needs.

## Overview

Veterans mental health encompasses the full continuum of psychological care for those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces, from active-duty transition support through end-of-life care. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates the largest integrated mental health system in the nation, serving over 2 million veterans annually through VA medical centers, Community-Based Outpatient Clinics, Vet Centers, and the Veterans Crisis Line. Despite significant investment -- VA mental health spending exceeded $12.5 billion in FY2024 -- the system continues to struggle with workforce shortages, fragmented care delivery, and the enduring crisis of veteran suicide, which claims approximately 17.5 veteran lives per day.

This analysis examines the full landscape of veterans mental health, including PTSD treatment, military sexual trauma (MST) services, traumatic brain injury (TBI), moral injury, suicide prevention, the transition from military to civilian life, and access challenges facing National Guard and Reserve members. It explores evidence-based treatments such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Prolonged Exposure (PE), and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), as well as emerging approaches including psychedelic-assisted therapy and telehealth expansion. The analysis proposes structural reforms to improve access, quality, accountability, and outcomes across the veterans mental health system.
