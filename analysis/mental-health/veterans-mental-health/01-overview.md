# Veterans Mental Health: Overview

## Overview

Veterans mental health is one of the most critical and complex challenges in American public policy. Approximately 18.6 million veterans live in the United States, and an estimated 1.7 million of them received mental health treatment from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in FY2023. Veterans face unique psychological burdens stemming from combat exposure, military sexual trauma (MST), moral injury, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and the disorienting transition from military to civilian life. The VA operates the nation's largest integrated mental health system, with over 33,000 mental health professionals delivering care across 1,321 VA health care facilities, 300 Vet Centers, and the 988 Veterans Crisis Line.

Despite substantial and growing investment -- VA mental health spending exceeded $12.5 billion in FY2024 -- the system confronts persistent structural failures. Approximately 17.5 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate 57.3% higher than for non-veteran adults after adjusting for age and sex (VA National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report, 2023). Of those veteran suicide deaths, roughly 62.8% involve the use of a firearm, and critically, about 60.6% of veterans who die by suicide are not recent users of VA health care services. This suggests that the current system, however well-resourced, fails to reach the most at-risk population.

The challenge is compounded by a severe workforce shortage. The VA has approximately 4,600 vacancies in mental health positions nationwide, and many rural and underserved areas lack any VA mental health presence. Wait times for initial mental health appointments average 29.6 days at some facilities, despite a VA standard of 20 days for new patients and same-day access for mental health emergencies. The MISSION Act of 2018 expanded veterans' access to community care, but referral processes are complex and community providers often lack training in military culture and combat-related conditions.

At the same time, the field of veterans mental health has developed an exceptional evidence base. Treatments such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy have been validated in rigorous randomized controlled trials as effective for combat-related PTSD. Newer approaches -- including MDMA-assisted therapy, psilocybin research, stellate ganglion block, and intensive outpatient programs -- offer hope for treatment-resistant cases. The fundamental policy question is not whether effective treatments exist, but whether the system can deliver them reliably, equitably, and at scale to all veterans who need them.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of veterans mental health:

- **VA Mental Health Services**: The structure, capacity, and performance of VA mental health care, including VA medical centers, Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), Vet Centers, and the Veterans Crisis Line (988, Press 1)
- **Veteran Suicide Prevention**: The national crisis of veteran suicide, including the National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide, the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act, and lethal means safety
- **Combat-Related Conditions**: PTSD, traumatic brain injury (TBI), moral injury, and military sexual trauma (MST), including prevalence, screening, and treatment pathways
- **Workforce and Access**: Mental health workforce shortages, geographic disparities, wait times, and the VA Community Care program under the MISSION Act
- **Transition and Reintegration**: The challenges veterans face moving from active duty to civilian life, including the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) and the unique barriers confronting National Guard and Reserve members
- **Evidence-Based Treatments**: The clinical evidence for CPT, PE, EMDR, and emerging therapies including psychedelic-assisted treatment and telehealth expansion

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **VA-Centric vs. Community Care**: Expanding community care improves geographic access but risks fragmenting care, losing the VA's military-competent expertise, and subsidizing a private system that may lack cultural competency. Keeping care within the VA preserves integration but cannot solve rural access gaps alone.
- **Suicide Prevention Outreach vs. Privacy**: Reaching the 60.6% of veteran suicide decedents who were not using VA care requires aggressive outreach, data-sharing between DoD and VA, and engagement with non-VA health systems -- all of which raise significant privacy and civil liberties concerns.
- **Evidence-Based Treatment vs. Veteran Choice**: The VA has invested heavily in CPT and PE as first-line PTSD treatments, but many veterans prefer alternative or complementary approaches. Mandating evidence-based protocols may improve aggregate outcomes while alienating individual veterans from the system.
- **Workforce Expansion vs. Quality Assurance**: Rapidly hiring thousands of mental health providers to fill vacancies risks lowering standards or onboarding clinicians without adequate training in military culture and combat-related conditions.
- **Federal Responsibility vs. State Capacity**: Veterans mental health is primarily a federal responsibility through the VA, but state-level programs, crisis services, and community organizations play essential roles that vary dramatically in quality and funding across states.

## Key Questions

1. How can the VA and the broader health care system reach the majority of veteran suicide decedents who are not engaged with VA care at the time of their death?
2. What structural reforms to VA workforce recruitment, retention, and deployment would most effectively close the 4,600-position mental health staffing gap?
3. How should the VA balance its commitment to evidence-based treatments (CPT, PE) with growing veteran demand for emerging therapies including psychedelic-assisted treatment?
4. What governance and accountability mechanisms are needed to ensure that Community Care referrals under the MISSION Act deliver equivalent quality to VA in-house mental health services?

## Vision of Success

A successful veterans mental health policy in the 21st century would feature:

- **Universal Timely Access**: Every veteran in the United States can access a qualified mental health professional within 14 days of requesting care, regardless of geographic location, service era, or discharge status
- **Dramatic Suicide Reduction**: Veteran suicide rates decline by at least 40% within a decade through comprehensive upstream prevention, lethal means safety, and crisis intervention that reaches veterans outside the VA system
- **Military-Competent Workforce**: Every clinician treating veterans -- whether at the VA or through Community Care -- has documented training in military culture, combat-related PTSD, MST, TBI, and moral injury
- **Seamless DoD-VA Transition**: Service members transitioning from active duty to veteran status experience no gap in mental health care, with warm handoffs, shared electronic health records, and proactive outreach during the high-risk first year post-separation
