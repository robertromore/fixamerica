# Veterans Mental Health: Legislation

## Overview

Veterans mental health reform requires a combination of federal legislation to expand VA capacity and community-based prevention, regulatory action to set quality standards, and state-level model legislation to fill gaps in the federal safety net. The legislative approach is incremental rather than constitutional: no amendments are needed because Congress already possesses broad authority over VA health care under Article I, Section 8 (spending, military, and general welfare powers) and the post-Civil War framework of federal veteran benefits. The core challenge is not legal authority but political will to fund workforce expansion, mandate quality standards, and sustain community-based suicide prevention at the scale the crisis demands.

This document presents two major federal bills, one state model act, and a regulatory framework, followed by legal analysis and a comprehensive loopholes and shortcomings assessment.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for veterans mental health reform.* Congress has clear constitutional authority under Article I, Section 8 (spending power, military powers) and the Fourteenth Amendment (equal protection) to fund, regulate, and expand VA mental health services and community-based veteran suicide prevention programs. The federal government's obligation to care for veterans is among the oldest and least contested federal responsibilities.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish a comprehensive initiative to expand the veterans mental health
workforce, strengthen community-based suicide prevention, improve the quality
of mental health care for veterans, and ensure seamless mental health care
transitions from military to civilian life.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Veterans Mental Health Workforce and Suicide
Prevention Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the VA National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report
(2023), approximately 17.5 veterans die by suicide each day, a rate 57.3%
higher than for non-veteran adults after adjusting for age and sex.

(2) Approximately 60.6% of veterans who die by suicide are not recent users
of VA health care services, indicating that the current clinical system fails
to reach the most at-risk population.

(3) The VA has approximately 4,600 unfilled mental health positions
nationwide, according to the VA Office of Inspector General (2023), and the
national mental health workforce shortage is estimated at 28,000 psychiatrists
and over 150,000 total mental health professionals (HRSA, 2023).

(4) Fewer than 10% of community mental health providers who treat veterans
through VA Community Care have completed military cultural competency training,
according to RAND Corporation (2023).

(5) The first year after military separation carries the highest suicide risk,
yet the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs maintain
separate electronic health record systems and do not provide systematic
clinical handoffs for separating service members with mental health conditions.

(6) Evidence-based treatments for combat-related PTSD, including Cognitive
Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure therapy, achieve remission in 50-60%
of participants, but treatment completion rates at VA facilities remain at only
35-40%.

(7) The Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement
Act of 2020 (Pub. L. 116-171) established the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon
Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program, which has demonstrated promising results
in community-based outreach but is funded at $174 million annually, well below
the scale required.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual basis for Congressional action using specific, current data from authoritative sources. The findings are critical for surviving judicial review if any provisions are challenged.
- **Section 4 (Workforce Initiative)**: The most structurally important provision. Addresses the approximately 4,600-position vacancy gap through a multi-pronged strategy: enhanced loan repayment ($300,000 cap), training pipeline expansion (2,000 new positions), hiring reform (95 to 45 days), and geographic incentives (15-25% bonus pay). The 10,000-professional target accounts for both filling current vacancies and building capacity for population growth and community care demand.
- **Section 5 (Fox Grant Expansion)**: Triples the most promising community-based suicide prevention program from $174 million to $500 million. Mandates county-level coordinators to reach the 60.6% of veteran suicide decedents not connected to VA care. Includes dedicated lethal means safety funding because 62.8% of veteran suicides involve firearms.
- **Section 6 (Cultural Competency)**: Addresses the RAND finding that fewer than 10% of community providers have military cultural competency training. Makes certification mandatory for Community Care enrollment with a 3-year phase-in.
- **Section 7 (Transition Program)**: Eliminates the DoD-VA transition gap by mandating warm handoffs, dual enrollment, and EHR interoperability. The 12-month dual enrollment period covers the highest-risk post-separation year.
- **Section 10 (Appropriations)**: Authorizes $6.9 billion over five years, ramping from $1.05 billion to $1.6 billion as programs scale. This represents approximately 12-13% of the current VA mental health budget.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Loan repayment enhancement effective | 90 days after enactment | VA Secretary |
| Hiring reform implemented | 6 months after enactment | VA HR / OPM |
| Fox Grant expansion funding available | FY2027 start | Congress / VA OMHSP |
| Military competency curriculum developed | 18 months after enactment | VA Office of Community Care |
| First training cohort enrolled | 2 years after enactment | VA Academic Affiliations |
| EHR interoperability for MH records | 2 years after enactment | VA OIT / DoD DHA |
| Mandatory certification phase-in complete | 3 years after enactment | VA Community Care |
| 10,000 new MH professionals hired | 5 years after enactment | VA Workforce Initiative |

**Regulatory Authority**: The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has primary implementation authority. The Secretary of Defense has shared authority for the Transition Program (Section 7). SAMHSA plays a supporting role for community-based prevention coordination.

**Challenges**:

- **Budget competition**: $6.9 billion over 5 years competes with other VA priorities and deficit reduction pressure
- **Workforce pipeline lag**: Academic training programs require 4-8 years to produce graduates; the initiative relies on retention and recruitment of existing professionals in the short term
- **DoD cooperation**: The Transition Program requires active DoD partnership, but DoD may resist diverting resources from readiness-focused activities to transition support

**Refinements**:

- **Phased certification**: If community provider attrition exceeds 15%, implement tiered certification (basic 20-hour and advanced 40-hour) to reduce compliance burden
- **Telehealth workforce**: Include language authorizing interstate telehealth practice for VA and Community Care mental health providers to reduce the geographic constraint on workforce deployment
- **Sunset clause**: Include a 10-year sunset with mandatory reauthorization based on outcome data

### The VA Psychedelic Research and Access Act

**Purpose**: Authorize and fund VA research into psychedelic-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant PTSD and depression, establish Centers of Excellence, and create a Compassionate Use pathway for veterans who have failed multiple evidence-based treatments.

**Key Provisions**:

1. $500 million over 5 years for VA clinical trials of MDMA-assisted and psilocybin-assisted therapy
2. 10 VA Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Centers of Excellence
3. Compassionate Use pathway for treatment-resistant veterans
4. Clinician training and safety monitoring infrastructure

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs to conduct research on
psychedelic-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress
disorder and depression, establish Centers of Excellence, and create a
Compassionate Use pathway for eligible veterans.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "VA Psychedelic Research and Access Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Approximately 35-40% of veterans with PTSD do not complete evidence-based
psychotherapy, and a significant proportion of those who do complete treatment
do not achieve full remission.

(2) Phase 3 clinical trials of MDMA-assisted therapy demonstrated that 67% of
participants no longer met PTSD diagnostic criteria after three sessions
(Mitchell et al., Nature Medicine, 2021).

(3) The Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act
of 2020 (Pub. L. 116-171) directed the VA to research these therapies, but
funding has been limited.

(4) Ketamine and esketamine (Spravato) are already FDA-approved for
treatment-resistant depression and are used in VA settings, demonstrating
that psychoactive-assisted treatment can be safely integrated into VA care.

(5) Veterans themselves are increasingly requesting access to psychedelic-
assisted therapy as a treatment option for conditions that have not responded
to conventional approaches.

SEC. 3. VA PSYCHEDELIC-ASSISTED THERAPY RESEARCH PROGRAM.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, acting through the
Office of Research and Development, shall establish a comprehensive research
program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy
for veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD and treatment-resistant major
depressive disorder.

(b) SCOPE.--The research program shall include clinical trials of--
    (1) MDMA-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant PTSD;
    (2) psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression and
    PTSD; and
    (3) combination or sequential approaches as warranted by emerging evidence.

(c) CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE.--The Secretary shall designate not fewer than 10
VA medical centers as Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Centers of Excellence,
selected based on existing research infrastructure, clinical expertise, and
geographic distribution.

(d) TRAINING.--The Secretary shall develop a training curriculum for clinicians
who administer psychedelic-assisted therapy, including not less than 80 hours
of didactic and clinical training in preparation, administration, and
integration therapy.

(e) SAFETY MONITORING.--The Secretary shall establish a centralized adverse
event reporting and safety monitoring system for all psychedelic-assisted
therapy administered under this section.

SEC. 4. COMPASSIONATE USE PATHWAY.

(a) ELIGIBILITY.--A veteran shall be eligible for access to psychedelic-
assisted therapy under this section if--
    (1) the veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD or major depressive disorder;
    (2) the veteran has failed to achieve adequate response from at least two
    evidence-based treatments; and
    (3) the veteran provides informed consent after receiving comprehensive
    information about risks, benefits, and alternatives.

(b) ADMINISTRATION.--Psychedelic-assisted therapy under this section shall be
administered only at designated Centers of Excellence by trained clinicians
under research protocols approved by the VA Institutional Review Board.

SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act--
    (1) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the date of
enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Research Program)**: Provides dedicated funding and authority for VA-specific clinical trials. The Centers of Excellence model concentrates expertise while ensuring geographic access across the VA system.
- **Section 4 (Compassionate Use)**: Creates a structured pathway for veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD to access psychedelic-assisted therapy under research protocols, balancing access with safety.
- **Section 5 (Appropriations)**: $500 million over 5 years funds clinical trials ($300 million), Centers of Excellence infrastructure ($100 million), and training/safety systems ($100 million).

**Challenges**:

- **FDA regulatory timeline**: Even with VA funding, MDMA remains Schedule I, and FDA approval may be delayed pending additional trial data
- **Political opposition**: Psychedelic-assisted therapy faces opposition from drug-war traditionalists and pharmaceutical industry actors threatened by non-patentable treatments
- **Safety concerns**: Psychedelic-assisted therapy requires 8-12 hours of direct clinician support per session, creating significant staffing demands

**Refinements**:

- **DEA research licensing**: Include language directing the DEA to expedite Schedule I research licenses for VA Centers of Excellence
- **Parallel track**: If MDMA faces continued FDA delays, authorize VA research into psilocybin and ketamine analogs that may face fewer regulatory barriers
- **Cost-effectiveness study**: Mandate a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis against standard PTSD treatment to build the fiscal case for scaling

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Veterans Mental Health Enhancement Act

**Purpose**: Establish state-level veteran mental health programs that complement federal VA services, particularly for veterans who do not use the VA system, including state crisis response, community-based prevention, and workforce incentives.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize based on their veteran population size (ranges from 200,000 to 1.8 million), existing state veteran agency capacity, mental health workforce supply, and rural/urban distribution. States with large rural veteran populations should emphasize telehealth and mobile unit provisions. States with strong university systems should emphasize training pipeline partnerships.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Veterans Mental
Health Enhancement Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds:

programs are needed to reach veterans who are not enrolled in VA care or who
live in areas without adequate VA facilities.

SECTION 3. STATE VETERAN MENTAL HEALTH COORDINATOR.

(a) The Governor shall appoint a State Veteran Mental Health Coordinator within
the [State Department of Veterans Affairs / State Health Department].

(b) The Coordinator shall--
    (1) coordinate state veteran mental health programs with the federal VA;
    (2) administer state veteran suicide prevention grants;
    (3) maintain a directory of military-competent mental health providers in
    the state; and
    (4) submit an annual report to the Legislature on veteran mental health
    outcomes in the state.

SECTION 4. STATE VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION GRANTS.

(a) There is established the [State] Veteran Suicide Prevention Grant Program,
to be administered by the State Veteran Mental Health Coordinator.

(b) Grants shall be awarded to community-based organizations, local
governments, and veteran service organizations for--
    (1) veteran outreach and peer support programs;
    (2) lethal means safety initiatives;

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), with shared authority between the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP), Office of Community Care, and Office of Information and Technology (OIT).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Military Cultural Competency Certification Standards**: VA must promulgate regulations defining the certification curriculum, testing requirements, recertification process, and provider directory standards within 18 months of enactment. Published in the Federal Register with 90-day comment period.
2. **Community Care Mental Health Quality Standards**: VA must establish regulations setting minimum outcome reporting requirements for community care mental health providers, including data formats, reporting frequency, and compliance penalties.
3. **DoD-VA Mental Health Data Exchange Standards**: Joint VA-DoD rulemaking to define the specific mental health data elements required for bidirectional exchange under FHIR standards, privacy protections, and patient consent requirements.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Administrative Actions**: The VA may suspend or terminate Community Care enrollment for providers who fail to obtain military cultural competency certification or comply with outcome reporting requirements.
- **Performance Accountability**: VA facility directors' performance evaluations must include mental health outcome metrics (EBP completion rates, patient-reported outcomes, wait times) in addition to access metrics.
- **Congressional Oversight**: Biannual reports to Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees with independent verification by the VA Office of Inspector General.
- **Private Right of Action**: None created by this legislation. Veterans retain existing rights to challenge VA decisions through the Board of Veterans Appeals and the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Power Authority**: Congress has plenary authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 to appropriate funds for VA mental health programs. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld federal spending on veteran benefits as within Congress's enumerated powers. No Commerce Clause analysis is necessary because VA programs are direct federal spending, not regulation of private activity.

**Federalism**: The State Model Legislation respects state sovereignty by establishing complementary programs rather than mandating state action. The federal legislation operates through direct federal spending and does not commandeer state governments under the anti-commandeering doctrine of *Printz v. United States*, 521 U.S. 898 (1997).

**Second Amendment**: Lethal means safety provisions (Section 5(c) of the main bill) are limited to voluntary safe storage promotion and free distribution of gun locks. No provision restricts firearm ownership, purchase, or possession. This design avoids Second Amendment challenges entirely because it involves no compulsion.

### Preemption

The federal legislation does not preempt state veteran mental health programs. Section 5 of the State Model Legislation creates complementary state programs. Federal Community Care quality standards may preempt conflicting state provider regulations to the extent they apply to federally funded veteran care, but a savings clause should preserve state licensing requirements.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance with military cultural competency certification is enforced through the Community Care provider enrollment process -- providers who do not certify cannot participate in the VA Community Care network. This is a condition of participation in a federal program, not a regulatory mandate on private practitioners, and is legally analogous to Medicare/Medicaid conditions of participation that have been upheld repeatedly.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Certification mill risk | Online-only training could become a checkbox exercise with minimal learning, allowing providers to obtain certification without genuine military cultural competency | High | Require at least 10 hours of in-person or live-virtual training with veteran-standardized patient encounters; include a competency assessment with a minimum passing score |
| Fox Grant gaming | Community organizations could use suicide prevention grant funds for general operations rather than veteran-specific outreach | Medium | Require grantees to report veteran-specific contact data, implement outcome-based metrics tied to continued funding, and conduct random audits |
| Community Care quality evasion | Providers could meet outcome reporting requirements with minimal data or incomplete records, satisfying the letter but not spirit of quality monitoring | High | Define minimum data completeness standards (>90% encounter-level outcome data) and tie Community Care enrollment renewal to data completeness |
| Dual enrollment abuse | The 12-month dual DoD-VA enrollment period could be used to access duplicative services or medications without coordination | Low | Require a shared treatment plan and medication reconciliation at the point of dual enrollment, with a single coordinating provider designated for each veteran |
| Geographic incentive gaming | Providers could accept rural assignments to receive 15-25% bonus pay, then telecommute from urban areas without serving the intended population | Medium | Require physical presence at the designated facility for a minimum percentage of scheduled clinical hours (e.g., 60%), with telehealth permitted for the remainder |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Legislation cannot reach veterans who reject all institutional contact | The most at-risk veterans may refuse engagement with VA, community organizations, and state programs regardless of outreach | Deep stigma, institutional distrust, and social isolation that legislation alone cannot address | Fund peer-led, non-institutional approaches (veteran mentors, community gathering spaces) that do not require formal help-seeking; invest in research on non-clinical protective factors |
| No firearm access restriction provisions | 62.8% of veteran suicides involve firearms, but the legislation includes only voluntary safe storage; determined individuals can still access lethal means | Political infeasibility of any mandatory firearm restriction for veterans; Second Amendment constraints | Maximize voluntary safe storage uptake; fund research on the effectiveness of crisis-period temporary storage programs; monitor whether voluntary programs reduce firearm suicide |
| EHR interoperability depends on DoD cooperation | DoD has historically been a reluctant partner in joint VA-DoD IT projects, and this legislation cannot compel DoD action | Separate department budgets, cultures, and IT governance; DoD prioritizes readiness over transition support | Include parallel DoD authorization language in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA); establish joint VA-DoD implementation oversight with reporting to both Veterans' Affairs and Armed Services Committees |
| Workforce pipeline lag | New training positions take 4-8 years to produce graduates; the bill's 5-year hiring target depends primarily on recruiting existing professionals | Academic training timelines are inherent constraints | Front-load retention incentives for existing VA staff; authorize expanded use of psychology technicians, peer specialists, and supervised trainees to increase capacity while pipeline matures |
| Psychedelic research may not produce approval-ready results in 5 years | FDA regulatory requirements may delay clinical integration beyond the bill's timeline | Complex regulatory pathway, safety data requirements, Schedule I classification | Include language extending research authority beyond the 5-year authorization if trials are ongoing; build ketamine/esketamine infrastructure that can be adapted for future psychedelic approvals |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Certification quality assurance**: Amend Section 6 to require that the certification program include a standardized competency assessment (written exam + simulated patient encounter) with a minimum 80% passing score, reviewed by an independent panel including veterans.
2. **Fox Grant outcome requirements**: Amend Section 5 to require grantees to demonstrate measurable increases in veteran outreach contacts, referral completions, and community engagement as conditions of grant renewal. Organizations that fail to meet targets in two consecutive years lose eligibility.
3. **Data completeness enforcement**: Add regulatory language requiring VA to deny Community Care enrollment renewal to providers with less than 85% encounter-level outcome data completeness for two consecutive reporting periods.
4. **DoD accountability**: Include companion NDAA language requiring the Secretary of Defense to report annually on DoD cooperation with the Seamless Transition Program, with specific metrics on warm handoff completion and EHR data exchange volumes.
5. **Workforce pipeline acceleration**: Amend Section 4 to authorize expanded scope of practice for psychology doctoral candidates, social work interns, and psychiatric nurse practitioner students under VA supervision, allowing them to provide billable services during their final clinical training year.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The legislation should include a 10-year sunset clause requiring reauthorization by Congress based on an independent evaluation (commissioned in Year 8) that assesses:
- Progress toward the 40% veteran suicide reduction target
- Workforce vacancy rates and pipeline sustainability
- Community Care quality parity with VA in-house services
- DoD-VA transition outcomes
- Psychedelic-assisted therapy trial results and clinical integration readiness

If the evaluation demonstrates that programs are achieving their targets, Congress should reauthorize with adjustments. If programs are failing, the evaluation should identify specific failures and recommend restructuring. The sunset clause ensures that programs do not become permanent entitlements without evidence of effectiveness.
