# Veterans Mental Health: Stakeholders

The veterans mental health landscape is shaped by a complex ecosystem of federal agencies, congressional committees, veteran service organizations, health care providers, researchers, and -- most importantly -- the veterans and families whose lives are directly affected.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Veterans with mental health conditions | Direct recipients of care (or lack thereof); bear the clinical, social, and economic consequences of inadequate treatment | ~3.5 million with diagnosable conditions; 1.7 million in VA MH care (FY2023) | Timely access, quality treatment, reduced stigma, disability compensation |
| Veteran families and caregivers | Secondary trauma, caregiving burden, family disruption, economic strain from untreated or undertreated conditions | ~5.5 million family members of veterans with MH conditions | Caregiver support, family therapy access, respite care, financial stability |
| Veterans not engaged with VA | The 60.6% of veteran suicide decedents who were not recent VA users; highest-risk population least connected to support | Estimated 10+ million veterans not enrolled or not active in VA | Outreach that meets them where they are; removal of enrollment and eligibility barriers |
| Post-9/11 veterans | Highest rates of PTSD, TBI, and MST; youngest cohort with decades of care needs ahead | ~4.1 million | Evidence-based PTSD/TBI treatment, transition support, career services |
| Women veterans | Fastest-growing veteran demographic; disproportionate MST burden; rising suicide rates | ~2 million (10% of veteran population, growing) | MST treatment, gender-responsive care, privacy, childcare during appointments |
| National Guard and Reserve | Deployed at unprecedented rates post-9/11 but lack full-time military health benefits; geographic dispersion compounds access challenges | ~800,000 deployed post-9/11 | Equal access to VA MH services, TRICARE continuity, employer support |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Active-duty service members**: Future veterans whose mental health needs are shaped by current military service conditions. Approximately 1.3 million active-duty personnel and 800,000 reservists.
- **Veteran communities (peer networks)**: Informal support structures including veteran-led nonprofits, peer support groups, and online communities that often serve as first points of contact.
- **Employers of veterans**: Workplace accommodation, understanding of mental health conditions, and willingness to hire veterans are directly affected by the quality of veteran mental health systems.
- **Taxpayers**: Fund the $12.5 billion VA mental health budget (FY2024) and bear the economic costs of inadequate treatment through homelessness, criminal justice involvement, and lost productivity.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| VA Secretary | Cabinet-level leader of the VA | Directs all VA operations, policy, and budget requests | $325 billion total VA budget (FY2024) | High |
| VA Under Secretary for Health (VHA) | Leads the Veterans Health Administration | Oversees all VA health care including mental health | ~$105 billion VHA budget (FY2024) | High |
| VA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP) | Directs VA mental health policy and suicide prevention | Sets clinical standards, workforce targets, program design | ~$12.5 billion MH budget (FY2024) | High |
| Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee | Legislative oversight of VA | Authorization, appropriation, confirmation, investigation | N/A | High |
| House Veterans' Affairs Committee | Legislative oversight of VA | Authorization, appropriation, investigation | N/A | High |
| DoD Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness | Oversees military personnel policy including transition | Shapes pre-separation mental health screening and TAP | DoD personnel budget | Medium |
| SAMHSA | Leads federal behavioral health policy | Administers block grants, sets national standards | ~$7.5 billion total (FY2024) | Medium |
| State VA agencies (50 states) | Administer state veteran benefits and services | Vary widely by state; some operate state veteran homes, crisis services, grants | Varies ($10M-$500M annually by state) | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)**: The central institutional player, operating the nation's largest integrated health care system. The VA's mental health programs are led by the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP) and the National Center for PTSD, headquartered in White River Junction, Vermont.
- **Department of Defense (DoD)**: Responsible for active-duty mental health care and the transition process. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) and Military Health System (MHS) provide mental health services to active-duty personnel and their families.
- **Veterans Health Administration (VHA)**: The health care arm of the VA, operating 171 medical centers and over 1,150 Community-Based Outpatient Clinics. VHA's Academic Affiliations program partners with 131 medical schools and 1,800 colleges.
- **SAMHSA**: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration administers the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and provides grant funding for veteran-specific mental health programs at the state and community level.

### Influencers

- **Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs)**: The most powerful advocacy force in veteran policy. Major VSOs include:

| Organization | Membership | Founded | Key Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) | ~1.5 million | 1899 | Benefits, health care, legislation |
| American Legion | ~1.6 million | 1919 | Advocacy, community service, VA oversight |
| Disabled American Veterans (DAV) | ~1 million | 1920 | Disability benefits, health care access |
| Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) | ~425,000 | 2004 | Post-9/11 veteran policy, suicide prevention |
| Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) | ~85,000 | 1978 | Agent Orange, PTSD, aging veteran care |
| Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) | N/A (service org) | 2003 | Mental health programs, peer support, direct services |

- **Academic researchers**: VA-affiliated researchers at institutions such as the National Center for PTSD, VA Health Services Research & Development (HSR&D), and leading universities (e.g., Boston University CTE Center, STRONG STAR consortium at UT Health San Antonio) generate the evidence base that drives policy.
- **Media and journalism**: Investigative reporting has been a primary driver of reform. *CBS News* (2007 suicide investigation), *ProPublica* and *The Arizona Republic* (2014 Phoenix scandal), and ongoing coverage by *Military Times*, *Stars and Stripes*, and *The War Horse* shape public awareness.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| VSOs + Congressional Veterans' Affairs Committees + VA | Increased VA mental health funding and staffing | Strong |
| Veterans + families + mental health professional associations | Workforce expansion (training pipeline, loan repayment, competitive pay) | Strong |
| Bipartisan congressional members + VSOs + DoD | Improved DoD-VA transition and shared electronic health records | Moderate |
| Veteran advocates + firearm safety organizations + VA | Lethal means safety (voluntary safe storage) for suicide prevention | Moderate |
| Research institutions + VA + pharmaceutical/biotech companies | Clinical trials for psychedelic-assisted therapy and other emerging treatments | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **VA institutional leadership vs. Community Care advocates**: The VA has an institutional interest in maintaining its role as the primary provider of veteran health care, while some advocates and legislators push for expanding community care and even privatizing VA services.
- **VSOs vs. each other**: Different VSOs represent different eras and demographics of veterans. The American Legion and VFW tend toward more traditional advocacy, while IAVA and newer organizations push for innovative approaches like psychedelic therapy and technology-enabled care.
- **Disability compensation advocates vs. treatment-focused reformers**: Some stakeholders prioritize increasing disability compensation and expanding eligibility, while others argue that the system should invest more in treatment that reduces symptoms and improves functioning, regardless of compensation status.
- **Firearm rights groups vs. suicide prevention advocates**: Lethal means safety -- the most evidence-based approach to reducing firearm suicide -- faces opposition from Second Amendment organizations that view any discussion of firearms in a mental health context as a potential pathway to gun confiscation.

### The Iron Triangle

The veterans mental health policy space features a classic iron triangle:

1. **Congressional Veterans' Affairs Committees**: Control authorization and appropriations
2. **VA bureaucracy**: Implements programs, controls data, and shapes policy options
3. **Veteran Service Organizations**: Mobilize political pressure, provide testimony, and monitor implementation

This triangle can be highly effective at securing funding increases but can also resist structural reform that threatens existing institutional arrangements. Outside actors -- academic researchers, emerging veteran organizations, community providers -- often struggle to break into this closed policy-making loop.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on veterans mental health policy:

- **Lobbying**: VSOs maintain permanent lobbying offices in Washington, D.C. The American Legion and VFW collectively spend over $5 million annually on lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023). These organizations have unmatched access to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees.
- **Congressional testimony**: VSO leaders testify at nearly every VA oversight hearing. VA officials testify regularly on budget and performance. Academic experts are occasionally invited but have less routine access.
- **Campaign engagement**: VSOs do not endorse candidates but issue voter guides and grade legislators on veteran-related votes. Individual veterans are highly engaged voters, particularly in swing states with large veteran populations (Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Texas).
- **Public advocacy and media**: High-profile veteran advocates, military families, and media investigations have been the most effective mechanism for catalyzing reform. The 2014 Phoenix VA scandal, driven by media reporting, produced more legislative change than years of policy advocacy.
- **Expertise and data**: The VA's research enterprise and the National Center for PTSD control much of the clinical evidence base. Academic affiliates conduct the studies that validate (or challenge) VA treatment protocols. This creates both a knowledge advantage and a potential conflict of interest.
