# Veterans Mental Health: What You Can Do

The crisis of veteran mental health -- 17.5 veteran suicides per day, 4,600 unfilled VA mental health positions, and 60.6% of veteran suicide decedents not connected to VA care -- demands sustained citizen engagement. Veterans mental health is one of the rare policy areas where bipartisan support already exists; the challenge is converting broad sympathy into specific legislative action, community-level prevention, and sustained oversight. Whether you are a veteran, a family member, a health care professional, or a concerned citizen, there are concrete actions you can take.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the VA's annual *National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report* to understand current data and trends. The 2023 report is available at <https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/suicide_prevention/data.asp>.
- Follow the VA's Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP) for updates on programs and initiatives: <https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/>
- Learn the warning signs of suicide. The VA's "S.A.V.E." training teaches how to recognize and respond to signs of suicidal crisis in veterans: <https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/suicide_prevention/docs/VA_SAVE_Training.pdf>
- Read *Invisible Wounds of War* (RAND, 2008) for a comprehensive overview of the psychological costs of post-9/11 military service
- Explore the National Center for PTSD's resources for understanding combat-related PTSD, TBI, and moral injury: <https://www.ptsd.va.gov/>

### Make Personal Changes

- If you are a veteran: Know that seeking mental health care is not weakness -- it is mission readiness for civilian life. Contact the Veterans Crisis Line (dial 988, press 1) if you are in crisis, or call your local Vet Center for confidential counseling.
- If you are a firearm owner: Practice voluntary safe storage. The VA's lethal means safety initiative provides free gun locks and safe storage counseling. 62.8% of veteran suicides involve firearms, and temporary safe storage during crisis saves lives.
- If you employ veterans: Learn about reasonable workplace accommodations for PTSD and TBI. The Job Accommodation Network (JAN) provides free guidance at <https://askjan.org/disabilities/Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder-PTSD.cfm>.
- Check on the veterans in your life. Social connection is one of the strongest protective factors against suicide. A regular phone call, text, or in-person visit matters.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge your members of Congress to fully fund VA mental health programs and support the Veterans Mental Health Workforce Act. The Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees control key legislation.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When the VA proposes new rules on mental health care (published in the Federal Register), submit comments during the public comment period. Recent rulemaking has addressed Community Care access standards and telehealth expansion.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When veteran suicide or VA mental health is in the news in your community, write to local newspapers emphasizing the need for upstream prevention, workforce investment, and community-based outreach.
- **Share Information**: Share the 988 Veterans Crisis Line number (dial 988, press 1) on social media. Many veterans and their families do not know this resource exists.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form or join a local veteran suicide prevention coalition modeled on the VA's "Together With Veterans" program, which has demonstrated success in rural Montana and Alaska. Contact your local VA suicide prevention coordinator for guidance.
- Host a community screening of veteran mental health documentaries (e.g., *Thank You for Your Service*, *The Weight of Gold*) followed by a discussion with a local VA clinician or veteran peer specialist.
- Partner with your local VFW post, American Legion hall, or veteran peer group to host mental health awareness events. Many veterans will attend social events at veteran-affiliated spaces who would never walk into a VA clinic.
- Volunteer with a veteran service organization to provide non-clinical support: meal delivery, transportation to appointments, social activities, or simply companionship.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect local faith communities with veteran mental health resources. Many veterans turn to clergy before clinicians. Faith leaders can be trained in suicide risk recognition through the VA's Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships initiative.
- Partner with local firearm retailers and ranges to distribute free gun locks and promote voluntary safe storage during crisis. The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) and American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) have jointly developed programs for this purpose.
- Work with local employers to establish veteran-friendly workplace mental health policies, including flexible scheduling for VA appointments and employee assistance programs with military cultural competency.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:
- During the annual VA budget and appropriations process (typically January-September), urge full funding for VA mental health programs
- When the Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program is up for reauthorization
- When any veterans mental health legislation is pending in the Senate or House Veterans' Affairs Committees
- After a veteran suicide in your community -- connect the personal tragedy to systemic policy failure

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Fully Fund VA Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Programs

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

As your constituent in [City, State], I am writing to urge your support for
full funding of VA mental health programs and the expansion of
community-based veteran suicide prevention efforts.

Every day, 17.5 veterans die by suicide, and 60.6% of those who die are not
connected to VA care. This means our current system, however well-resourced
within the VA, is not reaching the most at-risk veterans. I urge you to
support:

1. Tripling the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant
   Program to $500 million annually to fund community-based outreach
2. Increasing VA mental health workforce funding to close the 4,600-position
   vacancy gap
3. Requiring military cultural competency training for all Community Care
   mental health providers

[If applicable: I am writing as a veteran / the family member of a veteran /
a mental health professional who has seen these challenges firsthand.]

Thank you for your service to our community.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling
to urge [Representative/Senator] [Last Name] to fully fund VA mental health
programs and support the expansion of the Fox Suicide Prevention Grant
Program. Currently 17.5 veterans die by suicide every day, and more than
60% are not connected to VA care. We need community-based prevention, not
just clinical treatment. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Veterans Mental Health Workforce Act**: Would increase EDRP loan repayment to $300,000 for shortage areas, create 2,000 new training slots, and streamline VA hiring. Contact your Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee member.
- **Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program Reauthorization and Expansion**: Would triple community-based suicide prevention grants from $174 million to $500 million annually. Contact your House and Senate appropriators.
- **Guard and Reserve Mental Health Equity Act**: Would extend VA mental health eligibility to all Guard/Reserve members who deployed to combat zones. Contact members of the Armed Services and Veterans' Affairs Committees.
- **VA Psychedelic Research and Access Act**: Would authorize VA Centers of Excellence for psychedelic-assisted therapy research. Contact members with veterans affairs or health committee assignments.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your plan to reduce the veteran suicide rate of 17.5 deaths per day, particularly for the 60.6% who are not connected to VA care?"
2. "Do you support full funding of the VA mental health workforce to close the 4,600-position vacancy gap, and if so, how would you pay for it?"
3. "What is your position on expanding VA research into psychedelic-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant PTSD?"
4. "Do you support or oppose privatization of VA health care, and why?"

**Voting Considerations**:
- Look for candidates who support sustained VA investment rather than privatization
- Check whether candidates have endorsed or opposed the Commander John Scott Hannon Act's provisions
- Consider candidates' positions on both veterans' issues AND broader mental health policy (SAMHSA funding, 988 Lifeline, mental health parity)
- Review ratings from veteran service organizations: VFW, American Legion, DAV, and IAVA all publish congressional scorecards

## Professional Actions

- **For Mental Health Clinicians**: Complete the VA's free Military Cultural Competency training at <https://www.train.org/main/welcome>. Enroll in the VA Community Provider Toolkit. Consider joining the VA Community Care network to expand access for veterans in your area.
- **For Primary Care Providers**: Screen veteran patients for PTSD (using the PC-PTSD-5 screener), depression (PHQ-9), and suicidal ideation. Ask every patient if they are a veteran -- many do not volunteer this information. Refer to VA care or community veteran mental health services.
- **For Researchers**: Explore VA research partnership opportunities through the VA Office of Research and Development. The VA's Cooperative Studies Program and Clinical Science Research and Development Service fund veteran mental health research.
- **For Attorneys**: Provide pro bono assistance to veterans seeking discharge upgrades (particularly OTH discharges that may have resulted from untreated mental health conditions). Organizations like the National Veterans Legal Services Program (NVLSP) coordinate pro bono legal assistance.
- **For Employers**: Implement veteran-specific employee assistance programs. Train HR staff and managers on recognizing signs of PTSD, TBI, and adjustment difficulties. Partner with local VA Compensated Work Therapy programs.
- **For Educators and Faculty**: Integrate military cultural competency into graduate training programs for psychology, social work, counseling, and psychiatry. The VA's Academic Affiliations program provides frameworks for military mental health specialization tracks.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing veterans mental health with others, emphasize:

1. **The scope of the crisis**: 17.5 veterans die by suicide every day -- more than die from all combat operations combined in most recent years. This is a national emergency that demands emergency-level investment.
2. **The system's blind spot**: 60.6% of veterans who die by suicide are not connected to VA care. Spending more on the VA clinical system alone cannot solve this crisis -- we need community-based, upstream prevention.
3. **Effective treatments exist**: Evidence-based therapies like CPT and PE work for PTSD when delivered with fidelity. The problem is not a lack of effective treatments; it is a workforce shortage, access barriers, and stigma that prevent delivery at scale.
4. **Workforce is the bottleneck**: The VA has approximately 4,600 unfilled mental health positions. No amount of program innovation matters if there are not enough clinicians to deliver care.
5. **This is bipartisan**: Veterans mental health has strong support across the political spectrum. The Commander John Scott Hannon Act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in 2020.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "The VA provides terrible care" | The VA consistently outperforms private health care on clinical quality measures, including mental health | RAND Corporation, 2018 |
| "Veteran suicide is caused by combat trauma" | While combat exposure is a risk factor, veteran suicide is driven by a complex interaction of mental health conditions, social isolation, chronic pain, substance use, and firearm access; many veteran suicide decedents never deployed to combat | VA NSPAR, 2023 |
| "We just need to spend more on the VA" | More spending on the VA alone cannot reach the 60.6% of veteran suicide decedents not using VA care; community-based prevention is essential | VA NSPAR, 2023 |
| "Veterans prefer private care over the VA" | Surveys consistently show that veterans who use the VA rate their care highly; dissatisfaction is primarily about access (wait times, travel distance), not quality | VA SHEP Survey, 2023 |
| "Psychedelic therapy is just drug legalization" | Psychedelic-assisted therapy is a structured clinical intervention conducted in medical settings with trained therapists; it has nothing to do with recreational drug use | Mitchell et al., *Nature Medicine*, 2021 |
