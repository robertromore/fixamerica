# Community Mental Health: What You Can Do

Community mental health reform depends on sustained public engagement. The CCBHC model has achieved bipartisan legislative support -- the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 passed with votes from both parties -- but translating authorization into full national implementation requires ongoing advocacy at the federal, state, and local levels. Citizens, professionals, and community leaders all have roles to play.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to the National Council for Mental Wellbeing newsletter for updates on CCBHC expansion and community mental health policy (<https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/>)
- Read Mental Health America's annual *State of Mental Health in America* report to understand how your state ranks on access, coverage, and outcomes (<https://www.mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america>)
- Follow SAMHSA's data releases, particularly the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), to track mental illness prevalence and treatment gap data (<https://www.samhsa.gov/data/>)
- Read Thomas Insel's *Healing: Our Path from Mental Illness to Mental Health* (Penguin Press, 2022) for a comprehensive overview of what works in community mental health
- Monitor your state's CCBHC adoption status through the National Council's CCBHC Locator (<https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/>)

### Make Personal Changes

- Learn the warning signs of mental health crisis in friends, family members, and community members. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) offers free mental health first aid education courses.
- Save 988 in your phone contacts as the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Know that 988 connects to trained counselors 24/7 via call, text, or chat.
- If you or a family member needs services, locate your nearest community mental health center or CCBHC through SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Locator (<https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/>)
- Challenge mental health stigma in everyday conversations. Research shows that personal contact with individuals who have experienced mental illness is the most effective stigma reduction strategy (Corrigan et al., 2012).

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge your U.S. Senators and Representative to support full funding for CCBHC expansion, 988 crisis infrastructure, and behavioral health workforce programs. Find contact information at <https://www.congress.gov/members>
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS or SAMHSA publish proposed rules related to Medicaid behavioral health, CCBHC certification, or mental health parity enforcement, submit public comments. Federal Register notices are posted at <https://www.regulations.gov>
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Use data from this analysis -- 57.8 million adults with mental illness, only 47.2% receiving treatment, 169 million people in mental health shortage areas -- to make the case for community mental health investment in your local newspaper
- **Share Information**: Share CCBHC demonstration outcomes (60% reduction in ED visits, 40% reduction in jail bookings) on social media and in community discussions to build public awareness of what works

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a local mental health advocacy group or join an existing NAMI affiliate (<https://www.nami.org/Find-Your-Local-NAMI>). NAMI has 600+ affiliates across all 50 states.
- Host community forums with your local community mental health center director to discuss services available, unmet needs, and how the community can support the center
- Partner with local law enforcement to advocate for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training. CIT programs train officers to respond effectively to mental health crises and connect individuals to community treatment rather than arrest. CIT International provides implementation guidance (<https://www.citinternational.org/>).
- Attend your city or county council meetings when mental health funding, crisis services, or behavioral health facility siting decisions are on the agenda. NIMBY opposition to community mental health facilities is most effective when unopposed; your presence matters.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect mental health advocates with housing advocates, criminal justice reform groups, and homeless service providers. Community mental health reform intersects with all of these issues, and cross-sector coalitions are more politically powerful than single-issue groups.
- Engage local business leaders through organizations like the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions or your local Chamber of Commerce. Employers lose an estimated $225 billion annually from untreated mental illness (NAMI, 2023); the business case for community mental health investment is strong.
- Reach out to faith communities, which often serve as informal mental health support networks and can be powerful allies for reducing stigma and increasing funding

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During the annual federal appropriations process (typically February through September), when SAMHSA, CMS, and HRSA budgets are set
- When mental health legislation is pending in the Senate HELP Committee or House Energy & Commerce Committee
- When your state legislature is considering Medicaid behavioral health policy, CCBHC State Plan Amendment adoption, or state mental health budget allocations
- After mass casualty events, when political attention to mental health is temporarily elevated and legislative windows open

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Full Funding for Community Mental Health and CCBHC Expansion

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as your constituent from [City, State] to urge your support for
full federal funding for community mental health services, including national
expansion of Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs).

57.8 million American adults experience mental illness, yet only 47.2% receive
treatment. In our state, [insert state-specific data from Mental Health
America rankings]. The CCBHC model has demonstrated a 60% reduction in
emergency department visits and a 40% reduction in jail bookings among
clients -- saving taxpayer dollars while improving lives.

I urge you to support:
- Enhanced federal Medicaid matching for CCBHC State Plan Amendments
- Full funding for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and mobile crisis teams
- Expanded National Health Service Corps behavioral health loan repayment slots
- Community behavioral health technology modernization grants

[Optional: Add a personal story about how mental illness has affected your
family, community, or professional experience.]

Thank you for your service and consideration of this critical issue.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling to
urge [Representative/Senator] [Last Name] to support full funding for
community mental health services and CCBHC expansion. The CCBHC model has
reduced emergency room visits by 60% and jail bookings by 40% -- it works,
and it saves money. Please note my support for enhanced Medicaid funding for
CCBHCs. Can you confirm you've recorded my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current and proposed legislation to support:

- **Community Mental Health Transformation Act**: Enhanced federal Medicaid matching rates for CCBHC State Plan Amendments, planning grants for non-participating states, and CCBHC quality reporting requirements -- Contact members of the Senate HELP Committee and House Energy & Commerce Committee
- **988 Sustainment and Improvement Act**: Full annual funding for 988 operations, mobile crisis teams, and crisis stabilization facility construction -- Contact Appropriations Committee members
- **HITECH for Behavioral Health Act**: Technology modernization grants for community mental health EHR systems -- Contact Health IT Subcommittee members
- **ACT Expansion and Fidelity Act**: Dedicated funding for Assertive Community Treatment team development with fidelity standards -- Contact SAMHSA reauthorization bill sponsors
- **Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act reauthorization**: Continuation and expansion of the CCBHC demonstration program -- Contact bipartisan CCBHC caucus members

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support national expansion of Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) through enhanced Medicaid funding? What level of federal investment do you support?"
2. "What specific steps would you take to address the mental health workforce shortage, given that 169 million Americans live in mental health professional shortage areas?"
3. "How would you ensure that community mental health services are available in rural and underserved areas of our state/district?"
4. "Do you support full funding for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and mobile crisis teams as alternatives to law enforcement response for mental health emergencies?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who support Medicaid expansion (in non-expansion states), which is the single largest coverage mechanism for adults with mental illness
- Identify candidates who serve on or seek seats on committees with jurisdiction over mental health: Senate HELP Committee, Senate Finance Committee, House Energy & Commerce Committee, House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, and Education
- Review candidates' positions on behavioral health parity enforcement, which ensures private insurance covers mental health equitably with physical health

## Professional Actions

- **For Mental Health Clinicians**: Advocate with your state licensing board for scope-of-practice reforms that allow psychiatric nurse practitioners and psychologists to practice to the full extent of their training. These reforms are essential to addressing workforce shortages in community mental health. Consider working in a CMHC or CCBHC -- the NHSC offers up to $50,000 in loan repayment for providers in underserved areas (<https://nhsc.hrsa.gov/>).
- **For Primary Care Providers**: Implement the Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) in your practice to integrate behavioral health screening, care management, and psychiatric consultation. CoCM codes (99492-99494) are reimbursable by Medicare and many Medicaid programs. Training is available through the AIMS Center at the University of Washington (<https://aims.uw.edu/>).
- **For Law Enforcement**: Support Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training for your department. CIT-trained officers resolve mental health calls more safely and divert individuals from jail to treatment. Training models are available through CIT International (<https://www.citinternational.org/>).
- **For Educators**: Advocate for school-based mental health services through Project AWARE and related SAMHSA programs. Early identification and intervention for youth mental health conditions prevents escalation and reduces the burden on community mental health centers.
- **For Employers**: Implement employee mental health programs and advocate for adequate behavioral health benefits in your company's insurance plan. Support workplace mental health awareness through organizations like One Mind at Work (<https://onemindatwork.org/>).

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing community mental health with others, emphasize:

1. **The treatment gap is enormous**: 57.8 million Americans have mental illness, but only 47.2% receive treatment. For substance use disorders, the treatment rate is just 7.6%. This is a system-wide failure, not an individual one (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022).
2. **The CCBHC model works**: Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics have demonstrated a 60% reduction in ED visits, a 40% reduction in jail bookings, and a 30% reduction in homelessness among clients. This is not theory -- it is demonstrated outcomes from over 540 clinics across 40+ states (National Council, 2023).
3. **We spend more by spending less**: Untreated mental illness costs an estimated $280 billion annually in emergency services, incarceration, homelessness, and lost productivity. Every dollar invested in comprehensive community mental health reduces downstream costs by $1.30-$2.00 (National Council, 2023; Insel, 2008 adjusted).
4. **Community mental health is a public safety issue**: 10-20% of police calls involve individuals with mental illness. Community crisis teams and CCBHCs divert these calls from law enforcement, making communities safer for everyone (CIT International, 2023).

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Community mental health already failed -- just look at homelessness and jails" | Community mental health was never adequately funded. The CCBHC model addresses the structural failures (underfunding, fragmentation) that caused earlier shortcomings. | National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023 |
| "People with mental illness are dangerous" | People with mental illness are 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators. Only 3-5% of violent acts are attributable to serious mental illness. | SAMHSA, 2022; MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study |
| "We can't afford to expand mental health services" | The cost of untreated mental illness ($280 billion annually) far exceeds the cost of community mental health investment (~$9 billion additional annual federal spending for national CCBHC implementation). | Insel, 2008 adjusted; National Council, 2023 |
| "Mental health is a personal responsibility, not a government one" | Serious mental illness is a brain-based medical condition. Medicaid covers 40% of adults with SMI. The market cannot profitably serve the most complex populations -- that is why community mental health centers exist. | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022; KFF, 2023 |
| "Telehealth apps can replace community mental health centers" | Telehealth serves mild-to-moderate conditions in commercially insured populations. It cannot provide crisis services, ACT teams, case management, housing support, or psychiatric rehabilitation for individuals with SMI. | National Council, 2023 |
