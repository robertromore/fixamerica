# Community Mental Health: Stakeholders

The community mental health system is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with its own interests, resources, and degree of influence over policy and funding decisions. Understanding these stakeholders is essential to building effective reform coalitions.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Adults with serious mental illness (SMI) | Most severely affected; dependence on community services for housing, treatment, employment | 14.1 million | Access to comprehensive treatment, housing stability, recovery supports, civil rights |
| Adults with any mental illness (AMI) | Rely on outpatient community services for therapy, medication, crisis intervention | 57.8 million | Timely access to care, insurance coverage, affordable copays, stigma reduction |
| People with co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorders | Need integrated treatment rarely available in fragmented system | 21.5 million | Integrated treatment programs, reduced barriers between MH and SUD systems |
| Children and adolescents with mental health conditions | Depend on school-linked and community-based services | ~7.7 million youth (ages 6-17) | Early intervention, school-based services, family support, developmental appropriateness |
| Family members and caregivers | Provide unpaid care, navigate fragmented system, bear emotional and financial burden | ~8.4 million family caregivers of adults with SMI | Respite services, family psychoeducation, navigation support, crisis intervention access |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **People experiencing homelessness**: An estimated 30-40% of individuals experiencing homelessness have a serious mental illness. Community mental health is a gateway to housing stability and recovery (HUD Annual Homeless Assessment Report, 2023).
- **Incarcerated individuals with mental illness**: Approximately 356,268 inmates in jails and prisons have severe mental illness -- 10 times the number in state psychiatric hospitals. Community mental health services are essential for diversion and reentry (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2014).
- **Law enforcement officers**: Police are the first responders to most mental health crises; they bear the burden of a system that lacks adequate community crisis services. An estimated 10-20% of police calls involve individuals with mental illness (CIT International, 2023).
- **Emergency department staff**: Psychiatric boarding -- holding patients in EDs for days awaiting placement -- strains emergency medicine capacity. The average psychiatric ED hold exceeded 24 hours in 2023 (American College of Emergency Physicians, 2023).
- **Employers and the general economy**: Untreated mental illness costs employers an estimated $225 billion annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and turnover (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2023).

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Authorizes and funds SAMHSA, MHBG, CCBHC programs | Appropriations power; legislative authority over Medicaid | Federal budget (~$7 billion in behavioral health spending, FY2024) | High |
| Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) | Administers Medicaid behavioral health coverage; approves State Plan Amendments for CCBHCs | Regulatory authority over largest payer | $89 billion in Medicaid behavioral health spending (FY2022) | High |
| SAMHSA | Administers block grants, CCBHC grants, PRNS programs; sets national guidelines | Grant-making authority; technical assistance | ~$7.5 billion total budget (FY2024) | High |
| State Mental Health Authorities (SMHAs) | Plan and oversee state community mental health systems; distribute block grant funds | Licensing, certification, state funding allocation | Varies ($30-$250+ per capita by state) | High |
| State Medicaid Directors | Set behavioral health reimbursement rates; implement CCBHC State Plan Amendments | Rate-setting, benefit design, managed care contracting | State Medicaid budgets (behavioral health portion) | High |
| HRSA | Administers behavioral health workforce programs; designates Mental Health HPSAs | Workforce funding, shortage area designation | $315 million in behavioral health workforce funding (FY2024) | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **National Council for Mental Wellbeing**: The primary trade association for community behavioral health organizations. Represents over 3,000 member organizations, including most CMHCs and CCBHCs. Leads CCBHC advocacy, provides technical assistance, and publishes annual data on the CCBHC model. The most influential industry voice in community mental health policy.
- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: The largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization in the United States, with 600+ affiliates across all 50 states. Focuses on access to services, parity enforcement, and anti-stigma campaigns. Operates HelpLine, family support groups, and peer education programs.
- **Mental Health America (MHA)**: National nonprofit focused on prevention, early intervention, and community-based services. Publishes annual *State of Mental Health in America* report with state-by-state rankings.
- **Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC)**: Advocates for policies to ensure treatment access for individuals with severe mental illness, including Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) and expanded inpatient capacity. Often in tension with consumer/recovery-oriented organizations on issues of involuntary treatment.
- **SAMHSA Office of Recovery**: Within SAMHSA, promotes recovery-oriented systems of care, peer support integration, and consumer involvement in service planning and governance.

### Influencers

- **National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD)**: The organization of state mental health commissioners. Provides technical assistance to states, conducts research, and advises Congress and SAMHSA on policy. Significant influence on how federal dollars are distributed and spent.
- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: The professional organization of psychiatrists. Advocates for adequate psychiatric workforce, reimbursement rates, and scope of practice protections. Influential in clinical guidelines and payment policy.
- **American Psychological Association**: Advocates for psychologist workforce, research funding, and scope of practice (including prescribing authority in some states).
- **National Association of Social Workers (NASW)**: Represents licensed clinical social workers, the largest provider group in community mental health. Advocates for workforce development, loan forgiveness, and reimbursement equity.
- **Peer support advocacy organizations**: Including Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA), Copeland Center for Wellness and Recovery, and state-level peer specialist associations. Advocate for peer specialist certification, reimbursement, and integration into clinical teams.
- **Managed Behavioral Health Organizations (MBHOs)**: Companies like Optum Behavioral Health, Beacon Health Options (now Carelon), and Magellan Health manage behavioral health benefits for Medicaid and commercial plans. Their reimbursement decisions and network management directly affect community mental health center viability.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAMI + National Council + MHA + NASMHPD | Increased federal community mental health funding | Strong |
| National Council + CCBHCs + CMS | CCBHC expansion and Prospective Payment System adequacy | Strong |
| Law enforcement + NAMI + National Council | Crisis services expansion; 988 + mobile crisis team funding | Strong |
| APA + APA + NASW + HRSA | Behavioral health workforce investment | Moderate |
| Consumer/recovery organizations + SAMHSA | Recovery-oriented systems, peer support integration | Moderate |
| Hospitals + CMHCs + insurers | Reduction in psychiatric boarding through community alternatives | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Treatment Advocacy Center vs. Consumer/Recovery Organizations**: TAC advocates for expanded Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) and involuntary interventions for individuals with untreated SMI. Consumer and recovery organizations oppose involuntary treatment as a violation of autonomy and argue for voluntary, person-centered services. This is the most significant intra-advocacy split in community mental health.
- **State Fiscal Officers vs. Mental Health Advocates**: State budget offices seek to minimize state spending on mental health services. Advocacy organizations push for expanded investment. When federal funding increases (e.g., MHBG appropriations), states sometimes reduce their own spending -- a "crowd-out" effect that undermines the federal investment.
- **Managed Care Organizations vs. Community Providers**: MCOs managing Medicaid behavioral health benefits may set reimbursement rates below the cost of care, restrict authorization for services, and impose administrative burdens. Community providers argue that managed care prioritizes cost containment over access and quality.
- **Psychiatrists vs. Non-Physician Providers**: Scope of practice disputes (e.g., whether psychologists or nurse practitioners can prescribe medications) affect workforce capacity in community settings. Psychiatrists support scope limitations; non-physician providers argue that expanding scope is essential to addressing shortages in underserved communities.

### The Federal-State-Provider Triangle

Community mental health operates through a triangular relationship:

1. **Federal government** (Congress, SAMHSA, CMS): Sets policy, provides funding, establishes standards
2. **State governments** (SMHAs, Medicaid agencies): Distribute funds, license providers, set rates, plan systems
3. **Community providers** (CMHCs, CCBHCs, FQHCs): Deliver services, hire staff, manage operations

Each vertex depends on the others but has different priorities. Federal agencies want national standards and accountability. States want flexibility and minimal unfunded mandates. Providers want adequate reimbursement and reduced administrative burden. Reform requires aligning these interests.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on policy:

- **Lobbying**: The National Council for Mental Wellbeing spent $1.2 million on federal lobbying in 2023. The American Psychiatric Association spent $2.1 million. NAMI spent $860,000. Mental health lobbying is modest compared to pharmaceutical or hospital industries but has proven effective on targeted legislation (e.g., CCBHC provisions in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act) (OpenSecrets, 2024).
- **Campaign Contributions**: Mental health-specific PAC contributions are small (under $5 million total for the 2022 cycle), but mental health organizations leverage broader healthcare and disability coalitions. Key congressional champions (e.g., members of the Energy & Commerce and Appropriations Committees) receive targeted support.
- **Grassroots Advocacy**: NAMI's 600+ affiliates and 500,000+ supporters conduct annual advocacy days, constituent meetings, and letter-writing campaigns. The personal stories of individuals with mental illness and their families are among the most powerful advocacy tools in this policy area.
- **Data and Evidence**: The National Council's annual CCBHC outcomes data, SAMHSA's NSDUH surveys, and academic research provide the evidence base that policymakers rely on. CCBHC expansion has been driven largely by demonstration data showing cost savings and outcome improvements.
- **Media and Public Awareness**: Mass casualty events, investigative journalism about psychiatric boarding or jail conditions, and celebrity disclosure of mental health conditions periodically elevate public attention and create windows for legislative action.
