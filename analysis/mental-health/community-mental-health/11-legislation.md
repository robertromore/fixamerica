# Community Mental Health: Legislation

## Overview

Community mental health reform requires a legislative strategy that addresses the root causes of system failure: chronic underfunding, fragmented governance, workforce shortages, and inadequate accountability. The legislative approach builds on the existing CCBHC framework established by Section 223 of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-93) and the permanent Medicaid CCBHC option created by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-159). Rather than creating entirely new programs, the strategy accelerates and completes the transition to CCBHCs as the national standard for community behavioral health, while addressing workforce, crisis, technology, and housing gaps through complementary legislation.

The approach is primarily federal, using Medicaid as the financing vehicle and SAMHSA as the coordinating agency, supplemented by state model legislation for areas of state jurisdiction (scope of practice, crisis continuum, housing). This reflects the reality that community mental health depends on federal-state partnership, with federal standards and funding providing the floor and states implementing within their specific contexts.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for community mental health reform.* The federal government has clear authority to condition Medicaid participation on service standards (under the Spending Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, Section 8, cl. 1) and to fund community behavioral health programs through SAMHSA and HRSA. The CCBHC Medicaid State Plan Amendment option is a voluntary program that states choose to adopt, avoiding Spending Clause coercion concerns raised in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012).

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To accelerate the nationwide implementation of Certified Community
Behavioral Health Clinics through enhanced federal Medicaid matching
and state planning support.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Community Mental Health Transformation
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration (SAMHSA), 57.8 million American adults experienced
    mental illness in 2021, yet only 47.2 percent received any
    treatment.

(2) Approximately 14.1 million adults have serious mental illness
    (SMI), including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe major
    depression, yet 34.6 percent (4.9 million) received no treatment.

(3) The Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC)
    demonstration program, authorized under Section 223 of the
    Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-93),
    has demonstrated a 60 percent reduction in emergency department
    visits, a 40 percent reduction in jail bookings, and a 30 percent
    reduction in homelessness among clients served.

(4) As of 2024, more than 540 CCBHCs operate across more than 40
    States, but national implementation requires incentivizing
    adoption in remaining States and expanding the number of
    certified clinics.

(5) The Community Mental Health Services Block Grant (MHBG) totaled
    $1.06 billion in fiscal year 2024, a fraction of the estimated
    $280 billion annual economic burden of mental illness, indicating
    that comprehensive reform of financing mechanisms is necessary.

(6) Medicaid serves as the single largest payer for behavioral health
    services, covering approximately 27 percent of all adults with
    mental illness, and the CCBHC Prospective Payment System provides
    a proven mechanism for ensuring adequate reimbursement.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) CCBHC.--The term "Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic"
    or "CCBHC" has the meaning given such term under Section
    223(a)(2) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014
    (Public Law 113-93), as amended.

(2) ENHANCED FMAP.--The term "enhanced FMAP" means the increased
    Federal Medical Assistance Percentage applicable to CCBHC
    services as specified in section 4(b) of this Act.

(3) PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM.--The term "Prospective Payment
    System" or "PPS" means the cost-based prospective reimbursement
    methodology for CCBHC services as defined by the Secretary.

(4) SECRETARY.--The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services.

(5) STATE PLAN AMENDMENT.--The term "State Plan Amendment" or "SPA"
    means a modification to a State's Medicaid plan under title XIX
    of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) to include
    the CCBHC option authorized under section 1947 of such Act.

SEC. 4. ENHANCED FEDERAL MATCHING FOR CCBHC SERVICES.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with
    respect to amounts expended by a State for medical assistance for
    CCBHC services furnished under a State Plan Amendment adopted
    pursuant to section 1947 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
    1396w-2), the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage shall be
    increased as specified in subsection (b).

(b) ENHANCED FMAP RATES.--
    (1) For the 3-year period beginning on the date a State adopts
        a CCBHC State Plan Amendment, the Federal Medical Assistance
        Percentage for CCBHC services shall be 90 percent.
    (2) For each fiscal year thereafter, the Federal Medical
        Assistance Percentage for CCBHC services shall be 80 percent.
    (3) The enhanced rates under this subsection shall apply only to
        expenditures for services furnished by entities certified as
        CCBHCs meeting the criteria established by the Secretary
        under section 5 of this Act.

SEC. 5. STANDARDIZED CCBHC CERTIFICATION.

    the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,
    shall publish standardized certification criteria for CCBHCs,
    including--
    (1) the nine required service categories established under
        Section 223(a)(2) of Public Law 113-93;
    (2) 24-hour crisis services capacity, including mobile crisis
        team deployment capability;
    (3) staffing and credentialing requirements;
    (4) quality measurement and reporting requirements; and
    (5) Prospective Payment System rate-setting methodology.

(b) PPS RATE-SETTING.--

        States to calculate CCBHC PPS rates based on the anticipated
        reasonable costs of providing required services.
    (2) PPS rates shall be reviewed and updated not less than every
        3 years.
    (3) The Secretary shall ensure that PPS rates are sufficient to
        cover the actual cost of providing all required CCBHC
        services, including crisis services, peer support, and care
        coordination.

SEC. 6. STATE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT GRANTS.

    (2) building State capacity for CCBHC certification and
        oversight;
    (3) supporting existing community mental health centers in
        meeting CCBHC certification criteria;
    (4) developing PPS rate-setting actuarial capacity; and
    (5) training State staff in CCBHC administration.

(c) AMOUNT.--Each eligible State shall receive a grant of not less
    than $5,000,000 and not more than $15,000,000, based on State
    population and existing behavioral health infrastructure.

SEC. 7. QUALITY REPORTING.

(a) ANNUAL REPORTS.--Not later than 1 year after the date of
    enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, each State that
    has adopted a CCBHC State Plan Amendment shall submit to the
    Secretary a report on CCBHC performance that includes--
    (1) the number of CCBHCs certified and operating;
    (2) the number of individuals served, disaggregated by diagnosis,
        demographics, and insurance status;
    (3) standardized quality measures as defined by the Secretary;
    (4) crisis services utilization data; and

    (2) $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2028 for planning and
        development grants under section 6;
    (3) such sums as may be necessary for enhanced FMAP payments
        under section 4 for fiscal years 2027 through 2036; and
    (4) $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2031 for
        Federal administration, technical assistance, and quality
        measurement.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 90 days after the date
of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the evidence base for legislative action, citing specific data on the treatment gap, CCBHC demonstration outcomes, and the economic burden of untreated mental illness
- **Section 4 (Enhanced FMAP)**: The 90/10 matching rate for the first 3 years makes CCBHC adoption financially compelling for states, mirroring the ACA's Medicaid expansion FMAP structure. The 80/20 rate thereafter provides sustained support above the standard FMAP
- **Section 5 (Standardized Certification)**: Ensures consistent CCBHC quality across states by establishing federal certification criteria and PPS rate-setting methodology, addressing the variability that undermined earlier community mental health reforms
- **Section 7 (Quality Reporting)**: Creates accountability through standardized outcome reporting, enabling comparison across states and identification of underperformance

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Secretary publishes standardized CCBHC certification criteria | 180 days after enactment | SAMHSA |
| Secretary publishes PPS rate-setting methodology | 270 days after enactment | CMS |
| Planning grants awarded to non-participating states | 1 year after enactment | SAMHSA |
| First annual quality reports due from participating states | 1 year after enactment | States |
| Enhanced FMAP available for new CCBHC State Plan Amendments | 90 days after enactment | CMS |

**Regulatory Authority**: SAMHSA administers CCBHC certification and quality reporting. CMS administers the enhanced FMAP and PPS methodology. Both agencies coordinate through an interagency agreement.

**Challenges**:

- **CBO Scoring**: The enhanced FMAP increases mandatory Medicaid spending; CBO scoring will determine the budgetary impact and may require offsets
- **State Actuarial Capacity**: Some states lack the actuarial expertise to calculate PPS rates; SAMHSA technical assistance must address this gap
- **Non-Expansion States**: States that have not expanded Medicaid will have smaller Medicaid-eligible populations, reducing the CCBHC funding base and requiring supplemental federal support

**Refinements**:

- **Phase-in Provision**: States with fewer than 5 existing CMHCs could receive an extended 5-year enhanced FMAP at 90/10 to allow for facility development
- **Small State Supplement**: A minimum planning grant of $8 million for states with populations under 1 million would ensure adequate resources for small states

## State Model Legislation

### Model Community Crisis Continuum Act

**Purpose**: Establish a complete mental health crisis continuum in every community: 988 call center, mobile crisis team, and crisis stabilization facility.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize facility capacity requirements based on population density, adjust funding mechanisms based on state budget structure, and align definitions with existing state mental health law.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Community
Crisis Continuum Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(1) Mental health crises in this State disproportionately result in
    emergency department visits, law enforcement encounters, and
    incarceration due to the absence of community-based crisis
    services.

(2) Mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization facilities provide
    clinically appropriate and cost-effective alternatives to
    emergency departments and jails for individuals in behavioral
    health crisis.

(3) The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline requires state-level
    infrastructure to ensure calls are answered locally and
    connected to community-based response.

SECTION 3. CRISIS CONTINUUM REQUIREMENTS.

(a) Not later than 3 years after the effective date of this Act, the
    [State Mental Health Authority] shall ensure that every
    [county/region] in this State has access to:
    (1) A 988 crisis call center with capacity to answer calls from
        the geographic area within the designated service region;
    (2) A mobile crisis team capable of responding to behavioral
        health emergencies within 60 minutes in urban areas and 90
        minutes in rural areas; and
    (3) A crisis stabilization facility with a minimum of [8-16]
        beds, or access to such a facility within the designated
        service region.

(b) MEDICAID COVERAGE.--The [State Medicaid Agency] shall provide
    Medicaid reimbursement for mobile crisis services and crisis
    stabilization services as authorized under Section 9813 of the
    American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

SECTION 4. FUNDING.

(a) The [State Mental Health Authority] shall fund the crisis
    continuum through a combination of federal Medicaid matching,
    988 sustainment funds, Community Mental Health Services Block
    Grant set-aside, and State general fund appropriations.

(b) There is appropriated from the [State general fund/designated
    fund] the sum of $[amount] for fiscal year [year] to carry out
    the purposes of this Act.

SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: SAMHSA (certification, quality, grants); CMS (Medicaid PPS, enhanced FMAP); HRSA (workforce programs)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **CCBHC Certification Standards Rule**: Standardized certification criteria for all CCBHCs, including service requirements, staffing standards, and quality measures. Deadline: 180 days after enactment of the Community Mental Health Transformation Act.
2. **PPS Rate-Setting Methodology Rule**: Standardized methodology for calculating CCBHC Prospective Payment System rates, including cost categories, adjustment factors, and rate review timelines. Deadline: 270 days after enactment.
3. **Quality Reporting Rule**: Standardized performance measures, reporting requirements, data submission formats, and consequences for non-compliance. Deadline: 1 year after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Decertification**: CCBHCs that fail to meet certification criteria are subject to corrective action plans and, if deficiencies persist, decertification and loss of PPS reimbursement
- **State Accountability**: States that fail to meet minimum quality reporting requirements face reduction in enhanced FMAP rates
- **Federal Monitoring**: SAMHSA conducts annual site reviews of a sample of CCBHCs in each state
- **Private Right of Action**: Individuals who are denied CCBHC services may file complaints with the state Medicaid agency and, if unresolved, with CMS

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: The Community Mental Health Transformation Act conditions enhanced Medicaid funding on state adoption of the CCBHC model. Under *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), Congress may condition federal spending on state compliance with federal requirements, provided the conditions are related to the federal interest, are unambiguous, and do not constitute coercion. The CCBHC SPA is a voluntary option that provides additional funding, making coercion concerns minimal. The structure deliberately avoids the Medicaid expansion coercion problem identified in *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), by offering enhanced FMAP as an incentive rather than threatening loss of existing Medicaid funding.

**Commerce Clause**: Federal authority over community mental health is primarily exercised through the Spending Clause (Medicaid) rather than the Commerce Clause. SAMHSA grant programs are authorized under the general welfare spending power.

**Federalism Concerns**: The legislation preserves state flexibility by making CCBHC adoption voluntary. States choose whether to adopt the SPA, set their own PPS rates within federal methodology guidelines, and determine which clinics are certified. Federal standards establish a floor, not a ceiling.

### Preemption

The Community Mental Health Transformation Act does not preempt state mental health law. States retain authority over involuntary commitment, scope of practice, licensure, and state mental health system governance. The CCBHC certification criteria supplement, rather than replace, existing state regulatory frameworks. State model legislation (crisis continuum, scope of practice) operates independently of federal legislation.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through three mechanisms: (1) CCBHC certification reviews by state agencies under federal standards; (2) annual quality reporting with standardized measures; (3) CMS audits of state PPS rate adequacy and FMAP expenditures. Non-compliant CCBHCs face corrective action plans and potential decertification. Non-compliant states face reduction in enhanced FMAP rates.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| "Paper CCBHC" certification | States could certify clinics that meet minimal criteria on paper but lack actual capacity to deliver all 9 required service categories | High | Require on-site verification of service delivery capacity as part of certification; mandate mystery patient audits; tie certification to demonstrated service volume, not just policies |
| PPS rate gaming | Clinics could inflate cost projections to maximize PPS rates without corresponding service improvements | Medium | Require annual cost reconciliation with actual expenditures; cap PPS rate growth at CPI-Medical plus 2%; mandate independent actuarial review |
| Subcontracting without accountability | CCBHCs could subcontract required services to providers that do not meet CCBHC quality standards | Medium | Require that subcontracted services meet the same quality and access standards as directly provided services; hold CCBHCs accountable for subcontractor performance |
| State crowd-out | States could reduce existing state mental health funding when enhanced federal FMAP increases, resulting in no net increase in services | High | Include maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirement: states must maintain state mental health spending at no less than the average of the prior 3 fiscal years as a condition of enhanced FMAP |
| Cherry-picking clients | CCBHCs could prioritize lower-acuity, lower-cost clients to improve outcomes metrics while neglecting individuals with SMI | Medium | Require minimum percentage of clients with SMI diagnosis; weight quality measures to reflect outcomes for highest-acuity populations |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Voluntary state adoption | Some states may decline CCBHC SPA, leaving populations in those states without access to CCBHC services | Political opposition to Medicaid expansion of any kind in some states | Enhanced FMAP makes adoption financially attractive; planning grants reduce barriers; bipartisan support demonstrated in red and blue states; consider mandatory transition after 5-year voluntary period |
| Workforce timeline lag | NHSC expansion and training pipeline take 4-8 years to produce providers; workforce shortages will persist in early phases | Training programs have fixed duration; providers must complete education before serving | Telehealth expansion bridges short-term gaps; peer specialist integration expands non-traditional workforce; scope-of-practice reform (state-level) increases existing provider capacity |
| Housing supply constraints | CCBHC services alone cannot solve homelessness for individuals with SMI if housing stock is insufficient | Housing shortage is a structural problem beyond mental health policy | Housing integration legislation (HUD-SAMHSA partnerships, Section 811 expansion) addresses supply; tenancy support services address stability |
| 42 CFR Part 2 data sharing barriers | Federal confidentiality rules for substance use disorder records impede care coordination between CCBHCs and other providers | Legislation designed to protect SUD patients from discrimination, but outdated rules impede integrated care | Support alignment of 42 CFR Part 2 with HIPAA standards, as recommended by multiple stakeholder groups; the CARES Act (2020) began this alignment but implementation remains incomplete |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-Crowd-Out Provision**: Add maintenance-of-effort requirement to Section 4 of the Community Mental Health Transformation Act, requiring states to maintain state mental health spending at or above the 3-year average prior to CCBHC SPA adoption as a condition of receiving enhanced FMAP.
2. **On-Site Certification Verification**: Amend Section 5 to require that CCBHC certification include on-site verification of service delivery capacity within 6 months of initial certification and annually thereafter, including review of staffing levels, service utilization data, and client outcomes.
3. **SMI Service Minimum**: Add provision requiring that CCBHCs demonstrate that at least 25% of clients served have a diagnosis of serious mental illness, preventing cherry-picking of lower-acuity populations.
4. **PPS Rate Reconciliation**: Amend PPS methodology to require annual reconciliation of projected and actual costs, with rate adjustments if actual costs deviate by more than 10% from projections.
5. **Transition to Mandatory**: Include a 5-year review provision requiring Congress to evaluate whether voluntary adoption has achieved universal state participation. If fewer than 45 states have adopted the CCBHC SPA within 5 years, Congress should consider transitioning to mandatory CCBHC certification for all Medicaid-participating community behavioral health providers.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The enhanced FMAP provisions should be authorized for 10 years (FY2027-FY2036) with a mandatory Congressional reauthorization review in Year 8. The GAO should conduct biennial evaluations beginning in Year 2, assessing CCBHC expansion progress, cost-effectiveness, and outcome trends. Quality reporting requirements create an ongoing data stream that informs reauthorization decisions. The legislation should not include an automatic sunset, as community mental health financing must be durable to avoid the boom-and-bust cycles that have undermined previous reform efforts.
