# Community Mental Health: Solutions

Community mental health requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to transform the fragmented, underfunded system into a comprehensive, adequately financed, recovery-oriented network capable of serving all Americans who need behavioral health services.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Every American should have access to comprehensive community mental health services regardless of geography, income, or insurance status
- Payment systems must cover the actual cost of evidence-based care, not perpetuate the chronic underfunding that has defined community mental health for six decades
- Community mental health must be integrated with primary care, crisis services, housing, employment, and criminal justice -- not siloed as a separate, lower-status system
- Recovery orientation, peer support, and person-centered planning must be foundational to system design, not add-ons to a medical model
- Reform must reduce racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities in access and outcomes

### Theory of Change

The CCBHC model provides the structural vehicle for community mental health transformation. By establishing comprehensive service requirements, a Prospective Payment System that covers actual costs, quality measurement and reporting, and a pathway for any state to adopt the model through Medicaid, CCBHCs address the root causes of community mental health failure: underfunding, fragmentation, and lack of accountability. National CCBHC implementation -- supported by workforce investment, technology modernization, and cross-system integration -- can create the community mental health infrastructure that deinstitutionalization promised but never delivered.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: National CCBHC Implementation

**Description**: Transition all community behavioral health centers to the CCBHC model over 7 years, making CCBHC certification the national standard for community mental health service delivery. This requires Congress to incentivize all remaining states to adopt the CCBHC Medicaid State Plan Amendment option created by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022, with enhanced federal matching rates during the transition period. The target is 2,000+ CCBHCs operating in all 50 states and territories by 2032, ensuring that no American is more than 30 minutes from a CCBHC.

**Evidence Base**: The CCBHC demonstration program (2017-present) produced compelling outcomes across 10 states: 60% reduction in emergency department visits, 40% reduction in jail bookings, 30% reduction in homelessness among clients, and reduction in average wait times from 3+ weeks to fewer than 10 days (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023; ASPE CCBHC Evaluation, 2023). The Prospective Payment System ensures financial sustainability by reimbursing clinics based on the cost of providing all required services rather than fee-for-service billing.

**Implementation**: (1) Congress enacts enhanced federal Medicaid matching rate (90/10 for first 3 years, 80/20 thereafter) for CCBHC Medicaid State Plan Amendments; (2) SAMHSA provides planning grants to all remaining non-participating states; (3) CMS publishes standardized CCBHC certification criteria and PPS rate-setting methodology; (4) States certify existing CMHCs that meet CCBHC criteria and provide development grants to those that need to build capacity; (5) SAMHSA provides technical assistance and quality improvement support throughout transition.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $9 billion in additional annual federal Medicaid spending at full implementation; $2 billion in one-time transition and development grants over 5 years. Total 10-year federal cost: approximately $70 billion, offset by an estimated $90-120 billion in avoided costs across emergency, criminal justice, and homeless service systems (National Council, 2023).

**Timeline**: Years 1-2: planning and incentive legislation; Years 2-5: state adoption and clinic certification; Years 5-7: full national implementation.

**Challenges**: States without Medicaid expansion face larger coverage gaps; workforce shortages may limit clinic capacity in rural areas; PPS rate-setting requires actuarial capacity that some states lack.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of operational CCBHCs; geographic coverage (% of population within 30 minutes); average wait times; ED visit rates; jail booking rates; homelessness rates among clients.

### Solution 2: Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Scaling

**Description**: Expand Assertive Community Treatment teams from an estimated 800 teams nationally to 3,000+ teams, serving approximately 300,000 individuals with serious mental illness. ACT teams provide intensive, multidisciplinary community-based treatment including medication management, housing support, employment assistance, and crisis intervention, with staff-to-client ratios of approximately 1:10. ACT is the most evidence-based model for serving individuals with the most severe and persistent mental illness in community settings.

**Evidence Base**: Over 30 randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that ACT reduces hospitalization by 37%, increases housing stability by 44%, and reduces criminal justice involvement by 26% compared to standard community care (Bond et al., 2001; updated meta-analyses through 2022). ACT is rated as an "evidence-based practice" by SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP). States with strong ACT programs (e.g., Wisconsin, Indiana, Virginia) show significantly better outcomes for individuals with SMI.

**Implementation**: (1) Congress authorizes dedicated ACT expansion funding through SAMHSA; (2) SAMHSA establishes ACT fidelity standards aligned with the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale (DACTS); (3) States develop ACT expansion plans with priority given to high-need areas; (4) CCBHCs serve as organizational homes for ACT teams, integrating ACT with the broader CCBHC service array; (5) Medicaid behavioral health rates are set to cover actual ACT team costs.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $7,500-$12,000 per client per year for ACT services; expanding from 800 to 3,000 teams serving 300,000 individuals would cost approximately $2.5-$3.6 billion annually. Current annual spending on ACT is approximately $800 million.

**Timeline**: Years 1-2: authorization and fidelity standards; Years 2-5: expansion to 1,800 teams; Years 5-8: expansion to 3,000 teams.

**Challenges**: Recruiting psychiatrists and nurses for ACT teams in rural areas; maintaining fidelity as programs scale; ensuring Medicaid reimbursement covers true costs.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of ACT teams; clients served; hospitalization rates; housing stability; employment rates; criminal justice contacts.

### Solution 3: Behavioral Health Workforce Investment

**Description**: Address the community mental health workforce crisis through a comprehensive strategy including expanded loan repayment programs, training pipeline development, competitive salary supports, and scope of practice modernization. The target is to eliminate mental health Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designations within 10 years by adding an estimated 8,200+ behavioral health providers to underserved communities.

**Evidence Base**: HRSA's National Health Service Corps (NHSC) has demonstrated that loan repayment programs effectively recruit providers to underserved areas; 82% of NHSC participants remain in underserved communities after completing their service obligation (HRSA, 2023). Studies show that community mental health center salaries 20-40% below private practice create a workforce pipeline that funnels trained providers away from the populations with the greatest need.

**Implementation**: (1) Triple NHSC behavioral health slots from approximately 6,000 to 18,000; (2) Establish CMHC/CCBHC salary support grants to close the gap with private-practice compensation; (3) Fund residency and internship programs embedded in community mental health settings; (4) Expand peer support specialist certification and reimbursement in all states; (5) Support state scope-of-practice reforms allowing psychiatric nurse practitioners and psychologists to practice to the full extent of their training.

**Cost/Resources**: $1.5 billion annually for expanded loan repayment; $500 million annually for salary support grants; $300 million annually for training pipeline; $200 million annually for peer specialist development. Total: approximately $2.5 billion annually.

**Timeline**: Years 1-2: authorization and initial funding; Years 2-5: pipeline development; Years 5-10: HPSA elimination target.

**Challenges**: Training pipeline requires 4-8 years for new professionals; scope-of-practice battles are fought at the state level; salary supports must be sustained to prevent regression.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of providers in HPSAs; HPSA designation count; CMHC/CCBHC vacancy rates; turnover rates; provider diversity metrics.

### Solution 4: Crisis Continuum Development

**Description**: Build a complete crisis continuum linked to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in every community: (1) 988 call/text/chat center, (2) mobile crisis team, and (3) crisis stabilization facility. This "Someone to Call, Someone to Respond, A Place to Go" model ensures that individuals in mental health crisis receive appropriate community-based care rather than defaulting to emergency departments or law enforcement.

**Evidence Base**: The Georgia Crisis and Access Line achieved a 65% diversion rate from emergency departments; Maricopa County (Arizona) crisis system diverted 80% of behavioral health emergencies from hospitals and jails (National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, 2022). The CCBHC model requires 24/7 crisis services, providing an organizational platform for the crisis continuum.

**Implementation**: (1) Full funding for 988 infrastructure including local call center capacity; (2) Medicaid coverage of mobile crisis services in all states (CMS guidance issued 2022 under ARP Section 9813); (3) Federal grants for crisis stabilization facility construction; (4) CCBHCs serve as crisis hubs with mobile teams and stabilization beds; (5) Integration with law enforcement through co-responder and Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) models.

**Cost/Resources**: $1 billion annually for 988 operations; $800 million annually for mobile crisis team expansion; $500 million in one-time capital for crisis stabilization facilities. Total annual operating cost: approximately $1.8 billion; one-time capital: $500 million.

**Timeline**: Years 1-3: 988 infrastructure and mobile crisis buildout; Years 3-5: crisis stabilization facility construction; Years 5-7: full crisis continuum in all communities.

**Challenges**: Workforce for 24/7 crisis teams; facility siting (NIMBY opposition); coordination between 988, 911, and mobile teams.

**Impact Metrics**: 988 answer rate (target: 95%+); average response time for mobile crisis; ED psychiatric boarding hours; law enforcement mental health call volume.

### Solution 5: Integrated Primary Care-Behavioral Health

**Description**: Embed behavioral health services in primary care settings using the Collaborative Care Model (CoCM), while simultaneously strengthening reverse integration (primary care screening and monitoring within community mental health centers). The goal is to eliminate the artificial separation between physical and behavioral health that leaves most individuals with mental illness untreated.

**Evidence Base**: The Collaborative Care Model has been validated by over 80 randomized controlled trials showing improved depression outcomes, higher treatment engagement, and cost savings (Archer et al., 2012). Medicare has reimbursed CoCM codes (99492-99494) since 2017. Reverse integration through CCBHCs (which require primary care screening and monitoring) has improved physical health outcomes for individuals with SMI.

**Implementation**: (1) Require all FQHCs receiving Section 330 funding to implement CoCM within 5 years; (2) Expand Medicaid reimbursement for CoCM codes in all states; (3) Fund care manager and psychiatric consultant training; (4) CCBHC primary care screening requirements serve as the behavioral-to-physical integration pathway; (5) Develop shared data systems between primary care and behavioral health providers.

**Cost/Resources**: $500 million annually for FQHC behavioral health integration; $200 million annually for CoCM training; Medicaid CoCM reimbursement cost estimated at $300 million annually.

**Timeline**: Years 1-3: CoCM training and Medicaid code adoption; Years 3-5: FQHC integration; Years 5-7: full bidirectional integration.

**Challenges**: Primary care workforce resistance to behavioral health responsibility; reimbursement adequacy for CoCM; data-sharing barriers.

**Impact Metrics**: Depression treatment response rates in primary care; physical health screening rates in CMHCs; all-cause mortality for individuals with SMI.

### Solution 6: Technology Modernization

**Description**: Modernize community mental health center technology infrastructure including electronic health records (EHR), telehealth platforms, data analytics, and health information exchange (HIE) connectivity. Most CMHCs operate with outdated EHRs that cannot support quality measurement, care coordination, or value-based payment -- all required under the CCBHC model.

**Evidence Base**: The HITECH Act (2009) funded EHR adoption in hospitals and physician offices through Meaningful Use incentives, dramatically increasing EHR adoption from 12% to 86% (ONC, 2021). Community mental health centers were excluded from HITECH incentives. A 2023 National Council survey found that 62% of CMHCs reported that their EHR systems were inadequate for CCBHC reporting requirements.

**Implementation**: (1) Establish a Community Behavioral Health Technology fund modeled on HITECH; (2) Require certified EHR technology for all CCBHCs; (3) Fund HIE connectivity between CCBHCs, hospitals, primary care, and criminal justice systems; (4) Expand telehealth infrastructure including broadband for rural centers; (5) Support digital therapeutics integration.

**Cost/Resources**: $2 billion over 5 years for EHR modernization grants; $300 million for HIE connectivity; $200 million for telehealth infrastructure.

**Timeline**: Years 1-2: fund authorization and EHR standards; Years 2-5: modernization implementation; Years 5-7: full interoperability.

**Challenges**: Vendor fragmentation in behavioral health EHR market; privacy concerns (42 CFR Part 2 confidentiality for substance use records); cost of implementation for small rural centers.

**Impact Metrics**: EHR adoption rates; quality measure reporting capability; telehealth utilization; care coordination event tracking.

### Solution 7: Housing First Integration

**Description**: Integrate permanent supportive housing with community mental health services for individuals with serious mental illness who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Community mental health treatment is ineffective when individuals lack stable housing. The Housing First model provides housing without preconditions (sobriety, treatment compliance) and wraps comprehensive services around housing placement.

**Evidence Base**: The At Home/Chez Soi randomized controlled trial in Canada (2009-2013) demonstrated that Housing First reduced homelessness by 73% and was cost-effective, with costs offset by reduced emergency, hospital, and shelter use (Aubry et al., 2015). In the U.S., HUD's Continuum of Care permanent supportive housing programs serve approximately 380,000 individuals, but an estimated 300,000+ additional units are needed (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2023).

**Implementation**: (1) Expand HUD Section 811 and HUD-VASH vouchers with CMHC/CCBHC service linkage; (2) Require CCBHCs to establish formal partnerships with housing providers; (3) Fund housing navigators within community mental health settings; (4) Medicaid coverage of tenancy support services in all states.

**Cost/Resources**: $3 billion annually for expanded housing vouchers; $500 million annually for tenancy support services; $200 million annually for housing navigator positions.

**Timeline**: Years 1-2: voucher expansion and Medicaid tenancy support authorization; Years 3-5: scaled housing-clinical integration; Years 5-10: elimination of chronic homelessness among individuals with SMI.

**Challenges**: Housing supply constraints in high-cost markets; NIMBY opposition to supportive housing facilities; coordination between HUD and HHS.

**Impact Metrics**: Homeless count among individuals with SMI; housing retention rates; days housed per year.

## International Models

### Australia: Primary Health Networks (PHNs)

**Description**: Australia reorganized community mental health through 31 Primary Health Networks that commission mental health services regionally, integrating primary care, specialist services, and psychosocial support. PHNs are responsible for needs assessment, service planning, and outcomes monitoring.

**Results**: Australia increased community mental health access by 34% between 2016 and 2022 while reducing involuntary hospitalizations by 18% (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2023). The PHN model enables regional tailoring while maintaining national standards.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The PHN model's regional commissioning approach could inform the relationship between state mental health authorities and CCBHCs. However, Australia's universal healthcare system eliminates the insurance fragmentation that complicates U.S. service delivery.

### Italy: Community Mental Health Centers (CSMs)

**Description**: Italy abolished all psychiatric hospitals through Law 180 (1978), the most complete deinstitutionalization in world history. Community Mental Health Centers (Centri di Salute Mentale, CSMs) serve as the hub of the system, providing outpatient care, home visits, day programs, and coordination with social services. Italy operates approximately 700 CSMs.

**Results**: Italy's community-based system has maintained psychiatric hospitalization rates 40-60% below the European average while achieving treatment outcomes comparable to or better than countries with mixed institutional/community systems (de Girolamo et al., 2007; updated through 2022). Involuntary treatment rates are among the lowest in Europe.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Italy demonstrates that a fully community-based system is achievable. However, Italy's CSMs benefit from universal healthcare, smaller geographic coverage areas, and a cultural tradition of family-based care that reduces isolation.

### United Kingdom: Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)

**Description**: The UK's IAPT program (now NHS Talking Therapies) provides evidence-based psychological therapy through community settings, with standardized session-by-session outcome measurement. The program treated over 1.2 million people in 2022-2023.

**Results**: IAPT achieves 50% recovery rates for depression and anxiety, with a cost-benefit ratio of approximately 5:1 when accounting for reduced welfare benefits and increased employment (Clark, 2018). The program has reduced medication prescribing for mild to moderate conditions.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The IAPT model's emphasis on standardized outcome measurement and stepped care (matching treatment intensity to severity) could be adapted within the CCBHC framework. However, the UK's single-payer system simplifies implementation.
