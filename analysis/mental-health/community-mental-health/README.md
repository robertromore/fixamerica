# Community Mental Health

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of community-based mental health services in the United States, from the foundational Community Mental Health Centers Act of 1963 through the modern Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) model.

## Overview

Community mental health represents the primary framework through which most Americans with mental illness receive outpatient care. The system emerged from the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1960s, which promised to replace large state psychiatric hospitals with a network of locally operated Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs). That promise was never fully realized: federal funding fell short, state hospital closures outpaced community capacity, and millions of people with serious mental illness were left without adequate care. The consequences -- homelessness, incarceration, and preventable deaths -- persist today.

Modern community mental health operates through a fragmented patchwork of CMHCs, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), state-operated facilities, nonprofit agencies, and private providers. Federal funding flows primarily through Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) block grants and Medicaid reimbursement, while state Mental Health Authorities set priorities and distribute resources. The CCBHC model, first authorized in 2014 and expanded significantly through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022, represents the most promising structural reform in decades -- requiring comprehensive services, evidence-based practices, and prospective payment that covers actual costs of care.

This analysis examines the history and legacy of deinstitutionalization, the current state of community mental health infrastructure, the systemic causes of service gaps, and evidence-based reforms including Assertive Community Treatment (ACT), recovery-oriented systems of care, and full national CCBHC implementation. It proposes legislative and administrative actions to build a community mental health system capable of meeting the needs of all Americans.
