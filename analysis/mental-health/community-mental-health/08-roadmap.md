# Community Mental Health: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The transformation of community mental health requires a phased strategy that builds capacity incrementally while demonstrating results at each stage. The central vehicle is national implementation of the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) model, supported by parallel investments in workforce development, crisis continuum buildout, technology modernization, and cross-system integration.

The phases are designed to reinforce each other: Phase 1 establishes the legislative and financial foundation, accelerates CCBHC adoption, and addresses the most urgent workforce and crisis gaps. Phase 2 scales proven models to achieve critical mass, integrating behavioral health with primary care and housing services. Phase 3 completes the transformation, achieving universal geographic access, eliminating workforce shortage designations, and sustaining outcomes through durable payment and accountability systems.

This roadmap assumes bipartisan legislative action building on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-159), which established the permanent CCBHC Medicaid state plan option. The strategy leverages Medicaid as the primary financing mechanism, supplemented by targeted federal grants, to minimize reliance on annual discretionary appropriations.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation and Acceleration (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Enact enhanced federal Medicaid matching rates for CCBHC State Plan Amendments to incentivize adoption in all remaining states
- Expand the behavioral health workforce pipeline by doubling NHSC mental health loan repayment slots
- Achieve operational 988 crisis infrastructure with 95%+ answer rate and mobile crisis team deployment in 80% of communities
- Fund community behavioral health EHR modernization planning grants
- Certify 800+ CCBHCs operating across all 50 states

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Enact Community Mental Health Transformation Act with 90/10 enhanced FMAP for CCBHC SPAs | Congress | Months 1-12 | Congressional action; CBO scoring | Enacted into law |
| Issue CMS guidance on standardized CCBHC certification and PPS rate-setting | CMS | Months 6-18 | CMS staff; actuarial support | Guidance published |
| Distribute SAMHSA CCBHC planning grants to non-participating states | SAMHSA | Months 6-12 | $200 million in planning grants | Grants awarded to all remaining states |
| Expand NHSC behavioral health slots from 6,000 to 12,000 | HRSA | Months 1-18 | $750 million additional annual funding | 12,000 active slots |
| Fund 988 local call center capacity and mobile crisis team expansion | SAMHSA | Months 1-24 | $1 billion for 988; $800 million for mobile crisis | 95% answer rate; mobile teams in 80% of communities |
| Launch Community Behavioral Health Technology planning grants | SAMHSA/ONC | Months 12-24 | $300 million in planning grants | Plans completed for 1,500+ CMHCs |
| Issue Medicaid guidance clarifying mobile crisis and crisis stabilization coverage | CMS | Months 1-6 | CMS staff; state consultation | Guidance published; 40+ states implementing |

### Legislative Requirements

- Community Mental Health Transformation Act: Enhanced FMAP for CCBHC SPAs (90/10 for years 1-3, 80/20 thereafter), CCBHC planning grants, behavioral health workforce expansion authorization
- 988 Sustainment and Improvement Act: Full annual funding for 988 operations, mobile crisis teams, and crisis stabilization facility construction grants
- HITECH for Behavioral Health Act: Technology modernization grants for community mental health EHR systems, modeled on the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 establishes the financial and regulatory framework for national CCBHC implementation. By the end of Year 2, all 50 states will have either adopted the CCBHC Medicaid State Plan Amendment or initiated planning. The 988 crisis system will achieve reliable nationwide operation. The workforce pipeline will begin producing additional providers for underserved areas, though the full impact of loan repayment expansion takes 3-5 years to materialize. Early-adopting CCBHCs will demonstrate outcomes consistent with the demonstration program: reduced ED visits, reduced jail bookings, and reduced wait times.

---

## Phase 2: Scaling and Integration (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Achieve 1,500+ operational CCBHCs across all 50 states and territories
- Scale Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams from 800 to 1,800 nationally
- Implement Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) in all Federally Qualified Health Centers
- Complete community behavioral health EHR modernization in 80% of CMHCs/CCBHCs
- Establish formal housing partnerships between CCBHCs and HUD-funded providers in all communities
- Achieve full crisis continuum (988 + mobile crisis + stabilization facility) in 70% of communities

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Certify 1,500+ CCBHCs with standardized PPS rates | States/CMS | Months 24-60 | State certification staff; CMS oversight; PPS funding | 1,500+ certified CCBHCs |
| Scale ACT teams to 1,800 with SAMHSA fidelity standards | SAMHSA/States | Months 24-60 | $1.5 billion additional annual ACT funding | 1,800 teams serving 180,000 individuals |
| Require CoCM implementation in all Section 330 FQHCs | HRSA | Months 24-48 | $500 million annually for FQHC behavioral health integration | CoCM in all 1,375 FQHCs |

| Construct crisis stabilization facilities in underserved areas | States/SAMHSA | Months 24-60 | $500 million in capital grants | Crisis stabilization in 70% of communities |
| Expand NHSC behavioral health slots to 18,000 | HRSA | Months 24-48 | $1.5 billion annually | 18,000 active slots |

### Legislative Requirements

- ACT Expansion and Fidelity Act: Dedicated funding stream for ACT team development with mandatory fidelity standards aligned with the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale
- Housing and Behavioral Health Integration Act: Expanded Section 811 vouchers with CCBHC service linkage requirements; Medicaid coverage of tenancy support services in all states
- Reauthorization of enhanced FMAP for CCBHC SPAs through Year 10

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 2 achieves critical mass in CCBHC coverage, with 1,500+ clinics ensuring that most Americans are within reasonable distance of comprehensive community behavioral health services. ACT teams serve a significantly larger share of the SMI population. Primary care-behavioral health integration becomes the norm rather than the exception. Housing stability improves for individuals with SMI through structured partnerships between community mental health and housing providers. The crisis continuum operates in most communities, reducing reliance on emergency departments and law enforcement for mental health emergencies.

## Phase 3: Universal Access and Sustainability (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Achieve 2,000+ CCBHCs ensuring universal geographic access (30-minute standard)
- Expand ACT to 3,000 teams serving 300,000 individuals with serious mental illness
- Eliminate mental health Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designations
- Achieve full crisis continuum in all communities nationwide
- Eliminate chronic homelessness among individuals with serious mental illness
- Transition to value-based payment models that reward outcomes, not just service delivery

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Certify 2,000+ CCBHCs with universal geographic coverage | States/CMS | Months 60-120 | Continued enhanced FMAP; state certification | 30-minute access standard met |
| Scale ACT to 3,000 teams nationally | SAMHSA/States | Months 60-96 | $3.6 billion annually for ACT at full scale | 3,000 teams; 300,000 individuals served |
| Achieve HPSA elimination through workforce investment | HRSA/States | Months 60-120 | Sustained NHSC and training pipeline funding | Zero mental health HPSA designations |
| Complete crisis continuum in all communities | States/SAMHSA | Months 60-84 | $1.8 billion annually for crisis operations | 100% crisis continuum coverage |

| Achieve zero chronic homelessness among SMI population | HUD/SAMHSA/States | Months 60-120 | $3.7 billion annually for housing + services | HUD Point-in-Time count: zero chronic SMI homelessness |

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 3 completes the community mental health transformation that deinstitutionalization promised but never delivered. Every American lives within 30 minutes of a CCBHC or equivalent facility. Individuals with serious mental illness have access to ACT teams, crisis services, housing, and recovery supports. The workforce crisis has been resolved through sustained investment. Payment models reward outcomes, creating durable incentives for quality and innovation. The United States has, for the first time, a community mental health infrastructure commensurate with the burden of mental illness.

## Governance and Oversight

**Federal Oversight Structure**: SAMHSA serves as the lead federal agency for community mental health implementation, with CMS responsible for Medicaid CCBHC payment oversight and HRSA responsible for workforce programs. An interagency Community Mental Health Transformation Council -- including SAMHSA, CMS, HRSA, HUD, DOJ, and VA -- provides cross-system coordination and annual reporting to Congress.

**State Accountability**: States adopting the CCBHC Medicaid State Plan Amendment must submit annual quality reports based on standardized CCBHC quality measures. States that fail to meet minimum quality thresholds face corrective action plans and potential reduction in enhanced FMAP rates.

**Independent Evaluation**: The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducts biennial evaluations of community mental health transformation progress, with reports submitted to the Senate HELP Committee and House Energy & Commerce Committee.

**Public Reporting**: SAMHSA publishes an annual Community Mental Health Transformation Dashboard with state-by-state data on CCBHC coverage, treatment rates, crisis response times, and workforce metrics. All data is publicly accessible.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Insufficient State Adoption of CCBHC Model

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Enhanced FMAP rates (90/10 for years 1-3) make CCBHC adoption financially attractive. SAMHSA planning grants reduce upfront costs for states. Technical assistance addresses state capacity concerns. Bipartisan support demonstrated by existing adoption across red and blue states reduces political barriers.

**Contingency Plan**: If fewer than 40 states adopt the CCBHC SPA by Year 3, Congress considers transitioning from voluntary to mandatory CCBHC certification for all Medicaid-participating community behavioral health providers.

### Risk 2: Workforce Shortages Limit CCBHC Capacity

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Tripled NHSC slots, salary support grants, training pipeline investment, and scope-of-practice reform address the workforce shortage from multiple angles. Telehealth expansion enables providers to serve multiple sites. Peer specialist integration expands the workforce beyond traditional clinical providers.

**Contingency Plan**: If HPSA elimination targets are not on track by Year 5, implement emergency visa programs for international mental health professionals and establish fast-track training programs for behavioral health paraprofessionals.

### Risk 3: Medicaid PPS Rate Inadequacy

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Federal guidance on PPS rate-setting methodology ensures rates are based on actual service delivery costs, not discounted fee-for-service benchmarks. CMS audits state PPS rate adequacy annually. CCBHCs can appeal inadequate rates through a federal review process.

**Contingency Plan**: If more than 30% of CCBHCs report operating losses under PPS rates by Year 3, CMS issues corrective guidance and establishes a federal minimum PPS floor.

### Risk 4: Political Will Fades Between Crises

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Annual public reporting on community mental health outcomes maintains visibility. Bipartisan coalition building ensures that reform does not depend on single-party support. Criminal justice and law enforcement allies provide cross-ideological advocacy.

**Contingency Plan**: Build mandatory reporting and automatic funding adjustments into authorizing legislation to reduce dependence on annual appropriations decisions.

### Risk 5: Cross-System Savings Not Captured

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Community mental health transformation generates savings across healthcare, criminal justice, housing, and social service systems. Interagency Transformation Council tracks cross-system savings. States are required to report avoided costs in ED, jail, and homeless systems attributable to CCBHC services.

**Contingency Plan**: Establish cross-system savings recapture mechanisms that redirect a portion of avoided costs back into community mental health funding.
