# Civil Commitment and Involuntary Treatment: Solutions

Reforming the civil commitment system requires a multi-faceted approach that simultaneously expands treatment capacity, strengthens due process protections, and builds the community infrastructure necessary to reduce reliance on involuntary intervention. The guiding premise is that the system's twin failures -- coercive deprivation of liberty without adequate treatment and abandonment of severely ill individuals without access to care -- share common root causes and require integrated solutions.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- **Treatment capacity must precede or accompany expanded authority**: No expansion of commitment criteria or AOT implementation should proceed without commensurate investment in the services, beds, and workforce needed to fulfill commitment orders
- **Due process protections and treatment access are complementary, not competing**: A well-designed system provides robust legal protections while ensuring that those protections do not become barriers to timely, clinically appropriate treatment
- **Community-based treatment is the default; involuntary intervention is the last resort**: Investment in voluntary, accessible community services should reduce the population that ever reaches the point of requiring involuntary commitment
- **Racial equity and civil rights monitoring must be built into every reform**: Given documented disparities in commitment and AOT rates, every new program must include demographic data collection, independent oversight, and mechanisms to identify and correct bias
- **Outcomes, not ideology, should drive policy**: The effectiveness of commitment and AOT programs should be evaluated through rigorous, independent research, with sunset provisions and mandatory evaluation built into enabling legislation

### Theory of Change

The proposed reforms follow a sequenced logic: (1) build community treatment infrastructure so that voluntary care is genuinely available, (2) strengthen crisis response systems to divert individuals from emergency departments and jails, (3) reform AOT and commitment processes to ensure both effectiveness and rights protection, (4) close the financing gaps that have undermined every previous reform effort. As community capacity expands, the population requiring involuntary intervention should shrink. The remaining involuntary interventions should be shorter, more targeted, more rights-protective, and more clinically effective.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: National Community Mental Health Infrastructure Investment

**Description**: Establish a federal investment program to build the community mental health infrastructure that was promised but never delivered after deinstitutionalization. This includes Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs), crisis stabilization centers, assertive community treatment (ACT) teams, and supported housing. The model builds on the CCBHC demonstration project, which Congress authorized in 2014 and has expanded incrementally. Full national CCBHC implementation would establish a network of clinics required to serve all individuals regardless of ability to pay, provide 24/7 crisis services, and offer comprehensive treatment including medication management, therapy, case management, and peer support.

**Evidence Base**: The CCBHC demonstration, operating in over 500 clinics across 46 states as of 2024, has shown promising results. An evaluation by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing (2023) found that CCBHCs reduced emergency department visits by 18.5%, decreased hospitalizations by 12%, and reduced criminal justice involvement by 9% among participants. The demonstration also improved access: CCBHCs served 49% more patients than comparable non-CCBHC clinics. Internationally, Australia's Primary Health Networks and the United Kingdom's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) program demonstrate that systematic community treatment investment can reduce acute service utilization.

**Implementation**: Enact legislation making CCBHCs a permanent Medicaid benefit available to all states. Provide enhanced federal Medicaid matching rates (85% FMAP for the first five years, declining to 70% thereafter) to incentivize state participation. Require CCBHCs to provide crisis stabilization, ACT, supported employment, peer support, and medication-assisted treatment for co-occurring substance use disorders.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $5.5 billion annually in new federal spending for full CCBHC implementation (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023). Additional $2 billion annually for supported housing grants. Total: approximately $7.5 billion per year in new federal investment.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1. Initial state enrollment in Year 2. Full national implementation by Year 5.

**Challenges**: State budget constraints may limit uptake even with enhanced federal match. Workforce shortages will constrain service delivery. NIMBY opposition to facility siting.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of CCBHCs operational; patients served per clinic; ED visit rates among CCBHC service populations; hospitalization rates; criminal justice contact rates; housing stability rates.

### Solution 2: Comprehensive Crisis Response System

**Description**: Build a fully operational national crisis response system connecting the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline to mobile crisis teams, crisis stabilization units, and short-term crisis residential facilities in every community. The model follows the Crisis Now framework developed by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD): (1) regional crisis call centers with real-time bed registry, (2) mobile crisis teams that respond in person, and (3) crisis stabilization facilities (23-hour and short-term residential) that provide an alternative to emergency departments.

**Evidence Base**: The Crisis Now model, implemented in Maricopa County (Arizona), reduced psychiatric ED presentations by 38% and reduced average length of stay from 10 days (hospital) to 2.5 days (crisis facility) while achieving comparable clinical outcomes at roughly one-third the cost (RI International, 2020). Georgia's statewide crisis system reduced state hospital admissions by 20% over three years (Georgia DBHDD, 2022). Fewer than 10% of 988 calls currently result in mobile crisis team dispatch because teams are not available in most areas (SAMHSA, 2024).

**Implementation**: Require states receiving SAMHSA block grants to develop Crisis Now-compliant systems by Year 3. Provide $3 billion in federal startup grants for mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization centers. Establish Medicaid reimbursement for crisis stabilization services through Section 1115 waivers and eventual statutory coverage. Integrate 988 with local crisis systems through real-time bed registries and GPS-enabled dispatch.

**Cost/Resources**: $3 billion federal startup investment over 3 years; $1.5 billion annually in ongoing federal support. State matching requirements of 25%.

**Timeline**: 988-to-mobile-crisis linkage in Year 1-2. Crisis stabilization center network in Year 2-4. Full Crisis Now compliance in Year 5.

**Challenges**: Rural areas face particular challenges in building mobile crisis capacity. Medicaid reimbursement rates for crisis services are often inadequate. Workforce recruitment for 24/7 crisis positions is difficult.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of 988 calls connected to mobile crisis teams; average response time for mobile crisis; ED psychiatric boarding rates; involuntary hold rates; law enforcement involvement in psychiatric crises.

### Solution 3: Reform Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT)

**Description**: Establish a reformed national AOT framework that couples court-ordered treatment with mandatory service delivery obligations. The reformed AOT model includes five requirements: (1) states must appropriate funds sufficient to deliver the services ordered by courts, (2) AOT orders must specify a treatment plan developed by a qualified clinician, (3) individuals subject to AOT must receive competent legal representation, (4) courts must conduct periodic review hearings, and (5) states must collect and publish demographic, clinical, and outcome data on all AOT participants.

**Evidence Base**: New York's Kendra's Law, the most rigorously evaluated AOT program, demonstrated 77% reduction in hospitalization, 83% reduction in arrest, and 87% reduction in incarceration when backed by intensive services (Duke University/NYS OMH, 2009). The Cochrane Review (Kisely et al., 2017) finding of no significant AOT effect reflects programs that issued court orders without providing services -- confirming that the court order alone is insufficient. The critical variable is service delivery, not coercion. The RAND Corporation (2020) concluded that AOT is effective when implemented with intensive services.

**Implementation**: Enact federal legislation establishing minimum AOT standards as a condition of receiving SAMHSA block grants. States must demonstrate that treatment infrastructure exists before issuing AOT orders. Require independent legal representation for all AOT respondents. Mandate demographic data collection with annual public reporting.

**Cost/Resources**: Federal cost is primarily in conditional block grant requirements (no new appropriation required for the mandate itself). States would need to invest in service delivery; estimated $500 million-$1 billion nationally in new state spending to fully fund AOT service delivery.

**Timeline**: Federal minimum standards enacted in Year 1. State compliance plans in Year 2. Full implementation in Year 3-4.

**Challenges**: Three states (CT, MD, MA) lack AOT statutes entirely. States may resist federal conditions on block grants. Adequacy of service delivery is difficult to monitor from the federal level.

**Impact Metrics**: AOT enrollment per state; services actually delivered per AOT order; hospitalization rates among AOT participants; incarceration rates; housing stability; racial and ethnic composition of AOT participants relative to the SMI population.

### Solution 4: Repeal the Medicaid IMD Exclusion

**Description**: Repeal the Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, which prohibits federal Medicaid reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care in facilities with more than 16 beds for patients aged 21-64. This single provision has been the most powerful driver of psychiatric bed closures and state disinvestment in inpatient care. Repeal would enable federal Medicaid matching for state psychiatric hospital care, removing the financial incentive for states to minimize bed capacity.

**Evidence Base**: The IMD exclusion costs states billions in foregone federal matching funds. A 2016 Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) report recommended full repeal, estimating it would increase federal Medicaid spending by $5-10 billion annually while enabling states to expand psychiatric bed capacity. CMS has issued Section 1115 waivers allowing limited IMD stays (up to 30 days) in some states, and early evidence from California and other waiver states shows improved access to inpatient care without significant cost escalation (MACPAC, 2023).

**Implementation**: Congressional legislation amending Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act to remove the IMD exclusion. Phase in repeal over 3 years to allow states to plan capacity expansion. Condition federal reimbursement on quality standards, accreditation, and patient rights protections. Require Olmstead-compliant discharge planning for all IMD stays.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $5-10 billion annually in new federal Medicaid spending (CBO/MACPAC). However, offsetting savings from reduced ED boarding, reduced incarceration costs, and improved health outcomes could recover a significant portion.

**Timeline**: Legislative action in Year 1-2. Phased implementation over Years 3-5.

**Challenges**: Congressional Budget Office scoring will show significant new federal spending, creating opposition from fiscal hawks. Some disability rights organizations oppose repeal, fearing it will incentivize re-institutionalization. Must be paired with Olmstead protections and community investment.

**Impact Metrics**: State psychiatric bed capacity per 100,000; average wait time for state hospital admission; ED boarding rates; length of stay trends; community discharge rates.

### Solution 5: Mental Health Workforce Development

**Description**: Launch a comprehensive mental health workforce development initiative addressing the shortage of psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, social workers, and peer specialists. Key components include loan forgiveness for mental health professionals serving in shortage areas, expanded residency training positions funded through graduate medical education (GME), fast-track certification for psychiatric nurse practitioners, and professionalization of the peer support specialist workforce.

**Evidence Base**: Over 160 million Americans live in mental health professional shortage areas (HRSA, 2024). The U.S. has approximately 30,500 practicing psychiatrists (9.3 per 100,000; AAMC, 2023), with over 60% of counties having none. The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) loan repayment program has been shown to improve retention in underserved areas: 82% of NHSC scholars remain in shortage areas for at least three years after completing their service obligation (HRSA, 2022).

**Implementation**: Expand NHSC mental health slots by 10,000 positions over 5 years. Fund 1,000 new psychiatry residency positions through Medicare GME. Establish federal certification standards and reimbursement for peer support specialists. Create interstate telehealth licensure compacts for mental health professionals.

**Cost/Resources**: $2 billion annually ($1 billion for NHSC expansion; $500 million for GME positions; $300 million for peer specialist development; $200 million for telehealth infrastructure).

**Timeline**: NHSC expansion in Year 1. New residency positions filled by Year 3-4. Full workforce pipeline impact by Year 7-10.

**Challenges**: Workforce development is inherently long-term; psychiatry residency takes 4 years after medical school. Rural areas face compounding recruitment challenges. Compensation in public mental health is significantly below private practice.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of mental health professionals in shortage areas; vacancy rates in state hospitals and community mental health centers; wait times for outpatient psychiatric appointments; telehealth utilization rates.

### Solution 6: Strengthen Due Process in Commitment Proceedings

**Description**: Establish federal minimum standards for due process protections in civil commitment proceedings as a condition of receiving federal mental health funding. Key requirements include: (1) right to competent, specialized legal counsel (not general public defenders with overwhelming caseloads), (2) right to independent psychiatric evaluation, (3) clear and convincing evidence standard, (4) right to periodic review hearings at least every 90 days, (5) mandatory recording of commitment hearings, and (6) accessible appeals process.

**Evidence Base**: A 2021 study by the National Association for Rights Protection and Advocacy (NARPA) found that in many jurisdictions, court-appointed attorneys in commitment cases spend an average of 15 minutes per case, rarely call witnesses, and almost never request independent evaluations. The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law has documented that commitment hearings in some states last less than 5 minutes, with legal representation that amounts to a perfunctory presence. Studies from states that have implemented specialized mental health courts with dedicated attorneys show improved due process outcomes without reducing appropriate commitment rates (Honegger, *Law and Human Behavior*, 2015).

**Implementation**: Federal legislation conditioning SAMHSA block grants on state compliance with minimum due process standards. Establish training programs and certification for mental health law attorneys. Fund specialized mental health court divisions in states receiving federal support.

**Cost/Resources**: $200 million annually for legal representation infrastructure; $100 million for training programs and specialized courts.

**Timeline**: Federal standards enacted in Year 1. State compliance plans in Year 2. Implementation in Year 3-4.

**Challenges**: State courts may resist federal conditions on procedural practices. Public defender offices are already understaffed. Tension between strengthened due process and advocates for faster commitment processes.

**Impact Metrics**: Average duration of commitment hearings; percentage of respondents with specialized counsel; rate of independent evaluations requested and granted; appeal rates; reversal rates on appeal.

### Solution 7: Racial Equity Monitoring and Accountability

**Description**: Mandate comprehensive demographic data collection and analysis across all civil commitment and AOT programs, with independent oversight and corrective action requirements. Require states to report commitment and AOT rates disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, age, and housing status. Establish independent civil rights review commissions with authority to investigate disparities, issue recommendations, and require corrective action plans.

**Evidence Base**: Black New Yorkers are approximately 5 times more likely to be subject to AOT orders than white New Yorkers (New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, 2005). Racial disparities in involuntary commitment have been documented in multiple jurisdictions (Snowden et al., *Psychiatric Services*, 2009). Without systematic data collection, the scope and patterns of disparities remain invisible to policymakers.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation requiring demographic data reporting as a condition of federal mental health funding. Establish an Office of Mental Health Equity within SAMHSA. Create independent state-level review commissions modeled on the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) model of DOJ consent decrees.

**Cost/Resources**: $150 million annually for data infrastructure, SAMHSA equity office, and state commission support.

**Timeline**: Data reporting requirements in Year 1. Equity office established in Year 2. State commissions operational by Year 3.

**Challenges**: Data infrastructure varies greatly across states. Defining appropriate benchmarks for "equitable" commitment rates requires careful methodological work. Some stakeholders may view equity monitoring as a barrier to treatment access.

**Impact Metrics**: Completeness of demographic data reporting; ratio of commitment/AOT rates by race to SMI prevalence by race; state corrective action plans implemented; changes in disparity metrics over time.

## International Models

### United Kingdom: Community Treatment Orders (CTOs)

**Description**: The UK Mental Health Act 2007 introduced Community Treatment Orders, which allow patients discharged from involuntary hospitalization to be subject to conditions in the community, including medication compliance. CTOs are supervised by a responsible clinician and reviewed by a Mental Health Tribunal. Unlike most U.S. AOT programs, CTOs include an explicit right to advocacy support from an Independent Mental Health Advocate (IMHA).

**Results**: A randomized controlled trial (OCTET study, Burns et al., *Lancet*, 2013) found no significant difference in readmission rates between CTO and non-CTO patients. However, qualitative studies found that CTOs provided a framework for more intensive service engagement. The UK experience underscores that the court order itself is less important than the services delivered alongside it.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The UK model's mandatory advocacy support (IMHA) is directly transferable and addresses a major gap in U.S. AOT programs. The OCTET findings reinforce the need to couple AOT with intensive services.

### Australia: Mental Health Tribunals

**Description**: Australian states use independent Mental Health Tribunals rather than general courts to adjudicate involuntary treatment decisions. Tribunals include a legal member (chair), a psychiatrist, and a community member. They conduct regular reviews, provide reasons for decisions, and ensure patient representation.

**Results**: Victoria's Mental Health Tribunal reviews approximately 4,500 treatment orders annually and revokes or modifies approximately 15% of orders (Victorian Mental Health Tribunal, 2023). The tribunal model is credited with greater expertise, consistency, and efficiency compared to general court proceedings.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Specialized mental health tribunals could improve the quality and consistency of commitment decisions in U.S. jurisdictions. The multi-disciplinary panel model addresses concerns about both clinical overreach and legal formalism.

### Norway: Capacity-Based Commitment

**Description**: Norway reformed its mental health law in 2017 to introduce a capacity-based model: patients who have decision-making capacity cannot be committed involuntarily regardless of diagnosis or dangerousness. Commitment requires both a serious mental illness and a lack of capacity to consent to or refuse treatment. This approach directly addresses the anosognosia problem while protecting the autonomy of competent individuals.

**Results**: Early evidence suggests that the reform reduced involuntary admissions by approximately 10% without increasing rates of violence or self-harm (Wynn, *International Journal of Law and Psychiatry*, 2021). Critics note that capacity assessment is itself subjective and may be influenced by bias.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The capacity-based model offers a principled alternative to the dangerousness standard and could resolve some of the autonomy-vs-beneficence tension. Implementation would require standardized capacity assessment tools and training.

## Complementary Policies

Effective civil commitment reform depends on progress in several related policy areas:

- **Affordable housing**: Without housing, community-based treatment cannot succeed. Expanding Section 811 supportive housing and Housing First programs is essential.
- **Criminal justice diversion**: Pre-arrest and pre-booking diversion programs, mental health courts, and jail-based treatment must be expanded to reduce transinstitutionalization.
- **Mental health parity enforcement**: Strengthening enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act is necessary to ensure private insurance covers community mental health services adequately.
- **Substance use disorder treatment**: Co-occurring SMI and substance use disorder affects the majority of individuals subject to civil commitment. Integrated treatment models must be available.
- **Social Security and disability benefits**: Streamlining SSI/SSDI disability determination for individuals with SMI ensures income support during treatment and recovery.
