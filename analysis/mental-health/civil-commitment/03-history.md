# Civil Commitment and Involuntary Treatment: History

## Historical Development

The history of civil commitment in America is a story of dramatic swings between two failures: the abuse of unrestrained institutional power and the neglect that follows when that power is curtailed without building alternatives. Understanding this history is essential to designing a system that avoids both extremes.

### The Asylum Era (1750s-1945): Institutional Confinement with Minimal Oversight

- **Colonial and Early Republic period**: Mental illness was primarily a family and community responsibility. Those deemed "lunatics" were confined in almshouses, jails, or private homes. No formal commitment process existed; local officials or family members could arrange confinement with little legal process.
- **Dorothea Dix and the Asylum Movement (1840s-1870s)**: Reformer Dorothea Dix campaigned for the construction of state-funded mental hospitals. Between 1843 and 1880, over 30 state hospitals were established. The theory was "moral treatment" -- humane institutional care would cure mental illness. Commitment required only a physician's certificate or a family petition in most states.
- **Growth of State Hospital System (1880-1945)**: State hospitals expanded dramatically. By 1900, over 150,000 patients were confined in state institutions. The original therapeutic optimism gave way to custodial warehousing as patient populations grew far beyond capacity. Abuse, neglect, and involuntary sterilization became widespread. Legal oversight was minimal; commitment hearings, where they existed, were perfunctory proceedings lasting minutes.
- **Legal Framework**: Most states permitted commitment based on a physician's certification that a person was "insane" or "in need of care and treatment." No meaningful adversarial process existed. Patients had no right to counsel, no right to hearing, and no mechanism for judicial review.

### Peak Institutionalization and Early Reform (1945-1965): The Seeds of Change

- **Post-World War II exposés**: Journalists and conscientious objectors who had served as attendants during the war published devastating accounts of conditions in state hospitals. Albert Deutsch's *The Shame of the States* (1948) documented filth, overcrowding, and brutality. Life magazine published a photo essay titled "Bedlam 1946" showing patients at Byberry State Hospital in Pennsylvania living in conditions comparable to concentration camps.
- **Peak institutionalization (1955)**: The state hospital census reached its all-time peak of 558,922 patients (National Institute of Mental Health, 1965). This represented approximately 340 patients per 100,000 population.
- **Introduction of antipsychotic medication (1954)**: The FDA approved chlorpromazine (Thorazine), the first antipsychotic medication, fundamentally changing the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. For the first time, many patients could be stabilized enough for community living.
- **Community Mental Health Act (1963)**: President John F. Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act, envisioning a network of 2,000 community mental health centers to replace state hospitals. Congress authorized funding for construction but never fully funded the services. Only 789 centers were built (GAO, 1977).

### Deinstitutionalization and the Due Process Revolution (1965-1985): Rights Without Resources

- **Rapid depopulation of state hospitals**: State hospital populations fell from 558,922 in 1955 to 132,164 by 1980 -- a 76% decline (NIMH). Patients were discharged to communities that lacked the promised mental health infrastructure.
- **Medicaid and the "IMD Exclusion" (1965)**: The creation of Medicaid included the "Institutions for Mental Diseases" (IMD) exclusion, which prohibited federal Medicaid payment for care in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds for patients aged 21-64. This created a powerful financial incentive for states to close large hospitals and shift costs to the federal government by moving patients to nursing homes, boarding houses, and community settings.
- **Landmark legal decisions**:
    - *Lessard v. Schmidt*, 349 F. Supp. 1078 (E.D. Wis. 1972): Federal court struck down Wisconsin's commitment law, holding that civil commitment required due process protections analogous to criminal proceedings, including right to counsel, right to remain silent, and a "beyond reasonable doubt" standard of proof.
    - *O'Connor v. Donaldson*, 422 U.S. 563 (1975): The Supreme Court held that a state cannot constitutionally confine a nondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends. Kenneth Donaldson had been confined for 15 years despite posing no danger.
    - *Addington v. Texas*, 441 U.S. 418 (1979): The Supreme Court established that the standard of proof for civil commitment must be at least "clear and convincing evidence," higher than the civil "preponderance" standard but lower than the criminal "beyond reasonable doubt" standard.
    - *Youngberg v. Romeo*, 457 U.S. 307 (1982): The Court held that involuntarily committed persons have constitutionally protected liberty interests in safety, freedom from undue restraint, and minimally adequate training.
- **State law reforms**: Following these decisions, virtually every state rewrote its commitment statute between 1970 and 1985, narrowing criteria from "need for treatment" to "dangerousness" and adding procedural protections.

### The Consequences of Deinstitutionalization (1985-1999): Crisis Without Solutions

- **Emergence of mass homelessness (1980s)**: The intersection of deinstitutionalization, tightened commitment laws, loss of affordable housing, and inadequate community services contributed to a dramatic increase in visible homelessness. Studies in the late 1980s found that 25-50% of homeless individuals had serious mental illness (Torrey, 1988).
- **Transinstitutionalization to jails and prisons**: As state hospital beds disappeared, jails and prisons became the largest providers of mental health care. By 1992, the Los Angeles County Jail, Cook County Jail (Chicago), and Rikers Island (New York) were the three largest psychiatric facilities in the country (Torrey et al., 1992).
- **"Dying with their rights on"**: Critics of the due process revolution argued that tightened commitment standards left severely ill individuals to deteriorate on the streets, cycle through emergency rooms, or die of exposure and self-neglect. The phrase "dying with their rights on," attributed to psychiatrist Darold Treffert, captured the argument that legal protections had become obstacles to treatment.
- **Family advocacy movement**: Organizations like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI, founded 1979) gave voice to families frustrated by their inability to obtain treatment for severely ill relatives under the new legal regime. Families became powerful advocates for broader commitment standards and outpatient commitment.
- **Early AOT statutes**: North Carolina enacted the first outpatient commitment statute in 1983. By the mid-1990s, approximately 40 states had some form of outpatient commitment authority, though most were rarely used.

### The AOT Era and Olmstead (1999-2015): New Tools, Old Debates

- **Kendra's Law (New York, 1999)**: Following the subway pushing death of Kendra Webdale by Andrew Goldstein, a man with untreated schizophrenia, New York enacted Kendra's Law (N.Y. Mental Hygiene Law 9.60), creating a robust AOT program. The law became a national model, requiring a petition-based court process with specific eligibility criteria tied to treatment history and risk of deterioration.
- **Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999)**: The Supreme Court held that the unjustified institutionalization of persons with disabilities, including mental illness, constitutes discrimination under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. States were required to provide community-based services when treatment professionals determine that community placement is appropriate, the affected person does not oppose such placement, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated.
- **Laura's Law (California, 2002)**: California enacted its own AOT statute, but made implementation optional for counties. Uptake was extremely slow; fewer than 10 counties implemented the law in its first decade.
- **Virginia Tech shooting (2007)**: The mass shooting by Seung-Hui Cho, who had previously been found to be a danger to himself by a commitment hearing but was not hospitalized, exposed gaps in the commitment system and background check reporting. Virginia reformed its commitment laws and all states were required to improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).
- **Continued growth of forensic populations**: The number of individuals found incompetent to stand trial and referred for restoration grew steadily, creating massive backlogs in forensic state hospitals.

### Current Era (2015-Present): Renewed Urgency and Unresolved Tensions

- **COVID-19 pandemic**: The pandemic intensified mental health crises, increased emergency department psychiatric presentations, and further strained an already inadequate system. ED psychiatric visits rose 24% between 2019 and 2022 (CDC, 2023).
- **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (2022)**: The launch of the 988 number created an alternative to 911 for mental health crises, processing over 7.5 million contacts in its first 18 months (SAMHSA, 2024). However, the system's connection to mobile crisis teams and treatment resources remains uneven.
- **California SB 43 (2023)**: California expanded its definition of "gravely disabled" to include individuals with severe substance use disorders who cannot provide for personal safety, the most significant broadening of commitment criteria in a major state in decades.
- **New York City CARE initiative (2022)**: Mayor Eric Adams directed first responders to involuntarily transport individuals who appeared to pose a danger to themselves, even if they were not imminently suicidal, expanding street-level commitment practice and sparking national debate.
- **Ongoing debate**: The fundamental questions of the 1970s -- when should the state intervene, what process is due, and who decides -- remain unresolved, even as the human cost of the treatment gap becomes increasingly difficult to ignore.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Pendulum Swings Between Coercion and Neglect

The history of civil commitment reveals a recurring pattern: periods of excessive institutionalization provoke reform movements that restrict commitment authority, which then leads to periods of neglect that eventually provoke calls for expanded commitment. Neither extreme has served people with serious mental illness well. The challenge is finding a stable middle ground with adequate resources to support it.

### Pattern 2: Legal Reform Without Resource Investment Produces Worse Outcomes

Every major legal reform in civil commitment history -- deinstitutionalization, the due process revolution, *Olmstead* -- has been undermined by the failure to fund the community services needed to make the new legal framework work. Changing legal standards without changing resource allocation simply shifts where people with mental illness suffer: from overcrowded hospitals to overcrowded jails, emergency departments, and streets.

### Pattern 3: Tragedy as Catalyst

Major policy changes in civil commitment have almost always been triggered by high-profile tragedies -- the death of Kendra Webdale, the Virginia Tech shooting, individual cases of neglect or abuse. This reactive pattern produces legislation shaped by emotional response rather than systematic analysis, and the resulting laws often address the specific failure mode of the precipitating event rather than the systemic problems underlying it.

### Pattern 4: The Gap Between Law on the Books and Law in Action

Throughout the history of civil commitment, formal legal standards have diverged significantly from actual practice. Before the 1970s, broad commitment authority was exercised without regard for statutory procedures. After the due process revolution, narrowed standards were sometimes circumvented by clinical and law enforcement practices that did not match the law's intent. AOT statutes exist in 47 states but are actively implemented in only about 30. The gap between authorization and implementation is a persistent feature of this policy area.
