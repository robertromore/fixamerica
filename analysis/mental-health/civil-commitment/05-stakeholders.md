# Civil Commitment and Involuntary Treatment: Stakeholders

The civil commitment system is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with distinct interests, authority, and resources. The fundamental challenge is that those most directly affected -- individuals with serious mental illness -- often have the least political power, while those with the most influence over the system -- legislators, insurers, and organized interest groups -- face incentives that do not align with optimal patient outcomes.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) | Directly subject to commitment proceedings; may lose liberty, be forced to take medication, experience lasting stigma | 14.1 million adults with SMI (SAMHSA, 2023) | Autonomy, access to voluntary treatment, dignity, recovery, housing, employment |
| Individuals subject to involuntary holds | Experience emergency detention, potential long-term commitment, loss of rights | ~1 million annual involuntary holds (SAMHSA, 2022) | Due process, humane conditions, least restrictive treatment, right to counsel |
| Family members and caregivers | Bear emotional, financial, and practical burden of caring for relatives with SMI; often unable to obtain treatment for loved ones | ~8.4 million family caregivers of adults with SMI (NAMI, 2023) | Access to treatment for relatives, information sharing, respite, safety |
| People experiencing homelessness with SMI | Disproportionately subject to commitment and law enforcement contact; lack stable housing needed for community treatment | ~250,000 (30-40% of chronically homeless; SAMHSA, 2023) | Housing, voluntary treatment access, protection from arbitrary detention |
| Incarcerated individuals with mental illness | Receive inadequate treatment in custody; face longer sentences and harsher conditions | ~550,000 in jails (44% of jail population; BJS, 2021) | Treatment, diversion from incarceration, reentry support |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Victims of violence by untreated individuals with SMI**: Although rare (3-5% of all violence; APA, 2023), incidents involving individuals with untreated SMI receive outsized media coverage and drive legislative change. Victims and their families advocate for broader commitment authority.
- **Emergency department staff**: Psychiatric boarding consumes ED resources and staff time. Nurses and physicians face burnout from managing psychiatric crises in environments not designed for mental health care.
- **General public in communities with high homelessness**: Residents in cities with large visible homeless populations experience both compassion fatigue and safety concerns, driving political pressure for expanded commitment.
- **Taxpayers**: Bear the cost of emergency services, incarceration, and acute care that results from the failure to provide less expensive community-based treatment.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| State legislatures | Set commitment standards, funding levels, and AOT statutes | Plenary authority over state mental health law | Vary by state; control state hospital funding | High |
| State mental health agencies | Administer state hospitals, community programs, and AOT implementation | Regulatory authority; allocate state mental health funds | SAMHSA block grants + state appropriations | High |
| Judges and hearing officers | Preside over commitment hearings; issue commitment and AOT orders | Judicial authority to deprive liberty; interpret statutes | Limited; depend on clinical testimony and available services | High |
| Governors | Appoint mental health agency heads; propose budgets; sign legislation | Executive authority; bully pulpit | State budget proposals | High |
| U.S. Congress | Sets Medicaid policy (including IMD exclusion), SAMHSA funding, ADA enforcement | Federal legislation and appropriations | Control of federal mental health spending | High |
| CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) | Administers Medicaid, including IMD exclusion waivers | Regulatory authority over federal healthcare spending | Medicaid budget ($800+ billion total, 2024) | High |
| SAMHSA | Administers federal mental health programs and block grants | Program authority; data collection | $7.5 billion budget (FY2024) | Medium |
| Law enforcement | Initiates majority of involuntary holds; first responder for mental health crises | Authority to detain for emergency evaluation | Police budgets vary widely | Medium |
| Psychiatrists and clinical staff | Conduct evaluations, provide testimony, administer treatment | Clinical authority; expert testimony | Limited independent resources | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC)**: The leading national advocacy organization for expanding access to treatment for individuals with serious mental illness. TAC supports broader commitment standards, robust AOT implementation, and increased psychiatric bed capacity. Publishes influential reports and model legislation.
- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: The largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization in the U.S., with over 600 state and local affiliates. NAMI supports AOT when implemented with adequate services and due process. Represents primarily family members and individuals with lived experience.
- **Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law**: The leading legal advocacy organization for the rights of people with mental disabilities. Opposes expanded commitment authority and advocates for voluntary, community-based services. Named for Judge David Bazelon, a pioneer in mental health law.
- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: The professional association of psychiatrists. Supports evidence-based commitment standards and adequate resources for treatment. Generally cautious about both overly broad and overly narrow commitment criteria.
- **American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)**: Opposes expansion of involuntary commitment on civil liberties grounds. Files litigation challenging commitment conditions, forced medication, and inadequate due process.
- **National Disability Rights Network (NDRN)**: Coordinates the federally funded protection and advocacy (P&A) system in each state. P&A agencies represent individuals in commitment proceedings and monitor conditions in institutions.

### Influencers

- **Media organizations**: Coverage of individual tragedies involving untreated mental illness shapes public opinion and legislative action. High-profile cases (subway pushing incidents, mass shootings) generate pressure for expanded commitment.
- **Academic researchers**: Mental health law scholars and clinical researchers produce the evidence base that informs policy. Key centers include the MacArthur Research Network on Mental Health and the Law, Bazelon Center, and university-based psychiatric research programs.
- **Legal aid organizations**: Represent individuals in commitment proceedings. In states where public defenders handle commitment cases, caseload pressures often result in minimal representation.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAMI + TAC + APA | Increased funding for community mental health services | Strong |
| NAMI + TAC + law enforcement associations | Expansion of crisis intervention teams and 988 crisis system | Strong |
| Bazelon Center + ACLU + NDRN + disability rights organizations | Strong due process protections in commitment proceedings | Strong |
| All stakeholders (rare consensus) | Ending psychiatric boarding in emergency departments | Moderate |
| NAMI + Bazelon Center (limited overlap) | Increased funding for voluntary treatment and supported housing | Moderate |
| TAC + some law enforcement + prosecutors | Expansion of AOT programs | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Autonomy vs. treatment access**: The Bazelon Center and ACLU prioritize individual autonomy and oppose expanded commitment, while NAMI, TAC, and many families argue that severe mental illness can impair the very capacity needed to make treatment decisions, and that refusing to treat is not respecting autonomy but abandoning people to suffering.
- **Legal protections vs. clinical judgment**: Defense attorneys and disability rights organizations advocate for robust adversarial proceedings with strict evidentiary standards, while psychiatrists and family advocates argue that legalistic processes delay treatment and produce outcomes driven by procedural technicalities rather than clinical need.
- **State budgets vs. treatment adequacy**: State budget offices seek to contain mental health spending, while providers and advocates push for increased investment. The IMD exclusion amplifies this tension by making inpatient psychiatric care disproportionately expensive for states.
- **Local vs. state responsibility**: Counties often bear the immediate costs of psychiatric crisis response (ED boarding, jail housing) while states control commitment law and hospital funding, creating cost-shifting dynamics.

### The Iron Triangle of Inaction

A stable pattern of interests perpetuates the status quo:

1. **State legislatures** avoid funding community mental health at adequate levels because the cost is high and the constituency is politically weak
2. **Insurance companies** resist full mental health parity enforcement because it increases costs
3. **The federal government** maintains the IMD exclusion because repealing it would increase federal Medicaid spending by an estimated $5-10 billion annually (CBO estimate)

These three actors share an interest in limiting spending, and the result is a system where commitment authority exists on paper but treatment resources do not exist in practice.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on civil commitment policy:

- **Lobbying**: TAC, NAMI, APA, and the insurance industry all maintain active lobbying operations at state and federal levels. The insurance industry spends over $150 million annually on federal lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023), dwarfing the combined spending of mental health advocacy organizations.
- **Litigation**: The ACLU, Bazelon Center, and NDRN/P&A agencies use strategic litigation to challenge commitment conditions, forced medication, and inadequate due process. Landmark cases (*O'Connor*, *Olmstead*, *Addington*) were driven by litigation advocacy.
- **Campaign Contributions**: Mental health advocacy organizations contribute minimal campaign funds compared to the healthcare industry. Mental health policy changes are more often driven by public opinion in the wake of tragedies than by campaign contributions.
- **Public Advocacy**: NAMI's grassroots network of over 600 affiliates provides a powerful voice in state legislatures. Media campaigns by TAC and NAMI have shifted public opinion toward supporting expanded treatment access. The Bazelon Center and ACLU use media to highlight civil liberties concerns.
- **Expertise and Data**: Academic researchers and organizations like TAC produce data (bed counts, commitment rates, outcomes research) that frame policy debates. The Cochrane Review and RAND studies on AOT effectiveness are frequently cited by both sides.
- **Tragedy-driven advocacy**: Families of individuals harmed by untreated mental illness (Kendra Webdale's family, families of mass shooting victims) become powerful advocates for specific legislative changes. This mechanism is politically effective but produces reactive rather than systemic reform.
