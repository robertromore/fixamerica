# Civil Commitment and Involuntary Treatment: What You Can Do

Civil commitment policy affects millions of Americans -- people with serious mental illness, their families, emergency responders, and entire communities -- yet it receives far less public attention and citizen engagement than its impact warrants. The treatment gap that drives the civil commitment crisis is fundamentally a political choice: the community mental health infrastructure that was promised during deinstitutionalization was never funded because there was insufficient public demand. Changing this requires sustained, informed citizen engagement at the federal, state, and local levels.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the Treatment Advocacy Center's "Grading the States" report to understand your state's commitment laws, bed capacity, and AOT implementation: <https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/grading-the-states>
- Subscribe to NAMI's policy newsletter for updates on federal and state mental health legislation: <https://www.nami.org/advocacy>
- Follow the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline performance data to track crisis system development in your area: <https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/988/performance-metrics>
- Read "I Am Not Sick, I Don't Need Help!" by Xavier Amador for an accessible introduction to anosognosia and its implications for treatment and civil commitment
- Review your state's specific commitment statute and AOT law through your state legislature's website or the Treatment Advocacy Center's state-by-state database

### Make Personal Changes

- Save the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline number in your phone and share it with family and friends as the first call for a mental health emergency, rather than 911
- If you have a family member with serious mental illness, develop a crisis plan that identifies preferred treatment providers, medication information, and advance directive preferences before a crisis occurs
- Complete a Mental Health First Aid training course to learn how to recognize and respond to mental health crises in your community: <https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org>
- If you or a family member has experienced the civil commitment system, consider sharing your story with advocacy organizations or legislative committees -- lived experience is the most powerful tool for changing policy

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call your state legislators about specific mental health funding bills, commitment law reform, and AOT implementation. State-level action is where most civil commitment reform occurs.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When your state mental health agency proposes regulatory changes to commitment procedures, submit public comments. These comment periods are often poorly publicized and receive minimal input.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: After media coverage of incidents involving untreated mental illness, write letters that reframe the issue from individual tragedy to systemic treatment failure. Emphasize funding and infrastructure, not just legal standards.
- **Share Information**: Use social media to share data on the treatment gap, the psychiatric bed shortage, and the 988 crisis system. Use the hashtags #MentalHealthReform and #TreatmentNotTrauma to connect with the broader advocacy community.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Attend your county mental health board meetings. These boards often control local funding for crisis services, AOT implementation, and community treatment programs. Public attendance and testimony can influence funding priorities.
- Form a local mental health advocacy group that brings together family members, people with lived experience, providers, and community members to advocate for specific improvements in your local crisis response and treatment system.
- Partner with your local NAMI affiliate to organize community forums on civil commitment, AOT, and the treatment gap. Invite state legislators, local mental health officials, and people with lived experience to participate.
- Work with your local police department to advocate for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training for all officers and the development of co-responder models that pair mental health clinicians with law enforcement on mental health calls.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect family advocacy organizations (NAMI affiliates) with disability rights organizations to identify shared priorities. Both constituencies support increased funding for community mental health services, even when they disagree on commitment policy.
- Engage homeless service providers, emergency department staff, and jail officials in advocacy for community mental health investment. These groups experience the consequences of the treatment gap daily and can be powerful voices for reform.
- Reach out to faith communities, which are often the first point of contact for families dealing with mental illness. Many congregations are open to mental health education and advocacy partnerships.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During your state's budget process, when mental health funding levels are set
- When commitment law reform bills are introduced in your state legislature
- When AOT implementation bills are pending
- When Congress considers Medicaid policy changes, including the IMD exclusion
- When SAMHSA reauthorization and block grant funding levels are debated
- After high-profile incidents involving untreated mental illness, to advocate for systemic reform rather than reactive legislation

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Invest in Community Mental Health to Fix Our Civil Commitment System

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City/District] about the crisis in our mental health system. Our state has only [X] psychiatric beds per 100,000 residents -- far below the expert-recommended minimum of 50 per 100,000. Over [X] of our counties have no practicing psychiatrist. As a result, people with serious mental illness cycle through emergency departments, jails, and homelessness because they cannot access the community treatment they need.

I urge you to support [specific bill/funding request]. Research consistently shows that investing in community mental health services -- including crisis stabilization centers, assisted outpatient treatment backed by real services, and supported housing -- reduces emergency department use, incarceration, and homelessness while respecting individual rights and improving outcomes.

[OPTIONAL PERSONAL PARAGRAPH: As a family member of someone with serious mental illness / as a mental health professional / as a community member who has witnessed this crisis, I have seen firsthand how the lack of treatment infrastructure harms people and communities.]

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling about mental health funding and civil commitment reform. I'd like [Representative/Senator] to support [specific bill or funding increase] to expand community mental health services and ensure that people with serious mental illness can access treatment before they reach crisis. Our state has only [X] psychiatric beds per 100,000 people. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current and proposed legislation to support:

- **CCBHC Permanent Authorization**: Bills to make Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics a permanent Medicaid benefit would expand access to comprehensive community treatment. Contact your members of Congress to support full CCBHC authorization.
- **988 Funding**: The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline needs sustained federal funding for mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization centers. Support appropriations for the 988 crisis system.
- **IMD Exclusion Repeal**: Bipartisan bills to repeal or modify the Medicaid IMD exclusion have been introduced in multiple Congresses. Contact your senators and representative to support repeal.
- **State AOT Implementation**: If your state has an AOT statute but has not adequately implemented it, advocate for state appropriations to fund the services needed to fulfill AOT orders. If your state is among the three without AOT (CT, MD, MA), advocate for adoption.
- **Mental Health Workforce Bills**: Support legislation expanding the National Health Service Corps, funding new psychiatry residency positions, and establishing peer specialist certification.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What specific steps will you take to expand community mental health services so that people with serious mental illness can access treatment before they reach crisis?"
2. "Do you support expanding assisted outpatient treatment, and if so, will you also fund the community services needed to make AOT orders meaningful?"
3. "What is your plan to address the psychiatric bed shortage in our state? Will you support repealing or modifying the Medicaid IMD exclusion?"
4. "How will you ensure that civil commitment reforms include protections against racial disparities and due process violations?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who address mental health as a systems issue, not just through the lens of individual tragedies or law enforcement
- Key committees: State health and human services committees; Congressional Energy and Commerce, Finance, and Judiciary committees
- Check whether candidates have specific mental health policy platforms or merely generic statements of concern

## Professional Actions

- **For Mental Health Clinicians**: Advocate within your professional organizations (APA, NASW, ANA) for stronger policy positions on community treatment funding and workforce development. Serve on state mental health planning councils. Volunteer for Crisis Intervention Team training for law enforcement. Participate in AOT clinical teams.
- **For Attorneys**: Volunteer as court-appointed counsel in commitment cases. Many jurisdictions lack specialized mental health law attorneys, and pro bono representation can improve due process outcomes. Join the Mental Health Law Section of the American Bar Association.
- **For Law Enforcement Officers**: Advocate for CIT training in your department. Support co-responder models that pair clinicians with officers on mental health calls. Share data on mental health-related calls to support the case for dedicated crisis response resources.
- **For Emergency Department Staff**: Document and report psychiatric boarding data. Advocate within your hospital system for psychiatric emergency service capacity. Support 988 and crisis stabilization alternatives to ED-based crisis care.
- **For Educators**: Incorporate mental health literacy into school curricula. Train teachers and school counselors to recognize early signs of serious mental illness. Support school-based mental health services that connect students to treatment before crises develop.
- **For Journalists**: Cover civil commitment as a systemic policy issue, not just individual tragedies. Use data from SAMHSA, Treatment Advocacy Center, and BJS to contextualize incidents. Interview people with lived experience and family members alongside officials and advocates.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing civil commitment reform with others, emphasize:

1. **The treatment gap is the root problem**: 3.9 million Americans with serious mental illness are not receiving treatment (SAMHSA, 2023). The civil commitment crisis is fundamentally a treatment access crisis, not a legal standards problem.
2. **Community investment saves money**: Treatment costs a fraction of incarceration. The average daily cost of community mental health treatment is approximately $35-50, compared to $100 for jail and $500-1,000 for state psychiatric hospitalization (Vera Institute, 2023; NASMHPD, 2023).
3. **AOT works when backed by services**: New York's Kendra's Law reduced hospitalization by 77% and incarceration by 87% -- but only because it was paired with intensive community services (Duke University/NYS OMH, 2009). Court orders without treatment infrastructure are meaningless.
4. **Both rights and treatment matter**: The debate should not be "more commitment" vs. "more rights." The answer is both: strengthen due process protections while simultaneously building the treatment infrastructure that makes involuntary intervention a genuine last resort.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "People with mental illness are violent" | Only 3-5% of violence is attributable to serious mental illness; people with SMI are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators | American Psychiatric Association, 2023 |
| "Commitment is the only way to get treatment to people who need it" | The vast majority of individuals with untreated SMI cannot access voluntary treatment because it is unavailable, unaffordable, or inaccessible -- not because they refuse it | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| "Deinstitutionalization caused homelessness" | Deinstitutionalization without community investment caused the problem. Countries that built community infrastructure during deinstitutionalization did not experience the same crisis. | Grob, 1994; OECD, 2023 |
| "AOT doesn't work" | The Cochrane Review found that AOT without services doesn't work. Kendra's Law, with services, showed dramatic reductions in hospitalization, arrest, and incarceration. | Cochrane, 2017; Duke/NYS OMH, 2009 |
| "Civil commitment is needed more now because mental illness is increasing" | The prevalence of serious mental illness has remained relatively stable. What has increased is the gap between need and available treatment. | NIMH, 2023 |
