# Civil Commitment and Involuntary Treatment: Legislation

## Overview

Legislative reform of civil commitment requires action at both the federal and state levels. Federal legislation is needed to reform Medicaid financing (the IMD exclusion), establish minimum standards for due process and AOT implementation, and fund the community treatment infrastructure that underpins any meaningful reform. State legislation is needed to update commitment standards, strengthen procedural protections, and implement AOT programs with adequate service delivery. The legislative approach is incremental and comprehensive: it pairs expanded treatment authority with mandatory service delivery, strengthened rights protections, and equity monitoring.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for civil commitment reform.* The Supreme Court has consistently held that civil commitment is constitutionally permissible with adequate procedural protections (*O'Connor v. Donaldson*, 1975; *Addington v. Texas*, 1979; *Youngberg v. Romeo*, 1982). The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the ADA's *Olmstead* mandate provide the constitutional framework. Reform is achievable through federal and state statutory action.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To reform the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases exclusion, establish
minimum standards for civil commitment and assisted outpatient treatment,
expand community mental health infrastructure, and promote equity in
involuntary mental health treatment.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Community Mental Health Treatment Access
and Civil Commitment Reform Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Approximately 14.1 million adults in the United States have a
serious mental illness, and 3.9 million of those adults are not
receiving treatment (SAMHSA National Survey on Drug Use and Health,
2023).

(2) The United States has only 11.7 state psychiatric hospital beds
per 100,000 population, far below the expert-recommended minimum of
50 per 100,000 (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023).

(3) Approximately 44 percent of individuals in local jails and 37
percent in state prisons have a diagnosed mental health condition
(Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2021).

(4) Approximately 1 million involuntary psychiatric holds are
initiated annually in the United States, yet the community treatment
infrastructure necessary to support individuals discharged from
involuntary holds is severely inadequate (SAMHSA, 2022).

(5) The Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion,
enacted in 1965, has been the primary driver of state disinvestment
in psychiatric inpatient capacity by prohibiting federal Medicaid
reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care in facilities with more
than 16 beds for patients aged 21 to 64.

(6) Forty-seven States and the District of Columbia have enacted
assisted outpatient treatment statutes, but implementation varies
widely and many States issue court orders without funding the
community services necessary to fulfill those orders (Treatment
Advocacy Center, 2024).

(7) Racial disparities in involuntary commitment and assisted
outpatient treatment are well documented, with Black Americans
disproportionately represented in involuntary treatment programs
(Snowden et al., Psychiatric Services, 2009).

(8) The Supreme Court held in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581
(1999), that unjustified institutionalization of persons with mental
disabilities constitutes discrimination under the Americans with
Disabilities Act.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT.--The term "assisted outpatient
treatment" means court-ordered outpatient mental health treatment for
an individual who meets State-defined criteria related to serious
mental illness, treatment history, and risk of deterioration.

(2) CCBHC.--The term "CCBHC" means a Certified Community Behavioral
Health Clinic as established under section 223 of Public Law 113-93.

(3) CIVIL COMMITMENT.--The term "civil commitment" means the
involuntary confinement of an individual in a psychiatric facility or
the involuntary imposition of outpatient treatment by order of a
court or administrative body.

(4) IMD.--The term "IMD" means an institution for mental diseases
as defined in section 1905(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
1396d(i)).

means a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder of
sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria within the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders that results
in serious functional impairment.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the Congressional factual record for the legislation, using current data on the treatment gap, bed shortage, incarceration, and disparities. Findings are essential for surviving constitutional challenge.
- **Section 4 (IMD Repeal)**: Phases in repeal over 3 years to allow states to plan capacity expansion. Conditions federal funding on accreditation, Olmstead compliance, data reporting, and patient rights -- preventing a return to warehousing.
- **Section 5 (AOT Standards)**: Addresses the core problem identified in the research: AOT works when backed by services but fails when court orders are issued without funded treatment. Requires service delivery certification before orders can be issued.
- **Section 6 (Due Process)**: Establishes minimum protections that many states currently lack, including specialized counsel, independent evaluation, and hearing recording. Does not impose a single commitment standard but ensures procedural fairness.
- **Section 7 (Infrastructure)**: Makes CCBHCs permanent and funds the crisis system buildout needed to reduce reliance on involuntary commitment.
- **Section 8 (Equity)**: Creates the monitoring and accountability mechanisms needed to identify and address racial disparities.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 180 days after enactment | -- |
| SAMHSA publishes AOT minimum standards guidance | 1 year after enactment | SAMHSA |
| CMS publishes IMD repeal regulations (Phase 1) | 1 year after enactment | CMS |
| States submit compliance plans for AOT and due process standards | 18 months after enactment | State mental health agencies |
| Office of Mental Health Equity operational | 1 year after enactment | SAMHSA |
| First annual report to Congress | 2 years after enactment | SAMHSA |
| IMD exclusion fully repealed | 3 years after enactment | CMS |
| State equity commissions operational | 2 years after enactment | States |

**Regulatory Authority**: HHS/SAMHSA has primary regulatory authority for AOT standards, due process standards, data reporting, and equity monitoring. CMS has authority for Medicaid IMD exclusion implementation and CCBHC reimbursement. HRSA implements workforce provisions.

**Challenges**:

- **CBO scoring**: The IMD exclusion repeal and CCBHC expansion will score as significant new federal spending ($5-10 billion annually for IMD repeal alone), creating opposition from fiscal hawks.
- **State resistance**: Some states may resist federal conditions on block grants as an encroachment on state sovereignty over health law.
- **Workforce constraints**: Even with funding, building the workforce to deliver services will take years.

**Refinements**:

- **Waivers for innovation**: Include a provision allowing states to apply for waivers from specific requirements if they can demonstrate equivalent or better outcomes through alternative approaches.
- **Incentive bonuses**: Provide additional federal funding to states that achieve specific outcome targets (e.g., ED boarding reduction, commitment rate reduction).

## State Model Legislation

### Model Civil Commitment and Treatment Access Reform Act

**Purpose**: Provide a model state statute that reforms civil commitment by expanding the "gravely disabled" standard, establishing service-linked AOT, strengthening due process protections, and creating independent oversight.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize based on existing commitment law, bed capacity, AOT program maturity, and available workforce. States with no current AOT statute (CT, MD, MA) should adopt the full AOT framework. States with existing AOT should amend to incorporate service delivery certification and equity monitoring.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Civil Commitment
and Treatment Access Reform Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(1) [State] has [X] psychiatric hospital beds per 100,000 residents, and
[Y] percent of counties have no practicing psychiatrist.

(2) Approximately [Z] involuntary psychiatric holds are initiated annually
in [State], yet community treatment infrastructure is inadequate to
provide follow-up care.

(3) A comprehensive approach is needed that expands treatment access while
protecting individual rights and monitoring equity.

SECTION 3. EXPANDED COMMITMENT STANDARD.

(a) The [State commitment statute] is amended to include the following
criterion for civil commitment:

"An individual may be subject to involuntary examination and treatment if,
as a result of a serious mental illness, the individual is unable to make
a rational and informed decision regarding the need for treatment and,
without treatment, is likely to suffer substantial deterioration in the
individual's ability to function independently."

(b) This criterion shall be applied in addition to, and not in
replacement of, existing dangerousness and grave disability criteria.

SECTION 4. ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT.

(a) A court may order assisted outpatient treatment for an individual who
meets the following criteria:
    (1) The individual is 18 years of age or older;
    (2) The individual has a serious mental illness;
    (3) The individual has a history of treatment noncompliance that has
    resulted in at least two hospitalizations or one act, attempt, or
    threat of serious violence within the preceding 36 months;
    (4) The individual is unlikely to participate voluntarily in treatment;
    (5) The individual is in need of treatment to prevent deterioration;
    and
    (6) The treatment ordered is the least restrictive appropriate
    alternative.

(b) SERVICE DELIVERY CERTIFICATION.--No AOT order shall be issued unless
the court has received certification from the [State mental health
authority] that the services specified in the proposed treatment plan are
available and funded for the duration of the order.

(c) TREATMENT PLAN.--Each AOT order shall specify a treatment plan
developed by a qualified mental health professional, including medication,
therapy, case management, and any other services deemed clinically
appropriate.

(d) DURATION AND REVIEW.--
    (1) Initial AOT orders shall not exceed 6 months.
    (2) The court shall conduct a review hearing at least every 90 days.
    (3) Renewal orders may be issued upon a showing that the original
    criteria continue to be met.

(e) NONCOMPLIANCE.--
    (1) Noncompliance with an AOT order shall not be grounds for contempt
    of court or criminal sanctions.
    (2) Upon noncompliance, the court may order the individual to be
    evaluated for inpatient commitment under existing standards.

SECTION 5. DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS.

(a) Every individual subject to a civil commitment petition or AOT
petition shall have the right to:
    (1) Legal representation by an attorney with training in mental health
    law, appointed at State expense if the individual is indigent;
    (2) An independent psychiatric evaluation by a clinician not employed
    by the petitioning facility;
    (3) A hearing before a judicial officer within 72 hours of an
    involuntary hold;
    (4) The right to be present, testify, present evidence, and
    cross-examine witnesses;
    (5) Periodic judicial review at intervals not exceeding 90 days; and
    (6) A right to appeal.

SECTION 6. EQUITY MONITORING.

(a) The [State mental health authority] shall collect and publish annually
data on civil commitment and AOT participation disaggregated by race,
ethnicity, gender, age, and county.

(b) The [State] shall establish an independent Mental Health Civil Rights
Commission with authority to investigate complaints, access facility
records, and issue public reports.

SECTION 7. APPROPRIATIONS.

The Legislature shall appropriate $[amount] for the implementation of
this Act, including:
    (1) $[amount] for community treatment services supporting AOT orders;
    (2) $[amount] for legal representation infrastructure;
    (3) $[amount] for the Mental Health Civil Rights Commission; and
    (4) $[amount] for data collection and reporting systems.

SECTION 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], except that Sections 3 and 4 shall
take effect only upon certification by the [State mental health authority]
that adequate treatment infrastructure is available to support expanded
commitment and AOT orders.
```

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through SAMHSA, CMS, and HRSA.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **AOT Minimum Standards Rule**: SAMHSA must define "competent legal counsel," "independent psychiatric evaluation," "service delivery certification," and data reporting requirements. Deadline: 12 months after enactment.
2. **IMD Exclusion Repeal Implementation Rule**: CMS must establish accreditation standards, Olmstead discharge planning requirements, and phase-in schedule. Deadline: 12 months after enactment.
3. **CCBHC Permanent Authorization Rule**: CMS must establish reimbursement rates, scope of services, and quality metrics for permanent CCBHC program. Deadline: 18 months after enactment.
4. **Equity Data Reporting Rule**: SAMHSA must specify data elements, collection methods, and reporting deadlines for demographic and outcome data. Deadline: 12 months after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Block grant conditions**: Non-compliant states risk loss of SAMHSA Community Mental Health Services Block Grant funds (currently $757 million nationally, FY2024).
- **Medicaid conditions**: IMD exclusion repeal benefits are conditioned on accreditation, data reporting, and patient rights compliance.
- **Civil rights enforcement**: State equity commissions and the federal Office of Mental Health Equity have investigation and corrective action authority.
- **Private right of action**: Individuals subject to commitment or AOT may bring suit in federal court for violations of minimum due process standards.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: The federal government conditions SAMHSA block grants on state compliance with AOT and due process standards. Under *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), such conditions are permissible if they are related to the federal interest in the funded program, are not unduly coercive, and do not require states to violate other constitutional provisions. Mental health standards are directly related to the block grant's purpose.

**Federalism Concerns**: Civil commitment has traditionally been an area of state law. Federal minimum standards represent an expansion of federal involvement. However, the approach uses conditional spending rather than direct mandates, preserving state authority to design systems that meet federal minimums. The precedent of Medicaid conditions (e.g., EMTALA, parity requirements) supports this approach.

**Due Process**: The due process minimums established in Section 6 are consistent with existing Supreme Court precedent (*Addington*, *O'Connor*, *Youngberg*). They codify constitutional requirements rather than create new ones, reducing vulnerability to challenge.

### Preemption

Federal standards establish a floor, not a ceiling. States remain free to provide stronger protections than the federal minimum. The legislation includes an express non-preemption clause preserving state authority to impose more protective standards.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through three mechanisms: (1) financial conditions on block grants and Medicaid reimbursement, (2) independent monitoring by state equity commissions and the federal equity office, and (3) private right of action for individuals whose due process rights are violated.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Service delivery certification could become a rubber stamp | State mental health authorities might certify service availability without verifying actual capacity, allowing AOT orders to proceed without adequate resources | High | Require third-party verification of service capacity; authorize equity commissions to audit certifications |
| Data reporting requirements could be met with incomplete data | States might report aggregate data without meaningful disaggregation, hiding disparities | Medium | Specify minimum data elements at the individual record level; require external validation of data completeness |
| IMD accreditation could be weakened through industry lobbying | Hospital industry lobbying could weaken CMS accreditation standards, allowing sub-standard facilities to receive Medicaid funding | Medium | Establish accreditation standards in statute rather than delegating entirely to CMS; include minimum staffing ratios and patient rights |
| "Specialized counsel" requirement could be circumvented by minimal training | States might satisfy the requirement with brief training modules rather than genuine specialization | Medium | Specify minimum training hours (40+ hours) and ongoing CLE requirements for attorneys representing commitment respondents |
| States could maintain technical compliance while underfunding | States might adopt the required standards on paper while appropriating insufficient funds, producing the same resource-free mandates that have undermined previous reforms | High | Require states to submit fiscal impact analyses with compliance plans; authorize SAMHSA to withhold block grant funds if fiscal commitment is inadequate |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Workforce pipeline requires 5-10 years to produce results | Expanded services cannot be fully staffed in the near term | Medical education timelines; rural recruitment challenges | Immediate expansion of telehealth and peer specialist workforce; interim reliance on nurse practitioners and physician assistants |
| Federal minimum standards may not address all state-specific problems | One-size-fits-all standards may be too rigid for diverse state contexts | Geographic, demographic, and institutional variation across states | Include waiver provisions for states that demonstrate equivalent outcomes through alternative approaches |
| IMD exclusion repeal could incentivize institutionalization | Without strong Olmstead protections, states might expand inpatient capacity at the expense of community services | Institutional bias in healthcare systems; cost structure favoring inpatient care | Condition IMD reimbursement on Olmstead-compliant discharge planning and community service investment |
| Conditional block grant approach may not bind states that forgo federal funds | Wealthy states could theoretically refuse block grants to avoid federal standards | Structural limitation of spending clause approach | Monitor for states declining funds; consider alternative enforcement mechanisms if needed |
| Political polarization may prevent bipartisan passage | The legislation combines elements that appeal to both left and right, but partisan dynamics may override policy logic | Structural polarization in Congress | Build bipartisan coalition starting with specific, less controversial provisions (crisis system, workforce) |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen service delivery certification**: Amend Section 5(b) to require independent third-party verification of service capacity, not just state self-certification. Authorize state equity commissions to conduct random audits.
2. **Specify data granularity**: Amend Section 8 to require individual-level record reporting (with appropriate privacy protections) rather than aggregate data, enabling meaningful disparity analysis.
3. **Codify minimum accreditation standards**: Include minimum staffing ratios (e.g., 1 psychiatrist per 20 patients, 1 nurse per 8 patients) and patient rights protections directly in statute rather than delegating entirely to CMS rulemaking.
4. **Define specialized counsel requirements**: Specify in statute that attorneys representing individuals in commitment proceedings must complete at least 40 hours of mental health law training and 8 hours of annual continuing education.
5. **Require fiscal impact analysis**: Add a requirement that states submit fiscal impact analyses demonstrating adequate appropriations alongside compliance plans. Authorize SAMHSA to conditionally approve plans pending fiscal verification.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The legislation should include a 7-year sunset provision requiring Congressional reauthorization. The GAO should be directed to conduct comprehensive evaluations at Years 3 and 5, assessing:

- Impact on commitment and AOT rates
- Impact on hospitalization, incarceration, and homelessness
- Impact on racial and ethnic disparities
- Cost-effectiveness relative to prior system
- State compliance and implementation quality

Reauthorization should be conditioned on demonstrated improvement in key outcome metrics.
