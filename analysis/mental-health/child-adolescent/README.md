# Child and Adolescent Mental Health

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of the youth mental health crisis in the United States, encompassing the dramatic rise in pediatric mental health conditions, the severe shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists, and the systemic barriers preventing young people from accessing timely, evidence-based care.

## Overview

The United States is experiencing an unprecedented crisis in child and adolescent mental health. The U.S. Surgeon General issued an advisory in December 2021 warning that youth mental health had reached a critical inflection point, with rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation rising sharply even before the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the trend. Between 2009 and 2021, the share of high school students reporting persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness increased from 26% to 42%, and emergency department visits for mental health crises among children aged 5-17 rose by over 50%.

This crisis is compounded by a severe workforce shortage--fewer than 14 child and adolescent psychiatrists practice per 100,000 children nationwide, and more than 70% of U.S. counties lack even one such specialist. Meanwhile, the systems designed to serve youth--schools, Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit, foster care, and community mental health centers--are fragmented, underfunded, and often inaccessible to those who need them most. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) affect nearly two-thirds of American adults and lay the groundwork for lifelong health consequences that early intervention could mitigate.

This analysis examines the current scope of the youth mental health crisis, its historical roots, the structural and social factors that perpetuate it, and a range of evidence-based solutions from expanded school-based services to federal legislative proposals like the Kids Mental Health Crisis Act. It explores how social media, economic inequality, and systemic racism contribute to disparate outcomes and proposes a comprehensive roadmap for building a children's system of care that meets the scale of the challenge.
