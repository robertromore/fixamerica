# Child and Adolescent Mental Health: Current State

## Prevalence and Burden of Youth Mental Health Conditions

The scale of child and adolescent mental health need in the United States has reached levels without precedent in the modern era of measurement. Multiple federal data systems confirm that both the prevalence of diagnosable conditions and the severity of self-reported distress have increased sharply over the past decade, with acceleration following the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Depression and Anxiety

Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health conditions affecting American youth and have shown the steepest increases in recent years.

| Condition | Population | Prevalence | Trend (2016-2022) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Major depressive episode (past year) | Ages 12-17 | 5.0 million (20.1%) | Up from 12.8% (2016) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |
| Current anxiety disorder | Ages 3-17 | 9.4 million (15.4%) | Up from 7.1% (2003) | CDC NSCH, 2022 |
| Current depression | Ages 3-17 | 5.7 million (9.4%) | Up from 3.1% (2003) | CDC NSCH, 2022 |
| Persistent sadness/hopelessness (past year) | High school students | 42% | Up from 26% (2009) | CDC YRBS, 2021 |
| Seriously considered suicide (past year) | High school students | 22% | Up from 14% (2009) | CDC YRBS, 2021 |
| Made a suicide plan (past year) | High school students | 18% | Up from 11% (2009) | CDC YRBS, 2021 |

The increase in depression among adolescent girls has been particularly striking. In the 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 57% of female high school students reported persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, compared to 29% of male students. Among LGBTQ+ youth, 69% reported persistent sadness or hopelessness and 45% seriously considered suicide in the past year (CDC YRBS, 2021).

### Suicide and Self-Harm

Suicide is the second leading cause of death among Americans aged 10-24, claiming 6,643 lives in 2021 (CDC WISQARS, 2023). Emergency department visits for self-harm and suicidal ideation among children have surged.

| Metric | Value | Comparison | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Suicide deaths, ages 10-24 (2021) | 6,643 | Up 62% from 2007 | CDC WISQARS, 2023 |
| Suicide rate, ages 10-14 (per 100,000) | 2.8 (2021) | Tripled since 2007 (0.9) | CDC WISQARS, 2023 |
| Suicide rate, ages 15-19 (per 100,000) | 11.0 (2021) | Up from 6.7 (2007) | CDC WISQARS, 2023 |
| ED visits for suicide attempts, ages 12-17 | Up 51% (girls) in early 2021 | Compared to same period in 2019 | CDC MMWR, 2021 |
| ED visits for mental health, ages 5-11 | Up 24% (2020 vs. 2019) | During pandemic year | CDC MMWR, 2022 |

Black children aged 5-12 now die by suicide at nearly twice the rate of white children in the same age group, a reversal of historical patterns (Congressional Black Caucus Emergency Task Force on Black Youth Suicide, 2019). Indigenous youth face suicide rates 2.5 times the national average (IHS, 2022).

### Behavioral and Developmental Conditions

| Condition | Ages | Prevalence | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADHD (ever diagnosed) | 3-17 | 9.8% (6.0 million) | CDC NSCH, 2022 |
| Behavior/conduct problems | 3-17 | 8.9% (5.5 million) | CDC NSCH, 2022 |
| Autism spectrum disorder | 8 | 1 in 36 | CDC ADDM Network, 2023 |
| Substance use disorder | 12-17 | 1.6 million (6.3%) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022 |
| Eating disorders (lifetime) | Adolescents | 2.7% | NIMH, 2023 |

### Overall Burden

An estimated 49.5% of adolescents have experienced a mental health disorder by age 18, based on the National Comorbidity Survey Replication-Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A, Merikangas et al., 2010). More recently, the CDC's National Survey of Children's Health found that in 2022, 21.8% of children aged 3-17 had a current mental, emotional, developmental, or behavioral condition (CDC NSCH, 2022).

## Treatment Access and Utilization

### The Treatment Gap

Despite rising need, roughly half of youth with mental health conditions do not receive any treatment. The treatment gap is widest for the most vulnerable populations.

| Population | Treatment Rate | Gap | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Children 6-17 with any mental health condition | 50.6% received treatment | 49.4% untreated | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022 |
| Adolescents 12-17 with major depressive episode | 41.6% received treatment | 58.4% untreated | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |
| Adolescents with severe major depressive episode | 55.0% received treatment | 45.0% untreated | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |
| Youth with SUD (ages 12-17) | 6.1% received treatment | 93.9% untreated | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022 |

### Insurance Coverage and Access

Insurance status significantly affects access but does not guarantee it. Even insured children face narrow provider networks, high cost-sharing, and long wait times.

| Insurance Status | Children Covered | Mental Health Access Issues | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Medicaid/CHIP | 39.7 million children | EPSDT mandate often unenforced; network adequacy poor | CMS, 2023 |
| Employer-sponsored insurance | ~30 million children | Out-of-network rates for mental health 5x physical health | Milliman, 2022 |
| Uninsured children | 3.7 million | No coverage for mental health services | Census Bureau, 2023 |
| Children on Medicaid denied care | 21% denied appointment | Compared to 7% with private insurance | HHS OIG, 2019 |

The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008, strengthened in 2024, requires insurers to cover mental health on par with physical health. However, enforcement has been inconsistent. A 2022 Milliman study found that out-of-network utilization for behavioral health services among children was 5.4 times higher than for medical/surgical services, indicating that insurers maintain inadequate in-network provider panels.

### Wait Times

| Setting | Average Wait | Range | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Child psychiatry appointment | 8+ weeks | 2-25 weeks by state | AACAP survey, 2022 |
| Outpatient therapy (new patient) | 6 weeks | 2-16 weeks | APA Practice Survey, 2023 |
| Psychiatric inpatient bed (pediatric) | 3.2 days average ED boarding | Up to 7+ days in some states | ACEP, 2023 |
| School-based mental health referral | 4-8 weeks | Varies by district | NASP, 2022 |

## Workforce Shortage

### Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists

The shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists is among the most severe workforce gaps in American healthcare.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Practicing child/adolescent psychiatrists | ~9,500 | AACAP, 2023 |
| Ratio per 100,000 children | Fewer than 14 | AACAP Workforce Maps, 2023 |
| Counties with zero child psychiatrists | More than 70% | AACAP, 2023 |
| Estimated additional psychiatrists needed | 12,000-30,000 | HRSA, 2022 |
| Annual training program graduates | ~900 | AACAP, 2023 |
| Median age of child psychiatrists | 55 years | AACAP, 2022 |

At the current training rate of approximately 900 graduates per year, the workforce is not keeping pace with attrition, let alone growing to meet expanded need. HRSA designated child psychiatry as a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) discipline, and more than 150 million Americans live in a mental health HPSA.

### Broader Mental Health Workforce for Children

| Profession | Current Supply | Recommended Ratio | Actual Ratio | Shortage | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| School psychologists | ~43,000 | 1:500 students | 1:1,127 | ~62,000 additional needed | NASP, 2022 |
| School counselors | ~119,000 | 1:250 students | 1:385 | ~72,000 additional needed | ASCA, 2023 |
| School social workers | ~35,000 | 1:250 students | 1:1,375 | Severe shortage | SSWAA, 2022 |
| Licensed child therapists | ~120,000 (estimated) | Varies | Below need | Significant shortage | BLS, 2023 |

### Geographic Distribution

The workforce shortage is most severe in rural and underserved communities.

| Region Type | Child Psychiatrists per 100,000 Children | Access to Any Mental Health Professional | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Urban | 17.5 | 80%+ of children within 30 min | AACAP, 2023 |
| Suburban | 11.2 | 60-70% within 30 min | AACAP, 2023 |
| Rural | 4.1 | 40% within 30 min | AACAP, 2023 |
| Frontier/tribal | 0.7 | Below 20% within 30 min | IHS/HRSA, 2022 |

---

## School-Based Mental Health

Schools are the primary point of contact for children's mental health services, with an estimated 80% of youth who receive mental health services accessing them through schools (NAMI, 2023).

### Current School-Based Infrastructure

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Schools with a school psychologist | 83% | NASP, 2022 |
| Schools with a school counselor | 91% | ASCA, 2023 |
| Schools with a school social worker | 48% | SSWAA, 2022 |
| Schools with a school nurse | 40% (full-time) | NASN, 2023 |
| Schools offering suicide prevention programs | 73% | CDC SHPPS, 2022 |
| Schools with comprehensive mental health services | 35% | NCES, 2022 |

### Bipartisan Safer Communities Act Impact

The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (Public Law 117-159, 2022) appropriated $1.7 billion over 5 years for youth mental health, including $1 billion for school-based mental health services through the Stronger Connections Grant Program. As of mid-2024, all 50 states had received initial allocations, but disbursement to individual schools remained uneven.

## Social Media and Digital Environment

### Usage Patterns

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Teens (13-17) who use social media "almost constantly" | 46% | Pew Research Center, 2023 |
| Teens using YouTube | 93% | Pew, 2023 |
| Teens using TikTok | 63% | Pew, 2023 |
| Teens using Instagram | 59% | Pew, 2023 |
| Teens using Snapchat | 60% | Pew, 2023 |
| Average daily screen time, ages 8-12 | 5 hours 33 minutes | Common Sense Media, 2021 |
| Average daily screen time, ages 13-18 | 8 hours 39 minutes | Common Sense Media, 2021 |

### Evidence of Harm

The Surgeon General's 2023 Advisory on Social Media and Youth Mental Health concluded that while social media can offer benefits including community and connection, there is "growing evidence that social media use is associated with harm to young people's mental health." Key findings include:

- Adolescents who spend more than 3 hours per day on social media face double the risk of poor mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety symptoms (Surgeon General Advisory, 2023)
- Social media features such as infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications, and algorithmic amplification of extreme content are designed to maximize engagement, not protect users (FTC Staff Report, 2024)
- 64% of adolescents are "often" or "sometimes" exposed to hate-based content online (Surgeon General Advisory, 2023)
- Girls who use social media heavily report higher rates of body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, and social comparison (Orben & Przybylski, 2019; Haidt & Twenge, 2023)

### Regulatory Landscape

| Jurisdiction | Measure | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Federal | Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) | Passed Senate 91-3 (July 2024); House pending | congress.gov, 2024 |
| Federal | Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act | Passed Senate with KOSA; House pending | congress.gov, 2024 |
| Utah | Social Media Regulation Act | Signed into law (March 2023); partially enjoined | Utah HB 311, 2023 |
| California | Age-Appropriate Design Code Act | Signed (2022); preliminary injunction (2023) | CA AB 2273, 2022 |
| Arkansas | Social Media Safety Act | Signed (2023); enjoined by federal court | AR SB 396, 2023 |
| Texas | Securing Children Online through Parental Empowerment Act | Signed (2023); partially upheld | TX HB 18, 2023 |

## Foster Care and Child Welfare

Children in the child welfare system face dramatically elevated mental health risk.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Children in foster care (FY2022) | 368,530 | ACF AFCARS, 2023 |
| Foster youth with a mental health diagnosis | 50-80% (estimates vary) | Casey Family Programs, 2022 |
| Foster youth prescribed psychotropic medication | 25-35% | GAO, 2017; state audits |
| Former foster youth with PTSD | 25% (comparable to combat veterans) | Harvard/Casey study, 2005 |
| Foster youth receiving adequate mental health services | Estimated 30-40% | Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative, 2022 |

The use of psychotropic medications among foster children has drawn particular scrutiny. A 2017 GAO report found that children in foster care were prescribed psychotropic medications at rates 2.7 to 4.5 times those of non-foster Medicaid-enrolled children, often with inadequate monitoring and informed consent procedures.

## Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)

### Prevalence

| Number of ACEs | Adult Prevalence | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1+ ACEs | 63.9% of adults | CDC BRFSS, 2022 |
| 2+ ACEs | 38.7% of adults | CDC BRFSS, 2022 |
| 4+ ACEs | 17.3% of adults | CDC BRFSS, 2022 |
| Children currently experiencing 2+ ACEs | 22.6% of children aged 0-17 | CDC NSCH, 2022 |

### Health Impact

The landmark CDC-Kaiser ACE Study (Felitti et al., 1998) and subsequent research have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between ACE exposure and lifelong health outcomes.

| ACE Score | Depression Risk (Relative) | Suicide Attempt Risk (Relative) | Substance Use Risk (Relative) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1.0 (baseline) | 1.0 (baseline) | 1.0 (baseline) | CDC-Kaiser ACE Study |
| 1-3 | 2.5x | 2.0x | 2.0x | Felitti et al., 1998 |
| 4+ | 4.6x | 12.2x | 4.7x | Felitti et al., 1998 |

## Medicaid and EPSDT

### The EPSDT Mandate

Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit is the most comprehensive pediatric mental health entitlement in federal law, covering all medically necessary mental health services for children under 21 enrolled in Medicaid. However, implementation falls far short of the legal mandate.

| EPSDT Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Children enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP | 39.7 million | CMS, 2023 |
| Children receiving any EPSDT screening | 58% of eligible children | CMS Form 416 data, 2022 |
| States meeting screening targets | 18 of 50 | CMS, 2022 |
| Children receiving follow-up mental health treatment | Data incomplete; estimated 30-40% of those screened | HHS OIG, 2019 |

A 2019 HHS Office of Inspector General report found that more than half of Medicaid-enrolled children did not receive all required preventive screenings, and follow-through to mental health treatment was inconsistent. CMS enforcement of EPSDT mental health obligations has been limited, relying primarily on state self-reporting.

## Recent Trends

### Accelerating Crisis (2019-2024)

- **Pre-pandemic trajectory**: Depression rates among 12-17-year-olds rose from 12.8% (2016) to 15.7% (2019), establishing a clear upward trend before COVID-19 (SAMHSA NSDUH)
- **Pandemic shock**: ED visits for mental health among children aged 5-11 increased 24% and among girls aged 12-17 increased 51% for suspected suicide attempts in early 2021 compared to the same period in 2019 (CDC MMWR)
- **Post-pandemic persistence**: Youth mental health indicators have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. The 2022 NSDUH found 20.1% of adolescents experienced a major depressive episode, the highest rate recorded
- **Surgeon General response**: The December 2021 Advisory on Youth Mental Health and the May 2023 Advisory on Social Media and Youth Mental Health elevated the issue to national prominence
- **Legislative action**: The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022) appropriated $1.7 billion for youth mental health, the largest single federal investment in this area

### Telehealth Expansion

The pandemic catalyzed rapid expansion of telehealth for pediatric mental health. All 50 states now have some form of Medicaid telehealth coverage for behavioral health. Studies indicate telehealth is effective for many pediatric mental health conditions, with comparable outcomes to in-person care for CBT and medication management (APA, 2023). However, the digital divide means that telehealth expansion disproportionately benefits higher-income and urban families.

---

## Emerging Challenges

- **Fentanyl and youth substance use**: While overall adolescent substance use has declined, fentanyl contamination of illicit drugs has driven a sharp increase in adolescent overdose deaths--up 109% from 2019 to 2021 (CDC WONDER, 2023)
- **Climate anxiety**: Surveys find that 45% of young people aged 16-25 report that climate change feelings negatively affect their daily functioning (Lancet Planetary Health, 2021)
- **AI and digital manipulation**: Emerging AI technologies pose new risks for youth including deepfakes, AI-generated harassment, and conversational AI that may give harmful health advice
- **Post-pandemic learning loss and disengagement**: Chronic absenteeism rates doubled during the pandemic and remain elevated, compounding mental health challenges with academic and social disconnection
- **Workforce burnout**: Mental health professionals report high rates of burnout and secondary traumatic stress, threatening the stability of the existing workforce even as expansion is needed
