# Child and Adolescent Mental Health: What You Can Do

Children cannot vote, lobby, or testify before Congress. The youth mental health crisis will not be resolved unless adults--parents, educators, healthcare workers, and citizens--demand systemic change with the same urgency they would bring to a physical health emergency affecting millions of children. Every level of engagement matters, from individual conversations to federal advocacy.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the Surgeon General's Advisory on Youth Mental Health (December 2021) and the Advisory on Social Media and Youth Mental Health (May 2023)--both are publicly available at <https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/>
- Follow SAMHSA's annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data releases for the most current youth mental health prevalence and treatment statistics
- Subscribe to the AACAP legislative newsletter for updates on federal and state children's mental health policy at <https://www.aacap.org/>
- Read *The Anxious Generation* by Jonathan Haidt (2024) for a comprehensive analysis of how smartphones and social media are affecting youth mental health
- Review your state's KIDS COUNT profile at <https://datacenter.kidscount.org/> to understand children's mental health indicators in your community

### Make Personal Changes

- **Monitor and manage screen time**: Implement family media plans (AAP offers a template at <https://www.healthychildren.org/English/faimly-life/Media/Pages/How-to-Make-a-Family-Media-Use-Plan.aspx>); delay smartphone access for children under 14 where possible; model healthy technology habits
- **Learn to recognize warning signs**: Familiarize yourself with the signs of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation in children and adolescents. NAMI offers a free guide at <https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions>
- **Talk to children about mental health**: Normalize conversations about emotions and mental health in your household. The AAP recommends asking open-ended questions and validating feelings rather than dismissing them
- **Know the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline**: Save 988 in your phone. Share the number with the young people in your life. The Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741) is also available for youth who prefer text communication
- **Request ACE screening**: Ask your pediatrician whether they screen for adverse childhood experiences at well-child visits. If not, ask them to consider implementing screening

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge support for the Kids Online Safety Act, increased SAMHSA children's mental health funding, and Medicaid EPSDT enforcement. See below for specific contact guidance
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS publishes proposed rules on EPSDT enforcement or Medicaid behavioral health rates, submit comments supporting strong standards. Federal Register notices are published at <https://www.regulations.gov/>
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Local newspapers remain influential with state legislators. Share data on your community's children's mental health needs--school staffing ratios, wait times, provider shortages
- **Share Information**: Post about the youth mental health crisis on social media using evidence-based messaging. Correct misinformation that frames children's mental health solely as a parenting problem rather than a systemic issue

---

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- **Attend school board meetings**: Advocate for school-based mental health staffing. Ask your district: What is our student-to-school-psychologist ratio? (National average: 1,127:1; recommended: 500:1.) What is the ratio for school counselors? Does our district employ school social workers?
- **Form a parent mental health advocacy group**: Connect with other parents in your community to advocate collectively for better children's mental health services. NAMI Basics is a free course for parents and caregivers of children with mental health conditions
- **Host community information sessions**: Partner with local mental health providers, schools, and faith institutions to host events on topics such as recognizing youth mental health warning signs, navigating the treatment system, and managing screen time
- **Support school-based mental health programs**: Volunteer with or donate to organizations that bring mental health professionals into schools, such as local school-based health centers or university training clinics

### Build Coalitions

- **Connect educators, parents, and providers**: Create cross-sector coalitions that include school administrators, parents, pediatricians, and mental health professionals. Unified advocacy is more effective than siloed efforts
- **Engage faith communities**: Many families first turn to religious leaders when a child is struggling. Partner with faith institutions to integrate mental health literacy into pastoral care and youth programs
- **Work with local businesses**: Employer coalitions can advocate for children's mental health as a workforce development issue--untreated childhood mental illness affects future productivity and economic vitality

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When children's mental health legislation is pending in Congress or your state legislature (AACAP and NAMI send action alerts)
- During the annual federal and state budget/appropriations process (typically February-September)
- After the release of new youth mental health data (NSDUH, YRBS, CDC reports)
- When your school district is setting its annual budget and staffing plans

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Children's Mental Health Investment

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a [parent/educator/healthcare provider/citizen] in [City, State], writing
about the youth mental health crisis affecting children in our community. The
Surgeon General has declared youth mental health "the defining public health
crisis of our time." In our state, [insert local data point - e.g., "only X%
of children with mental health conditions receive treatment" or "our district
has a student-to-school-psychologist ratio of X:1"].

I urge you to support:

1. Increased federal funding for children's mental health services through
   SAMHSA and Medicaid
2. The Kids Online Safety Act to protect children from harmful social media
   platform design
3. Stronger enforcement of Medicaid EPSDT mental health obligations
4. Expanded loan forgiveness for child mental health professionals serving
   underserved communities

Investing in children's mental health saves lives and saves money. Every $1
invested returns $1.50-$11.00 in reduced healthcare, education, and criminal
justice costs.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling
about children's mental health. [X] million children in the United States have
a mental health condition, and nearly half receive no treatment. I'm asking
[Representative/Senator] [Name] to support increased funding for children's
mental health services and to co-sponsor the Kids Online Safety Act. Can you
please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)**: Establishes a duty of care for platforms toward minors; passed Senate 91-3 in July 2024; pending House action. Contact your House representative to urge floor vote
- **Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0)**: Strengthens data privacy protections for children and teens. Passed Senate with KOSA; pending House action
- **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act reauthorization**: The 2022 law's $1.7 billion in youth mental health funding expires; advocate for reauthorization and expansion
- **Mental Health Parity enforcement**: Support CMS and DOL efforts to strengthen enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, particularly for children's behavioral health networks
- **State-level school mental health staffing mandates**: Many states are considering legislation requiring minimum student-to-mental-health-professional ratios. Check your state legislature for pending bills

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your plan to address the youth mental health crisis, which the Surgeon General has called the defining public health issue of our time?"
2. "Do you support requiring social media platforms to implement safety-by-design features for minors, as proposed in the Kids Online Safety Act?"
3. "How would you close the gap in children's mental health access--particularly for children on Medicaid, in rural areas, and in communities of color?"
4. "Do you support federal investment in school-based mental health professionals to bring staffing ratios to recommended levels?"
5. "How do you balance parental rights with ensuring all children--including LGBTQ+ youth--can access the mental health care they need?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who endorse specific children's mental health funding commitments, not just general sympathy
- Key congressional committees: Senate HELP Committee, Senate Finance Committee, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House Education and the Workforce Committee, and House and Senate Appropriations Committees
- State-level officials (governors, state legislators, state education board members) have significant authority over school-based mental health, Medicaid implementation, and social media regulation

## Professional Actions

- **For Educators**: Advocate within your school and district for SEL implementation, mental health first aid training, and adequate school mental health staffing. Report student mental health needs to administrators with data. Connect with NASP for advocacy resources
- **For Pediatricians and Primary Care Providers**: Implement universal mental health screening at well-child visits using validated tools (PHQ-A, GAD-7, PSC). Explore collaborative care models. Contact your AACAP chapter for resources on integrating behavioral health
- **For Mental Health Professionals**: Consider accepting Medicaid patients; advocate through your professional association for rate increases; participate in NHSC loan repayment if eligible; volunteer with school-based mental health programs; mentor trainees
- **For Technology Industry Workers**: Support internal advocacy for youth safety features; engage with responsible technology groups; if aware of designs that harm youth, consider protected disclosure under existing whistleblower frameworks
- **For Attorneys and Legal Professionals**: Support pro bono EPSDT enforcement litigation; assist families in appealing insurance denials for children's mental health services; engage with state attorney general offices pursuing platform accountability lawsuits
- **For Researchers**: Prioritize rigorous studies of social media's causal effects on youth mental health; evaluate the effectiveness of scaled interventions; publish findings in accessible formats for policymakers

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing children's mental health with others, emphasize:

1. **The crisis is real and measurable**: 5.0 million adolescents (20.1%) experienced a major depressive episode in the past year; suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for ages 10-24; 42% of high school students report persistent sadness or hopelessness (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023; CDC WISQARS, 2022; CDC YRBS, 2021)
2. **Nearly half of affected children get no help**: 49.4% of children with a mental health condition receive no treatment. The treatment gap is even wider for Black youth (71% untreated) and Hispanic youth (67% untreated) (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022)
3. **The system is broken, not just overwhelmed**: More than 70% of U.S. counties have zero child psychiatrists. The national student-to-school-psychologist ratio is 1,127:1--more than double the recommended level. Wait times for child psychiatry exceed 8 weeks in most states (AACAP, 2023; NASP, 2022)
4. **Investment pays for itself**: Children's mental health programs return $1.50-$11.00 for every $1 invested through reduced emergency visits, special education costs, juvenile justice involvement, and future adult healthcare needs (SAMHSA, 2019; Belfield et al., 2015)
5. **This is bipartisan**: The Kids Online Safety Act passed the Senate 91-3. Concern about youth mental health and social media cuts across party lines. This is a rare area where broad political consensus is achievable

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Kids today are just too soft" | Youth mental health conditions are clinically diagnosable disorders, not character weakness. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD have measurable neurobiological bases. The rate of youth suicide has increased 62% since 2007 | CDC WISQARS, 2023 |
| "This is just over-diagnosis" | The dominant problem is under-treatment, not over-diagnosis. 49.4% of children with conditions receive no treatment at all. Only 50.6% of those with identified conditions get help | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022 |
| "Parents just need to take away phones" | While individual families can manage screen time, platform design features (infinite scroll, algorithmic amplification, push notifications) are engineered to maximize engagement regardless of user age. Systemic problems require systemic solutions | Surgeon General Advisory, 2023 |
| "This is a parenting problem, not a government problem" | Clinical mental health conditions require professional treatment, just as diabetes or asthma do. Families need a functioning system with trained providers, affordable access, and adequate school-based support | AACAP, 2023; AAP, 2021 |
| "Government programs don't work for mental health" | The System of Care model reduced out-of-home placements by 30-50% and generated $1.50-$3.00 in savings per $1 invested. School-based mental health programs improve both clinical and academic outcomes | SAMHSA, 2019; Durlak et al., 2011 |
