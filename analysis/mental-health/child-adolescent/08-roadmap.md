# Child and Adolescent Mental Health: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The implementation strategy is organized into three phases that build sequentially. Phase 1 (Years 1-2) focuses on quick wins that can be achieved through executive action, appropriations, and legislation with existing bipartisan support--primarily workforce incentives, billing code creation, and social media regulation. Phase 2 (Years 3-5) scales infrastructure through school-based staffing, EPSDT enforcement, crisis system construction, and ACE screening pilots. Phase 3 (Years 6-10) completes the systemic transformation by reaching full staffing ratios, closing geographic gaps, and achieving measurable reductions in the treatment gap and health disparities. Each phase creates the preconditions for the next: workforce expansion in Phase 1 enables the staffing of school-based and crisis systems in Phase 2, which in turn supports the population-level outcome improvements targeted in Phase 3.

## Governance and Oversight

- **Federal Interagency Task Force on Youth Mental Health**: Co-chaired by HHS Secretary and Education Secretary; includes SAMHSA, CMS, HRSA, CDC, FTC, and DOJ representatives. Meets quarterly to coordinate implementation across agencies and report to Congress annually
- **Congressional Oversight**: Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee conduct annual hearings on implementation progress, with testimony from federal agencies, state officials, and youth/family advocates
- **Independent Evaluation**: GAO conducts biennial evaluations of major program components (workforce expansion, school-based services, EPSDT enforcement, crisis infrastructure). Reports are public and include recommendations
- **Youth Advisory Council**: Established within HHS, composed of 25 young people aged 14-24 representing diverse geographic, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Council advises on program design, reviews implementation data, and issues an annual report from the youth perspective

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Workforce Expansion Falls Short of Targets

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Diversify workforce strategies beyond physician expansion; invest heavily in Child Mental Health Specialists, collaborative care models, and telehealth to extend specialist reach. Increase loan repayment amounts for the most underserved areas. Partner with HBCUs and minority-serving institutions to diversify the pipeline.

**Contingency Plan**: If workforce targets are missed by more than 25% at Year 5 review, double loan repayment incentives for shortage areas and authorize emergency scope-of-practice expansions for supervised paraprofessionals.

### Risk 2: State Resistance to EPSDT Enforcement

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Phase enforcement gradually (technical assistance first, then corrective action, then financial penalties). Offer enhanced FMAP (90% initially) to offset compliance costs. Highlight states that implement effectively as models. Engage National Governors Association early.

**Contingency Plan**: If more than 20 states fail to submit compliance plans, authorize DOJ to file enforcement actions on behalf of Medicaid-enrolled children, building on existing EPSDT litigation precedents.

### Risk 3: Social Media Legislation Struck Down on First Amendment Grounds

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Draft legislation to focus on platform design and commercial conduct (duty of care) rather than content regulation. Include robust findings section with evidence of harm. Structure as consumer protection rather than speech restriction. Build strong legislative record.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal law is struck down, pursue state-level age-appropriate design codes with narrower scope; use FTC's existing Section 5 unfair practices authority for enforcement where possible; support industry self-regulation framework with mandatory reporting.

### Risk 4: Political Support Erodes Before Full Implementation

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design programs to show measurable results within 2-3 years (quick wins). Build bipartisan ownership by distributing investments across red and blue states. Create annual public scorecards tracking progress. Engage youth and parent advocacy networks to sustain political pressure.

**Contingency Plan**: Structure core programs (EPSDT enforcement, billing codes, loan repayment) so they become administratively embedded and difficult to reverse without new legislation. Sunset provisions in authorizing legislation should require affirmative Congressional action to terminate, not merely the expiration of authorization.

### Risk 5: Technology Companies Circumvent Platform Safety Requirements

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design regulations around outcomes (demonstrable reduction in harmful exposures for minors) rather than specific technical requirements that can be gamed. Require independent annual audits with published methodology. Impose escalating penalties for non-compliance. Include whistleblower protections for platform employees.

**Contingency Plan**: If audits reveal widespread non-compliance, authorize FTC to mandate specific design changes (e.g., disabling algorithmic recommendations for all minor accounts) and increase civil penalties to percentage-of-revenue levels.
