# Child and Adolescent Mental Health: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to child and adolescent mental health reform combines federal legislation creating new programs and mandates, enforcement of existing entitlements (particularly Medicaid EPSDT), state model legislation for school-based services, and a regulatory framework addressing social media platform accountability. The strategy is comprehensive rather than incremental: the youth mental health crisis reflects multiple systemic failures that require simultaneous action on workforce, financing, access, prevention, and digital safety. Federal legislation establishes national standards and funding, while state model legislation addresses the school-based and community infrastructure that the federal government cannot directly control.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for child and adolescent mental health reform.* The proposed legislation operates within established congressional authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1), the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3), and the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18). Medicaid reforms rely on the Spending Clause; social media regulation on the Commerce Clause; and school-based programs on conditional federal funding.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish a comprehensive framework for expanding access to child and
adolescent mental health services, strengthening the child mental health
workforce, enforcing Medicaid mental health obligations for children, and
promoting prevention and early intervention.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Comprehensive Child Mental Health
Access Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA), 5.0 million adolescents aged 12-17
(20.1 percent) experienced a major depressive episode in the past
year as of 2023.

(2) Suicide is the second leading cause of death among Americans
aged 10-24, claiming 6,643 lives in 2021, an increase of 62 percent
since 2007, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).

(3) According to the SAMHSA National Survey on Drug Use and Health,
49.4 percent of children aged 6-17 with a mental health condition
did not receive treatment as of 2022.

(4) The United States has fewer than 14 child and adolescent
psychiatrists per 100,000 children, and more than 70 percent of
counties have zero child psychiatrists, according to the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023).

(5) The national student-to-school-psychologist ratio is
1,127 to 1, more than double the recommended ratio of
500 to 1, according to the National Association of School
Psychologists (2022).

(6) Only 58 percent of Medicaid-enrolled children receive
required EPSDT screenings, and no State has lost federal
Medicaid funding for failure to meet EPSDT mental health
obligations, according to CMS Form 416 data (2022).

(7) Untreated childhood mental illness costs the United States
an estimated $247 billion annually in healthcare, education,
and lost productivity, according to the National Research Council
and Institute of Medicine (2009, adjusted for inflation).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual basis for congressional action with current, specific data from authoritative federal sources, creating a legislative record to support judicial review
- **Section 4 (Workforce Program)**: Addresses the most binding constraint--workforce shortage--through a three-pronged approach: loan repayment for existing professionals, a new Child Mental Health Specialist category for faster pipeline, and fellowship expansion for long-term supply
- **Section 5 (EPSDT Enforcement)**: Transforms EPSDT from an unenforced entitlement to a functional system with specific, measurable benchmarks and graduated enforcement. The 80% of Medicare rate floor addresses the reimbursement gap that drives providers away from Medicaid
- **Section 6 (Collaborative Care)**: Extends the workforce by enabling primary care practices to deliver behavioral health services, leveraging the most extensively studied integration model
- **Section 7 (School Staffing)**: Uses enhanced FMAP and grants to incentivize states to meet professional staffing standards, reaching children through the most accessible access point
- **Section 8 (ACE Screening)**: Shifts the system toward prevention by identifying children at risk before conditions become severe
- **Section 10 (Appropriations)**: Ramps funding over 5 years to allow infrastructure to build, reaching $25 billion by Year 5--approximately $340 per child per year

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 90 days after enactment | N/A |
| CMS publishes proposed EPSDT enforcement rules | 12 months after enactment | CMS |
| Pediatric collaborative care billing codes established | 12 months after enactment | CMS |
| NHSC Child Mental Health Workforce Program accepting applications | 6 months after enactment | HRSA |
| Child Mental Health Specialist certification standards published | 18 months after enactment | HHS |
| CMS publishes final EPSDT enforcement rules | 18 months after enactment | CMS |
| State compliance plans due | 24 months after enactment | State Medicaid agencies |
| EPSDT enforcement begins | 36 months after enactment | CMS |
| First annual report to Congress | 12 months after enactment | HHS |

**Regulatory Authority**: HHS (through CMS, HRSA, and SAMHSA) has primary implementation authority. CMS regulates Medicaid compliance and billing codes. HRSA administers workforce programs. SAMHSA manages grant programs for school staffing and ACE screening.

**Challenges**:

- **State resistance to EPSDT enforcement**: States will argue that financial penalties for EPSDT non-compliance constitute an unfunded mandate, despite enhanced FMAP provisions. Legal challenges under *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012) are possible if penalties are deemed coercive
- **Workforce pipeline lag**: Even with aggressive investment, training new child psychiatrists takes 5-13 years; the Child Mental Health Specialist category is designed to address this gap but will face scope-of-practice objections from existing professional groups
- **Appropriations risk**: Authorization does not guarantee appropriation; annual funding levels will be subject to budget negotiations

**Refinements**:

- **Add maintenance-of-effort requirement**: Require states to maintain current spending levels to prevent substitution of federal funds for existing state investment
- **Include telehealth provisions**: Explicitly authorize interstate telehealth practice for child mental health professionals under the workforce program
- **Strengthen data collection**: Require CMS to collect and publish disaggregated data on EPSDT compliance by race, ethnicity, geography, and foster care status

## State Model Legislation

### Model School Mental Health Staffing Act

**Purpose**: Establish minimum school mental health staffing ratios at the state level, ensuring all students have access to school-based mental health professionals.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should adjust timelines based on current staffing levels, available workforce, and fiscal capacity. States with very low current ratios may require a longer implementation period (8-10 years rather than 5). Rural states should include provisions for shared services, itinerant professionals, and telehealth.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] School
Mental Health Staffing Act of 2025".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(1) An estimated 80 percent of children who receive mental health
services access them through schools.

(2) The current student-to-school-psychologist ratio in [State]
is [X:1], exceeding the national recommended ratio of 500:1.

(3) Evidence-based school mental health programs improve academic
outcomes, reduce disciplinary referrals, and decrease emergency
department utilization.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "School mental health professional" means a school psychologist,
school counselor, or school social worker licensed by the [State
licensing board].

(b) "Recommended staffing ratio" means:
    (1) For school psychologists: 1 per 500 students;
    (2) For school counselors: 1 per 250 students;
    (3) For school social workers: 1 per 250 students.

SECTION 4. STAFFING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) Each school district shall achieve the recommended staffing
ratios established in Section 3(b) within 7 years of the
effective date of this Act.

(b) Each school district shall submit an annual staffing plan
to the [State Department of Education] demonstrating progress
toward the recommended ratios.

(c) The [State Department of Education] shall publish an annual
report on school mental health staffing ratios by district.

SECTION 5. FUNDING.

(a) The [State] shall appropriate funds sufficient to support
districts in meeting the staffing requirements of Section 4,
including:
    (1) Direct grants to districts based on student enrollment
    and current staffing deficits;
    (2) Loan forgiveness for school mental health professionals
    who serve in high-need districts for not less than 3 years; and
    (3) Partnerships with institutions of higher education to
    expand training programs.

(b) Districts may use federal funds received under Title IV-A of
the Every Student Succeeds Act, Medicaid school-based services
reimbursement, and other applicable federal programs to supplement
State funding.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on July 1, [Year].
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Health and Human Services (CMS, HRSA, SAMHSA)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **EPSDT Mental Health Enforcement Standards**: CMS must promulgate regulations defining screening rate benchmarks, timely access standards, network adequacy requirements, and progressive enforcement procedures. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment
2. **Pediatric Collaborative Care Billing Codes**: CMS must establish new CPT-equivalent codes for pediatric collaborative care services under Medicare and Medicaid. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment
3. **Child Mental Health Specialist Certification Standards**: HHS must define education, training, supervision, and scope-of-practice requirements for the new Child Mental Health Specialist category. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment
4. **Medicaid Rate Floor Implementation**: CMS must issue guidance on calculating the 80% of Medicare rate floor for child behavioral health services, including adjustment methodology for states with managed care delivery systems. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: CMS may reduce federal administrative matching by up to 5% for states failing EPSDT benchmarks after technical assistance and corrective action
- **Administrative Actions**: CMS may require corrective action plans, enhanced reporting, and independent compliance reviews
- **Private Right of Action**: Existing Medicaid beneficiary rights under 42 U.S.C. 1983 remain available; the Act preserves the ability of Medicaid-enrolled children and their families to seek judicial enforcement of EPSDT mental health obligations
- **State Attorney General Enforcement**: State AGs retain authority to enforce parity requirements and platform safety obligations within their jurisdictions

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: The core provisions of the Act operate through Medicaid, a cooperative federalism program funded under Congress's Spending Clause authority. The EPSDT enforcement provisions attach conditions to the receipt of federal Medicaid funds. Under *South Dakota v. Dole* (1987) and *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012), such conditions must be clearly stated, related to the federal interest in the program, and not coercive. The 5% administrative cost reduction is designed to be proportionate and non-coercive--significantly less than the total withdrawal of Medicaid funding that the Court found coercive in *NFIB*.

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Social media platform regulation (referenced in companion KOSA legislation) relies on the Commerce Clause, as platforms operate in interstate and international commerce. Platform design requirements (duty of care, default privacy) regulate commercial conduct rather than speech content, strengthening the constitutional basis.

**Tenth Amendment / State Sovereignty**: The school staffing provisions use incentive-based conditional funding rather than direct mandates on states, consistent with the anti-commandeering doctrine of *New York v. United States* (1992) and *Printz v. United States* (1997). States are not required to participate but receive enhanced FMAP if they do.

### Preemption

The Act does not preempt state laws that provide greater protections or more expansive services for children's mental health. States remain free to adopt higher staffing ratios, more stringent EPSDT standards, or additional social media regulations beyond federal requirements. Express savings clauses preserve state authority.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through multiple mechanisms: CMS monitoring of EPSDT data (Form 416 and enhanced reporting); HRSA oversight of workforce program participants; GAO biennial evaluations; annual reporting to Congress; and preserved private rights of action under existing Medicaid law. The graduated enforcement approach (technical assistance, corrective action, financial consequences) is modeled on CMS's existing compliance framework for other Medicaid requirements.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| EPSDT screening counted without meaningful follow-up | States could inflate screening numbers by counting brief, perfunctory screenings that do not lead to referral or treatment, technically meeting the 90% benchmark while failing to identify children in need | High | Define "screening" in regulation to require use of validated instruments (e.g., PSC, PHQ-A) with documented follow-up for positive screens; track screening-to-treatment conversion rates |
| Medicaid rate floor calculated on nominal rates | States could set Medicare-equivalent rates at 80% but impose administrative barriers (prior authorization, documentation requirements) that effectively reduce reimbursement below the floor | High | Prohibit prior authorization for initial mental health assessments and require that administrative burden for behavioral health not exceed that for medical/surgical services, consistent with parity law |
| School staffing ratios met through part-time or shared positions | Districts could count part-time or itinerant professionals at their full FTE value, technically meeting ratios while leaving schools without adequate coverage | Medium | Define ratios in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions dedicated to mental health functions, excluding time spent on administrative tasks, testing coordination, or college counseling |
| Workforce program participants exit underserved areas after obligation | Loan repayment recipients fulfill their 5-year service obligation and immediately relocate to higher-paying settings, providing only temporary relief | Medium | Offer retention bonuses for years 6-10 of service; structure loan repayment to back-load larger payments in later years; create career advancement pathways within underserved settings |
| ACE screening triggers punitive child welfare responses | Families may be deterred from participating in ACE screening if positive results are reported to child protective services, particularly in communities with historical over-surveillance | High | Establish explicit statutory separation between ACE screening for prevention purposes and mandatory reporting obligations; screen results are confidential health information, not evidence of abuse absent independent indicators |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Workforce pipeline lag | Even with maximum investment, training new child psychiatrists takes 5-13 years; the shortage cannot be eliminated within one legislative cycle | Structural: medical education pipeline is inherently long | Child Mental Health Specialist category (2-year training) and collaborative care provide shorter-term workforce expansion while the physician pipeline grows |
| Appropriations vulnerability | Authorized funding levels may not be appropriated; annual budget negotiations could reduce or eliminate program funding | Political: appropriations are annual and subject to partisan dynamics | Build bipartisan support; structure programs to demonstrate measurable results within 2-3 years; include mandatory spending where politically feasible |
| Geographic maldistribution persists | Loan repayment incentives may be insufficient to attract professionals to the most remote and underserved areas | Structural: quality-of-life factors beyond compensation affect workforce location decisions | Supplement financial incentives with telehealth infrastructure, professional development, and community supports; authorize rural practice fellowships |
| Cultural competency gap | Expanding the workforce without diversifying it may not close disparities for Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and LGBTQ+ youth | Structural: the mental health workforce does not reflect the demographic diversity of the child population | Require training programs to include cultural competency curriculum; prioritize loan repayment for professionals from underrepresented backgrounds; fund HBCUs and minority-serving institutions |
| Insurance industry resistance to parity | Insurers may comply with the letter of rate reforms while continuing to maintain narrow networks through other administrative barriers | Political economy: insurance industry lobbying influence exceeds that of children's mental health advocates | Strengthen DOL and CMS parity enforcement; require regular network adequacy audits; impose penalties for out-of-network utilization ratios exceeding 2:1 |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen screening quality standards**: Amend Section 5 to require CMS to define validated screening instruments and establish a minimum screening-to-treatment conversion rate as a compliance metric
2. **Close administrative burden loophole**: Add provision requiring that Medicaid prior authorization, documentation, and utilization review requirements for child behavioral health services not exceed those for comparable medical/surgical services, per MHPAEA
3. **Define FTE for staffing ratios**: Amend Section 7 to define staffing ratios in terms of full-time equivalent positions dedicated to direct mental health service delivery, with no more than 25% of time allocated to administrative or non-clinical duties
4. **Protect ACE screening confidentiality**: Add provision establishing that ACE screening results are protected health information under HIPAA and may not be disclosed to child welfare authorities absent independent evidence meeting mandatory reporting thresholds
5. **Require workforce diversity reporting**: Add requirement that HRSA report annually on the demographic composition of workforce program participants by race, ethnicity, language, and geographic setting

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Act authorizes appropriations for 5 fiscal years (FY2026-FY2030), after which reauthorization is required. This ensures congressional review of program effectiveness before continued funding. GAO is required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation in Year 4 to inform the reauthorization debate. EPSDT enforcement provisions, once in regulation, are not subject to sunset--they become part of the ongoing Medicaid compliance framework. Workforce programs that demonstrate positive retention and access outcomes in GAO evaluation should be reauthorized with expanded funding.
