# Mental Health Policy: Solutions

Reforming the U.S. mental health system requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the structural failures documented in the preceding analyses: chronic underfunding, workforce shortages, insurance parity violations, a fractured crisis system, deteriorating youth mental health, and the criminalization of serious mental illness. The solutions below are designed to work in concert, with each reinforcing the others toward a system in which every American can access timely, effective, and affordable mental health care.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- **Parity in practice, not just on paper**: Enforce existing parity law rigorously before layering on new mandates; close the gap between legal requirements and insurer behavior.
- **Workforce-first investment**: No system reform succeeds without the providers to deliver care; training pipeline expansion and reimbursement reform must precede or accompany every access initiative.
- **Upstream prevention**: Invest in prevention and early intervention -- especially for children and adolescents -- to reduce the downstream burden of untreated illness on emergency rooms, jails, and shelters.
- **Integration over fragmentation**: Break down the artificial separation between mental health, substance use, and physical health services, and consolidate fragmented funding streams wherever possible.
- **Accountability through data**: Require transparent, public reporting of outcomes, access metrics, and spending across all payers and programs so that failures are visible and correctable.
- **Equity as a design requirement**: Every reform must be evaluated for its impact on racial, ethnic, geographic, and income disparities in access and outcomes.

### Theory of Change

The mental health system fails because of mutually reinforcing structural problems: inadequate funding produces workforce shortages, which produce access gaps, which push people into crisis, which generates emergency and criminal justice costs that dwarf the cost of preventive treatment but are borne by different budgets. Breaking this cycle requires simultaneous action on multiple fronts: enforce parity to unlock private insurance capacity, invest federal dollars to expand the workforce and crisis system, integrate behavioral health into primary care and schools, and create accountability mechanisms that make system performance visible to policymakers and the public. Early wins -- particularly parity enforcement and crisis system investment -- generate savings that build the political case for sustained investment.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Rigorous Parity Enforcement and Transparency

**Description**: Transform the enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) from a paper obligation into a functioning regulatory system. This requires tripling the Department of Labor's parity enforcement staff, mandating annual comparative analyses by all health plans demonstrating that non-quantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs) are applied no more stringently to behavioral health than to medical/surgical services, requiring public disclosure of denial rates by service category, and creating a private right of action allowing patients to sue for parity violations with attorney's fees.

The 2023 proposed MHPAEA rules strengthened NQTL requirements but left enforcement resources insufficient. This solution addresses the root cause identified in 04-root-causes.md: the enforcement gap that has allowed insurers to violate parity for over 15 years.

**Evidence Base**: Between 2010 and 2023, the DOL issued fewer than 50 formal parity enforcement actions despite widespread violations (DOL Annual Reports). Out-of-network use for behavioral health is 5.4 times higher than for medical/surgical services (Milliman, 2023), and prior authorization denial rates for mental health services are approximately double those for medical/surgical claims (NAMI, 2023). States with active parity enforcement -- notably New York, California, and Illinois -- have demonstrated that audits and penalties produce measurable improvements in insurer compliance (NAIC, 2023).

**Implementation**: Congress amends the MHPAEA to require annual comparative analysis submissions, authorize DOL to impose civil monetary penalties (up to $10,000 per violation per day), and create a private right of action. DOL hires 200 additional compliance auditors and establishes a dedicated Parity Enforcement Office. HHS issues standardized reporting templates for comparative analyses within 12 months of enactment.

**Cost/Resources**: Approximately $150 million annually for expanded DOL enforcement staff and systems. This is expected to be revenue-positive as civil monetary penalties and increased insurer compliance reduce Medicaid and Medicare spending on services that commercial plans should cover.

**Timeline**: Legislation and initial rule-making in Years 1-2; full compliance auditing by Year 3; measurable improvement in network adequacy and denial rate parity by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Insurance industry lobbying will be intense. Opponents will argue that enforcement costs will be passed through as higher premiums. The DOL will need to build new analytical capacity to evaluate NQTL comparative analyses.

**Impact Metrics**: Reduction in the out-of-network utilization gap between behavioral health and medical/surgical services (from 5.4x to below 2.0x within 5 years); reduction in behavioral health prior authorization denial rate disparity; increase in in-network behavioral health providers per plan.

### Solution 2: Mental Health Workforce Expansion Act

**Description**: Launch a comprehensive federal initiative to expand the mental health workforce through four pillars: (1) increase Graduate Medical Education (GME) funding for 1,000 new psychiatry residency slots over 5 years; (2) establish a National Mental Health Service Corps modeled on the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) that provides full tuition and loan repayment for psychologists, social workers, counselors, and psychiatric nurse practitioners who commit to 4 years of service in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas; (3) fund 200 new training programs for certified peer support specialists with Medicaid reimbursement in all 50 states; (4) create a federal incentive program for states that adopt full practice authority for psychiatric nurse practitioners and prescriptive authority for psychologists.

**Evidence Base**: HRSA projects a shortage of 14,000 psychiatrists by 2030 (AAMC, 2023). The existing NHSC mental health program has a 75% retention rate in underserved areas after the service commitment ends (HRSA, 2022). States with full practice authority for psychiatric NPs have 30% more mental health prescribers per capita in rural areas (AANP, 2023). Peer support specialists have been shown to reduce hospitalization and improve engagement in treatment (Chinman et al., *Psychiatric Services*, 2014).

**Implementation**: Congress authorizes the Workforce Expansion Act with mandatory appropriations to insulate funding from the annual appropriations process. HRSA administers the Service Corps and GME expansion. CMS issues guidance requiring all state Medicaid programs to cover peer support specialist services within 2 years. States receive enhanced federal matching funds (90/10 FMAP) for the first 3 years of expanded peer support coverage.

**Cost/Resources**: Approximately $3 billion annually at full implementation. GME expansion: $1.2 billion/year. Service Corps: $1.0 billion/year. Peer support training and Medicaid coverage: $500 million/year. State incentive grants: $300 million/year.

**Timeline**: Authorization and initial funding in Year 1. First cohort of Service Corps participants begins practice in Year 3. Full GME expansion realized by Year 7 (given residency training length). Peer support coverage in all states by Year 3.

**Challenges**: GME funding expansion is politically complex because it involves the physician lobby and hospital funding formulas. Scope-of-practice reform faces organized opposition from physician specialty groups at the state level. Recruiting providers to rural and underserved areas requires sustained incentives beyond initial loan repayment.

**Impact Metrics**: Reduction in Mental Health Professional Shortage Area designations by 50% within 10 years; increase in active psychiatrists from ~37,000 to ~50,000; elimination of the rural-urban provider ratio gap (from 6.4 vs. 26.3 per 100,000 to at least 15 per 100,000 in rural areas).

### Solution 3: National Crisis System Investment

**Description**: Build a comprehensive crisis continuum that makes the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline function as reliably as the 911 system, with three essential components in every community: (1) 24/7 crisis call/text/chat centers with air-traffic-control-style capacity to dispatch resources; (2) mobile crisis teams that respond to mental health emergencies in the field, diverting people from law enforcement and emergency departments; and (3) crisis stabilization units (short-stay facilities of up to 23 hours or up to 7 days) that provide immediate treatment in a therapeutic setting. Fund this system through a combination of federal grants, Medicaid reimbursement for crisis services, and a dedicated telecom surcharge modeled on 911 funding.

**Evidence Base**: The 988 Lifeline handled 5.7 million contacts in 2023, up from 3.6 million in 2021 (SAMHSA, 2024), but only ~50% of the U.S. population has access to a mobile crisis team (NASMHPD, 2024), and crisis stabilization capacity is roughly one-third of the SAMHSA-recommended level. Georgia's crisis system -- widely regarded as the national model -- operates crisis stabilization units in every region and has documented a 75% diversion rate from emergency departments and a 65% diversion rate from incarceration (Georgia DBHDD, 2023). Medicaid reimbursement for mobile crisis services was enabled by the American Rescue Plan Act (2021) at a 85% federal match for the first 3 years.

**Implementation**: Congress appropriates $5 billion over 5 years for crisis system infrastructure grants. CMS makes Medicaid reimbursement for crisis services (call centers, mobile teams, stabilization units) a mandatory Medicaid benefit rather than optional. The FCC authorizes a monthly telecom surcharge of $0.50-$1.00 per line (similar to existing 911 surcharges) to provide sustainable funding. SAMHSA establishes national standards for crisis services staffing, response times (mobile team arrival within 60 minutes in urban areas, 90 minutes in rural), and outcomes reporting.

**Cost/Resources**: $5 billion in federal infrastructure grants over 5 years; ongoing operational costs of approximately $4 billion annually (shared among federal grants, Medicaid, and telecom surcharge revenue). The telecom surcharge alone would generate $2-4 billion annually based on approximately 400 million active phone lines.

**Timeline**: Legislation and initial grants in Year 1; crisis stabilization units operational in 25 states by Year 3; full national coverage by Year 5; mobile crisis teams available to 90% of the population by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Telecom surcharge faces industry opposition. Medicaid mandatory benefit expansion requires Congressional action. Workforce for mobile crisis teams must be recruited and trained simultaneously. Rural response time standards will require creative solutions including telehealth-augmented models.

**Impact Metrics**: 988 Lifeline answer rate above 95% (currently 87%); mobile crisis team availability to 90%+ of population (currently ~50%); ED psychiatric boarding reduced by 50%; law enforcement responses to mental health calls reduced by 40%.

### Solution 4: Youth Mental Health Prevention and Early Intervention

**Description**: Establish a comprehensive federal-state partnership to address the youth mental health crisis through three strategies: (1) fund school-based mental health services to achieve the recommended 1:250 student-to-counselor ratio in all public schools, with embedded licensed clinicians providing therapy and assessment; (2) mandate and fund universal mental health screening at pediatric well-child visits and in schools at key developmental transitions (entering kindergarten, middle school, and high school); (3) regulate social media platforms to require age verification, prohibit manipulative design features targeting minors (infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications for children under 16), and mandate algorithmic transparency for content delivered to users under 18.

**Evidence Base**: The national student-to-counselor ratio is 1:385, far above the 1:250 recommendation, with only 3 states meeting the standard (ASCA, 2023). School-based mental health services have been shown to increase access by 60% among low-income students who would not otherwise receive care (Hoover et al., *School Psychology Review*, 2019). Universal screening identifies at-risk youth 2-3 years earlier than self-referral (Richardson et al., *Pediatrics*, 2010). The U.S. Surgeon General's 2023 advisory specifically recommended age verification, design regulation, and algorithmic transparency for social media platforms. Internal Meta research showed that Instagram worsened body image for 32% of teenage girls (Wall Street Journal, 2021).

**Implementation**: Congress authorizes the Youth Mental Health Act with mandatory funding for school-based services distributed through an enhanced Title I formula. HHS issues screening protocols and providers receive Medicaid reimbursement for screenings. The FTC, in coordination with a new Digital Safety Commission, issues rules on age verification, manipulative design, and algorithmic transparency with enforcement authority and civil penalties.

**Cost/Resources**: School-based services: approximately $10 billion annually to hire an estimated 100,000 additional school counselors and clinicians nationally. Screening program: $500 million annually (largely covered by existing insurance mandates once established). Social media regulation: minimal federal cost; compliance costs borne by platforms.

**Timeline**: School-based funding authorized in Year 1 with first hires in Year 2; screening mandate phased in over 3 years; social media regulations proposed within 18 months, final rules by Year 3.

**Challenges**: School-based services require a workforce that does not yet exist in sufficient numbers (linked to Solution 2). Social media regulation faces First Amendment challenges and intense industry lobbying. Screening programs must be paired with treatment access to avoid identifying problems without offering solutions.

**Impact Metrics**: National student-to-counselor ratio at or below 1:250 within 7 years; youth (12-17) treatment gap reduced from 58.4% to below 30% within 10 years; reversal of the upward trend in adolescent persistent sadness/hopelessness (from 42% back toward 30% or below).

### Solution 5: Integrated Behavioral Health in Primary Care

**Description**: Scale the Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) -- in which a primary care provider, a behavioral health care manager, and a consulting psychiatrist work together to treat depression, anxiety, and other common conditions in the primary care setting -- to reach at least 50% of primary care practices nationwide. This involves increasing Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement for CoCM billing codes (CMS codes 99492, 99493, 99494), providing startup grants for practices transitioning to the model, and training 25,000 behavioral health care managers over 5 years.

**Evidence Base**: The Collaborative Care Model is the most extensively studied integration model, with over 90 randomized controlled trials demonstrating superior outcomes for depression and anxiety compared to usual care (Archer et al., *Cochrane Database*, 2012). The IMPACT trial showed that CoCM produces a 50% greater improvement in depression outcomes than usual primary care (Unutzer et al., *JAMA*, 2002). CMS began reimbursing CoCM codes in 2017, but adoption remains below 5% of primary care practices due to low reimbursement rates and implementation complexity (APA, 2023).

**Implementation**: CMS increases CoCM reimbursement rates by 30% for Medicare and requires state Medicaid programs to cover CoCM codes at parity with Medicare rates. HRSA provides $500 million in startup grants for practice transformation. The National Council for Mental Wellbeing, in partnership with HRSA, establishes 50 regional training centers for behavioral health care managers.

**Cost/Resources**: CMS reimbursement increases: approximately $2 billion annually once scaled. Startup grants: $500 million over 5 years. Training centers: $250 million over 5 years. Total incremental cost is expected to be partially offset by reduced emergency department use and hospitalization.

**Timeline**: CMS reimbursement increase effective within 1 year of legislation. Startup grants begin Year 1; practice transformation takes 2-3 years per practice. Target of 50% adoption reached by Year 7-10.

**Challenges**: Primary care practices -- especially small and rural ones -- lack the administrative infrastructure to implement CoCM without significant support. Behavioral health care managers are a new workforce category that must be trained. Psychiatrist time for case consultation is constrained by existing shortages.

**Impact Metrics**: CoCM adoption in primary care practices increases from below 5% to 50%; depression treatment response rates in participating practices improve by 40%; behavioral health ED visits from patients in CoCM practices reduced by 25%.

### Solution 6: Serious Mental Illness Reform -- Housing, Treatment, and Diversion

**Description**: Address the crisis of untreated serious mental illness through three integrated strategies: (1) fund 100,000 new permanent supportive housing (PSH) units dedicated to people with serious mental illness, pairing housing with wraparound services; (2) expand Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams -- intensive, mobile, multidisciplinary treatment teams that serve people with the most severe conditions in the community -- to achieve SAMHSA's recommended coverage; (3) establish mental health diversion programs in every jurisdiction with a jail population exceeding 500, including pre-booking diversion by co-responder teams and post-booking diversion through mental health courts.

**Evidence Base**: Permanent supportive housing reduces homelessness among people with SMI by 80% and produces net savings of $16,000-$31,000 per person per year by reducing emergency, hospital, and criminal justice costs (Culhane et al., *Housing Policy Debate*, 2002; National Academies, 2018). ACT teams reduce hospitalization by 60% and incarceration by 50% for participants (Bond et al., *Psychiatric Services*, 2001). Mental health courts reduce recidivism by 20% compared to traditional criminal processing (McNiel & Binder, *American Journal of Psychiatry*, 2007). New York's Kendra's Law AOT program reduced hospitalization by 77% and arrest by 83% among participants (Duke University, 2009).

**Implementation**: Congress appropriates $10 billion over 5 years for PSH construction and operating subsidies through HUD, with a requirement that all units include behavioral health service linkages funded through Medicaid. SAMHSA establishes ACT team expansion grants. DOJ administers diversion program grants through the Bureau of Justice Assistance. States receive enhanced Medicaid matching funds for ACT services during the first 5 years.

**Cost/Resources**: PSH: $10 billion over 5 years (capital and operating). ACT expansion: $1.5 billion annually. Diversion programs: $500 million annually. Total: approximately $4.5 billion/year at full implementation, with significant offsets from reduced incarceration, hospitalization, and emergency services.

**Timeline**: First PSH units operational by Year 2; ACT expansion grants awarded in Year 1 with teams operational by Year 2; diversion programs in all large jails by Year 3; full PSH target reached by Year 7.

**Challenges**: PSH construction faces local opposition (NIMBYism), zoning barriers, and labor/material costs. ACT team staffing requires psychiatrists and other professionals who are in short supply. Diversion programs require cooperation between criminal justice and behavioral health systems that often operate independently.

**Impact Metrics**: 50% reduction in people with SMI experiencing homelessness (from ~120,000 to ~60,000); 40% reduction in people with SMI booked into jail annually (from ~2 million to ~1.2 million); increase in ACT team coverage from approximately 25% to 75% of the population with SMI.

### Solution 7: Medicaid Mental Health Modernization

**Description**: Reform Medicaid -- the single largest payer for mental health services -- through three structural changes: (1) repeal or substantially reform the IMD exclusion to allow Medicaid reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care in facilities of all sizes for adults ages 21-64, with quality and length-of-stay safeguards; (2) increase Medicaid reimbursement rates for behavioral health services to at least 80% of Medicare rates, with federal incentive payments to states that meet the target; (3) make Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) a permanent, nationwide Medicaid benefit.

**Evidence Base**: The IMD exclusion has constrained inpatient psychiatric capacity for over 50 years; 45 states have sought Section 1115 waivers to partially bypass it (KFF, 2024). Medicaid behavioral health reimbursement averages 70% of Medicare and 47% of commercial rates (Milliman, 2023), driving providers out of Medicaid networks. CCBHCs -- which provide comprehensive, integrated mental health and substance use services with no one turned away -- have demonstrated 24% reductions in ED visits and 18% reductions in hospitalization in SAMHSA demonstration states (SAMHSA, 2023).

**Implementation**: Congress amends Title XIX of the Social Security Act to remove the IMD exclusion for short-term stays (up to 60 days) and requires CMS to establish quality standards for participating facilities. CMS establishes a behavioral health reimbursement rate floor and provides enhanced FMAP (80/20) for states meeting the target during the first 5 years. Congress permanently authorizes the CCBHC program with mandatory Medicaid coverage and prospective payment methodology.

**Cost/Resources**: IMD exclusion reform: estimated $3-5 billion annually in additional Medicaid federal spending, partially offset by reduced ED boarding and incarceration costs. Reimbursement rate increase: approximately $5 billion annually in enhanced federal matching. CCBHC expansion: approximately $2 billion annually. Total: $10-12 billion/year in additional federal Medicaid spending.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; CMS rulemaking in Year 2; IMD exclusion reform effective Year 2; reimbursement rate targets phased in over 3 years; CCBHC expansion nationwide by Year 5.

**Challenges**: IMD exclusion reform must include safeguards against re-institutionalization. States may resist reimbursement rate mandates as unfunded mandates without enhanced FMAP. CCBHC expansion requires a workforce that must be developed simultaneously. Total cost is substantial and requires political will.

**Impact Metrics**: Increase in inpatient psychiatric bed availability by 20%; reduction in Medicaid behavioral health out-of-network use; CCBHC coverage available in every state; psychiatric ED boarding times reduced by 50%.

### Solution 8: Mental Health Data Infrastructure and Accountability

**Description**: Create a national mental health data infrastructure that enables transparent tracking of system performance across all payers, providers, and programs. This includes: (1) a national mental health dashboard with standardized metrics reported by every state; (2) mandatory insurer reporting of behavioral health denial rates, network adequacy ratios, and average time to appointment; (3) linkage of mental health outcome data across healthcare, criminal justice, homelessness, and education systems to enable whole-system evaluation.

**Evidence Base**: The mental health system currently has no comprehensive, real-time data system comparable to those for infectious disease surveillance or hospital quality reporting. SAMHSA's National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) provides annual prevalence data but not system performance metrics. The 988 Lifeline dashboard offers a partial model of real-time crisis system monitoring (SAMHSA, 2024). The UK's NHS Benchmarking Network provides an international model of comprehensive mental health system performance reporting.

**Implementation**: Congress authorizes a National Mental Health Performance Dashboard administered by SAMHSA in coordination with CMS, DOL, and HUD. All states, insurers, and federally funded programs are required to report standardized metrics quarterly. SAMHSA develops the dashboard within 2 years of enactment. Data are publicly available with appropriate privacy protections.

**Cost/Resources**: Approximately $200 million for initial dashboard development and $50 million annually for operation and maintenance. Insurer and state reporting compliance costs estimated at $100-200 million annually across all reporting entities.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; dashboard development in Years 1-2; initial data reporting by Year 3; full system operational by Year 4.

**Challenges**: Data linkage across systems (health, justice, housing, education) raises privacy concerns that require careful legal and technical solutions. States and insurers will resist new reporting mandates. Standardizing metrics across 50 states and multiple payer types is technically complex.

**Impact Metrics**: Publicly available performance data for all 50 states by Year 4; identification of the 10 worst-performing states on key access metrics with targeted improvement plans; insurer parity compliance measurable and publicly reported.

## International Models

### United Kingdom: NHS Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)

**Description**: Launched in 2008, IAPT provides evidence-based psychological therapies (primarily Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) through the National Health Service, with a target of treating 900,000 people per year by 2015, later expanded to 1.5 million by 2021. The program uses a stepped-care model: guided self-help and computerized CBT for mild-to-moderate conditions, and individual therapy for moderate-to-severe cases.

**Results**: IAPT has treated over 8 million people since launch, achieving recovery rates of 50% for those completing treatment (NHS Digital, 2023). Average wait times for initial assessment are below 6 weeks. The program has been credited with reducing disability benefit claims and increasing employment among participants (Clark, *Annual Review of Clinical Psychology*, 2018).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The U.S. could adapt the stepped-care, high-volume model through CCBHCs and the Collaborative Care Model. Key barriers include the fragmented insurance system (IAPT is funded by a single payer), the lack of a standardized outcome measurement system, and workforce constraints. A U.S. adaptation would need to operate across multiple payers with standardized protocols.

### Australia: Better Access Program and Headspace Centers

**Description**: Australia's Better Access program provides Medicare-funded psychological therapy (up to 20 sessions per year, recently expanded from 10) for people with diagnosed mental health conditions, delivered by psychologists, social workers, and occupational therapists with a GP referral. Headspace is a national network of youth mental health centers (ages 12-25) providing early intervention in accessible, youth-friendly settings.

**Results**: Better Access significantly increased access to psychological therapy, reaching over 3.4 million Australians in 2022-2023 (AIHW, 2023). Headspace has grown to over 150 centers and has demonstrated improvements in psychological distress and functional outcomes for young people (Rickwood et al., *Medical Journal of Australia*, 2019).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Headspace model is directly adaptable as a federally funded youth mental health center network, potentially co-located with schools or community centers. Better Access demonstrates that insurance coverage of psychological therapy significantly increases utilization and reduces the treatment gap. The U.S. would need to address reimbursement rate adequacy (Australia's rates are higher relative to cost of living than U.S. Medicaid rates) and workforce availability.

### Canada (Ontario): Structured Psychotherapy Program

**Description**: Ontario launched a provincial program providing publicly funded Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and related therapies delivered by trained therapists in community settings, modeled on the UK's IAPT. The program uses standardized outcome measurement and stepped care.

**Results**: Early evaluation showed treatment completion rates of 65% and clinically significant improvement in 48% of completers (Mowbray et al., *Canadian Journal of Psychiatry*, 2023). The program demonstrated feasibility of adapting the IAPT model to a North American health system context.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Ontario's experience shows that the IAPT model can work in a North American context with fee-for-service insurance elements. The U.S. adaptation would benefit from Ontario's implementation lessons regarding therapist training, quality assurance, and integration with existing health services.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs)**: The SAMHSA CCBHC demonstration, authorized by the Excellence in Mental Health Act (2014) and expanded in 2020 and 2022, operates in over 500 clinics across 46 states. Results show 24% reduction in ED visits, 18% reduction in hospitalization, and improved access for uninsured and underinsured populations (SAMHSA, 2023).

- **Georgia Crisis System**: Georgia's comprehensive crisis system -- with regional crisis stabilization units, mobile crisis teams, and a centralized crisis line -- diverts 75% of people from emergency departments and 65% from incarceration. It serves as the national model for crisis continuum development (Georgia DBHDD, 2023).

- **Colorado 988 Funding via Telecom Surcharge**: Colorado enacted a dedicated telecom surcharge to fund 988 crisis services, providing a sustainable, non-appropriations funding model. The surcharge generates approximately $30 million annually (Colorado BHA, 2024).

- **New York Kendra's Law (AOT)**: Since 1999, New York's Assisted Outpatient Treatment program has served over 10,000 individuals with serious mental illness, reducing hospitalization by 77%, homelessness by 74%, and arrest by 83% among participants (Duke University, 2009; NY OMH, 2023).

## Complementary Policies

The success of mental health reform depends on progress in related policy areas:

- **Housing policy**: Permanent supportive housing for people with SMI requires coordination with HUD, zoning reform, and increased federal housing investment. See [Housing](../housing/07-solutions.md).
- **Criminal justice reform**: Diversion programs, mental health courts, and reentry services require changes in policing, prosecution, and sentencing practices. See [Justice](../justice/07-solutions.md).
- **Healthcare reform**: Mental health parity enforcement and Medicaid expansion are inseparable from broader insurance reform and healthcare access policy. See [Healthcare](../healthcare/07-solutions.md).
- **Education policy**: School-based mental health services require integration with education funding formulas, teacher training, and school infrastructure policy. See [Education](../education/07-solutions.md).
- **Technology regulation**: Social media regulation for youth mental health is part of the broader technology governance agenda. See [Technology](../technology/07-solutions.md).
- **Drug policy**: Mental health and substance use disorders frequently co-occur, and treatment systems must be integrated. See [Drugs](../drugs/07-solutions.md).
