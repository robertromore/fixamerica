# Mental Health Funding Systems: What You Can Do

Citizen engagement is essential to reforming mental health financing. Unlike many policy areas where industry lobbying dominates, mental health funding reform depends on the mobilization of people directly affected -- patients, families, providers, and communities -- because the populations most harmed by underfunding lack the organized political power and financial resources to compete with insurance industry lobbying ($163 million in federal lobbying in 2022) or fiscal conservatism that treats mental health as a discretionary luxury rather than a public health necessity.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the SAMHSA annual report on the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to understand the mental health treatment gap in your state: <https://www.samhsa.gov/data/release/2022-national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-releases>
- Follow the Kaiser Family Foundation's state mental health fact sheets to track spending and coverage data in your state: <https://www.kff.org/statedata/mental-health-and-substance-use-state-fact-sheets/>
- Review the Milliman parity reports to understand the gap between parity law and parity practice: <https://www.milliman.com/en/insight/addiction-and-mental-health-vs-physical-health-widening-disparities>
- Read your state's Mental Health Block Grant application (publicly available on the SAMHSA website) to see how federal mental health funds are allocated in your state

### Track Your Own Insurance Coverage

- Request a copy of your health plan's mental health benefit summary, including prior authorization requirements, visit limits, and provider network directory
- Compare your plan's mental health coverage terms to its medical/surgical coverage terms. If mental health has more restrictive requirements (higher copays, more prior authorization, narrower networks), this may be a parity violation
- If you experience a parity violation, file a complaint with your state insurance department and the federal DOL Employee Benefits Security Administration: <https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/ask-a-question/ask-ebsa>

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call or write your U.S. Senators and Representative to support CCBHC permanent authorization, strengthened parity enforcement, and IMD exclusion reform. The most effective time is during budget season (February-April) and when relevant legislation is under consideration.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS proposes changes to Medicaid behavioral health rules, SAMHSA issues block grant guidance, or DOL proposes parity enforcement regulations, submit public comments through Regulations.gov: <https://www.regulations.gov>
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Respond to local news coverage of mental health crises (ED boarding, homelessness, mass incarceration) by connecting the crisis to funding system failures. Editors prioritize letters that connect local issues to specific policy proposals.
- **Share Information**: Use social media to amplify data on the treatment gap (57.8% of adults with mental illness received no treatment in 2022), funding disparities (10:1 per capita spending variation across states), and parity violations.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a local mental health funding advocacy group that includes consumers, families, providers, law enforcement, and business leaders. Cross-sector coalitions are more effective than provider-only or patient-only groups.
- Host community forums with your state mental health authority director or county behavioral health administrator. Ask them to present their budget, explain how mental health funding flows in your community, and identify the specific funding gaps that prevent service expansion.
- Partner with your local NAMI affiliate to organize advocacy events. NAMI has over 600 local affiliates with established relationships with legislators: <https://www.nami.org/Find-Your-Local-NAMI>
- Work with your local hospital to document psychiatric ED boarding data. Emergency department boarding -- where psychiatric patients wait for hours or days because no inpatient beds are available -- is a visible, measurable consequence of funding inadequacy that resonates with policymakers and the public.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect with law enforcement agencies that are dealing with the consequences of untreated mental illness. Police chiefs, sheriffs, and county prosecutors are powerful messengers for mental health funding reform because they experience the downstream effects daily.
- Engage local business leaders through the National Business Group on Health or your local Chamber of Commerce. Employers bear an estimated $210 billion annually in lost productivity from untreated mental illness (NAMI, 2023) and have a direct financial interest in effective treatment.
- Coordinate with homelessness service organizations, reentry programs, and school mental health providers to present a unified front on funding needs.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During the annual federal budget process (February-April), when appropriations for SAMHSA and the Mental Health Block Grant are set
- When CCBHC authorization or reauthorization legislation is under consideration
- When your state legislature is debating state mental health budget allocations
- After a high-profile mental health crisis in your community (within 1-2 weeks, while attention is high)

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Mental Health Funding Reform -- CCBHC Authorization and Parity Enforcement

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge your support for
strengthening mental health funding systems. Specifically, I ask you to:

1. Co-sponsor legislation to permanently authorize Certified Community
   Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) as a Medicaid state plan option.
   CCBHCs have reduced emergency department visits by 18-25% and
   increased client access by 29% in demonstration states.

2. Support strengthened enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and
   Addiction Equity Act, including mandatory insurer reporting of
   non-quantitative treatment limitation comparisons.

3. Support reform of the Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion,
   which has blocked Medicaid reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care
   since 1965.

In our state, [insert state-specific data: per capita mental health spending,
treatment gap, number of CCBHCs, or a specific local issue]. These are
not abstract policy questions -- they affect [X number] of people in our
community who need mental health care and cannot access it.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling
to ask [Representative/Senator] [Name] to support permanent CCBHC
authorization and strengthened mental health parity enforcement. In our
state, [brief data point]. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to
co-sponsor these reforms. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Community Behavioral Health Clinic Enhancement and Expansion Act**: Permanently authorizes CCBHCs as a Medicaid state plan option. Contact the Senate Finance Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee members to support markup and floor votes.
- **MHPAEA enforcement amendments**: Support legislation requiring proactive NQTL comparative analysis, civil monetary penalties, and private right of action for parity violations. Contact the Senate HELP Committee and House Education and Workforce Committee.
- **IMD exclusion reform**: Support the Psychiatric Care Access Act or similar legislation to allow Medicaid payment for short-term acute psychiatric stabilization. Contact the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee.
- **988 sustainable funding legislation**: Support creating a dedicated telecommunications fee to fund the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and crisis response infrastructure.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support permanently authorizing Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics and expanding them to every community? If so, how will you fund this expansion?"
2. "The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act has been the law since 2008, but insurers still deny mental health claims at twice the rate of medical claims. What specific enforcement mechanisms would you support?"
3. "Our state spends [$X] per capita on mental health, compared to the national average of $135. What will you do to close this gap?"
4. "The IMD exclusion has prevented Medicaid from covering inpatient psychiatric care in hospitals with more than 16 beds since 1965. No comparable restriction exists for any other medical condition. Do you support reforming this exclusion?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who make specific funding commitments rather than general statements about "supporting mental health"
- Check whether candidates have co-sponsored CCBHC, parity enforcement, or IMD reform legislation
- Pay attention to candidates' positions on state Medicaid expansion, which directly affects mental health coverage for low-income populations
- Review candidates' positions on overall federal spending and whether they consider mental health investment a priority within fiscal constraints

## Professional Actions

- **For Mental Health Clinicians**: Join your professional association's advocacy efforts (APA, APA, NASW, AAMFT). Testify at state legislative hearings on reimbursement rate adequacy. Share de-identified data on client wait times, insurance denials, and uncompensated care with advocacy organizations. Consider joining or establishing a CCBHC in your community.
- **For Primary Care Providers**: Advocate for integrated behavioral health funding. Document the time and resources spent on mental health concerns that cannot be referred to behavioral health providers due to access barriers. Support collaborative care models that are reimbursable through Medicare (CoCM billing codes 99492-99494).
- **For Hospital Administrators**: Track and publicly report psychiatric ED boarding data. Advocate for IMD exclusion reform with your state hospital association. Explore CCBHC affiliation or partnership models.
- **For Employers and HR Professionals**: Audit your organization's health plan for parity compliance. Report parity violations to the DOL. Advocate for better mental health coverage as part of benefits negotiations with insurers. Support the National Business Group on Health's mental health initiatives.
- **For Attorneys**: Consider pro bono representation for parity violation cases. The private right of action under ERISA (for employer-sponsored plans) and state parity laws provides a mechanism for individual enforcement. The *Wit v. United Behavioral Health* case established important precedents for coverage determination challenges.
- **For Journalists**: Investigate local mental health funding data, including your county's per capita mental health spending, CCBHC availability, and ED boarding times. Compare your state's spending to peer states. FOIA requests to state mental health authorities can reveal how block grant funds are allocated.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing mental health funding with others, emphasize:

1. **The treatment gap is enormous and measurable**: 57.8% of adults with mental illness -- 28.5 million people -- received no treatment in 2022 (SAMHSA, 2022 NSDUH). This is not a vague problem; it is a specific, quantified failure of the funding system.
2. **Funding fragmentation costs more than reform**: The current system forces psychiatric patients into emergency departments (average 34-hour boarding, costing $2.2 billion annually per ACEP, 2022) and jails (~2 million people with SMI cycle through annually per Treatment Advocacy Center). These downstream costs exceed the cost of upstream investment.
3. **The CCBHC model works and has bipartisan support**: CCBHCs reduce ED visits by 18-25%, increase clients served by 29%, and operate in 46 states. Permanent authorization has had over 200 bipartisan co-sponsors in Congress.
4. **The IMD exclusion discriminates against mental illness**: No comparable restriction on Medicaid reimbursement exists for any other medical condition. Cancer hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and nursing homes of any size can receive Medicaid payment; only psychiatric facilities are excluded.
5. **State spending variation is unjustifiable**: Per capita state mental health spending ranges from $47 (Texas) to $468 (District of Columbia) -- a 10:1 ratio that reflects political choice, not clinical need (NRI/NASMHPD, FY2021).

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "We spend enough on mental health; the problem is waste" | The U.S. spends 5.5% of health expenditures on mental health vs. an estimated 13% burden of disease -- a 2.4x gap | Lancet Commission, 2018; SAMHSA NHED, 2023 |
| "Mental health parity law already fixed insurance coverage" | Out-of-network utilization for mental health is 5.4x higher than for medical/surgical services, indicating systematic network inadequacy despite parity law | Milliman, 2021 |
| "More spending won't help because there aren't enough providers" | Provider shortages are directly caused by low reimbursement rates (Medicaid pays 72% of Medicare for mental health); raising rates attracts providers | MACPAC, 2023 |
| "States should handle mental health without federal mandates" | State-only control has produced a 10:1 per capita spending variation with the lowest-spending states having the highest unmet need | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| "Repealing the IMD exclusion would bring back asylums" | The U.S. has 11.7 psychiatric beds per 100,000 people -- the lowest since before 1850. Targeted reform allows short-term stabilization, not long-term institutionalization | Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023 |
