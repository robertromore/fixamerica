# Mental Health Funding Systems: Overview

## Overview

The United States spent an estimated $280 billion on mental health and substance use disorder services in 2020, yet chronic underfunding, fragmented financing, and misaligned incentives leave millions of Americans without access to the care they need. Mental health funding flows through at least eight major channels -- Medicaid, Medicare, the Mental Health Block Grant, SAMHSA discretionary grants, state general funds, county appropriations, commercial insurance, and direct patient payments -- each with its own eligibility rules, reimbursement rates, reporting requirements, and political dynamics. No single entity is responsible for ensuring that the total is adequate or that the pieces fit together.

Medicaid is the dominant payer, financing approximately 27% of all mental health spending in the United States, yet its coverage of psychiatric inpatient care is limited by the Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion, a 1965 provision that bars federal Medicaid reimbursement for care in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds. This exclusion was originally intended to prevent states from shifting their existing institutional costs to the federal government, but it now functions as a barrier to inpatient treatment for the most severely ill. The Mental Health Block Grant, funded at $1.86 billion in FY2024, is the primary federal discretionary program for community mental health services, but its purchasing power has declined substantially in inflation-adjusted terms since its creation in 1981.

The Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) model, authorized by the Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act of 2014 and expanded through Section 2707 demonstrations, represents the most significant structural innovation in mental health financing in decades. CCBHCs receive prospective, cost-based payment rather than fee-for-service reimbursement, enabling them to provide a comprehensive range of services including crisis intervention, outpatient treatment, primary care screening, and care coordination. As of 2024, over 540 CCBHCs operate in more than 46 states, but the model has not yet been made permanent or universal.

The core challenge is not simply the total amount of money spent on mental health care but the architecture through which it flows. Fragmented funding streams create administrative burden, leave gaps in coverage, incentivize cost-shifting between levels of government, and make it nearly impossible to build the integrated, continuous care systems that evidence shows produce the best outcomes.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key components of mental health financing in the United States:

- **Federal Entitlement Programs**: Medicaid mental health coverage, Medicare mental health reimbursement, and the IMD exclusion
- **Federal Discretionary Programs**: Mental Health Block Grant, SAMHSA grant programs, CCBHC demonstrations, and Section 1115 waivers
- **State and Local Funding**: State mental health authority budgets, county behavioral health funding, and state-federal cost-sharing
- **Private Financing**: Commercial insurance coverage, parity law compliance, and out-of-pocket spending
- **Structural Issues**: Fragmentation across funding streams, provider reimbursement adequacy, uncompensated care, and the gap between authorization and appropriation

## Key Facts

| Medicaid share of mental health spending | 27% | Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023 |
| Mental Health Block Grant funding | $1.86 billion (FY2024) | SAMHSA, FY2024 Congressional Justification |
| SAMHSA total budget | $9.5 billion (FY2024) | SAMHSA, FY2024 Congressional Justification |
| Number of CCBHCs operating nationwide | 540+ in 46 states (2024) | National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2024 |
| Adults with mental illness who received no treatment | 57.8% (28.5 million people, 2022) | SAMHSA, 2022 NSDUH |
| IMD exclusion threshold | 16 beds | 42 U.S.C. Section 1396d(a)(B) |
| Medicare psychiatric inpatient lifetime cap | 190 days | Social Security Act Section 1812(b)(3) |
| Average Medicaid reimbursement rate vs. Medicare for mental health | 72% of Medicare rates | Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC), 2023 |
| State mental health agency (SMHA) total expenditures | $44.8 billion (FY2021) | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Federal vs. State Responsibility**: The federal government provides the majority of mental health funding through Medicaid matching, but states control service design, provider networks, and eligibility criteria. Expanding federal funding risks creating unfunded mandates; devolving responsibility risks a race to the bottom.
- **Entitlement vs. Discretionary Spending**: Medicaid provides an entitlement to mental health services for eligible populations, but the block grant and most SAMHSA programs are subject to annual appropriations that can be cut. Moving toward entitlement coverage guarantees access but increases mandatory spending.
- **Institutional vs. Community Care**: The IMD exclusion was designed to shift care from institutions to communities, but community alternatives were never adequately funded. Repealing the exclusion could revive institutional care; maintaining it leaves the most severely ill without access to needed inpatient treatment.
- **Fee-for-Service vs. Prospective Payment**: Fee-for-service reimbursement incentivizes volume over value and discourages the provision of non-billable services like care coordination. Prospective payment models like CCBHCs address this but require significant upfront investment and ongoing cost reporting.
- **Parity in Law vs. Parity in Practice**: The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 requires commercial insurers to cover mental health services on par with medical/surgical services, but enforcement has been weak, and parity in reimbursement rates and network adequacy remains elusive.
- **Adequacy vs. Fiscal Constraint**: Closing the mental health treatment gap would require substantial new investment at a time of competing fiscal pressures. Every dollar allocated to mental health is a dollar not available for physical health, education, or deficit reduction.

## Key Questions

1. How can the United States consolidate its fragmented mental health funding streams into a more coherent financing system without disrupting existing services?
2. Should the IMD exclusion be repealed, reformed, or replaced with alternative mechanisms to ensure access to inpatient psychiatric care?
3. Can the CCBHC prospective payment model be scaled nationally, and what would it cost to make it the default financing mechanism for community mental health?
4. How should mental health funding be divided between federal entitlements and state-administered programs to balance accountability, flexibility, and adequacy?

## Vision of Success

A successful mental health funding system in the 21st century would feature:

- **Adequate Total Investment**: Mental health funding proportional to the burden of disease, closing the gap between the 57.8% of adults with mental illness who receive no treatment and universal access to evidence-based care.
- **Unified Financing Architecture**: A coherent funding structure that eliminates the fragmentation, cost-shifting, and administrative burden created by multiple overlapping funding streams with different rules.
- **Provider Sustainability**: Reimbursement rates sufficient to recruit and retain a mental health workforce, with prospective payment models that support the full range of services including crisis care, outpatient treatment, and care coordination.
- **Equity Across Geography and Insurance Status**: A system in which access to mental health care does not depend on whether a person lives in a Medicaid expansion state, has commercial insurance, or resides in a county with adequate local funding.
