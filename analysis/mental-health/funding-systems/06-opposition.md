# Mental Health Funding Systems: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to significantly expand or restructure mental health funding face resistance from fiscal conservatives concerned about government spending, insurers and managed care organizations protecting their financial interests, some state officials wary of federal mandates, and ideological opponents of expanded government involvement in health care. While virtually no one opposes "mental health" in the abstract, specific proposals to increase funding, enforce parity, repeal the IMD exclusion, or expand entitlement coverage face organized and effective opposition.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) | Oppose stronger parity enforcement and rate adequacy mandates | $163 million in federal lobbying (2022, industry-wide) | Lobby against NQTL comparative analysis requirements; fund studies questioning parity compliance costs |
| Managed care organizations (Centene, Molina, UHC) | Protect Medicaid BH managed care revenue ($18+ billion annually) | Significant state-level lobbying presence | Lobby state Medicaid agencies against direct-to-provider payment models; oppose CCBHC carve-outs from managed care |
| Congressional fiscal hawks | Oppose new mandatory spending | Budget committee leadership positions | Score legislation, invoke CBO cost estimates, enforce PAYGO |
| National Governors Association (conditional) | Oppose unfunded mandates on state Medicaid programs | Collective state government voice | Lobby against federal requirements without federal funding |
| Some pharmaceutical companies | Prefer medication-focused care over investment in psychosocial alternatives | $80+ million in PAC contributions (2022 cycle) | Fund research emphasizing pharmacological treatment; lobby against formulary restrictions |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Fiscal Conservative**: Objects to the scale of new spending required. CBO estimates for IMD exclusion repeal ($3.4-$5.9 billion/year) and CCBHC nationalization ($10-$15 billion/year) are cited as unaffordable given existing deficits and competing priorities.
- **Libertarian**: Opposes expanding government's role in health care financing on principle. Argues that government funding distorts the market, creates dependency, and crowds out private charity and innovation.
- **States' Rights Conservative**: Opposes federal mandates on state Medicaid programs. Views block grants as the appropriate federal role -- providing funding with maximum state flexibility -- and resists entitlement expansions that constrain state discretion.
- **Free-Market Conservative**: Argues that low reimbursement rates and provider shortages are symptoms of over-regulation, not under-funding. Favors deregulation (expanded scope of practice, reduced licensing requirements, telehealth expansion) over increased government spending.

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: The Federal Government Cannot Afford New Mental Health Spending

**Claim**: With federal deficits exceeding $1.5 trillion annually and national debt at $34 trillion (2024), the United States cannot afford to add billions in new mental health mandatory or discretionary spending. Expanding Medicaid entitlements for mental health will worsen the long-term fiscal outlook.

**Evidence Cited**: CBO projects that federal debt held by the public will reach 116% of GDP by 2034. IMD exclusion repeal alone would cost $3.4-$5.9 billion annually. Universal CCBHC expansion could cost $10-$15 billion annually.

**Reality**: Mental illness already imposes enormous costs on public systems. Untreated mental illness costs the U.S. economy an estimated $282 billion annually in lost productivity, disability, homelessness services, criminal justice involvement, and emergency care (Lancet Commission on Global Mental Health, 2018). Studies consistently show that investment in community mental health services generates a return of $2-$7 for every dollar spent through reduced emergency department use, incarceration, and disability payments (RAND Corporation, 2022).

**Rebuttal**: The question is not whether the nation can afford to invest in mental health but whether it can afford not to. Current spending on downstream consequences (ED boarding at $2.2 billion annually, incarceration of people with SMI at $15+ billion annually, homelessness services at $5+ billion annually) already exceeds the cost of upstream investment. Funding reform should be evaluated as a cost-effectiveness question, not solely as a spending increase.

### Argument 2: Repealing the IMD Exclusion Will Revive Institutionalization

**Claim**: Repealing the IMD exclusion will create a financial incentive for states to rebuild large psychiatric institutions, reversing decades of progress toward community-based care. Federal Medicaid dollars should not subsidize institutional care.

**Evidence Cited**: Historical experience with state hospitals, where 559,000 patients were confined at the system's peak (1955). Civil liberties concerns about involuntary institutionalization.

**Reality**: The modern mental health system faces the opposite problem: acute inpatient psychiatric beds have been reduced to approximately 37,000 nationwide -- a rate of 11.7 beds per 100,000 population, the lowest since before 1850 (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023). The IMD exclusion does not prevent institutionalization; it prevents Medicaid from paying for it. People who need inpatient psychiatric care either receive it in general hospital settings (at higher cost), board in emergency departments for days, cycle through the criminal justice system, or go without treatment entirely.

**Rebuttal**: Targeted IMD exclusion reform -- such as allowing Medicaid payment for short-term (30-60 day) acute stabilization stays with discharge planning requirements -- can expand needed inpatient capacity without creating incentives for long-term institutionalization. Section 1115 waivers in 37 states for SUD and 4 states for SMI have demonstrated this approach without evidence of institutional resurgence.

### Argument 3: Block Grants Provide Appropriate Flexibility

**Claim**: The Mental Health Block Grant structure appropriately gives states the flexibility to design mental health systems that meet local needs. Converting block grants to entitlements or adding federal mandates would impose a one-size-fits-all approach that ignores state variation.

**Evidence Cited**: States have different population demographics, provider availability, and existing infrastructure. The MHBG allows states to allocate funding based on local priorities.

**Reality**: The block grant structure has produced a 10:1 ratio in per capita state mental health spending (from $47 in Texas to $468 in the District of Columbia, FY2021). This variation reflects political choice rather than clinical need -- Texas has higher rates of mental illness and less insurance coverage than high-spending states. The block grant's fixed funding level means it has declined substantially in inflation-adjusted terms since 1981.

**Rebuttal**: Flexibility without adequacy is not a meaningful benefit. The block grant can preserve state flexibility within a reformed structure that establishes minimum per capita funding levels, requires states to meet performance benchmarks, and adjusts federal allocations based on need rather than solely on historical spending patterns.

### Argument 4: Parity Enforcement Will Increase Premiums

**Claim**: Strengthening MHPAEA enforcement -- requiring comparative analyses of non-quantitative treatment limitations, mandating network adequacy standards, and imposing penalties for non-compliance -- will increase health insurance premiums and employer costs.

**Evidence Cited**: Industry-funded studies estimating 1-3% premium increases from full parity compliance. Small business concerns about health care costs.

**Reality**: The original CBO estimate for MHPAEA projected less than a 0.5% premium increase, which has been confirmed by subsequent analysis. The Milliman reports (2017, 2019, 2021) document that out-of-network utilization for mental health is 5.4 times higher than for medical/surgical services, indicating that insurers are systematically failing to build adequate networks. The cost of parity non-compliance is borne by patients through higher out-of-pocket costs and by providers through lower reimbursement.

**Rebuttal**: Parity does not require insurers to spend more on mental health -- it requires them to cover mental health on the same terms as physical health. If parity increases premiums, it does so by ending a discriminatory subsidy in which mental health services have been systematically under-reimbursed relative to medical/surgical services.

### Argument 5: Government Funding Crowds Out Private Innovation

**Claim**: Expanding government funding for mental health will crowd out private-sector innovation, including digital mental health tools, employer wellness programs, and philanthropic investment. The market is better positioned to develop new delivery models than government bureaucracies.

**Evidence Cited**: Growth in digital mental health startups ($5.5 billion in venture capital investment, 2021). Expansion of employer EAPs and mental health benefits.

**Reality**: Digital mental health tools and employer programs serve primarily employed, commercially insured populations. They do not reach the uninsured, Medicaid populations, or people with serious mental illness who account for the majority of mental health costs and need. The populations most affected by funding inadequacy -- people with SMI, those experiencing homelessness, incarcerated individuals -- are precisely those the private market has no incentive to serve.

**Rebuttal**: Public and private investment are complementary, not competing. Public funding serves populations the market cannot serve; private innovation develops new tools that public systems can adopt. The CCBHC model, for example, is a government-funded framework that incorporates technological innovation and value-based payment within a publicly accountable structure.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

Opposition to mental health funding reform follows a consistent pattern across decades:

1. **Agree in principle, oppose in practice**: Virtually all political actors express support for "mental health." Opposition emerges when specific funding mechanisms, regulatory requirements, or spending levels are proposed.
2. **Invoke fiscal constraints selectively**: The same legislators who support tax cuts, defense spending increases, or other priorities cite fiscal constraints when opposing mental health investment. Mental health consistently loses the competition for scarce discretionary dollars.
3. **Cite state flexibility to block federal standards**: The preference for state flexibility has been used to oppose minimum funding levels, performance benchmarks, and parity enforcement -- the very mechanisms needed to ensure that flexibility produces adequate care rather than a race to the bottom.

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Build the bipartisan coalition**: Mental health is one of the few health policy areas with genuine bipartisan support. Framing reforms as addressing the opioid crisis, veterans' mental health, and youth mental health can build broader coalitions than traditional health care reform.
- **Leverage law enforcement and criminal justice allies**: Police chiefs, sheriffs, and county prosecutors who deal with the consequences of untreated mental illness are powerful messengers for funding reform.
- **Use CBO scoring strategically**: Present mental health investment as a cost offset against existing spending on ED boarding, incarceration, and disability payments, requesting CBO to score the interaction effects.

### Communication Strategies

- **Lead with fiscal responsibility**: Frame mental health funding as an investment that reduces downstream costs, not as a new spending program. The $282 billion annual cost of untreated mental illness (Lancet Commission, 2018) provides a powerful benchmark.
- **Personalize the impact**: Stories of individuals and families navigating the fragmented funding system are more persuasive than aggregate statistics.
- **Reframe the IMD exclusion**: Emphasize that no comparable restriction exists for any other medical condition. The exclusion is not a policy choice but an artifact of 1965 fiscal politics.

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Use demonstrations before mandates**: The CCBHC demonstration model -- prove effectiveness in a subset of states, then expand -- has been more politically successful than proposing nationwide mandates.
- **Offer state flexibility within federal floors**: Establish minimum per capita funding levels and performance standards while allowing states discretion in program design. This addresses both conservative concerns about mandates and progressive concerns about adequacy.
- **Phase in costs gradually**: Proposals that phase in over 5-10 years, with escalating federal match rates, face less political resistance than proposals requiring immediate large appropriations.
