# Mental Health Funding Systems: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Reforming mental health funding requires a sequenced strategy that builds political momentum through early bipartisan wins, uses demonstration evidence to justify larger structural changes, and phases in costs gradually to manage fiscal and political resistance. The roadmap is organized in three phases: Phase 1 consolidates existing bipartisan momentum (permanent CCBHC authorization, strengthened parity enforcement, expanded waivers); Phase 2 tackles structural reforms that require new legislation and higher spending (IMD exclusion reform, reimbursement rate adequacy, 988 sustainable funding); Phase 3 addresses the long-term transformation of the funding architecture itself (block grant reform, unified financing, spending parity with burden of disease).

Each phase builds on the preceding one. Phase 1 generates the evidence and political coalitions needed for Phase 2. Phase 2 creates the infrastructure and funding streams that make Phase 3 achievable. Attempting Phase 3 reforms without the groundwork of Phases 1 and 2 would repeat the historical pattern of ambitious structural reform without adequate implementation capacity.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Permanently authorize the CCBHC model as a Medicaid state plan option available in every state
- Strengthen MHPAEA enforcement through administrative and legislative action
- Expand Section 1115 SMI/SED waivers to at least 15 additional states
- Establish the analytical infrastructure for Phase 2 reforms

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Enact CCBHC permanent authorization legislation | Congress (bipartisan) | Months 1-12 | Existing CBO scoring; bipartisan co-sponsors | Bill signed into law |
| CMS issues final CCBHC certification criteria and state plan amendment guidance | CMS | Months 6-18 | CMS staff time; stakeholder engagement | Final rule published in Federal Register |
| DOL/HHS issue joint strengthened MHPAEA enforcement guidance requiring proactive NQTL comparative analysis | DOL, HHS | Months 3-12 | Existing regulatory authority; modest staffing increase ($15-$20 million) | Joint guidance published |
| CMS expedites review and approval of Section 1115 SMI/SED waiver applications | CMS | Months 1-24 | CMS waiver review staff | 15+ states with approved SMI/SED waivers |
| SAMHSA commissions comprehensive study of MHBG allocation formula equity | SAMHSA, Congress | Months 6-18 | $2-$5 million study contract | Published report with reform recommendations |
| CMS initiates Medicaid mental health rate adequacy data collection | CMS, MACPAC | Months 12-24 | Data collection infrastructure; state participation | Baseline rate adequacy data for all 50 states |

### Legislative Requirements

- **Community Behavioral Health Clinic Enhancement and Expansion Act**: Permanent CCBHC authorization with Medicaid state plan option. Bipartisan support exists; bill has had 200+ co-sponsors in recent Congresses.
- **MHPAEA enforcement amendments**: Legislation mandating proactive NQTL comparative analysis submission, establishing civil monetary penalties for violations, and creating a private right of action.
- **SAMHSA reauthorization**: Include MHBG formula study mandate and authorization for enhanced data collection on mental health spending.

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, the CCBHC model will have permanent statutory authorization, enabling states to adopt prospective payment for community behavioral health without relying on time-limited demonstrations. Parity enforcement will have measurably strengthened, with proactive insurer reporting creating a baseline of compliance data. At least 15 additional states will have SMI/SED waivers, generating evidence for Phase 2 statutory IMD reform. The MHBG formula study and Medicaid rate adequacy data collection will establish the analytical foundation for Phase 2 reforms.

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Reform the IMD exclusion through federal legislation
- Establish a Medicaid mental health reimbursement rate floor with enhanced federal match
- Create sustainable 988 crisis system funding through a dedicated telecommunications fee
- Mandate Medicaid reentry coverage for behavioral health services
- Begin MHBG formula reform based on Phase 1 study findings

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Enact IMD exclusion reform legislation allowing acute stabilization stays up to 60 days | Congress | Months 24-36 | CBO scoring; evidence from expanded 1115 waivers | Bill signed into law |
| CMS publishes IMD reform implementing regulations | CMS | Months 30-42 | CMS regulatory staff; quality standards development | Final rule published |
| Enact Medicaid MH reimbursement rate floor legislation (80% of Medicare) with 90% FMAP for incremental costs | Congress | Months 24-36 | $4-$6 billion annual federal cost; CBO scoring | Bill signed into law |
| States submit rate adjustment plans and implement rate increases | States, CMS | Months 36-60 | State plan amendments; rate-setting analysis | 40+ states in compliance by Year 5 |
| Enact 988 Crisis System Sustainable Funding Act with $0.50/month telecommunications fee | Congress, FCC | Months 24-36 | FCC rulemaking; state grant program design | Legislation enacted; FCC rulemaking initiated |
| 988 Trust Fund begins collecting revenue and distributing grants | SAMHSA, FCC | Months 36-48 | Trust fund administration; state grant applications | Revenue collection begins; first grants distributed |
| Enact Medicaid reentry coverage mandate for behavioral health | Congress | Months 30-42 | $1.2-$2.0 billion annual federal cost | Bill signed into law |
| Begin MHBG formula reform implementation with "hold harmless" provision | Congress, SAMHSA | Months 48-60 | $500 million-$1 billion additional annual MHBG funding | New formula allocations begin Year 5 |

### Legislative Requirements

- **Psychiatric Care Access Act**: Reform 42 U.S.C. Section 1396d(a)(B) to allow Medicaid payment for acute psychiatric stabilization stays (up to 60 days) in facilities of any size, with mandatory discharge planning and community follow-up.
- **Mental Health Rate Adequacy Act**: Establish a federal floor for Medicaid mental health reimbursement at 80% of Medicare rates, with 90% FMAP for incremental rate increases.
- **988 Crisis System Sustainable Funding Act**: Authorize a federal telecommunications surcharge dedicated to a 988 Trust Fund.
- **Medicaid Reentry Act**: Amend the Medicaid "inmate exclusion" to permit coverage for behavioral health services during the 30-90 day pre-release period.
- **MHBG Reauthorization**: Reauthorize the Mental Health Block Grant with a need-based allocation formula.

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, the core structural barriers in mental health financing will have been addressed. The IMD exclusion will no longer block Medicaid payment for needed acute psychiatric care. Medicaid reimbursement rates will be adequate to recruit and retain providers. The 988 crisis system will have a sustainable, dedicated funding stream generating $3.0-$3.5 billion annually. Medicaid reentry coverage will improve care continuity for the approximately 2 million people with SMI who cycle through jails annually. The MHBG formula will begin to allocate funds based on need rather than historical spending patterns.

## Phase 3: System Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Consolidate fragmented mental health funding streams into a unified financing architecture
- Achieve mental health spending proportional to burden of disease
- Establish a comprehensive national mental health data system
- Eliminate geographic inequities in mental health access

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Establish Federal Mental Health Financing Commission to design unified funding architecture | Congress, HHS | Months 60-72 | $10-$15 million commission budget; expert participation | Commission report with legislative recommendations |
| Enact legislation consolidating mental health funding streams with unified reporting | Congress | Months 72-96 | Comprehensive reform legislation | Bill signed into law |
| CMS implements unified mental health spending data system | CMS, SAMHSA | Months 72-108 | $50-$100 million IT investment; multi-payer data integration | Data system operational |
| Gradually increase total mental health spending from 5.5% to 8-10% of health expenditures | Congress, CMS, States | Months 60-120 | Incremental annual increases of $10-$15 billion | Measurable increase in spending share |
| States achieve minimum per capita mental health spending standards | States, CMS | Months 84-120 | Maintenance of effort requirements; continued enhanced FMAP | Reduction in interstate spending ratio from 10:1 to 3:1 |

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 3, mental health funding will flow through a coherent, accountable architecture rather than eight or more separate streams with conflicting rules. A unified national data system will allow policymakers to track total spending, identify gaps, and measure outcomes. Per capita mental health spending variation across states will have narrowed from a 10:1 ratio to no more than 3:1. Total mental health spending will approach proportionality with the burden of disease.

| Inmate MH coverage | Year 5 | States providing pre-release Medicaid BH coverage | 14 (2024) | 25 | 40 | 50 |

## Governance and Oversight

Implementation requires a dedicated oversight structure:

- **Federal Interagency Mental Health Funding Coordination Council**: Chaired by the HHS Secretary, with representation from CMS, SAMHSA, DOL, VA, DOJ, and HUD. Meets quarterly to coordinate funding streams, resolve conflicts, and track implementation milestones. Established by executive order in Year 1.
- **Congressional Mental Health Caucus Reporting**: Annual report to the bipartisan Congressional Mental Health Caucus on implementation progress, spending data, and outcome metrics.
- **GAO Biennial Audit**: GAO conducts biennial performance audits of mental health funding reform implementation, with specific focus on whether increased funding is translating into improved access and outcomes.
- **State Accountability**: States receiving enhanced federal matching or reformed MHBG allocations must submit annual performance reports with standardized metrics on access, quality, and spending.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Political Will Dissipates After Phase 1

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Phase 1 is designed to produce visible, measurable results (more CCBHCs, stronger parity enforcement, reduced ED boarding in waiver states) that sustain political momentum. Building a broad bipartisan coalition early -- including law enforcement, families, providers, and employers -- creates durable political support that survives election cycles.

**Contingency Plan**: If congressional action stalls, maximize administrative actions (CMS waivers, DOL/HHS enforcement guidance, SAMHSA grant priorities) that do not require new legislation.

### Risk 2: States Substitute Federal Dollars for State Spending

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Include maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirements in all federal legislation, requiring states to maintain or increase state mental health spending as a condition of receiving enhanced federal funds. Model on ACA Medicaid MOE provisions.

**Contingency Plan**: If some states reduce state spending despite MOE provisions, SAMHSA withholds enhanced federal funding from non-compliant states and publishes state-by-state compliance data publicly.

### Risk 3: Workforce Shortages Prevent Effective Deployment of New Funding

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Coordinate funding reform with parallel workforce investments: loan repayment programs, training pipeline expansion, and competitive salary standards. The Medicaid rate floor (Phase 2) directly addresses the economic driver of workforce shortages.

**Contingency Plan**: Accelerate telehealth expansion, scope-of-practice modernization, and international recruitment to supplement domestic workforce development during transition period.

### Risk 4: Insurance Industry Litigation Delays Parity Enforcement

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Draft parity enforcement legislation with Chevron-proof specificity, minimizing regulatory discretion that could be challenged. Include explicit statutory standards for NQTL comparability.

**Contingency Plan**: Pursue parallel state-level parity enforcement in states with strong insurance regulatory authority while federal litigation proceeds.

### Risk 5: Fiscal Crisis Triggers Across-the-Board Spending Cuts

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Establish mental health funding in mandatory (entitlement) accounts where possible, insulating it from discretionary spending cuts. The 988 telecommunications fee and CCBHC Medicaid state plan option both create funding outside the annual appropriations process.

**Contingency Plan**: Prioritize sustaining the CCBHC model and Medicaid rate floor (which have the strongest evidence base) if overall funding is reduced.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Annual Cost | Cumulative Investment | Primary Funding Source | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Yrs 1-2) | $1-$2 billion | $2-$4 billion | Existing appropriations authority; modest new authorizations | CCBHC authorization is budget-neutral (payment shift, not new spending); parity enforcement uses existing authority |
| Phase 2 (Yrs 3-5) | $12-$18 billion | $36-$54 billion | New mandatory spending (Medicaid rate floor, IMD reform); 988 telecommunications fee; enhanced MHBG appropriations | Offset by $5-$10 billion annually in reduced ED, incarceration, and homelessness costs |
| Phase 3 (Yrs 6-10) | $15-$25 billion | $75-$125 billion | Expanded mandatory spending; consolidated funding streams | Spending increase reaches 8-10% of health expenditures |
| **Total (10 years)** | **$12-$20 billion (avg.)** | **$113-$183 billion** | | Offset by estimated $50-$80 billion in downstream cost savings |

### Personnel

- **Phase 1**: 150-200 additional FTEs across CMS (waiver review, CCBHC certification), DOL (parity enforcement), and SAMHSA (formula study, data collection)
- **Phase 2**: 300-500 additional FTEs for CMS rate monitoring, 988 Trust Fund administration, and state compliance review
- **Phase 3**: Federal Mental Health Financing Commission (25-30 commissioners and staff); unified data system development team (50-75 FTEs)

### Infrastructure

- **Data Systems**: Unified mental health spending data platform integrating Medicaid, Medicare, commercial claims, block grant reporting, and state budget data. Estimated cost: $50-$100 million over 5 years.
- **988 Crisis Infrastructure**: Call centers, mobile crisis teams, crisis stabilization units in every community. Funded through 988 Trust Fund ($3.0-$3.5 billion annually at full build-out).
- **CCBHC Expansion**: Construction, renovation, and staffing for 2,000-3,000+ CCBHCs nationwide. Primary funding through Medicaid prospective payment (federal-state cost sharing).
