# Mental Health Funding Systems: Solutions

Reforming mental health financing requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to increase total investment, rationalize fragmented funding streams, align payment incentives with outcomes, and ensure that funding reaches the populations and services with the greatest need.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Public mental health funding should be proportional to the burden of disease, not constrained by historical spending patterns or arbitrary statutory exclusions
- Payment models should reward comprehensive, coordinated, evidence-based care rather than volume of discrete services
- Federal funding should establish minimum adequacy standards while preserving state flexibility in program design
- Financing reform must be coupled with workforce investment to ensure that increased funding can be effectively deployed

### Theory of Change

Fragmented, inadequate funding produces access gaps, workforce shortages, and downstream costs (emergency department use, incarceration, homelessness) that exceed the cost of adequate upstream investment. By consolidating funding streams, raising reimbursement rates to parity with medical care, expanding proven models like CCBHCs, and reforming the IMD exclusion, the system can redirect spending from costly crisis response to effective prevention and treatment. Demonstrated cost savings from pilot programs and international models provide the evidence base for scaling these reforms.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: National CCBHC Expansion and Permanent Authorization

**Description**: Make the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) model a permanent Medicaid option available in every state, rather than a time-limited demonstration program. CCBHCs receive prospective, cost-based payment that covers the full cost of delivering nine required service categories, including crisis services, outpatient treatment, primary care screening, and peer support. This model replaces the fee-for-service system that under-reimburses community mental health providers and discourages the provision of non-billable services.

**Evidence Base**: The ASPE evaluation of the initial Section 2707 demonstration (2022) found that CCBHC demonstration clinics increased the number of clients served by 29%, reduced emergency department visits by 18-25%, and reduced inpatient hospitalizations by 17-22% compared to pre-demonstration baselines. A 2023 analysis by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing found that CCBHCs outperformed non-CCBHC community mental health centers on 14 of 17 quality metrics.

**Implementation**: Congress would amend Title XIX of the Social Security Act to create a permanent CCBHC Medicaid state plan option under Section 1905(a). CMS would issue final certification criteria, and states would submit state plan amendments. Implementation would begin with current demonstration states and expand over 5 years.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $10-$15 billion annually when fully implemented nationwide, offset by $3-$5 billion in reduced ED, inpatient, and criminal justice costs (CBO methodology applied to ASPE demonstration findings).

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; CMS rulemaking in Year 2; state plan amendments in Years 2-3; full implementation by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Managed care organizations may resist CCBHC carve-outs from Medicaid managed care. States must develop cost-reporting infrastructure. Workforce recruitment is needed to staff expanded CCBHCs.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of operational CCBHCs, clients served, ED visit rates among CCBHC clients, inpatient admission rates, 30-day readmission rates.

### Solution 2: IMD Exclusion Reform

**Description**: Reform the IMD exclusion to allow Medicaid reimbursement for acute psychiatric stabilization stays of up to 60 days in psychiatric facilities of any size, with mandatory discharge planning and community follow-up requirements. This is a targeted reform, not a full repeal: it enables access to needed inpatient care while preserving incentives for community-based treatment.

**Evidence Base**: The four states with Section 1115 SMI/SED waivers (Washington, Idaho, Vermont, Indiana) have demonstrated that allowing short-term IMD stays reduces ED boarding times, improves care transitions, and does not lead to increased long-term institutionalization. Washington State reported a 38% reduction in psychiatric ED boarding in the first year of its waiver (Washington Health Care Authority, 2022). The 37 states with SUD IMD waivers provide additional evidence of successful short-term institutional care under Medicaid.

**Implementation**: Congress would amend 42 U.S.C. Section 1396d(a)(B) to create an exception for acute psychiatric stabilization stays. CMS would issue implementing regulations specifying quality standards, discharge planning requirements, and reporting obligations.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $3.4-$5.9 billion annually in new federal Medicaid spending (CBO, 2019), offset by reduced ED boarding costs ($2.2 billion annually, ACEP, 2022) and reduced state-only funding for psychiatric inpatient care.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; CMS rulemaking in Year 2; state implementation begins Year 3.

**Challenges**: Some community mental health advocates fear diversion of funding to institutional settings. States must ensure adequate discharge planning and community follow-up infrastructure.

**Impact Metrics**: Average ED boarding time for psychiatric patients, inpatient psychiatric bed availability, 30-day readmission rates, state spending on uncompensated institutional care.

### Solution 3: Medicaid Mental Health Reimbursement Rate Adequacy

**Description**: Establish a federal floor for Medicaid mental health reimbursement rates at 80% of Medicare rates, with an enhanced federal match (90% FMAP) for the incremental cost of rate increases above current levels. This addresses the fundamental driver of workforce shortages in public mental health: reimbursement rates that are too low to attract and retain clinicians.

**Evidence Base**: MACPAC (2023) documented that average Medicaid mental health reimbursement is 72% of Medicare rates, which are themselves below private-sector rates. Research by Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission demonstrates a direct relationship between Medicaid reimbursement rates and provider participation: states with higher rates have shorter wait times and more available providers.

**Implementation**: Congress would establish minimum rate requirements in Title XIX. CMS would develop rate adequacy monitoring methodology. States would submit rate adjustment plans as part of their state plan amendments.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $4-$6 billion annually in additional federal Medicaid spending (based on MACPAC rate adequacy modeling). The enhanced 90% FMAP minimizes the state share of the cost increase.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; CMS rate methodology development in Year 2; state compliance in Years 3-5 with a phased implementation schedule.

**Challenges**: States may resist federal rate mandates as unfunded mandates despite the enhanced match. Setting rates too high could increase costs without proportional access improvements.

**Impact Metrics**: Medicaid-to-Medicare rate ratio, number of mental health providers accepting Medicaid, average wait time for mental health appointments, provider turnover rates.

### Solution 4: Mental Health Block Grant Reform

**Description**: Reform the Mental Health Block Grant to include need-based allocation formulas, minimum per capita spending requirements, and performance accountability standards. The current formula primarily reflects historical spending patterns and population size, not mental health need or treatment gap.

**Evidence Base**: The 10:1 ratio in per capita state mental health spending ($47 in Texas to $468 in the District of Columbia, FY2021) demonstrates that the current allocation formula does not adjust for need. States with the lowest per capita spending tend to have the highest unmet need (NRI/NASMHPD, 2023).

**Implementation**: Congress would reauthorize the MHBG with a revised formula incorporating mental illness prevalence, uninsured rates, poverty rates, and provider shortage metrics. A "hold harmless" provision would ensure no state loses funding in the transition.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $500 million-$1 billion in additional annual MHBG appropriations to fund the formula adjustment without reducing any state's allocation.

**Timeline**: Reauthorization legislation in Year 1; SAMHSA formula revision in Year 2; new allocations beginning Year 3.

**Challenges**: States currently receiving disproportionately high allocations will resist formula changes. Congressional delegations protect existing allocations.

**Impact Metrics**: Variance in per capita MHBG allocations, correlation between MHBG funding and state mental health need indicators.

### Solution 5: Strengthened Parity Enforcement

**Description**: Strengthen Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act enforcement by requiring insurers to submit comparative analyses of non-quantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs) to federal and state regulators proactively (not just upon request), establishing civil monetary penalties for parity violations, and creating a private right of action for individuals to enforce parity in federal court.

**Evidence Base**: The DOL reported in 2023 that of 158 MHPAEA investigations in FY2022, 32 resulted in corrective actions -- indicating widespread non-compliance. The Milliman reports (2017, 2019, 2021) consistently documented that out-of-network utilization for mental health services is 5.4 times higher than for medical/surgical services, indicating that insurer networks are systematically inadequate.

**Implementation**: Congress would amend ERISA and the Public Health Service Act to mandate proactive NQTL comparative analysis submission, establish civil penalties ($10,000 per violation per day), and create a private right of action. DOL and HHS would issue joint enforcement guidance.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct federal cost (enforcement within existing DOL/HHS budgets with modest staffing increases). Industry compliance costs estimated at $500 million-$1 billion annually (which represents the transfer of costs currently borne by patients through higher out-of-pocket spending).

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; joint DOL/HHS rulemaking in Year 2; compliance deadline Year 3.

**Challenges**: Insurance industry will lobby vigorously against mandatory NQTL reporting and civil penalties. ERISA preemption issues may limit state enforcement capacity.

**Impact Metrics**: Ratio of out-of-network MH utilization to medical/surgical, prior authorization denial rates for MH vs. medical, number of enforcement actions, average out-of-pocket spending differential.

### Solution 6: 988 Crisis System Sustainable Funding

**Description**: Establish a dedicated, sustainable funding mechanism for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and associated crisis response infrastructure through a per-line telecommunications fee (modeled on the existing 911 fee structure), replacing reliance on annual discretionary appropriations.

**Evidence Base**: The Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute (2023) estimated that a comprehensive national crisis system (call centers, mobile crisis teams, crisis stabilization units) would cost approximately $3.7 billion annually. Current federal funding of $502 million (FY2024) covers only call center operations, not the full crisis continuum. The 911 fee model, which generates approximately $3.5 billion annually across all states, demonstrates the viability of telecommunications-based funding.

**Implementation**: Congress would authorize a federal 988 surcharge of $0.50/month per telephone line (wireless and wireline), with revenues dedicated to a 988 Trust Fund administered by SAMHSA. States would be eligible for grants from the Trust Fund to build crisis response infrastructure.

**Cost/Resources**: An estimated $3.0-$3.5 billion annually in telecommunications fee revenue, sufficient to fund the full crisis continuum.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; FCC rulemaking in Year 2; fee collection begins Year 3.

**Challenges**: Telecommunications industry will oppose new fees. States with existing 988 fees may resist federal preemption.

**Impact Metrics**: 988 call answer rate, average response time for mobile crisis teams, psychiatric ED boarding rates, involuntary commitment rates.

### Solution 7: Medicaid Reentry Coverage

**Description**: Require all state Medicaid programs to provide coverage for behavioral health services during the 30-90 days prior to release from incarceration, ensuring continuity of care for people with mental illness transitioning from jails and prisons to community settings.

**Evidence Base**: CMS approved Section 1115 reentry waivers for 14 states as of 2024, with early evidence showing reduced recidivism and improved treatment engagement. A 2022 RAND study found that pre-release Medicaid enrollment reduced 12-month re-arrest rates by 16% for people with SMI.

**Implementation**: Congress would amend Title XIX to exclude the "inmate exclusion" for behavioral health services during the pre-release period. CMS would issue implementing guidance.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $1.2-$2.0 billion annually in new federal Medicaid spending, with potential offsets from reduced recidivism (estimated at $1.5-$3.0 billion annually in avoided incarceration costs, per RAND, 2022).

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; CMS guidance in Year 2; state implementation in Years 2-4.

**Challenges**: Some states may resist the mandate without federal funding. Coordination between corrections departments and Medicaid agencies is complex.

**Impact Metrics**: Pre-release enrollment rates, 30-day post-release treatment engagement, 12-month recidivism rates for enrollees.

## International Models

### United Kingdom: NHS Ring-Fenced Mental Health Funding

**Description**: The UK's National Health Service established a "mental health investment standard" (MHIS) in 2016, requiring each Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) to increase mental health spending at least as fast as its overall budget increase. Mental health funding is "ring-fenced" -- protected from cuts even when overall health budgets are constrained.

**Results**: Mental health spending in the NHS increased from 11.8% to 14.1% of total health spending between 2016 and 2023 (NHS England, 2023). Access to psychological therapies (IAPT) expanded from 900,000 to 1.7 million referrals annually.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The ring-fencing principle could be applied to the Mental Health Block Grant (requiring states to maintain or increase mental health spending as a condition of federal funding) or to Medicaid managed care contracts (requiring MCOs to spend a minimum percentage on behavioral health). The single-payer NHS structure is not directly replicable in the U.S. multi-payer system.

### Australia: Better Access Program

**Description**: Australia's Better Access program (2006-present) provides Medicare-funded rebates for up to 20 psychological therapy sessions per year, delivered by psychologists, social workers, or occupational therapists with a GP referral. The program is funded through the national Medicare system with no block grant or state allocation structure.

**Results**: In 2022, 3.5 million Australians (13.5% of the population) accessed Better Access services. Treatment access rates for common mental disorders increased from 37% to 54% between 2007 and 2022 (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Better Access model demonstrates the effectiveness of entitlement-based (rather than block-grant-based) mental health funding. The U.S. could adapt this approach through Medicare or Medicaid by establishing a defined benefit for a specified number of therapy sessions without prior authorization.

### Canada: Transfer Payment Accountability

**Description**: Canada's federal government provides mental health funding to provinces through the Canada Health Transfer, with conditions requiring provinces to report on how mental health funds are used. The 2017 federal budget included $5 billion over 10 years dedicated to mental health and addiction, with bilateral agreements requiring each province to report on access, quality, and spending metrics.

**Results**: Provincial mental health spending increased from 5.1% to 7.2% of total health spending between 2017 and 2023 (CIHI, 2023). Wait times for community mental health services decreased by an average of 23% across provinces.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Canadian model of conditional transfer payments with accountability metrics mirrors what a reformed MHBG could look like: federal funding with performance requirements and public reporting, but provincial/state flexibility in program design.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **CCBHC Section 2707 Demonstration (2017-present)**: 10 states participating in Medicaid demonstrations showing improved access, reduced ED use, and sustainable cost-based payment. Most successful U.S. pilot in mental health financing.
- **Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic Expansion Grants (2018-present)**: SAMHSA grants have supported 540+ CCBHCs in 46 states, demonstrating scalability.
- **California MHSA (Proposition 63)**: Since 2004, a 1% income tax surcharge on incomes over $1 million has generated $3.7 billion annually (FY2023) for county mental health services. The dedicated funding stream has enabled California to expand prevention, early intervention, and community services independent of annual appropriations cycles.
- **Section 1115 SMI/SED Waivers**: Four states (WA, ID, VT, IN) demonstrating IMD exclusion reform through Medicaid waivers, with early evidence of reduced ED boarding and improved care transitions.

## Sequencing and Prioritization

### Quick Wins (0-2 years)

- Permanent CCBHC authorization legislation (bipartisan support exists)
- Strengthened parity enforcement rulemaking (can use existing statutory authority)
- Expansion of Section 1115 SMI/SED waivers to additional states (administrative action)

### Medium-term Reforms (2-5 years)

- IMD exclusion statutory reform
- Medicaid reimbursement rate adequacy requirements with enhanced FMAP
- 988 sustainable funding through telecommunications fee
- Medicaid reentry coverage mandate

### Long-term Transformation (5-10 years)

- Mental Health Block Grant formula reform
- Unified mental health funding architecture (consolidating overlapping streams)
- Mental health spending parity with burden of disease (5.5% of health spending rising to 10%+)

## Complementary Policies

- **Workforce investment**: Loan repayment, training pipeline expansion, and competitive salaries (see [Workforce Shortage](../workforce-shortage/07-solutions.md))
- **Housing**: Permanent supportive housing for people with SMI (see [Homelessness](../homelessness/07-solutions.md))
- **Criminal justice diversion**: Mental health courts, crisis intervention teams, and pre-arrest diversion programs (see [Criminal Justice](../criminal-justice/07-solutions.md))
- **Insurance parity**: Full implementation and enforcement of MHPAEA (see [Insurance Parity](../insurance-parity/07-solutions.md))
