# Mental Health Funding Systems: Legislation

## Overview

Reforming mental health financing requires both incremental legislation that can pass within the current political landscape and structural reforms that address the fundamental architecture of the funding system. This legislative approach is organized in two tiers: (1) federal legislation that can advance with bipartisan support in the near term (CCBHC permanent authorization, strengthened parity enforcement, IMD exclusion reform), and (2) longer-term structural legislation that requires broader coalition building (reimbursement rate floors, 988 sustainable funding, block grant reform). State model legislation complements federal action by addressing state-level funding adequacy and accountability.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for mental health funding reform.* The federal government has clear constitutional authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8) and the Commerce Clause to condition federal health care funding on state compliance with program requirements, as established in *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), and refined in *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012). Reforms to Medicaid, Medicare, and the Mental Health Block Grant operate within existing constitutional frameworks.

## Federal Legislation

### The Community Behavioral Health Clinic Enhancement and Expansion Act

**Purpose**: Permanently authorize Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) as a Medicaid state plan option available in every state, replacing the time-limited demonstration program with a permanent financing model that enables comprehensive, cost-based community behavioral health care.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Create a permanent CCBHC Medicaid state plan option under Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act
2. Establish prospective payment system (PPS) based on cost of providing nine required service categories
3. Require CMS to publish final CCBHC certification criteria within 18 months of enactment
4. Authorize supplemental SAMHSA grants for planning and implementation in states without existing CCBHCs

**Draft Text**:

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics as a permanent
Medicaid provider type with prospective payment, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Community Behavioral Health Clinic
Enhancement and Expansion Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to SAMHSA (2023), 57.8% of adults with any mental
illness (28.5 million people) received no mental health treatment
in 2022.

(2) The CCBHC demonstration program, authorized by Section 223 of
the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-93), has
demonstrated that prospective, cost-based payment for community
behavioral health services reduces emergency department visits by
18-25% and hospitalizations by 17-22% (ASPE, 2022).

(3) As of 2024, over 540 CCBHCs operate in more than 46 states, but
the program has not been permanently authorized.

(4) The fee-for-service payment model that governs most community
mental health center reimbursement provides inadequate rates
(averaging 72% of Medicare rates per MACPAC, 2023) and fails to
cover non-billable services essential to comprehensive care.

(5) Permanent CCBHC authorization would enable every state to adopt
a financing model proven to improve access, reduce costly
downstream utilization, and provide the full continuum of
community behavioral health services.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) CERTIFIED COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC.--The term
"certified community behavioral health clinic" has the meaning
given in section 1913(b)(9) of the Public Health Service Act

established by the Secretary under section 4(c).

(2) PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM.--The term "prospective payment
system" means the payment methodology described in section
223(d) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014
(P.L. 113-93) as adapted for permanent implementation under
this Act.

(3) SECRETARY.--The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Health
and Human Services.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Permanent Medicaid State Plan Option)**: Creates the legal authority for any state to include CCBHCs as a covered Medicaid provider type with prospective payment. This replaces the current reliance on time-limited demonstration authority and SAMHSA discretionary grants.
- **Section 4(b)(2) (Rate Setting)**: Requires rates to cover the full cost of providing required services, including 24/7 crisis services. Annual updates using the Medicare Economic Index ensure rates keep pace with costs.
- **Section 5 (Grants)**: Provides planning and implementation funding for states that have not yet established CCBHCs, targeting the states with the greatest unmet need.
- **Section 6 (Reporting)**: Ensures transparency and accountability by requiring annual public reporting on key access and outcome metrics.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 180 days after enactment | N/A |
| CMS publishes proposed certification criteria | 12 months after enactment | CMS |
| CMS publishes final certification criteria | 18 months after enactment | CMS |
| States begin submitting state plan amendments | 18-24 months after enactment | States, CMS |
| First states implement CCBHC state plan option | 24-30 months after enactment | States |
| SAMHSA awards first planning grants | 12 months after enactment | SAMHSA |

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS administers the Medicaid state plan option; SAMHSA administers planning grants and provides technical assistance.

**Challenges**:

- **Managed care integration**: In states with Medicaid managed care, CCBHC prospective payment may need to be carved out from MCO capitation rates, which MCOs will resist.
- **State fiscal commitment**: The state share of Medicaid CCBHC costs (typically 30-50% depending on the state's FMAP) requires state legislative appropriation.

**Refinements**:

- **MCO pass-through provision**: Require Medicaid managed care organizations to pass through the full CCBHC PPS rate to CCBHCs without administrative reduction.
- **FMAP enhancement**: Consider providing an enhanced 90% federal match for the first 3 years of CCBHC implementation to incentivize state adoption.

### The Psychiatric Care Access Act

**Purpose**: Reform the Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion to allow Medicaid reimbursement for acute psychiatric stabilization stays of up to 60 days while maintaining protections against long-term institutionalization.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Create an exception to the IMD exclusion for acute psychiatric stabilization stays of up to 60 days
2. Require facilities to develop individualized discharge plans within 72 hours of admission
3. Mandate community follow-up within 7 days of discharge as a condition of reimbursement
4. Establish quality standards for psychiatric facilities receiving Medicaid payment

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide for Medicaid
coverage of acute psychiatric stabilization services in institutions
for mental diseases, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Psychiatric Care Access Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The IMD exclusion, enacted in 1965, prohibits federal Medicaid
matching for care in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds
for adults aged 21-64.

(2) No comparable restriction on Medicaid reimbursement exists for
any other category of medical facility.

(3) The United States has approximately 37,000 psychiatric inpatient
beds, a rate of 11.7 beds per 100,000 population, the lowest since
before 1850 (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023).

(4) Psychiatric patients board in emergency departments for an
average of 34 hours awaiting placement, compared to 4.3 hours for
medical patients (ACEP, 2022), at an estimated cost of $2.2 billion
annually.

(5) Section 1115 waiver demonstrations in 4 states have shown that
allowing short-term IMD stays reduces ED boarding and improves care
transitions without increasing long-term institutionalization.

SEC. 3. MEDICAID COVERAGE OF ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC STABILIZATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act
(42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)) is amended--
    (1) in
    by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the following:

    "(B) except that--
        (i) such term does not include amounts expended for services
        provided to individuals aged 21-64 who are patients in an
        institution for mental diseases, unless such services are
        provided during an acute psychiatric stabilization stay that
        does not exceed 60 days within a 12-month period; and
        (ii) facilities providing services under clause (i) shall
        comply with the quality standards and discharge planning
        requirements established by the Secretary under subsection
        (jjj);"

(b) QUALITY AND DISCHARGE REQUIREMENTS.--Section 1905 of the
Social Security Act is amended by adding at the end the following:

    "(jjj) ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC STABILIZATION REQUIREMENTS.--
    (1) DISCHARGE PLANNING.--A facility providing services under
    subsection (a)(B)(i) shall develop an individualized discharge
    plan for each patient not later than 72 hours after admission,
    which shall include--
        (A) identification of outpatient mental health services to
            be provided after discharge;
        (B) medication reconciliation and transition planning;
        (C) coordination with community behavioral health providers;
        (D) housing and social service needs assessment; and
        (E) scheduled follow-up appointment within 7 days of discharge.

    (2) COMMUNITY FOLLOW-UP.--As a condition of Medicaid payment for
    services under subsection (a)(B)(i), the facility shall ensure
    that the patient receives a community-based follow-up service
    within 7 days of discharge. Failure to meet this requirement
    shall result in a 10% reduction in the Medicaid payment for
    the stay.

    (3) QUALITY STANDARDS.--The Secretary shall establish quality
    standards for facilities receiving payment under subsection
    (a)(B)(i), including--
        (A) staffing ratios for psychiatric and nursing staff;
        (B) patient rights protections;
        (C) evidence-based treatment requirements;
        (D) restraint and seclusion minimization standards; and
        (E) data reporting requirements.

    (4) REPORTING.--Each facility receiving payment under subsection
    (a)(B)(i) shall report to the Secretary, on an annual basis--
        (A) number of Medicaid-covered stays;
        (B) average length of stay;
        (C) 30-day readmission rates;
        (D) 7-day community follow-up completion rates;
        (E) patient outcome measures; and
        (F) restraint and seclusion usage data."

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be
necessary to carry out this Act. The Congressional Budget Office
estimated the federal cost of IMD exclusion reform at $3.4-$5.9
billion annually (2019 estimate).

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 1 year after the date
of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3(a) (60-Day Exception)**: Creates a targeted exception to the IMD exclusion for acute stabilization, not a full repeal. The 60-day limit within a 12-month period prevents long-term institutional use while ensuring access to needed acute care.
- **Section 3(b) (Discharge Planning and Follow-Up)**: Addresses the concern that IMD reform could lead to institutionalization by requiring discharge planning within 72 hours and community follow-up within 7 days. The 10% payment reduction for missed follow-up creates a financial incentive for facilities to ensure care transitions.
- **Section 3(b)(3) (Quality Standards)**: Ensures that psychiatric facilities meet evidence-based standards as a condition of Medicaid payment, preventing the abuses associated with historical state hospitals.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 1 year after enactment | N/A |
| CMS publishes proposed quality standards | 6 months after enactment | CMS |
| CMS publishes final quality standards | 12 months after enactment | CMS |
| States begin implementing coverage | 12-18 months after enactment | States |
| First annual facility reports due | 2 years after enactment | Facilities, CMS |

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS establishes quality standards, monitors compliance, and collects facility reporting data.

**Challenges**:

- **Community mental health advocacy opposition**: Some advocacy groups may oppose any expansion of institutional Medicaid coverage, fearing it diverts resources from community services.
- **State fiscal impact**: States will absorb their FMAP share (30-50%) of new Medicaid spending on IMD stays.

**Refinements**:

- **Community reinvestment requirement**: Require states to demonstrate that any state savings from reduced uncompensated institutional care are reinvested in community behavioral health services.
- **Sunset and review**: Include a 5-year reauthorization requirement with mandatory GAO evaluation of whether the reform has reduced ED boarding without increasing long-term institutionalization.

## State Model Legislation

### Model Mental Health Funding Adequacy Act

**Purpose**: Establish minimum per capita mental health spending standards at the state level, create dedicated mental health funding streams, and require annual public reporting on mental health funding adequacy.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize the specific per capita minimum, funding source, and reporting requirements based on their existing spending levels, tax capacity, and administrative structure. States with county-administered mental health systems should include county-level adequacy standards.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Mental Health
Funding Adequacy Act of 2025".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds and declares:

(a) The [State] Mental Health Authority spent $[amount] in FY[year],
    equivalent to $[X] per capita.

(b) The national average per capita state mental health authority
    spending is $135 (FY2021), with a 10:1 ratio between the highest
    and lowest spending states.

(c) [State-specific data on treatment gap, workforce shortages,
    or unmet need].

(d) Adequate and sustained mental health funding is essential to
    reducing emergency department boarding, incarceration of people
    with mental illness, and homelessness.

SECTION 3. MINIMUM MENTAL HEALTH SPENDING STANDARD.

(a) Beginning in the fiscal year following enactment, the [State]
    shall appropriate for the State Mental Health Authority no less
    than the greater of:
    (1) The prior fiscal year appropriation adjusted for inflation
        using the Consumer Price Index for Medical Care; or
    (2) $[X] per capita, based on the most recent U.S. Census
        population estimate.

(b) The minimum per capita amount in subsection (a)(2) shall
    increase by 5% annually until it reaches the national average
    per capita state mental health spending as reported by the
    National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors.

SECTION 4. DEDICATED MENTAL HEALTH FUND.

(a) There is hereby established in the State Treasury a Mental Health
    Services Fund.

(b) The Fund shall be supported by [state-specific revenue source,
    e.g., a surcharge on commercial insurance premiums, a designated
    portion of state income tax, or a dedicated tax].

(c) Moneys in the Fund shall be appropriated exclusively for
    community mental health services, crisis infrastructure, and
    mental health workforce development.

SECTION 5. ANNUAL REPORTING.

Not later than December 1 of each year, the State Mental Health
Authority shall submit to the Legislature and publish on its website
a report that includes:

(a) Total state mental health expenditures and per capita spending;
(b) Federal mental health funding received, by program;
(c) Mental health treatment access rates;
(d) Provider workforce data, including vacancies;
(e) Emergency department psychiatric boarding data; and
(f) Comparison to national per capita spending averages.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on July 1 following enactment.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for Medicaid-related reforms; SAMHSA for block grant and discretionary programs; DOL and HHS for parity enforcement.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **CCBHC Certification Criteria**: CMS must publish final certification standards including staffing, access, quality reporting, and scope of service requirements within 18 months of enactment.
2. **IMD Reform Quality Standards**: CMS must publish quality standards for psychiatric facilities receiving Medicaid payment under the IMD exclusion exception, including staffing ratios, patient rights, and discharge planning requirements.
3. **Parity Enforcement Rule**: DOL and HHS must issue a joint final rule specifying the format and frequency of mandatory NQTL comparative analyses and establishing civil monetary penalty schedules.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties for Parity Violations**: $10,000 per violation per day, assessed by DOL (for ERISA plans) or state insurance departments (for fully-insured plans).
- **Administrative Sanctions for State Non-Compliance**: CMS may withhold enhanced FMAP or block grant funds from states that fail to meet maintenance-of-effort requirements or spending standards.
- **Private Right of Action**: Individuals may bring suit in federal court for parity violations under ERISA or in state court under state parity laws. Attorney's fees and costs recoverable by prevailing plaintiffs.
- **Public Reporting**: CMS and SAMHSA publish annual state-by-state data on mental health spending, access, and outcomes, creating transparency-driven accountability.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: Congress has broad authority under the Spending Clause to attach conditions to federal health care funding, provided the conditions are unambiguous, related to the federal interest in the program, and not coercive. CCBHC authorization and Medicaid rate floors operate as optional state plan amendments -- states choose whether to adopt them -- satisfying the non-coercion requirement of *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012).

**Commerce Clause and Parity Enforcement**: MHPAEA enforcement amendments operate under Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce, as health insurance is sold across state lines and employer-sponsored plans operate nationally. ERISA preemption provides the federal framework for employer-sponsored plan regulation.

**Federalism Concerns**: IMD exclusion reform and Medicaid rate adequacy requirements alter the federal-state Medicaid partnership. Structuring reforms as optional state plan amendments with enhanced federal matching (rather than mandatory requirements) reduces federalism objections. Block grant formula reform does not compel state spending; it changes the allocation formula for existing federal discretionary funds.

### Preemption

Federal parity enforcement amendments would preempt weaker state parity laws but include a savings clause preserving state laws that provide greater protections. ERISA preemption continues to apply to self-insured employer plans, making federal enforcement essential for the approximately 100 million Americans in ERISA-governed plans.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through a combination of financial incentives (enhanced FMAP for rate adequacy, CCBHC prospective payment), financial penalties (civil monetary penalties for parity violations, payment reductions for missed discharge follow-up), transparency mechanisms (annual public reporting), and judicial enforcement (private right of action for parity violations).

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| States adopt CCBHC option but reduce other MH spending to offset new Medicaid costs | States shift existing general fund MH spending to Medicaid CCBHC payments, resulting in no net increase in total spending | High | Include maintenance-of-effort provision requiring states to sustain non-Medicaid mental health spending at prior-year levels |
| MCOs reduce CCBHC PPS rates through administrative fees or "quality" withholdings | Managed care organizations pass through less than the full PPS rate to CCBHCs, undermining cost-based payment | High | Mandate 100% pass-through of CCBHC PPS rates by MCOs; prohibit administrative reductions exceeding 3% |
| IMD reform used for long-term stays through serial 60-day admissions | Facilities discharge and readmit patients to circumvent 60-day limit, creating de facto long-term institutionalization | Medium | Track 12-month cumulative IMD days per beneficiary; require 90-day gap between qualifying stays; flag serial admissions for CMS review |
| Insurers game parity NQTL comparative analyses by using favorable comparison categories | Insurers select medical/surgical comparison services with high utilization management to make MH restrictions appear comparable | Medium | Specify standardized comparison methodology in statute; require DOL pre-approval of comparison frameworks |
| Block grant formula "hold harmless" provisions prevent effective redistribution | States that currently receive disproportionately high per capita allocations retain their excess funding indefinitely | Medium | Limit hold harmless to 5 years with mandatory phase-down to need-based formula allocations |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Legislation does not address workforce shortages directly | New funding cannot be effectively deployed without providers to deliver services | Workforce reform requires separate legislative and regulatory action (training pipelines, scope of practice, immigration) | Coordinate with complementary workforce legislation; include loan repayment provisions in CCBHC implementation grants |
| 60-day IMD exception does not cover long-term care for people with SMI who need ongoing residential support | Some people with SMI need more than 60 days of structured residential care; the exception leaves them without Medicaid coverage for stays beyond 60 days | Full repeal of the IMD exclusion is politically infeasible; the 60-day limit is a compromise | Phase 3 reform could extend the exception or create a separate Medicaid benefit for longer-term psychiatric residential care with appropriate safeguards |
| State model legislation lacks enforcement mechanism if legislature fails to appropriate required funds | Minimum per capita spending standards are unenforceable if the legislature simply ignores the statutory requirement | State legislatures cannot bind future legislatures to specific spending levels | Include automatic appropriation mechanism tied to dedicated revenue source; create citizen standing to enforce spending standards through court action |
| Parity enforcement relies on patient complaints to identify violations | Most patients lack the expertise or resources to identify and report parity violations | Information asymmetry between patients and insurers regarding coverage comparability | Require proactive insurer reporting to regulators; fund state parity enforcement offices; create DOL whistleblower protections for insurer employees |
| CCBHC quality standards may create barriers to entry for small community organizations | Complex certification requirements may favor larger organizations with administrative capacity, reducing competition and local accountability | Certification standards necessarily impose administrative costs | Provide technical assistance and planning grants specifically for small organizations; allow phased certification with provisional status |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Maintenance-of-effort codification**: Add explicit MOE language requiring states to maintain non-Medicaid mental health spending at no less than the average of the prior 3 fiscal years as a condition of receiving enhanced FMAP or new block grant allocations.
2. **MCO pass-through enforcement**: Amend Medicaid managed care regulations (42 CFR Part 438) to require that MCOs pass through 100% of the CCBHC PPS rate, with permissible administrative deductions capped at 3% and subject to state Medicaid agency approval.
3. **Serial admission monitoring**: Require CMS to establish a national tracking system for IMD Medicaid stays per beneficiary, with automated flags for beneficiaries approaching the 60-day annual limit and mandatory CMS review for any beneficiary with more than one qualifying stay per year.
4. **Standardized NQTL methodology**: Direct DOL and HHS to publish a standardized NQTL comparative analysis methodology within 1 year of parity enforcement legislation, specifying the categories of medical/surgical services that must be used as the comparison standard.
5. **Block grant phase-down schedule**: Enact a 5-year phase-down of hold-harmless protections, with no state losing more than 5% of its prior-year allocation in any single year, and redirect freed-up funds to states with the highest unmet need.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The IMD exclusion reform should include a mandatory 5-year reauthorization requirement with:

- GAO evaluation of whether the reform has reduced ED boarding times, improved care transitions, and avoided increases in long-term institutionalization
- CMS assessment of state implementation and facility compliance with quality standards
- Congressional hearing requirement before reauthorization

The CCBHC permanent authorization should include a mandatory 3-year GAO evaluation of the transition from demonstration to state plan option, with assessment of whether cost-based payment is sustainable and whether CCBHCs are achieving improved access and outcomes compared to pre-CCBHC baselines.
