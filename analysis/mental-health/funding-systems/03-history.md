# Mental Health Funding Systems: History

## Historical Development

The financing of mental health care in the United States has been shaped by two centuries of shifting responsibility between levels of government, evolving conceptions of mental illness, and recurring cycles of reform followed by fiscal retrenchment. The story is fundamentally one of cost-shifting -- from states to the federal government and back again -- with people with serious mental illness caught in the gaps between systems designed primarily to manage governmental liability rather than to deliver effective care.

### State Asylum Era (1840s-1963): State Governments Bear the Full Cost

- **Dorothea Dix's Crusade**: In the 1840s-1850s, reformer Dorothea Dix campaigned for the establishment of state-funded asylums. Her advocacy led to the creation of state psychiatric hospitals across the country, establishing the principle that state governments were responsible for the care of people with mental illness.
- **Federal Abdication (1854)**: President Franklin Pierce vetoed the "Bill for the Benefit of the Indigent Insane" in 1854, which would have used federal land sale revenues to fund state asylums. Pierce's veto message argued that the federal government had no constitutional authority to provide charity, establishing a precedent of federal non-involvement in mental health funding that persisted for over a century.
- **State Hospital System Growth**: By 1955, state psychiatric hospitals housed approximately 559,000 patients at their peak. State legislatures funded these institutions through general appropriations, typically spending $3-$5 per patient per day (equivalent to roughly $30-$50 in 2024 dollars).
- **Chronic Underfunding**: Despite the scale of the system, state hospitals were chronically underfunded, overcrowded, and understaffed. Exposees such as Albert Deutsch's *The Shame of the States* (1948) and the resulting public outcry created political pressure for alternatives.

### Federal Entry and Deinstitutionalization (1963-1981): The Federal Government Creates New Funding Streams

- **Community Mental Health Act (1963)**: President Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act (P.L. 88-164), authorizing $150 million in federal grants for the construction of community mental health centers (CMHCs). This represented the first major federal investment in mental health infrastructure. The original vision called for 2,000 CMHCs; only approximately 789 were ever built.
- **Medicaid and the IMD Exclusion (1965)**: The Social Security Amendments of 1965 (P.L. 89-97) created Medicaid but deliberately excluded federal matching for care in "Institutions for Mental Disease" (IMDs) -- facilities with more than 16 beds primarily engaged in mental health treatment. Congress included the IMD exclusion to prevent states from shifting their existing state hospital costs to the new federal Medicaid program. The exclusion has remained in effect for nearly 60 years.
- **Medicare Discriminatory Copay (1965)**: The original Medicare statute imposed a 50% coinsurance rate for outpatient mental health services, compared to 20% for other medical services. This discriminatory rate was not fully eliminated until 2014.
- **Supplemental Security Income (1972)**: The creation of SSI (P.L. 92-603) provided a federal income floor for people with disabilities, including mental illness. SSI eligibility also conferred automatic Medicaid eligibility in most states, creating a critical link between disability income and health care coverage.
- **Deinstitutionalization Acceleration**: State hospital populations fell from 559,000 (1955) to approximately 138,000 (1980). The combination of new psychotropic medications (beginning with chlorpromazine in 1954), civil liberties litigation, and the financial incentive to move patients from state-funded hospitals to federally subsidized community settings (Medicaid, SSI) drove rapid depopulation.
- **Unfunded Community Care**: The community mental health infrastructure was never funded at levels sufficient to serve the population discharged from state hospitals. Federal CMHC grants declined in real terms throughout the 1970s.

### Block Grants and Retrenchment (1981-1996): Federal Retreat, State Variation

- **Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (OBRA)**: The Reagan administration converted categorical federal mental health grants into the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health (ADM) Block Grant, cutting funding by 25% and giving states broad discretion over how to spend the reduced allocation. This marked a fundamental shift from federal program design to state flexibility.
- **Mental Health Block Grant Creation (1992)**: The ADAMHA Reorganization Act (P.L. 102-321) separated the ADM Block Grant into two distinct programs: the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant (MHBG) and the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SABG). SAMHSA was created as the administering agency.
- **Medicaid Managed Care Expansion**: Throughout the 1990s, states increasingly moved Medicaid populations into managed care. Behavioral health "carve-outs" became common, with states contracting with specialized managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs). This introduced a new intermediary layer between public funding and service delivery.
- **State Spending Cuts**: The recession of the early 1990s triggered state budget cuts to mental health services. Between 1993 and 1996, at least 31 states cut community mental health funding in real terms (NASMHPD, 1997).
- **Welfare Reform (1996)**: The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (P.L. 104-193) severed the automatic link between welfare receipt and Medicaid eligibility for some populations, creating coverage gaps for people with mental illness who lost welfare benefits.

### Parity and the ACA Era (1996-2020): Coverage Expansion with Persistent Gaps

- **Mental Health Parity Act (1996)**: P.L. 104-204 required group health plans that offered mental health benefits to apply the same annual and lifetime dollar limits as for medical/surgical benefits. The law was narrow: it did not require plans to offer mental health benefits, did not address treatment limits, and did not apply to individual or small-group markets.
- **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (2008)**: MHPAEA (P.L. 110-343) substantially expanded parity requirements, prohibiting insurers from applying more restrictive financial requirements (copays, deductibles) or treatment limitations (visit limits, prior authorization) to mental health services than to medical/surgical services. Enforcement, however, remained weak.
- **Affordable Care Act (2010)**: The ACA (P.L. 111-148) was the most significant expansion of mental health coverage since Medicaid's creation. It required all individual and small-group plans to include mental health as an "essential health benefit," extended MHPAEA to individual and small-group markets, and expanded Medicaid to 138% of the federal poverty level in participating states. An estimated 2.8 million people with mental illness gained coverage through Medicaid expansion (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2016).
- **Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act (2014)**: P.L. 113-93, Section 223, authorized a demonstration program to establish Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) with prospective, cost-based reimbursement. Eight states began participating in 2017.
- **21st Century Cures Act (2016)**: P.L. 114-255 authorized $1 billion in new mental health and substance use funding over two years, including grants for early intervention, crisis services, and criminal justice diversion. It also established the 10% set-aside for first-episode psychosis programs within the MHBG.

### Pandemic Era and Post-Pandemic (2020-Present): Surge Funding and Structural Questions

- **CARES Act and American Rescue Plan (2020-2021)**: Pandemic-era legislation provided approximately $5.5 billion in supplemental mental health and substance use funding, including enhanced FMAP for Medicaid community-based mobile crisis services (additional 85% match for 3 years under ARPA Section 9813).
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (2022)**: The FCC designated 988 as the national suicide and crisis number (effective July 2022), but funding for the underlying crisis response infrastructure remained fragmented and insufficient.
- **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022)**: P.L. 117-159 provided $240 million for CCBHC expansion grants, extended telehealth flexibilities, and added marriage and family therapists and mental health counselors as Medicare-eligible provider types (effective January 2024).
- **CCBHC Expansion**: The number of CCBHCs grew from 67 demonstration clinics in 8 states (2017) to over 540 in 46 states (2024), representing the most rapid expansion of community behavioral health infrastructure in decades.
- **Post-Pandemic Funding Cliff**: As supplemental pandemic funding expired, states confronted the challenge of sustaining expanded capacity with pre-pandemic funding levels.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Cost-Shifting Drives Policy More Than Clinical Need

The central dynamic of mental health funding history is the effort by each level of government to shift costs to another. States created asylums to manage populations that communities could not handle. The federal government designed the IMD exclusion to prevent states from offloading institutional costs to Medicaid. States accelerated deinstitutionalization to move patients onto federal SSI and Medicaid rolls. Each maneuver succeeded in moving costs but failed to ensure that adequate care followed the patient.

### Pattern 2: Reform Without Adequate Funding Produces Worse Outcomes

Every major structural reform -- deinstitutionalization, community mental health centers, block grants, parity legislation -- was initially underfunded relative to its ambitions. The Community Mental Health Act promised 2,000 centers; only 789 were built. Parity laws required equal coverage but not adequate coverage. The ACA expanded insurance but not the workforce to deliver care. The lesson is clear: structural reform without commensurate investment creates new categories of unmet need.

### Pattern 3: Crisis Creates Funding Surges That Fade

The pattern of crisis-driven appropriations (post-Sandy Hook, opioid epidemic, COVID-19 pandemic) followed by reversion to baseline funding levels has prevented the development of sustainable mental health infrastructure. Each funding surge expands services temporarily, but the lack of permanent baseline increases means that providers must repeatedly build and dismantle capacity.
