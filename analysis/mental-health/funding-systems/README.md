# Mental Health Funding Systems

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of how mental health services are financed in the United States, examining the fragmented patchwork of federal, state, county, and private funding streams that shapes access to care for tens of millions of Americans.

## Overview

Mental health funding in the United States is not a coherent system but a collection of overlapping, often contradictory financing mechanisms developed over decades of piecemeal legislation. Medicaid is the single largest payer for mental health services, covering approximately 21% of all mental health spending, yet its coverage is constrained by the Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion, which bars federal reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care in facilities with more than 16 beds. The Mental Health Block Grant, SAMHSA discretionary grants, Medicare, commercial insurance, state general funds, and county appropriations each fill parts of the gap, but none provides comprehensive coverage on its own.

The result is a system in which funding availability is determined more by a person's insurance status, geographic location, and diagnosis than by clinical need. The Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) model and the Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act represent promising steps toward prospective payment and integrated care, but they remain demonstration programs rather than permanent national policy. This analysis examines the full landscape of mental health financing, identifies the structural failures that produce chronic underfunding, and proposes reforms to create a more rational, adequate, and equitable funding architecture.
