# Mental Health Funding Systems: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current challenges in mental health financing are not the result of a single failure but of several long-term, interlocking dynamics: the historical separation of mental health from general health care, the fragmentation of responsibility across levels of government, the political weakness of the primary beneficiary population, and economic incentives that reward cost-shifting over effective treatment. These structural forces explain why mental health remains chronically underfunded despite broad bipartisan agreement that the system is broken.

## Structural Fragmentation

### No Single Accountable Entity

Unlike physical health care, where CMS (for Medicare and Medicaid), state insurance departments (for commercial plans), and employer benefits departments each have defined oversight roles, mental health funding is administered by SAMHSA (block grants), CMS (Medicaid and Medicare), state mental health authorities, county behavioral health departments, the VA, and private insurers simultaneously. No single entity is responsible for ensuring that total funding is adequate or that services reach the people who need them.

**Evidence**: A 2019 GAO report (GAO-19-274) found that at least 13 federal agencies administered 112 programs related to mental health, with "limited coordination and potential overlap." State auditors in California, New York, and Texas have documented parallel findings at the state level, where mental health funding flows through multiple departments with separate reporting requirements and no unified outcome tracking.

### Categorical Funding Silos

Federal mental health funding is distributed through dozens of categorical programs, each with its own eligibility criteria, allowable uses, reporting requirements, and application processes. A community mental health center may simultaneously receive funding from Medicaid fee-for-service, a CCBHC demonstration grant, the Mental Health Block Grant, PATH (for homeless services), a SAMHSA discretionary grant, state general fund appropriations, and county levy dollars -- each requiring separate documentation, compliance activities, and audits.

**Evidence**: The National Council for Mental Wellbeing reported in 2022 that community behavioral health organizations spend an average of 17% of their revenue on billing and administrative compliance, compared to 8-12% for general medical practices. For organizations receiving five or more distinct funding streams, administrative costs can exceed 25% of revenue.

## The IMD Exclusion as a Structural Barrier

### Legal Architecture of Exclusion

The IMD exclusion, enacted in 1965, was a fiscal policy decision -- not a clinical one. By prohibiting federal Medicaid matching for care in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds, Congress ensured that states would continue to bear the full cost of institutional psychiatric care. The exclusion has no analog in general medicine; there is no restriction on Medicaid reimbursement for hospitals of any size providing medical or surgical care.

**Evidence**: The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2019 that full repeal of the IMD exclusion would cost the federal government $3.4-$5.9 billion annually, because states would shift existing state-funded institutional costs to the federal Medicaid match. This confirms that the exclusion functions primarily as a cost-allocation mechanism, not a clinical standard.

### Downstream Effects

The IMD exclusion contributes to:

- Emergency department boarding of psychiatric patients (average 34 hours vs. 4.3 hours for medical patients, per ACEP, 2022)
- Reliance on the criminal justice system as a de facto psychiatric inpatient system
- Proliferation of "16-bed" facilities designed to comply with the exclusion threshold rather than to meet clinical need
- State reluctance to invest in inpatient psychiatric capacity that cannot be partially offset by federal Medicaid matching

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| State governments | Avoid increased state Medicaid match costs from expanding coverage | Billions annually in avoided state costs | Resist new mandates or match requirements |
| Managed care organizations (MCOs) | Intermediation profits from administering Medicaid behavioral health | $18+ billion in annual Medicaid BH managed care revenue (Milliman, 2022) | Oppose models that bypass MCO intermediation |
| Commercial insurers | Lower costs from under-reimbursing mental health providers | Estimated $10-$15 billion annually in avoided costs from parity non-compliance (Kennedy Forum, 2023) | Oppose stronger parity enforcement and rate adequacy mandates |
| Pharmaceutical companies | Current system generates high drug spending relative to therapy | ~$37 billion in psychotropic drug sales (IQVIA, 2022) | Prefer medication-focused care over investment in psychosocial services |
| Congressional appropriators | Block grants allow fiscal control | Fixed annual outlays vs. open-ended entitlement risk | Prefer discretionary spending (controllable) over entitlement expansion |

### Perverse Incentives

The current funding architecture creates multiple incentives that work against effective care:

- **Medicaid fee-for-service** rewards brief medication checks over longer therapy sessions, because 15-minute medication management visits generate higher hourly revenue than 45-minute therapy sessions at current reimbursement rates.
- **The IMD exclusion** incentivizes states to keep psychiatric facilities at exactly 16 beds or fewer, regardless of community need, and to route psychiatric patients through general hospital emergency departments (where Medicaid does pay) rather than dedicated psychiatric facilities.
- **Block grant funding** creates a ceiling effect: because block grant amounts are fixed regardless of need, states with growing populations or rising mental health prevalence receive no additional federal support.
- **Parity law structure** requires non-quantitative treatment limitation (NQTL) comparability testing but imposes minimal penalties for non-compliance, making it economically rational for insurers to under-comply and pay occasional penalties rather than achieve full parity.

## Stigma and Political Weakness

### The Beneficiary Population Lacks Political Power

People with serious mental illness -- the primary beneficiaries of mental health funding reform -- face barriers to political engagement that are inherent to their conditions. Cognitive impairment, social isolation, homelessness, and incarceration reduce the capacity for sustained advocacy. Unlike organized disease-specific lobbies (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease), mental health advocacy is fragmented among dozens of organizations with overlapping but non-identical agendas.

**Evidence**: In the 2022 election cycle, mental health-related political action committees contributed less than $5 million to federal candidates, compared to $40 million from hospital and nursing home PACs and over $80 million from pharmaceutical industry PACs (OpenSecrets, 2023).

### Structural Stigma in Fiscal Policy

The IMD exclusion itself is a codification of structural stigma: it treats psychiatric facilities differently from all other health care facilities solely because they serve people with mental illness. No comparable restriction exists for cancer hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, or long-term care nursing homes.

## Workforce-Funding Disconnect

### Funding That Cannot Be Spent

Even when funding is available, the mental health workforce shortage prevents its effective deployment. Approximately 160 million Americans live in designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HRSA, 2024). Community mental health centers report that unfilled positions are a more binding constraint than funding levels, because existing reimbursement rates are too low to attract qualified clinicians.

**Evidence**: A 2023 survey by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing found that 93% of community behavioral health organizations reported difficulty recruiting clinical staff, and 73% had turned away clients due to insufficient staff capacity. Average community mental health center salaries for licensed clinicians were $55,000-$65,000, compared to $85,000-$120,000 in private practice or hospital settings (NCCBH, 2023).

## Why Reform Has Failed

### Incremental Approaches Cannot Overcome Structural Problems

Past reforms have targeted individual symptoms rather than the structural architecture. Parity legislation addressed insurance benefit design but not provider payment adequacy. The ACA expanded coverage but not the workforce to deliver care. CCBHC demonstrations proved the prospective payment model works but did not make it universal. Each reform addressed one piece of the fragmentation puzzle while leaving the others intact.

### Fiscal Federalism Creates a Collective Action Problem

Because mental health funding is shared between federal and state governments, neither level has sufficient incentive to solve the problem unilaterally. The federal government could increase block grant funding, but states might substitute federal dollars for state dollars rather than expanding services. States could increase reimbursement rates, but doing so increases both state and federal spending, and states have limited control over federal matching formulas.

### Crisis-Driven Budgeting Prevents Sustained Investment

Mental health funding increases tend to follow high-profile tragedies (mass shootings, celebrity suicides, pandemic-era mental health crises) and fade as public attention shifts. The pattern of crisis-driven supplemental appropriations followed by reversion to baseline prevents the multi-year, predictable investment needed to build sustainable infrastructure and workforce.
