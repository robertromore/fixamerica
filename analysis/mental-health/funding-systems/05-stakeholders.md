# Mental Health Funding Systems: Stakeholders

The financing of mental health services in the United States is shaped by the interactions of federal agencies, state and county governments, providers, insurers, advocacy organizations, and the tens of millions of Americans who live with mental illness. Each group has distinct interests, resources, and levels of power over how funding decisions are made.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Adults with any mental illness (AMI) | Directly affected by funding levels, insurance coverage, provider availability | 57.8 million (2022, SAMHSA NSDUH) | Affordable, accessible, comprehensive treatment |
| Adults with serious mental illness (SMI) | Most severely affected; most dependent on public funding | 14.1 million (2022, SAMHSA NSDUH) | Inpatient access, crisis services, long-term support, housing |
| Children/adolescents with SED | Dependent on Medicaid, CHIP, and school-based services | 7.7 million (2022, SAMHSA NSDUH) | Early intervention, school-based services, family support |
| Families and caregivers | Bear financial, emotional, and time costs of caregiving | ~8.4 million family caregivers for adults with SMI (NAMI, 2023) | Respite services, navigation support, caregiver health |
| Uninsured adults with mental illness | No coverage for treatment; rely on safety net | ~6.3 million uninsured with AMI (2022, SAMHSA NSDUH) | Any coverage pathway, safety-net funding |
| People with mental illness in jails/prisons | Receive inadequate treatment; system of last resort | ~2 million with SMI cycle through jails annually (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022) | Diversion programs, reentry coverage, pre-release Medicaid |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Employers**: Mental illness costs employers an estimated $210 billion annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and disability (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2023). Employers have a financial interest in effective treatment but resist mandate-driven cost increases.
- **Emergency departments**: EDs serve as the default entry point for psychiatric crises. In 2022, mental health-related ED visits accounted for approximately 6.4 million visits, with an average boarding time of 34 hours for patients awaiting psychiatric placement (ACEP, 2022).
- **Law enforcement**: Police respond to an estimated 10% of all calls involving people with mental illness. Local law enforcement budgets absorb the cost of mental health crisis response in the absence of adequate community services (PERF, 2023).
- **Taxpayers**: Total public spending on mental health exceeds $150 billion annually across all levels of government. Taxpayers bear costs through both direct appropriations and indirect costs (ED use, incarceration, homelessness services).

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Congress (Appropriations Committees) | Sets federal funding levels for SAMHSA, MHBG, and authorizes Medicaid reforms | Spending power, legislative authority | Controls federal discretionary and mandatory spending | High |
| Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) | Administers Medicaid/Medicare, approves state plan amendments and 1115 waivers | Regulatory authority over nation's largest payers | $1.5+ trillion annual Medicaid/Medicare budget | High |
| SAMHSA | Administers block grants, discretionary grants, and CCBHC programs | Grant administration, technical assistance, data collection | $9.5 billion budget (FY2024) | Medium |
| State legislatures | Set state mental health budgets, Medicaid eligibility, and provider licensing | State appropriations authority, Medicaid state plan control | Varies by state; $44.8 billion total SMHA spending (FY2021) | High |
| State Mental Health Authorities (SMHAs) | Administer state MH systems, allocate block grant funds, manage state hospitals | Direct service delivery and contracting authority | Varies by state | Medium |
| Governors | Propose state budgets, control executive branch agencies, apply for federal waivers | Executive authority, budget proposal | Agenda-setting power | High |
| County boards of supervisors | In many states, set local mental health levies and contracts | Local taxing authority, service contracting | Varies widely by county | Medium (in county-administered states) |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: The largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization, with 600+ local affiliates and over 500,000 members. NAMI advocates for increased funding, parity enforcement, and CCBHC expansion. Annual revenue approximately $35 million (2022).
- **National Council for Mental Wellbeing**: Represents over 3,300 community behavioral health organizations. The National Council has been the primary advocate for CCBHC expansion and serves as the technical assistance provider for CCBHC implementation.
- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: The professional association for psychiatrists (38,800 members). The APA advocates for Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement increases and opposes scope-of-practice expansions for non-physician providers.
- **American Psychological Association**: Represents 146,000+ psychologists. Advocates for parity enforcement, inclusion of psychologists in integrated care teams, and expanded reimbursement.
- **National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD)**: Represents the 56 state and territory mental health commissioners. NASMHPD provides data, technical assistance, and a collective voice for state mental health systems.
- **Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC)**: Independent federal body that advises Congress on Medicaid policy, including mental health coverage and payment adequacy.

### Influencers

- **Insurance industry (AHIP, BlueCross BlueShield Association)**: Lobby against stronger parity enforcement and rate adequacy mandates. The health insurance industry spent $163 million on federal lobbying in 2022 (OpenSecrets, 2023).
- **Pharmaceutical industry (PhRMA)**: Support coverage expansion for psychotropic medications but oppose policies that would shift spending from medications to psychosocial services. Pharma PACs contributed over $80 million to federal candidates in the 2022 cycle (OpenSecrets, 2023).
- **Managed care organizations (Centene, Molina, UnitedHealth)**: Administer Medicaid behavioral health in most states. MCOs support payment models that flow through their intermediation and resist direct-to-provider payment approaches.
- **Kennedy Forum**: Founded by former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, advocates for mental health parity enforcement. Has been instrumental in pushing for CMS and DOL enforcement actions.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAMI + National Council + APA + NASMHPD | Increased federal mental health funding | Strong |
| Providers + patients + families | CCBHC expansion and higher reimbursement rates | Strong |
| Criminal justice reformers + mental health advocates | Diversion funding, pre-release Medicaid | Moderate |
| Employers + insurers (narrow) | Effective treatment that reduces disability costs | Moderate |
| State governments + CMS | Section 1115 waivers for flexibility (divergent on funding levels) | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Providers vs. MCOs**: Community mental health providers want higher reimbursement and less administrative burden; MCOs profit from managing (and restricting) utilization.
- **States vs. Federal government**: States want maximum federal funding with minimum federal oversight; the federal government wants accountability for how funds are used.
- **Psychiatrists vs. other mental health professionals**: Psychiatrists defend scope-of-practice restrictions and physician-level reimbursement; psychologists, social workers, and counselors seek expanded billing authority and higher rates.
- **Institutional vs. community care advocates**: Some advocates for people with SMI support IMD exclusion repeal to expand inpatient access; community mental health advocates fear repeal would divert funding back to institutional settings.

### The Iron Triangle of Mental Health Under-Funding

The persistent underfunding of mental health services is sustained by an interlocking set of relationships:

1. **Congressional appropriators** prefer discretionary block grants (which they control annually) over entitlement expansions (which grow automatically).
2. **State officials** prefer federal funding without federal mandates, making block grants politically attractive even though they produce inadequate total funding.
3. **Insurance industry lobbyists** resist parity enforcement and rate adequacy requirements that would increase private-sector mental health spending, leaving more of the burden on public systems.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on mental health funding policy:

- **Lobbying**: The health insurance industry spent $163 million on federal lobbying in 2022. Mental health advocacy organizations spent approximately $12 million total -- a 14:1 ratio favoring the status quo (OpenSecrets, 2023).
- **Campaign Contributions**: Mental health-related PACs contributed less than $5 million to federal candidates in the 2022 cycle, compared to $40 million from hospital/nursing home PACs and $80 million from pharmaceutical PACs (OpenSecrets, 2023).
- **Revolving Door**: Former CMS and SAMHSA officials frequently move to managed care organizations and consulting firms that advise states on Medicaid behavioral health contracting.
- **Public Advocacy**: NAMI's annual "NAMIWalks" events raise $15+ million annually and generate significant media coverage, but this grassroots advocacy has not translated into proportional policy influence.
- **Expertise/Information**: NASMHPD and MACPAC produce influential data and analysis that shapes congressional understanding of mental health funding needs, but their recommendations are often not implemented due to fiscal constraints.
