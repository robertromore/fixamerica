# Mental Health Funding Systems: Current State

## Total Mental Health Spending

The United States spent an estimated $280 billion on mental health and substance use disorder treatment services in 2020, representing approximately 5.5% of total national health expenditures. Mental health spending has grown in nominal terms but has not kept pace with the growing prevalence of mental illness, the expansion of evidence-based treatments, or the rising cost of care delivery.

### Spending by Payer

| Payer | Share of Mental Health Spending | Estimated Amount (2020) | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Medicaid | 27% | ~$75.6 billion | Increasing | Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023 |
| Private Insurance | 22% | ~$61.6 billion | Stable | SAMHSA NHED, 2023 |
| State and Local Government (non-Medicaid) | 13% | ~$36.4 billion | Declining as share | SAMHSA NHED, 2023 |
| Medicare | 8% | ~$22.4 billion | Increasing | CMS, 2023 |
| Out-of-Pocket | 11% | ~$30.8 billion | Stable | SAMHSA NHED, 2023 |
| Other Federal (VA, DoD, IHS, SAMHSA grants) | 10% | ~$28.0 billion | Increasing | SAMHSA NHED, 2023 |
| Other Private (philanthropy, self-pay facilities) | 9% | ~$25.2 billion | Stable | SAMHSA NHED, 2023 |

### Per Capita Mental Health Spending

| Metric | Value | Comparison | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| U.S. per capita mental health spending | ~$843 (2020) | Higher than OECD average | OECD Health Statistics, 2023 |
| Mental health share of total health spending | 5.5% | Below burden of disease (est. 13%) | Lancet Commission, 2018 |
| Growth rate (2014-2020) | 52% nominal | Inflation-adjusted growth ~28% | SAMHSA NHED, 2023 |

## Medicaid: The Largest Payer

Medicaid is the single largest source of funding for mental health services in the United States. In FY2021, Medicaid covered approximately 94 million enrollees, of whom an estimated 13.4 million received at least one mental health service.

### Medicaid Mental Health Coverage

Section 1396d(a)(B), prohibits federal Medicaid matching payments for care provided to adults aged 21-64 in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds. This exclusion applies only to mental health and substance use disorder facilities, not to general medical hospitals of any size.

## Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs)

The CCBHC model, first authorized by the Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-93, Section 223), represents a shift from fee-for-service to prospective, cost-based payment for community behavioral health services.

### CCBHC Key Metrics

|---|---|---|

## State and Local Funding

### State Mental Health Authority Budgets

State Mental Health Authorities (SMHAs) collectively spent $44.8 billion in FY2021, of which approximately 64% came from state general funds and 29% from federal sources (primarily Medicaid matching).

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total SMHA expenditures (FY2021) | $44.8 billion | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| State general fund share | 64% (~$28.7 billion) | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| Federal fund share | 29% (~$13.0 billion) | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| Per capita SMHA spending (national average) | $135 (FY2021) | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| Highest per capita (District of Columbia) | $468 (FY2021) | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| Lowest per capita (Texas) | $47 (FY2021) | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| Ratio of highest to lowest per capita | 10:1 | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |

### Geographic Variation

State mental health spending per capita varies by a factor of 10, reflecting profound differences in political commitment, Medicaid expansion status, tax capacity, and historical investment.

| State Category | Avg. Per Capita SMHA Spending (FY2021) | Examples | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| High-spending states | $200+ | DC ($468), NY ($298), CT ($243) | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| Middle-spending states | $100-$200 | WA ($182), OR ($155), MN ($148) | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| Low-spending states | Under $100 | TX ($47), FL ($68), GA ($72) | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |

### County-Level Funding

In many states, counties bear direct responsibility for funding and delivering mental health services. This creates additional fragmentation and inequality.

- **California**: Counties receive Mental Health Services Act (MHSA/Proposition 63) revenue from a 1% income tax surcharge on incomes over $1 million, generating approximately $3.7 billion annually (FY2023). County allocations vary widely based on population and millionaire density (California DHCS, 2023).
- **Ohio**: County Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and Mental Health (ADAMH) boards levy local property taxes to fund services. Per capita spending ranges from $28 to $198 across counties (Ohio ADAMH Board Association, 2023).
- **Colorado**: Regional behavioral health administrative service organizations coordinate services across counties, with state general fund appropriations supplemented by marijuana tax revenue (Colorado BHA, 2023).

## Commercial Insurance

### Parity Law Compliance

The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008 requires group health plans and insurers to provide mental health benefits that are no more restrictive than medical/surgical benefits.

| Indicator | Current Value | 5-Year Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plans subject to MHPAEA | ~210 million covered lives | Stable | DOL, 2023 |
| Prior authorization rates for MH outpatient | 2.5x higher than medical | Worsening | Milliman, 2021 |
| Out-of-network utilization for MH services | 5.4x higher than medical | Worsening | Milliman, 2021 |
| States with parity enforcement staff | 23 states with dedicated parity staff | Improving | Kennedy Forum, 2023 |
| DOL MHPAEA enforcement actions (FY2022) | 158 investigations, 32 corrective actions | Increasing | DOL EBSA, 2023 |

### Reimbursement Gaps

| Metric | Mental Health | Medical/Surgical | Gap | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| In-network provider participation | 55% of psychiatrists in-network | 85% of PCPs in-network | 30 percentage points | Milliman, 2021 |
| Average commercial reimbursement for therapy (90834) | $97 | N/A (comparison: E/M office visit ~$130) | Below comparable visit | Fair Health, 2023 |
| Annual claim denials | 12% of MH claims denied | 6% of medical claims denied | 2x higher | APA, 2023 |

## Uncompensated Care

Community mental health centers and safety-net providers deliver substantial volumes of unreimbursed care.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Uncompensated MH care (community MH centers) | ~$5.4 billion annually | NCCBH, 2023 |
| Share of CMHC clients who are uninsured | 14% | SAMHSA USSPS, 2022 |
| Share of CMHC clients on Medicaid | 46% | SAMHSA USSPS, 2022 |
| Cost of uncompensated crisis care (ED boarding) | ~$2.2 billion annually | ACEP, 2022 |

---

## Recent Trends

- **988 Implementation (2022-present)**: The launch of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in July 2022 created new demand for crisis services, with call volume increasing 40% in the first year. Federal funding of $502 million (FY2024) remains below the estimated $3.7 billion annual cost of a comprehensive national crisis system (Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute, 2023).
- **Post-Pandemic Funding Cliff**: The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and other pandemic-era legislation provided approximately $5.5 billion in supplemental mental health funding (2020-2023). As these funds expire, many states face significant shortfalls in behavioral health capacity (NASMHPD, 2023).
- **CCBHC Expansion**: The number of CCBHCs grew from 67 demonstration clinics in 8 states (2017) to over 540 in 46 states (2024), driven by SAMHSA expansion grants and growing state adoption of the model through Medicaid state plan amendments (National Council, 2024).
- **Medicaid Unwinding**: The end of the continuous enrollment provision in April 2023 led to an estimated 1.5 million people with mental health conditions losing Medicaid coverage through administrative churning rather than ineligibility (KFF, 2024).

## Emerging Challenges

- **Workforce-Funding Mismatch**: Even when funding is available, the mental health workforce shortage prevents its effective deployment. Approximately 160 million Americans live in designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HRSA, 2024).
- **Managed Care Intermediation**: As states shift Medicaid behavioral health into managed care, the additional administrative layer of managed care organizations (MCOs) can reduce the share of funding that reaches direct service providers.
- **Measurement and Accountability**: No unified data system tracks mental health spending across all payers, making it impossible to determine whether total investment is adequate or whether funds are reaching the populations and services with the greatest need.
