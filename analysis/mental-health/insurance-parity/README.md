# Insurance Parity

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of mental health and substance use disorder insurance parity in the United States, focusing on the gap between the legal promise of equal coverage and the reality experienced by patients seeking care.

## Overview

The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) of 2008 established the principle that health insurers must cover mental health and substance use disorder (MH/SUD) benefits no more restrictively than medical and surgical benefits. Despite this landmark law, enforcement gaps, ambiguous regulatory guidance, and insurer practices have perpetuated a two-tiered system in which Americans seeking behavioral health care face higher denial rates, narrower provider networks, and more burdensome prior authorization requirements than those seeking treatment for physical conditions.

This analysis examines the legal framework of federal and state parity laws, the persistent enforcement challenges that undermine compliance, and the specific mechanisms -- including nonquantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs), network adequacy failures, and claims denials -- through which insurers circumvent parity requirements. It explores the 2024 final rule strengthening NQTL compliance standards, the role of state insurance regulators, and proposed federal and state legislative solutions to close remaining gaps.

The analysis covers the full spectrum of parity enforcement, from the regulatory architecture governing employer-sponsored plans and individual market coverage to the practical impact on the approximately 150 million Americans whose plans are subject to MHPAEA. It proposes evidence-based reforms to achieve the law's original intent: that no American faces greater barriers to mental health care than to physical health care solely because of how their insurance plan is designed.
