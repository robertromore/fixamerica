# Mental Health Insurance Parity: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Achieving genuine mental health insurance parity requires a phased strategy that begins with implementing and strengthening existing law, builds enforcement infrastructure, and ultimately expands parity protections to all insurance products. The three-phase approach is designed so that each phase creates the political momentum, institutional capacity, and evidentiary base needed for the next.

Phase 1 focuses on maximizing the impact of the 2024 final rule by ensuring plans comply with new NQTL requirements, expanding DOL enforcement capacity, and launching transparency initiatives that make compliance measurable. Phase 2 enacts new federal legislation to close the ERISA preemption gap, establish reimbursement rate floors, and extend parity to Medicare fee-for-service. Phase 3 achieves universal parity across all insurance products, standardizes enforcement nationally, and ensures that parity in benefit design translates into parity in patient outcomes.

The theory of change is straightforward: parity violations persist because they are profitable, undetectable, and unpunished. Each phase addresses one or more of these conditions -- making violations detectable through data, costly through penalties, and unprofitable through reimbursement reform.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation and Enforcement (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Ensure full implementation of the 2024 final rule's NQTL comparative analysis and outcomes data requirements on schedule
- Expand DOL enforcement capacity to conduct proactive compliance audits rather than relying solely on patient complaints
- Launch a public Parity Scorecard that enables consumers, employers, and regulators to compare plan compliance
- Implement prior authorization reform standards for MH/SUD services

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Publish standardized NQTL comparison methodology | DOL/HHS/Treasury | Months 1-12 | $5 million for technical advisory committee; interagency staff | Methodology published and adopted by plans |
| Hire 50 additional EBSA parity investigators | DOL | Months 1-18 | $15 million annual appropriation | Investigator count from ~500 to ~550 |
| Develop Parity Scorecard data collection framework | CMS/DOL | Months 6-18 | $25 million for IT infrastructure and data systems | Framework published; plan reporting begins |
| Issue prior authorization timing standards for MH/SUD | DOL/CMS | Months 6-12 | Regulatory staff time; minimal direct cost | Standards published; 24-hour urgent, 72-hour routine |
| Establish parity compliance technical assistance program | DOL | Months 3-12 | $10 million for templates, webinars, training | 1,000+ plans receiving technical assistance |
| Launch MH/SUD claims denial monitoring dashboard | DOL/CMS | Months 12-24 | $8 million for data analytics platform | Dashboard live; baseline denial rate data published |
| Begin targeted audits of largest self-insured plans | DOL EBSA | Months 6-24 | Existing + new staff; $3 million audit support | 100 self-insured plans audited in Year 1 |

### Legislative Requirements

- FY2026/FY2027 appropriations increase of $50-$65 million for DOL EBSA parity enforcement and CMS Parity Scorecard development
- Authorization of prior authorization timing standards through regulatory action under existing MHPAEA authority (no new legislation required)
- Congressional oversight hearings on 2024 final rule implementation (Senate HELP Committee, House Education & Workforce Committee)

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, plans will have submitted their first round of NQTL comparative analyses with outcomes data under the 2024 final rule. DOL will have audited at least 100 of the largest self-insured plans and published compliance findings. The standardized NQTL comparison methodology will be available, reducing the analytical burden on plans and creating a uniform compliance standard. The Parity Scorecard data collection framework will be operational, with the first public reports expected in early Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Legislative Expansion and Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Enact federal legislation establishing mandatory public parity reporting (Parity Scorecard)
- Close the ERISA preemption gap through federal-state enforcement delegation
- Establish a reimbursement rate floor (100% of Medicare) for MH/SUD services in commercial plans
- Extend MHPAEA requirements to Medicare fee-for-service (eliminate the 190-day psychiatric inpatient limit)
- Establish an independent third-party parity compliance audit system

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Enact Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act | Congress | Years 3-4 | Legislative staff; advocacy coalition effort | Bill signed into law |
| Establish federal-state parity enforcement delegation | DOL | Years 3-5 | $30-50 million in federal grants to qualifying states | 15+ states with delegated enforcement authority |
| Implement reimbursement rate floor regulation | DOL/CMS | Years 3-4 (18-month rulemaking) | Regulatory staff; actuarial analysis | Commercial MH/SUD rates at 100%+ of Medicare |
| Enact Medicare MH/SUD Parity Act | Congress | Years 4-5 | CBO scoring; $5-10 billion over 10 years | 190-day psychiatric limit eliminated |
| Launch independent compliance audit program | DOL | Years 4-5 | $15-25 million annually; certified auditor pool | 500+ plans audited per year by Year 5 |
| Publish first annual Parity Scorecard | CMS/DOL | Year 3 | Data collection infrastructure from Phase 1 | Plan-level parity data publicly available |
| Develop parity standards for telehealth and digital therapeutics | DOL/CMS | Years 3-5 | Interagency task force; $3 million | Telehealth parity guidance published |

### Legislative Requirements

- Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act: Authorizes Parity Scorecard, establishes compliance audit program, increases civil penalties for parity violations
- ERISA Amendment for Parity Enforcement: Creates federal-state delegation authority for MHPAEA enforcement of self-insured plans
- Medicare Mental Health Parity Act: Amends Title XVIII to apply MHPAEA requirements to Medicare fee-for-service; eliminates 42 U.S.C. section 1812(b)(3) 190-day psychiatric inpatient limit
- MH/SUD Provider Rate Parity Act: Establishes 100% of Medicare as minimum commercial reimbursement for MH/SUD services

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, the structural barriers to parity enforcement will be substantially addressed. The ERISA preemption gap will be narrowed through federal-state delegation, giving state regulators authority over self-insured plans for parity compliance purposes. The reimbursement rate floor will begin to improve network adequacy as more providers find network participation financially viable. Medicare beneficiaries will have parity protections for the first time. The Parity Scorecard will create competitive pressure among plans and actionable information for consumers and employers.

---

## Phase 3: Universal Parity and Outcome Measurement (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Achieve universal parity coverage across all insurance products, including Medicaid fee-for-service, TRICARE, and federal employee plans
- Measure and report outcome-level parity: denial rates, network adequacy, wait times, and patient satisfaction
- Develop and implement parity standards for emerging treatment modalities (psychedelic-assisted therapy, digital therapeutics, intensive outpatient programs)
- Achieve measurable convergence between MH/SUD and medical/surgical access metrics

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Extend MHPAEA to Medicaid FFS and TRICARE | Congress | Years 6-7 | Legislation; $3-5 billion over 10 years | All government insurance programs covered |
| Achieve 50-state enforcement coverage | DOL/States | Years 6-8 | Continued federal grant funding ($40 million/year) | All 50 states with active parity enforcement |
| Develop emerging modality parity standards | DOL/CMS | Years 6-8 | Technical advisory committee; $5 million | Standards published for telehealth, digital, psychedelic-assisted therapy |
| Conduct 10-year longitudinal parity outcomes study | SAMHSA/AHRQ | Years 7-10 | $20 million research appropriation | Peer-reviewed outcomes data published |
| Implement automatic compliance triggers | DOL | Years 8-10 | Regulatory action; data systems upgrade ($10 million) | Plans auto-flagged when denial rate disparity exceeds threshold |
| Publish 5th annual Parity Scorecard with trend data | CMS/DOL | Year 8 | Ongoing program costs | 5-year trend analysis showing convergence |

### Expected Outcomes

By Year 10, parity protections will cover all Americans with health insurance. Outcome-level metrics -- denial rates, out-of-network utilization, wait times -- will show measurable convergence between MH/SUD and medical/surgical benefits. The enforcement system will operate proactively through automated data monitoring and regular compliance audits, rather than reactively through patient complaints. Plans with persistent violations will face meaningful penalties, making non-compliance more expensive than compliance.

## Governance and Oversight

**Interagency Parity Enforcement Task Force**: Establish a standing task force comprising DOL (EBSA), HHS (CMS, SAMHSA), Treasury, and representatives from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The task force would coordinate enforcement strategy, share data, resolve jurisdictional issues, and produce an annual report to Congress on parity enforcement progress.

**Congressional reporting**: Require DOL to submit an annual Parity Enforcement Report to the Senate HELP Committee and House Education & Workforce Committee, including data on investigations, violations, corrective actions, monetary recoveries, and compliance trends.

**Public accountability**: Publish the Parity Scorecard annually with plan-level data, accessible through a searchable public website. Require plans found in violation to post corrective action notices on their member-facing websites and enrollment materials.

**Independent evaluation**: Commission AHRQ to conduct a 5-year evaluation of the 2024 final rule's impact on access, costs, and patient outcomes, with a mid-course report at Year 3 and a final report at Year 5.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Legal Challenges to the 2024 Final Rule

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: DOL and HHS should proactively defend the rule in litigation, coordinating with DOJ. The rule's legal foundation is supported by the statutory text of MHPAEA and the CAA of 2021. Build a strong administrative record through early enforcement actions that demonstrate the rule's workability.

**Contingency Plan**: If courts vacate portions of the rule, Congress should codify the outcomes data requirement through legislation. The bipartisan history of parity legislation makes this politically feasible.

### Risk 2: Insufficient Appropriations for Enforcement Expansion

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Frame enforcement funding as a cost-saving measure (reducing emergency room utilization, criminal justice costs, and lost productivity). Build bipartisan support by emphasizing the Domenici-Wellstone legacy. Pursue user fees on plans as an alternative funding mechanism.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal appropriations fall short, prioritize federal-state delegation to leverage existing state enforcement capacity. Focus limited federal resources on the largest self-insured plans with the most enrollees.

### Risk 3: Industry Compliance Through Data Manipulation

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: The standardized NQTL comparison methodology should include data validation requirements and audit trails. Independent third-party audits will provide a check on plan-generated data. Whistleblower protections for plan employees who report fraudulent compliance reporting.

**Contingency Plan**: If widespread data integrity issues emerge, shift to a sampling-based audit model in which DOL conducts its own data analysis using raw claims data obtained through subpoena authority.

### Risk 4: Small Employer Compliance Burden

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Low to Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: The technical assistance program in Phase 1 should specifically target small and mid-size self-insured employers. Provide free compliance templates, standardized comparison tools, and DOL-hosted webinars. Allow small employers to rely on their TPA's or insurer's comparative analyses.

**Contingency Plan**: If compliance rates among small employers remain low despite technical assistance, consider a phased compliance schedule that applies the most burdensome requirements only to plans with 5,000+ enrollees initially.

### Risk 5: Workforce Shortage Limits Access Despite Parity Compliance

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Phase 2's reimbursement rate floor will increase provider network participation. Complement parity enforcement with workforce expansion initiatives (graduate medical education funding for psychiatry, loan repayment programs). Integrate telehealth parity standards to expand geographic access.

**Contingency Plan**: If workforce constraints persist despite reimbursement reform, establish time-limited network adequacy standards that account for genuine supply constraints while requiring plans to demonstrate good-faith recruitment efforts and competitive reimbursement.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Cost | Funding Source | Notes |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Yrs 1-2) | $65-$85 million | DOL/CMS appropriations | Investigators, IT, technical assistance |
| Phase 2 (Yrs 3-5) | $250-$400 million | Appropriations + plan user fees | Legislation, state grants, Medicare expansion |
| Phase 3 (Yrs 6-10) | $150-$250 million | Appropriations + self-sustaining audit fees | Sustained enforcement, research, expansion |
| **Total (10 years)** | **$465-$735 million** | | Offset by reduced ER, criminal justice costs |

Note: CBO estimates that untreated MH/SUD conditions cost the U.S. economy $280 billion annually (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023). Even modest improvements in treatment access would generate savings that far exceed enforcement costs.

### Personnel

| Phase | New FTEs | Expertise Required |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Phase 1 | 80-100 | EBSA investigators, actuaries, data analysts, IT staff |
| Phase 2 | 50-75 | State grant managers, audit program staff, rulemaking teams |
| Phase 3 | 30-50 | Research staff, emerging modality specialists, program evaluators |

### Infrastructure

- **Data systems**: Parity Scorecard reporting platform; claims data analytics capability; automated compliance monitoring dashboard ($25-40 million total)
- **Training facilities**: Parity compliance training program for state regulators, plan administrators, and certified auditors ($5 million)
- **Legal support**: DOL Solicitor's Office expansion for parity litigation and regulatory defense ($8 million annually)
