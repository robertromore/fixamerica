# Mental Health Insurance Parity: Legislation

## Overview

Achieving genuine mental health insurance parity requires a legislative strategy that operates on multiple levels. Federal legislation must strengthen enforcement mechanisms, close the ERISA preemption gap, establish reimbursement rate standards, and extend parity protections to populations currently outside MHPAEA's reach. State model legislation must empower state insurance departments to conduct proactive enforcement for fully insured plans. The approach is incremental by necessity -- building on MHPAEA's existing framework rather than replacing it -- but ambitious in scope, addressing the structural conditions that have allowed parity violations to persist for over 15 years since MHPAEA's enactment.

No constitutional amendments are required. MHPAEA's constitutional foundation rests on the Commerce Clause (regulation of employer-sponsored health plans engaged in interstate commerce) and the Spending Clause (conditions on federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid). Both are well-established.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments required for this reform.* MHPAEA and its proposed extensions operate within Congress's well-established Commerce Clause and Spending Clause authority. Federal courts have consistently upheld MHPAEA's application to employer-sponsored plans under ERISA. Extension to Medicare and Medicaid operates under the Spending Clause, which authorizes Congress to impose conditions on federal spending programs.

## Federal Legislation

### The Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen MHPAEA enforcement by establishing mandatory public parity reporting, an independent compliance audit system, meaningful civil penalties for parity violations, and standardized NQTL comparison methodology.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Mandatory annual parity compliance reporting by all plans subject to MHPAEA, with data published through a public Parity Scorecard
2. Independent third-party compliance audits on a 3-year cycle for plans with 1,000+ enrollees
3. Civil penalties of $100 per enrollee per day for parity violations that persist after notice, with a minimum of $500,000 per violation
4. Development and publication of a standardized NQTL comparison methodology by an interagency technical advisory committee

**Draft Text**:

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To strengthen enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction
Equity Act through mandatory compliance reporting, independent audits,
and meaningful civil penalties.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Department of Labor (2023), 100 percent of
initial nonquantitative treatment limitation (NQTL) comparative
analyses submitted by health plans were found insufficient under
the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA).

(2) Mental health and substance use disorder (MH/SUD) claims are
denied at a rate of 22.4 percent compared to 11.7 percent for
medical and surgical claims (Milliman, 2023).

(3) Out-of-network utilization for MH/SUD services is 5.4 times
higher than for medical and surgical services (Milliman, 2023),
indicating severe network inadequacy.

(4) Fewer than 0.5 percent of denied MH/SUD claims are appealed
by patients, yet 50 to 75 percent of appeals that reach external
review are overturned (DOL EBSA, 2023; NAIC, 2023).

(5) The Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security
Administration oversees approximately 2.5 million health plans
with approximately 500 investigators, making proactive
enforcement of MHPAEA infeasible without additional resources.

(6) An estimated 28.5 million adults with MH/SUD conditions did
not receive treatment in 2022, with 42 percent citing insurance
or cost barriers (SAMHSA, 2023).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) SECRETARY.--The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Labor,
except when referring to CMS functions, in which case it means
the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

(2) PLAN.--The term "plan" means any group health plan or health
insurance issuer subject to section 712 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1185a) or

300gg-26).

(3) PARITY SCORECARD.--The term "Parity Scorecard" means the
public reporting system established under section 4 of this Act.

(4) NQTL.--The term "NQTL" means a nonquantitative treatment
limitation as defined in 29 CFR 2590.712(c)(4).

(5) CERTIFIED PARITY AUDITOR.--The term "certified parity auditor"
means an independent auditor certified by the Secretary under
section 5 of this Act.

SEC. 4. MANDATORY PARITY COMPLIANCE REPORTING AND SCORECARD.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Reporting and Scorecard)**: Creates the data infrastructure needed for transparent enforcement. Public reporting of plan-level parity data enables consumers and employers to make informed choices and creates competitive pressure for compliance.
- **Section 5 (Independent Audits)**: Shifts from complaint-driven enforcement to proactive verification. Third-party audits provide an independent check on plan-generated compliance data.
- **Section 6 (Civil Penalties)**: Addresses the penalty asymmetry identified in root cause analysis. Current DOL enforcement recovers minimal amounts; meaningful penalties make non-compliance more expensive than compliance.
- **Section 8 (Appropriations)**: $290 million over 5 years funds enforcement infrastructure. Offset by an estimated $280 billion annual cost of untreated MH/SUD conditions (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023).

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Technical Advisory Committee established | 6 months after enactment | DOL |
| Standardized NQTL methodology published | 18 months after enactment | DOL/HHS/Treasury |
| Parity Scorecard launched | 18 months after enactment | DOL/CMS |
| First parity compliance reports due | 18 months after enactment (first applicable plan year end + 120 days) | Plans |
| Auditor certification standards published | 12 months after enactment | DOL |
| First audit cycle begins | 24 months after enactment | Certified auditors |
| First annual Congressional report | 180 days after enactment | DOL |

**Regulatory Authority**: DOL (EBSA) serves as lead enforcement agency for ERISA-governed plans. CMS enforces for individual/small group market plans and Medicaid managed care. Both agencies jointly develop reporting standards and the Parity Scorecard.

**Challenges**:

- **Industry lobbying**: AHIP, ERIC, and the Chamber of Commerce will oppose mandatory reporting and penalty provisions. Counter with bipartisan parity history and constituent stories.
- **Data standardization**: Creating uniform reporting metrics across diverse plan designs requires significant actuarial and technical work.
- **Auditor supply**: Building a pool of certified parity auditors will take time. Phase implementation to prioritize the largest plans first.

**Refinements**:

- **Safe harbor provision**: Plans that voluntarily achieve denial rate parity within 2 percentage points and out-of-network parity within 2x could receive a 3-year audit exemption, rewarding compliance.
- **Small plan accommodation**: Plans with fewer than 1,000 enrollees could be exempt from independent audits but still subject to reporting requirements and DOL compliance reviews.

### The ERISA Parity Enforcement Amendment

**Purpose**: Create a federal-state partnership for MHPAEA enforcement of self-insured employer plans, closing the ERISA preemption gap that currently prevents state insurance departments from examining self-insured plans for parity compliance.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Amends ERISA section 514 to create a limited exception for MHPAEA enforcement
2. Authorizes DOL to delegate parity enforcement authority to qualified state insurance departments
3. Establishes federal grants for state enforcement programs meeting minimum standards
4. Preserves ERISA preemption for all non-parity aspects of self-insured plan regulation

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "ERISA Parity Enforcement Amendment
of 2026".

SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO ERISA SECTION 514.

Section 514 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(29 U.S.C. 1144) is amended by adding at the end the following:

"(e) MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTION.--
    (1) IN GENERAL.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), a State may
    enforce the requirements of section 712 of this Act with
    respect to any group health plan, including a self-insured
    plan, if the State has been certified by the Secretary under
    paragraph (2).
    (2) CERTIFICATION.--The Secretary shall certify a State for
    purposes of paragraph (1) if the State--
        (A) has enacted a law providing for enforcement of section
        712 of this Act;
        (B) has established an enforcement program with dedicated
        staff meeting minimum competency standards established by
        the Secretary;
        (C) has entered into a delegation agreement with the
        Secretary; and
        (D) submits annual reports to the Secretary on enforcement
        activities and outcomes.
    (3) SCOPE OF AUTHORITY.--A certified State's enforcement
    authority under this subsection shall be limited to
    enforcement of section 712 and shall not extend to any other
    provision of this Act.
    (4) FEDERAL GRANTS.--The Secretary shall award grants to
    certified States to support enforcement activities under this
    subsection. There are authorized to be appropriated
    $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2031.
    (5) REVIEW AND REVOCATION.--The Secretary shall review each
    State certification not less than every 3 years and may
    revoke certification if the State fails to meet minimum
    enforcement standards."
```

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act

**Purpose**: Enable state insurance departments to conduct proactive parity enforcement for fully insured plans, including mandatory reporting, market conduct examinations, and penalties for violations.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize penalty amounts to their regulatory frameworks, adjust staffing requirements to their market size, and coordinate with DOL for self-insured plan referrals. States with existing parity laws should integrate these provisions rather than creating parallel enforcement structures.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Mental
Health Parity Enforcement Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds the following:

(1) Mental health and substance use disorder claims are denied
at rates approximately twice those of medical and surgical claims.
(2) Out-of-network utilization for MH/SUD services is 5.4 times
higher than for medical services.
(3) Effective parity enforcement requires proactive examination
of health plans, not reliance on patient complaints.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Commissioner" means the [State] Insurance Commissioner.
(b) "Plan" means any health insurance plan subject to regulation
by the [State] Department of Insurance.
(c) "Parity compliance report" means the report required under
Section 4 of this Act.

SECTION 4. MANDATORY PARITY REPORTING.

(a) Each plan shall submit to the Commissioner, not later than
120 days after the end of each plan year, a parity compliance
report containing:
    (1) MH/SUD and medical/surgical denial rates;
    (2) out-of-network utilization rates;
    (3) prior authorization data;
    (4) reimbursement rate comparisons; and
    (5) network adequacy metrics.

(b) The Commissioner shall publish an annual summary of parity
compliance data, identifying plans with the greatest disparities
between MH/SUD and medical/surgical metrics.

SECTION 5. PROACTIVE EXAMINATIONS.

(a) The Commissioner shall conduct parity-focused market conduct
examinations of not fewer than [10/15/20] plans per year.
(b) Plans found in violation shall submit corrective action plans
within 60 days and demonstrate compliance within 180 days.

SECTION 6. PENALTIES.

(a) A plan found in violation of mental health parity requirements
under this Act or federal law shall be subject to a fine of not
less than $10,000 and not more than $1,000,000 per violation.
(b) Repeated violations within a 3-year period shall result in
doubled penalties.

SECTION 7. DEDICATED ENFORCEMENT.

(a) The Commissioner shall establish a Mental Health Parity
Enforcement Unit within the Department of Insurance.
(b) The Unit shall be staffed with not fewer than [3/5/8]
full-time employees with expertise in health insurance,
behavioral health, and regulatory enforcement.

SECTION 8. APPROPRIATIONS.

There is appropriated from the [General Fund / Insurance Regulatory
Fund] the sum of $[amount] annually for the purposes of this Act.

SECTION 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Labor (EBSA) for ERISA-governed plans; CMS (CCIIO) for individual/small group market plans and Medicaid managed care.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Parity Scorecard Reporting Standards**: DOL and CMS must jointly develop standardized data collection templates, reporting timelines, and publication format within 18 months of enactment.
2. **Certified Parity Auditor Standards**: DOL must establish certification criteria, training requirements, independence standards, and audit protocols within 12 months.
3. **Standardized NQTL Comparison Methodology**: The interagency technical advisory committee must develop and DOL must publish the methodology within 18 months.
4. **State Delegation Standards**: DOL must establish minimum requirements for state certification, including staffing, expertise, data systems, and reporting obligations, within 12 months.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: $100 per enrollee per day, minimum $500,000 per violation, maximum $10,000,000 per violation (except willful violations, which have no cap). Penalties deposited in a Mental Health Parity Enforcement Fund.
- **Administrative Actions**: DOL can require corrective action plans, order retroactive claims processing, mandate network expansion, and impose enhanced reporting requirements.
- **Private Right of Action**: ERISA section 502 already provides participants and beneficiaries with a cause of action for violations. The Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act preserves and strengthens this right by ensuring that plan-level data is available to support claims.
- **State Enforcement**: Certified states can conduct examinations, impose state-level penalties, require corrective actions, and refer cases to DOL for federal action.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: MHPAEA and its proposed extensions regulate employer-sponsored health plans engaged in interstate commerce. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld ERISA's application to employee benefit plans under the Commerce Clause. The proposed ERISA Parity Enforcement Amendment creates a limited exception to ERISA preemption rather than expanding federal regulatory power, reducing constitutional vulnerability.

**Spending Clause Authority**: Extension of parity requirements to Medicare fee-for-service and Medicaid fee-for-service operates under Congress's Spending Clause authority to impose conditions on federal programs. The conditions must be clear, related to the program's purpose, and non-coercive -- all criteria met by parity requirements for federal health insurance programs. See *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).

**Due Process**: Plans subject to civil penalties must receive notice and an opportunity to correct violations before penalties accrue. The 90-day correction period in Section 6 satisfies procedural due process requirements.

### Preemption

The ERISA Parity Enforcement Amendment creates a narrow, targeted exception to ERISA section 514 preemption. The exception applies only to MHPAEA enforcement and explicitly preserves ERISA preemption for all other aspects of self-insured plan regulation. This approach minimizes disruption to the ERISA framework while addressing the specific enforcement gap.

State model legislation applies only to fully insured plans already within state regulatory jurisdiction. No preemption conflict exists for state-regulated plans.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through multiple overlapping mechanisms: mandatory reporting (detects violations through data), independent audits (verifies compliance through examination), civil penalties (deters non-compliance through financial consequences), and private litigation (provides individual remedies through the courts). This redundant enforcement structure ensures that no single mechanism's failure defeats overall enforcement.

---

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Data manipulation in compliance reports | Plans could selectively categorize claims to reduce apparent MH/SUD denial rates or reclassify denials as "administrative" rather than "clinical" | High | Require raw claims data submission alongside summary reports; mandate independent auditor verification of data integrity; establish DOL sampling-based data validation |
| Audit shopping among certified auditors | Plans could seek out lenient auditors willing to certify compliance despite deficiencies, similar to accounting audit shopping | Medium | Require auditor rotation every 2 cycles (6 years); publish auditor-specific compliance finding rates; authorize DOL to decertify auditors with patterns of insufficient findings |
| Shifting restrictions to non-NQTL categories | Plans could impose new barriers not captured by current NQTL definitions, such as restrictive benefit classification schemes or narrow definitions of "medically necessary" | High | Authorize DOL to designate new NQTL categories through rulemaking without additional legislation; require plans to report any new utilization management tool applied to MH/SUD |
| Self-insured plan jurisdictional avoidance | Self-insured employers in states without delegated authority could resist compliance, knowing that DOL has limited investigative capacity | Medium | Prioritize DOL enforcement in non-delegated states; create incentives (reduced audit frequency) for employers who voluntarily submit to state enforcement |
| Cost exemption exploitation | Under existing MHPAEA, plans can claim exemption if compliance increases costs by more than 2% in the first year or 1% in subsequent years | Medium | Eliminate or raise the cost exemption threshold; require actuarial certification of cost exemption claims with DOL review |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Small plan exemption | Plans with fewer than 1,000 enrollees excluded from audit requirement; approximately 1.5 million plans below threshold | Political necessity to avoid small employer opposition; practical limits on audit capacity | Require reporting for all plans regardless of size; conduct DOL compliance reviews of small plans on a sampling basis |
| No reimbursement rate mandate in this bill | The Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act addresses enforcement but not the reimbursement rate gap that drives network inadequacy | Scope limitation; reimbursement reform addressed in separate legislation (MH/SUD Provider Rate Parity Act) | Advance reimbursement rate floor legislation in parallel; include reimbursement data in Parity Scorecard to create transparency pressure |
| Delayed implementation | 18-month reporting and Scorecard development timeline means no public data for nearly 2 years | Technical complexity of developing standardized reporting infrastructure | Accelerate where possible; use interim reporting based on existing plan data while full Scorecard is developed |
| No private penalty recovery | Civil penalties go to the enforcement fund, not to affected patients | ERISA's remedial framework limits individual recovery to plan benefits and equitable relief | Strengthen ERISA section 502 remedies in a companion bill to allow compensatory damages for parity violations |
| Medicare and Medicaid FFS excluded | The Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act applies to MHPAEA-covered plans; Medicare and Medicaid FFS require separate legislation | Constitutional and legislative structure requires separate statutory authority | Advance Medicare Mental Health Parity Act in parallel |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Data Integrity Safeguards**: Add a subsection to Section 4 requiring plans to submit raw, de-identified claims data alongside summary reports, and authorizing DOL to conduct random validation audits comparing summary data to raw claims.
2. **Auditor Independence Standards**: Add to Section 5 a requirement for mandatory auditor rotation every 6 years, prohibition on auditing a plan for which the auditor has provided consulting services within the prior 3 years, and DOL publication of auditor-specific compliance finding rates.
3. **Dynamic NQTL Authority**: Add to Section 4(d) authorization for DOL to designate new categories of NQTLs through rulemaking as insurers develop novel utilization management tools, without requiring additional legislation.
4. **Cost Exemption Reform**: Amend MHPAEA section 712(c)(2) to raise the cost exemption threshold from 2%/1% to 5%/3%, and require plans claiming the exemption to submit actuarial certifications reviewed by DOL within 60 days.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act should include a 7-year reauthorization requirement. Congress should evaluate the Parity Scorecard's effectiveness, audit program outcomes, and enforcement trends before reauthorization. A mandatory GAO study at Year 5 should assess whether the enforcement infrastructure has measurably reduced denial rate disparities, out-of-network utilization gaps, and unmet MH/SUD treatment needs.
