# Mental Health Insurance Parity: Current State

## Claims Denial Disparities

The most direct measure of parity compliance is whether MH/SUD claims are denied at rates comparable to medical/surgical claims. Available data consistently shows they are not.

### Denial Rate Comparison

| Benefit Category | Average Denial Rate | Denial Rate Ratio (MH/SUD to Med/Surg) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mental health inpatient | 22.4% | 1.9x | Milliman, 2023 |
| Substance use disorder inpatient | 24.8% | 2.1x | Milliman, 2023 |
| Mental health outpatient | 18.6% | 1.7x | Milliman, 2023 |
| Substance use disorder outpatient | 20.1% | 1.8x | Milliman, 2023 |
| Medical/surgical (all categories) | 11.7% | Baseline | Milliman, 2023 |

### Prior Authorization Burden

Prior authorization is the most frequently cited barrier to MH/SUD care. Plans impose these requirements on behavioral health services at rates far exceeding medical services.

| Metric | MH/SUD | Medical/Surgical | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Services requiring prior authorization | 30-40% | 10-15% | APA Practice Survey, 2023 |
| Average time to obtain authorization | 7-14 business days | 2-5 business days | NAMI Survey, 2023 |
| Authorization denial rate (initial) | 18.3% | 8.1% | Milliman, 2023 |
| Patients who abandon care during auth process | 29% | 11% | Kennedy Forum, 2023 |

### Appeal Outcomes

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| MH/SUD denials appealed by patients | 0.5% | DOL EBSA, 2023 |
| Appeals overturned (internal review) | 40-60% | State insurance dept. data, 2023 |
| Appeals overturned (external review) | 50-75% | NAIC External Review Data, 2023 |
| Average time for external review resolution | 45 days | NAIC, 2023 |

The high overturn rate on appeal indicates that many initial denials are not clinically justified, yet fewer than 1% of denied claims are ever appealed. This asymmetry is a central failure of the current enforcement model.

## Network Adequacy

### Out-of-Network Utilization

The most reliable indicator of network adequacy is the rate at which patients must go out-of-network to obtain care. Behavioral health services consistently show far higher out-of-network utilization.

| Service Category | Out-of-Network Rate | Comparison to Med/Surg | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| MH/SUD office visits | 16.3% | 5.4x higher | Milliman, 2023 |
| MH/SUD inpatient | 7.8% | 3.2x higher | Milliman, 2023 |
| Medical/surgical office visits | 3.0% | Baseline | Milliman, 2023 |
| Medical/surgical inpatient | 2.4% | Baseline | Milliman, 2023 |

### Reimbursement Rate Gap

Low reimbursement rates are the primary reason behavioral health providers decline to participate in insurer networks.

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| MH/SUD reimbursement as % of Medicare rates | 77-83% | Stable/declining | Milliman, 2024 |
| Medical/surgical reimbursement as % of Medicare rates | 105-130% | Stable | Milliman, 2024 |
| MH/SUD providers accepting insurance | 55% | Declining | APA, 2023 |
| Psychiatrists accepting new patients with insurance | 38% | Declining | Bishop et al., JAMA, 2023 |
| Primary care physicians accepting new patients with insurance | 86% | Stable | Bishop et al., JAMA, 2023 |

### Provider Network Composition

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Psychiatrists in-network with commercial plans | 38% | Melek et al., Milliman, 2024 |
| Psychologists in-network with commercial plans | 47% | APA Practice Survey, 2023 |
| Licensed clinical social workers in-network | 52% | NASW Survey, 2023 |
| Primary care physicians in-network | 86% | CMS, 2023 |
| Cardiologists in-network | 81% | Avalere Health, 2023 |

## Nonquantitative Treatment Limitations (NQTLs)

NQTLs are the design features of insurance plans -- such as prior authorization criteria, step therapy requirements, medical necessity standards, and network admission requirements -- that do not impose numerical limits but can effectively restrict access to care. They are the primary mechanism through which modern parity violations occur.

### Common NQTL Disparities

| NQTL Type | MH/SUD Application | Medical/Surgical Application | Parity Concern |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prior authorization | Required for most inpatient and many outpatient services | Required selectively for high-cost procedures | More restrictive for MH/SUD |
| Concurrent review | Frequent (every 3-7 days for inpatient) | Less frequent (every 7-14 days) | More frequent for MH/SUD |
| Step therapy (fail-first) | Required for most psychiatric medications | Required for some specialty drugs | Applied more broadly to MH/SUD |
| Medical necessity criteria | Often uses strietary criteria without clinical evidence basis | Generally uses evidence-based clinical guidelines | Stricter for MH/SUD |
| Network admission standards | Higher credentialing barriers, lower reimbursement | Standard credentialing, competitive reimbursement | More restrictive for MH/SUD |

### NQTL Compliance Under the 2024 Final Rule

The 2024 final rule (89 Fed. Reg. 77586) requires plans to conduct comparative analyses demonstrating that NQTLs are no more restrictive for MH/SUD benefits than for medical/surgical benefits. Key requirements include:

| Requirement | Deadline | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Comparative analysis documentation | January 1, 2025 | Plans must maintain written analyses for each NQTL |
| Data collection for outcomes | Plan years beginning on/after January 1, 2025 | Plans must collect data on NQTL impact |
| Outcomes data reporting | Plan years beginning on/after January 1, 2026 | Plans must evaluate whether NQTLs produce disparate outcomes |
| Network composition reporting | Plan years beginning on/after January 1, 2026 | Plans must report in-network vs. out-of-network utilization |
| Corrective action for non-compliance | Ongoing | Plans found non-compliant must cease imposing the NQTL until corrected |

## Federal Enforcement

### Department of Labor (DOL) -- Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA)

EBSA is the primary federal enforcer of MHPAEA for employer-sponsored plans governed by ERISA, covering approximately 136 million people.

| Metric | FY2022 | FY2023 | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MHPAEA investigations initiated | 185 | 206 | Upward | DOL EBSA Annual Report, 2023 |
| Violations found | 142 | 168 | Upward | DOL EBSA, 2023 |
| Plans required to make corrections | 87 | 112 | Upward | DOL EBSA, 2023 |
| Monetary recoveries | $3.2 million | $4.8 million | Upward | DOL EBSA, 2023 |
| Comparative analysis requests | 204 | 312 | Upward | DOL EBSA, 2023 |
| Comparative analyses found insufficient | 100% of initial submissions | 100% of initial submissions | Stable | DOL EBSA, 2023 |

The finding that 100% of initial NQTL comparative analyses reviewed by DOL were insufficient underscores the depth of the compliance challenge.

### Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)

CMS enforces parity for individual and small group market plans and for certain Medicaid managed care plans.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Individual/small group plans subject to parity | ~15 million enrollees | CMS, 2023 |
| Medicaid managed care plans subject to parity | ~55 million enrollees (since March 2024) | CMS, 2024 |
| Parity enforcement actions (2022-2023) | 47 | CMS, 2023 |

### State Enforcement

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| States with parity enforcement programs | 39 + D.C. | NAMI, 2024 |
| States with dedicated parity enforcement staff | 18 | Parity Track, 2024 |
| States requiring proactive parity reporting by insurers | 12 | Parity Track, 2024 |
| State enforcement limited to fully insured plans | All states (due to ERISA preemption) | ERISA section 514 |

## Geographic Variation

State-level parity enforcement varies dramatically, creating uneven protections depending on where a person lives and whether their plan is fully insured (regulated by the state) or self-insured (regulated by DOL).

### State Parity Enforcement Tiers

| Tier | Description | Number of States | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | Dedicated parity staff, proactive audits, public reporting, penalties | 12 | CT, IL, CO, OR, MA |
| **Moderate** | Parity law exceeds federal, complaint-driven enforcement | 17 | CA, NY, MD, NJ, WA |
| **Basic** | Relies on federal floor, minimal state enforcement | 10 + D.C. | PA, OH, MI, VA |
| **Weak** | No state parity law beyond federal minimum, limited resources | 11 | AL, MS, WY, ID, SD |

## Emerging Challenges

### Measurement and Compliance Complexity

The 2024 final rule's requirement that plans collect and analyze outcomes data on NQTLs creates unprecedented compliance obligations. Plans must develop new data systems, hire compliance staff, and engage actuarial consultants. Smaller self-insured employers may lack the resources to comply, creating a tiered compliance landscape.

### Digital and Telehealth Parity

The expansion of telehealth for MH/SUD services during and after the pandemic raises new parity questions. Plans that cover telehealth for medical visits but impose additional restrictions on behavioral health telehealth (such as requiring in-person intake or limiting session frequency) may violate parity. Regulatory guidance on digital parity remains undeveloped.

### Cost Pressure from Rising Demand

MH/SUD utilization has grown faster than medical utilization since the pandemic, with commercial plan spending on behavioral health increasing 53% from 2019 to 2023 (Evernorth, 2024). This creates pressure on plans to deploy cost management tools, which may conflict with parity requirements if those tools are applied more stringently to MH/SUD services.

### Enforcement Capacity

Even with increased enforcement activity, DOL oversees approximately 2.5 million health plans with approximately 500 EBSA investigators. The agency cannot audit more than a fraction of plans in any given year, making proactive enforcement difficult and complaint-driven enforcement the default.
