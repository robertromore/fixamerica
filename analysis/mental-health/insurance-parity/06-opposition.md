# Mental Health Insurance Parity: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to strengthen mental health insurance parity enforcement face resistance from those who believe that existing law is adequate, that stronger enforcement will increase costs and reduce plan flexibility, and that the behavioral health provider shortage -- rather than insurer practices -- is the primary barrier to care.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) | Preserve insurer discretion in benefit design and utilization management | $11.4 million annual lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023) | Lobbying, regulatory comments, legal challenges, industry research |
| ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC) | Protect self-insured employer plans from expanded regulation | $1.8 million annual lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023) | Lobbying against state enforcement authority and expanded DOL mandates |
| UnitedHealth Group / Optum | Maintain behavioral health management model through Optum BH | $10.4 million annual lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023) | Lobbying, regulatory comments, litigation |
| U.S. Chamber of Commerce | Oppose new employer mandates and compliance costs | $81 million annual lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023) | Broad employer advocacy against regulatory expansion |
| National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) | Protect small employers from compliance costs | $5.2 million annual lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023) | Advocacy against mandate expansion |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Fiscal conservatives**: Object to regulations that increase health plan costs, arguing that higher premiums reduce coverage and that market competition, not government mandates, should drive benefit design.
- **Libertarians**: Oppose government mandates on benefit design as interference with private contracts between employers, insurers, and employees. Argue that individuals should be free to choose plans with or without MH/SUD coverage.
- **Free-market advocates**: Contend that requiring parity distorts the insurance market, preventing plans from pricing MH/SUD benefits based on actuarial risk and clinical uncertainty. Argue that utilization management tools reflect legitimate cost control, not discrimination.

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: Parity Enforcement Increases Premiums

**Claim**: "Stronger parity enforcement will force plans to cover more MH/SUD services, driving up premiums for all enrollees. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the 2024 final rule could increase premiums by 1-2% for affected plans."

**Evidence Cited**: CBO analysis of 2024 final rule premium impact; AHIP-commissioned studies on compliance costs; employer surveys indicating cost concerns.

**Reality**: CBO's own estimates place the premium impact at less than 1% for most plans, and the 2024 final rule's regulatory impact analysis estimated a per-enrollee annual cost increase of $1-$16 (89 Fed. Reg. 77586, 2024). Independent analyses have consistently found that parity compliance costs are modest. When MHPAEA was first enacted, industry predicted premium increases of 3-5%, but actual increases were negligible -- a 2012 DOL study found no measurable premium effect from MHPAEA implementation. Moreover, untreated MH/SUD conditions impose far greater costs on employers through absenteeism, disability, and reduced productivity -- an estimated $47.6 billion annually from depression alone (National Safety Council, 2023).

**Rebuttal**: The cost of parity compliance is consistently overestimated by the industry and consistently small when measured. The cost of non-compliance -- in terms of untreated illness, emergency care, criminal justice involvement, and lost productivity -- is far higher. Parity enforcement is not a cost increase; it is a reallocation from hidden costs (emergency rooms, jails, lost productivity) to appropriate clinical care.

### Argument 2: Provider Shortages Are the Real Problem, Not Insurer Practices

**Claim**: "Plans cannot build adequate MH/SUD networks because there are not enough behavioral health providers. The solution is to train more providers, not to punish plans for a workforce shortage they did not create."

**Evidence Cited**: SAMHSA Mental Health Professional Shortage Area designations (over 160 million Americans in shortage areas); APA workforce data showing aging psychiatrist population.

**Reality**: The provider shortage is real, but it is not the sole or even primary cause of network inadequacy. Plans' own reimbursement practices drive providers out of networks. Only 38% of psychiatrists accept new commercial insurance patients, compared to 86% of primary care physicians (Bishop et al., JAMA, 2023). The gap is not because there are fewer psychiatrists but because insurance reimbursement for psychiatric services is 20-40% below comparable medical rates (Milliman, 2024). Providers who can sustain their practices with self-pay patients rationally decline to accept insurance. Network inadequacy is partly a supply problem and partly a demand problem created by insurer pricing.

**Rebuttal**: If plans paid competitive reimbursement rates, the number of in-network MH/SUD providers would increase substantially. The provider shortage argument conflates two distinct problems: an absolute shortage of providers in some areas (which requires workforce investment) and an artificial shortage of in-network providers caused by low reimbursement (which parity enforcement can address). Both problems need solutions, and one does not excuse the other.

### Argument 3: NQTLs Are Clinically Necessary, Not Discriminatory

**Claim**: "Prior authorization, step therapy, and medical necessity reviews are legitimate clinical tools that ensure patients receive appropriate care. They are not applied differently to MH/SUD; they reflect the clinical characteristics of behavioral health treatment, which is more variable and harder to standardize."

**Evidence Cited**: AHIP position papers on clinical appropriateness of utilization review; studies showing variation in MH/SUD treatment outcomes; actuarial arguments about clinical uncertainty.

**Reality**: The data directly contradicts this claim. Prior authorization is imposed on 30-40% of MH/SUD services but only 10-15% of medical/surgical services (APA, 2023). MH/SUD claims are denied at 22.4% compared to 11.7% for medical claims (Milliman, 2023). When denials are appealed, 50-75% are overturned -- indicating that the initial denial was not clinically justified (NAIC, 2023). If NQTLs were applied based on genuine clinical criteria rather than cost management, there would be no systematic disparity in denial rates, and appeals would not result in such high overturn rates.

**Rebuttal**: NQTLs are legitimate tools when applied comparably across benefit categories. MHPAEA does not prohibit utilization review; it requires that the processes and standards applied to MH/SUD be no more restrictive than those applied to medical/surgical benefits. The evidence shows a consistent, measurable disparity that cannot be explained by clinical differences alone.

### Argument 4: The 2024 Final Rule Exceeds Statutory Authority

**Claim**: "The 2024 final rule's requirement that plans evaluate outcomes data and demonstrate no disparate impact on MH/SUD access exceeds what MHPAEA authorizes. Congress required parity in benefit design, not parity in outcomes. The rule imposes an outcomes-based standard that has no basis in the statute."

**Evidence Cited**: Text of MHPAEA; legal analyses by employer and insurer groups; administrative law arguments about regulatory overreach.

**Reality**: The 2024 final rule is grounded in MHPAEA's text, which prohibits NQTLs that are applied more stringently to MH/SUD than to medical/surgical benefits. The rule interprets "applied more stringently" to encompass both design and effect -- a reasonable interpretation given that a facially neutral NQTL that produces severely disparate outcomes is, in practical terms, more restrictive. The CAA of 2021 explicitly authorized DOL to request and evaluate NQTL comparative analyses, and the legislative history of MHPAEA supports a broad reading of the NQTL prohibition. Courts will ultimately decide, but the regulatory agencies' interpretation is within the range of permissible readings of the statute.

**Rebuttal**: The argument that Congress intended parity in design but not outcomes would render parity law unenforceable. A plan could design a facially neutral prior authorization system that, through undisclosed criteria, denies 50% of MH/SUD claims while approving 95% of medical claims -- and claim compliance because the "design" was the same. Outcomes data is the only way to verify whether design-level parity translates into access-level parity.

### Argument 5: Compliance Costs Are Disproportionate for Small Employers

**Claim**: "The 2024 final rule's documentation and data requirements impose compliance costs that small and mid-size self-insured employers cannot afford. These employers may respond by dropping MH/SUD coverage or moving to less comprehensive plans."

**Evidence Cited**: ERIC survey data on employer compliance cost estimates; NFIB concerns about small employer burden; administrative cost analyses.

**Reality**: MHPAEA already exempts the smallest employers (those with fewer than 50 employees and those who do not offer MH/SUD benefits). For mid-size self-insured employers, compliance burden is typically borne by third-party administrators (TPAs) and insurers who administer the plan, not by the employer directly. The 2024 final rule allows plans to rely on their TPAs and MBHOs for comparative analyses. Moreover, the ACA's essential health benefits requirement already mandates MH/SUD coverage in the individual and small group markets, and employers who self-insure make a voluntary decision to do so; they can purchase fully insured coverage if they prefer state-level regulation.

**Rebuttal**: The compliance cost argument is a legitimate concern that should be addressed through technical assistance and standardized templates, not through weakening enforcement. The solution is to make compliance easier, not to exempt large categories of plans from parity requirements.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

The insurance industry has opposed every significant expansion of parity law, predicting cost increases that failed to materialize.

| Year | Reform | Industry Prediction | Actual Outcome |
|------|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1996 | Mental Health Parity Act | Premium increases of 2-4% | No measurable effect (GAO, 2000) |
| 2008 | MHPAEA | Premium increases of 3-5% | Negligible increase (DOL, 2012) |
| 2010 | ACA essential health benefits | Significant cost increase for individual market | Modest increase absorbed within overall ACA market changes |
| 2024 | 2024 Final Rule | Premium increases of 1-2% | TBD (estimated $1-$16/enrollee annually, 89 Fed. Reg. 77586) |

The pattern is consistent: each round of reform produces cost predictions that exceed actual costs. This track record undermines the credibility of current cost objections.

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Leverage bipartisan support**: Mental health parity has historically been a bipartisan issue. Frame enforcement strengthening as fulfilling the intent of Republican and Democratic lawmakers who passed MHPAEA.
- **Enlist employer allies**: Some large employers recognize that parity compliance improves workforce mental health and reduces long-term costs. Companies that have invested in comprehensive mental health benefits (e.g., Starbucks, Google, Unilever) can serve as models.
- **Use state momentum**: The 39 states with parity laws exceeding federal requirements represent a political base for continued reform. State-level success stories provide evidence for federal action.

### Communication Strategies

- **Lead with patient stories**: Personal accounts of care denied, treatment delayed, and families harmed are more persuasive than actuarial data. The Domenici-Wellstone legacy demonstrates that personal connection drives legislative action.
- **Reframe costs**: Shift the discussion from "the cost of parity compliance" to "the cost of parity non-compliance" -- emergency room visits, incarceration, lost productivity, and lives lost.
- **Use overturn data**: The fact that 50-75% of denied MH/SUD claims are overturned on appeal is a powerful proof point that initial denials are not clinically justified.

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Build in technical assistance**: Address small employer concerns by providing compliance templates, standardized NQTL comparison methodologies, and DOL-funded technical assistance.
- **Phase implementation**: The 2024 final rule's phased compliance timeline reduces disruption and gives plans time to develop systems. Future legislation should continue this approach.
- **Create safe harbors**: Offer regulatory safe harbors for plans that meet specified standards (e.g., denial rate parity within 2 percentage points, out-of-network rate parity within 2x), reducing compliance uncertainty and giving plans a clear target.
