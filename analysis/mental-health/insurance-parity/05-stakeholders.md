# Mental Health Insurance Parity: Stakeholders

The mental health insurance parity landscape is shaped by the interactions of patients seeking care, insurers managing costs, regulators enforcing compliance, providers navigating reimbursement, employers designing plans, and advocates pushing for reform. Each group has distinct interests, resources, and levels of influence over whether parity law translates into parity practice.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Adults with mental health conditions | Higher denial rates, narrower networks, greater out-of-pocket costs than medical patients | 57.8 million (22.8% of U.S. adults, SAMHSA 2023) | Equal access to affordable MH treatment through insurance |
| People with substance use disorders | Barriers to treatment including prior authorization delays, step therapy requirements, and limited network access | 48.7 million (17.3% of U.S. population 12+, SAMHSA 2023) | Timely access to SUD treatment without administrative barriers |
| Children and adolescents with MH conditions | Growing demand for services with inadequate pediatric behavioral health networks | 17.1% of children aged 6-17 (CDC, 2023) | Access to age-appropriate MH services with adequate in-network providers |
| Family members and caregivers | Bear the burden of navigating denials, appeals, and out-of-network costs | Estimated 8.4 million family caregivers (NAMI, 2023) | Reduced administrative burden, affordable care for their family members |
| Uninsured and underinsured individuals | Parity law does not help those without insurance coverage | ~26 million uninsured (Census Bureau, 2023) | Expansion of coverage, not just parity within existing coverage |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Employers**: Bear the cost of health plan premiums; affected by employee productivity losses from untreated MH/SUD conditions. Estimated $47.6 billion in annual lost productivity from depression alone (National Safety Council, 2023).
- **State and local governments**: Fund Medicaid programs, safety-net mental health services, and criminal justice costs when MH/SUD goes untreated. Untreated mental illness costs state and local governments an estimated $280 billion annually in emergency services, incarceration, and lost tax revenue (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023).
- **Criminal justice system**: Approximately 44% of people in jails and 37% of people in state prisons have a mental health condition (BJS, 2023). Insurance barriers to community-based treatment contribute to criminal justice involvement.
- **Emergency departments**: Serve as default MH/SUD treatment settings when outpatient care is unavailable. Psychiatric-related ED visits increased 31% from 2017 to 2022 (CDC, 2023).

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| DOL Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) | Enforces MHPAEA for ERISA-governed plans | Investigatory and corrective authority over ~2.5 million plans | ~500 investigators; FY2024 budget of $220 million (total EBSA) | High (for self-insured plans) |
| CMS Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) | Enforces parity for individual/small group and Medicaid managed care | Authority over ACA marketplace plans and Medicaid | Shared resources across multiple mandates | High (for individual market) |
| State insurance commissioners | Enforce parity for fully insured plans within their state | Examination, fine, and corrective action authority | Varies widely; 18 states have dedicated parity staff | Medium to High (state-dependent) |
| Congressional committees (HELP, Ways & Means, E&C) | Authorizing and appropriating legislation on parity enforcement | Legislative authority to expand, fund, or weaken parity requirements | Staff and hearing authority | High |
| Federal courts | Adjudicate private lawsuits and DOL enforcement actions under ERISA | Interpret MHPAEA requirements and remedies available | Case-by-case authority | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP)**: The national trade association representing health insurers. AHIP lobbies against expansion of parity enforcement requirements, arguing that existing law is adequate and that further regulation increases costs. Annual lobbying expenditure: approximately $11.4 million (OpenSecrets, 2023).
- **ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC)**: Represents large self-insured employers. ERIC opposes expansion of state authority over self-insured plans and argues that the 2024 final rule imposes excessive compliance costs.
- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: The largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization. NAMI has been a primary driver of parity enforcement legislation and public education. Budget: approximately $44 million (2023).
- **The Kennedy Forum**: Founded by former Representative Patrick Kennedy, a co-author of MHPAEA. The Kennedy Forum conducts parity compliance research, trains state regulators, and advocates for enforcement funding. The Parity Track initiative monitors state enforcement.
- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: Professional association of psychiatrists. APA advocates for higher reimbursement rates, reduced prior authorization burden, and stronger parity enforcement. Budget: approximately $65 million (2023).
- **American Psychological Association**: Represents psychologists. Advocates for network inclusion and adequate reimbursement for psychological services.
- **National Council for Mental Wellbeing**: Represents community-based behavioral health organizations. Advocates for expanded access and adequate Medicaid reimbursement.
- **Managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs)**: Companies like Optum Behavioral Health, Carelon Behavioral Health (formerly Beacon Health Options), and Magellan Health administer behavioral health benefits for insurers and employers. They implement the utilization management practices that most directly affect patient access.

### Influencers

- **Milliman, Inc.**: Actuarial consulting firm that publishes the most widely cited research on parity compliance, including analyses of denial rates, out-of-network utilization, and reimbursement disparities. Milliman data is used by advocates, regulators, and courts as evidence of parity violations.
- **Legal Aid and public interest law organizations**: Groups such as the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and the National Health Law Program provide legal support for parity enforcement litigation and policy advocacy.
- **Patient advocacy coalitions**: Organizations including Mental Health America, Faces & Voices of Recovery, and the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence advocate for parity enforcement from the patient perspective.
- **State attorneys general**: Have filed enforcement actions and amicus briefs supporting stronger parity enforcement. The 2020 multistate attorney general letter urging DOL to strengthen NQTL enforcement contributed to the 2024 final rule.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAMI, APA, Kennedy Forum, patient groups | Stronger NQTL enforcement, higher MH/SUD reimbursement, proactive audits | Strong |
| State insurance commissioners, state attorneys general | Greater state enforcement authority, federal-state coordination | Strong |
| Behavioral health providers (psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers) | Higher reimbursement rates, reduced prior auth burden, network adequacy | Strong |
| Employers concerned about productivity, bipartisan legislators | Evidence-based parity enforcement that improves workforce health | Moderate |
| Community mental health centers, safety-net providers, Medicaid advocates | Expanded parity coverage to Medicaid FFS and Medicare | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Insurers vs. patients/providers**: Insurers seek to manage MH/SUD costs through utilization controls; patients and providers want fewer barriers to care
- **Self-insured employers vs. state regulators**: Employers value ERISA preemption as protection from state mandates; states want authority to enforce parity in all plans within their borders
- **MBHOs vs. integrated care advocates**: MBHOs profit from behavioral health carve-out models; integrated care advocates argue carve-outs inherently create parity problems by separating MH/SUD management from medical benefits
- **Small employers vs. parity advocates**: Small employers fear compliance costs; advocates argue all employers should meet the same standards

### The Insurance Industry Power Structure

The insurance industry's influence over parity enforcement operates through multiple channels:

1. **Lobbying**: AHIP and individual insurers spend over $150 million annually on federal and state lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023)
2. **Plan design control**: Insurers and MBHOs design the NQTLs, medical necessity criteria, and network standards that determine whether parity is achieved in practice
3. **Data control**: Until the 2024 final rule, plans controlled the data needed to evaluate parity compliance and had no obligation to share it
4. **Revolving door**: Former CMS and DOL officials frequently move to positions in the insurance industry, and vice versa

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on parity policy:

- **Lobbying**: AHIP spent $11.4 million on federal lobbying in 2023. UnitedHealth Group (parent of Optum Behavioral Health) spent $10.4 million. NAMI spent $1.2 million. The financial asymmetry is approximately 10:1 in favor of the insurance industry.
- **Campaign contributions**: Health insurance industry PACs contributed $43.7 million to federal candidates in the 2022 election cycle (OpenSecrets, 2023). Mental health advocacy organizations contributed less than $2 million.
- **Regulatory comments**: During the 2024 final rule comment period, AHIP, ERIC, and individual insurers submitted detailed comments opposing the outcomes data requirement and network composition standards. Advocacy organizations submitted comments supporting these requirements. The final rule adopted many advocate-supported provisions, but with extended compliance timelines sought by industry.
- **Litigation**: Insurers and employers have filed legal challenges to parity regulations, including challenges to the scope of NQTLs covered, the burden of proof standard, and the remedies available for violations. The legal landscape remains contested.
- **Public advocacy**: NAMI, the Kennedy Forum, and allied organizations conduct public education campaigns, organize lobby days, and maintain media attention on parity issues. The Kennedy Forum's Parity Track initiative publicly rates state parity enforcement efforts, creating accountability pressure.
- **Expertise and research**: Milliman's actuarial analyses provide the evidence base for parity enforcement. The Kennedy Forum and NAMI produce compliance guides and training materials used by state regulators.
