# Mental Health Insurance Parity: Solutions

Achieving genuine mental health insurance parity requires a multi-faceted approach that strengthens enforcement of existing law, closes regulatory loopholes, expands coverage to populations outside MHPAEA's current reach, and addresses the structural conditions -- particularly the reimbursement rate gap and provider shortage -- that enable insurers to maintain unequal access to behavioral health care.

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Equal treatment in practice, not just on paper: Parity must be measured by outcomes (denial rates, network access, wait times), not only by benefit design
- Proactive enforcement: Regulators must audit plans before patients complain, not after
- Transparency: Plans must publicly report parity compliance data so consumers, employers, and regulators can compare performance
- Universal coverage: Parity protections should apply to all insurance products, not only employer-sponsored and individual market plans
- Provider viability: Networks cannot be adequate if reimbursement rates drive providers away; rate parity is a prerequisite for access parity

### Theory of Change

Parity violations persist because they are profitable, difficult to detect, and rarely punished. Reform must change this calculus by (1) making violations detectable through mandatory data reporting, (2) making them costly through meaningful penalties, (3) making compliance achievable through standardized methodologies and technical assistance, and (4) expanding the behavioral health workforce so that parity in network design translates into parity in provider availability. When non-compliance is more expensive than compliance, plans will comply.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Mandatory Public Parity Reporting (Parity Scorecard)

**Description**: Require all health plans subject to MHPAEA to annually report standardized parity compliance metrics to CMS and DOL, and make these reports publicly available. The report would include denial rates by benefit category, out-of-network utilization rates, prior authorization approval rates and timelines, average wait times for in-network appointments, and reimbursement rates as a percentage of Medicare rates. CMS would publish a "Parity Scorecard" for each plan, modeled on the Hospital Compare and Medicare Advantage Star Rating systems.

**Evidence Base**: The Hospital Compare program demonstrated that public reporting of quality metrics drives provider improvement even absent direct financial penalties. Research by Hibbard et al. (2005, *Health Affairs*) found that public reporting leads to quality improvements in approximately 75% of measured domains. CMS's Medicare Advantage Star Ratings similarly drive plan behavior because consumers and employers use ratings in purchasing decisions.

**Implementation**: DOL and CMS would develop standardized reporting templates. Plans would be required to submit data within 120 days of plan year end. CMS would publish the Parity Scorecard online with plan-level data searchable by employer, insurer, and geography.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $25-$40 million annually for DOL/CMS data collection and publication infrastructure, plus plan-level compliance costs of approximately $5,000-$50,000 per plan depending on size.

**Timeline**: 18 months to develop reporting standards; 12 months for first data collection cycle; initial publication within 3 years of enactment.

**Challenges**: Plans will resist public reporting of data that may reveal non-compliance. Self-insured employer plans may argue that plan-specific data is proprietary. Standardizing metrics across diverse plan designs is technically complex.

**Impact Metrics**: Reduction in variance of denial rates between MH/SUD and medical/surgical claims; decrease in out-of-network utilization disparity; improvement in average plan Parity Scorecard ratings over time.

### Solution 2: Reimbursement Rate Floor for MH/SUD Providers

**Description**: Establish a federal requirement that commercial health plans reimburse MH/SUD providers at rates no less than 100% of the applicable Medicare rate for the same service. This addresses the most significant structural cause of network inadequacy: the 20-40% reimbursement gap between MH/SUD and medical/surgical providers.

**Evidence Base**: Research by Mark et al. (2018, *Psychiatric Services*) found that increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates by 10% for psychiatrists was associated with a 4.5% increase in provider participation in Medicaid. Applying this elasticity, raising commercial rates to Medicare parity would significantly increase network participation. Milliman's 2024 analysis documents that MH/SUD reimbursement runs 77-83% of Medicare rates, while medical/surgical reimbursement runs 105-130% of Medicare. A floor of 100% of Medicare would still leave MH/SUD reimbursement below medical/surgical rates but would close the most extreme gaps.

**Implementation**: DOL and CMS would issue regulations defining the reimbursement rate floor, keyed to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Plans would be required to demonstrate compliance as part of their NQTL comparative analysis. Compliance would be measured using average contracted rates by CPT code category.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated premium increase of 0.3-0.8% based on actuarial modeling (CBO methodology), representing $4-$11 per member per month for commercial plans.

**Timeline**: Regulatory development: 18 months. Effective date: 2 years after enactment, with a 1-year phase-in period.

**Challenges**: Insurers will argue this is a price control that exceeds MHPAEA's scope. Constitutional challenges may arise under the Commerce Clause if applied to self-insured plans without clear statutory authority. Provider groups in high-cost regions may argue that Medicare rates are still inadequate.

**Impact Metrics**: In-network MH/SUD provider counts; psychiatrist acceptance of new commercial patients (baseline: 38%); out-of-network utilization for MH/SUD services (baseline: 16.3%).

### Solution 3: Independent Parity Compliance Audits

**Description**: Create a system of mandatory, independent, third-party parity compliance audits for all health plans with 1,000 or more enrollees. Audits would be conducted by DOL-certified compliance auditors (similar to the HIPAA Security Rule audit framework) on a 3-year cycle. Auditors would evaluate NQTL comparative analyses, denial rate data, network adequacy metrics, and prior authorization processes against standardized compliance criteria.

**Evidence Base**: HIPAA Security Rule audits have demonstrated that third-party compliance assessment identifies violations at rates significantly higher than self-reporting or complaint-driven models. The DOL Inspector General found in 2020 that EBSA's self-directed enforcement model missed the majority of parity violations, and recommended moving toward proactive auditing (DOL OIG Report No. 09-20-001-12-121, 2020).

**Implementation**: DOL would establish auditor certification standards and compliance criteria. Plans would be responsible for the cost of audits (similar to financial statement audits required of pension plans). Audit results would be reported to DOL and, for non-compliant plans, corrective action plans would be mandatory.

**Cost/Resources**: $10,000-$50,000 per plan audit, depending on plan size. Total program administration cost: $15-$25 million annually for DOL oversight.

**Timeline**: 12 months to establish certification standards; 18 months for first audit cycle; full coverage within 5 years.

**Challenges**: Developing a sufficient pool of certified auditors; potential resistance from plans to third-party access to proprietary data; cost burden on smaller plans.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of plans audited per cycle; compliance rate among audited plans; time from audit finding to corrective action.

### Solution 4: Close the ERISA Preemption Gap

**Description**: Amend ERISA to allow states to enforce MHPAEA against self-insured employer plans, or create a federal-state partnership model in which DOL delegates parity enforcement authority to qualified state insurance departments. This would address the structural enforcement gap that prevents states from regulating the majority of employer-sponsored plans.

**Evidence Base**: States with strong parity enforcement programs (Connecticut, Illinois, Oregon) demonstrate measurably better compliance outcomes for fully insured plans within their jurisdiction but cannot touch self-insured plans. A 2023 Kennedy Forum analysis found that states with proactive enforcement had 30-40% lower out-of-network utilization disparities for fully insured plans compared to states relying solely on federal enforcement.

**Implementation**: Two approaches: (1) Amend ERISA section 514 to create an exception for MHPAEA enforcement, allowing state insurance departments to examine self-insured plans for parity compliance. (2) Create a federal-state delegation model in which DOL certifies state enforcement programs meeting minimum standards and delegates enforcement authority, similar to OSHA's state plan structure.

**Cost/Resources**: Federal-state delegation would require $30-$50 million in federal grants to qualifying state programs, offset by enforcement efficiencies and reduced burden on DOL.

**Timeline**: Legislation required; estimated 2-3 years for passage and implementation of delegation framework.

**Challenges**: ERISA preemption is fiercely defended by the employer and insurance lobbies. ERIC and the Chamber of Commerce will oppose any erosion of the uniform federal standard for self-insured plans. Constitutional federalism arguments may be raised.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of states with delegated enforcement authority; parity compliance rates for self-insured plans in participating states; DOL investigative capacity freed for complex cases.

### Solution 5: Expand Parity to Medicare and Medicaid Fee-for-Service

**Description**: Enact legislation extending MHPAEA's requirements to Medicare fee-for-service and Medicaid fee-for-service programs. Currently, MHPAEA applies to employer-sponsored plans, individual market plans, and (since 2024) Medicaid managed care. Medicare fee-for-service and Medicaid fee-for-service are not covered, leaving significant gaps.

**Evidence Base**: Medicare fee-for-service imposes a 190-day lifetime limit on inpatient psychiatric hospital care (42 U.S.C. section 1812(b)(3)) -- a quantitative treatment limitation that would violate MHPAEA if applied in a commercial plan. Medicare's coverage of substance use disorder treatment is limited compared to medical treatment. Extending parity would affect approximately 37 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and millions of Medicaid fee-for-service enrollees.

**Implementation**: Legislation would amend Title XVIII (Medicare) and Title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to apply MHPAEA's requirements. CMS would issue implementing regulations within 24 months.

**Cost/Resources**: CBO has estimated the cost of eliminating the 190-day psychiatric hospital limit at $1.2-$1.8 billion over 10 years. Broader Medicare MH/SUD parity would cost an estimated $5-$10 billion over 10 years (Kennedy Forum estimate, 2024).

**Timeline**: Legislation required; estimated 3-5 years for passage given fiscal implications.

**Challenges**: Fiscal cost in a constrained budget environment; opposition from those who view Medicare as already providing adequate MH/SUD benefits; complexity of applying MHPAEA's private-plan framework to government programs.

**Impact Metrics**: Medicare and Medicaid MH/SUD utilization rates; reduction in out-of-pocket spending for Medicare MH/SUD beneficiaries; closure of the 190-day psychiatric inpatient limit.

### Solution 6: Standardized NQTL Comparison Methodology

**Description**: Require DOL and CMS to develop and publish a standardized, evidence-based methodology for NQTL comparative analyses. Currently, plans develop their own methodologies, leading to inconsistent and often superficial analyses. A standardized methodology would specify the data sources, comparison categories, statistical tests, and compliance thresholds for each type of NQTL.

**Evidence Base**: DOL's finding that 100% of initial NQTL comparative analyses were insufficient reflects the absence of a clear, enforceable standard. The Government Accountability Office recommended in 2022 that DOL develop more specific guidance on how plans should conduct NQTL analyses (GAO-22-104597). The 2024 final rule improved guidance but stopped short of mandating a specific methodology.

**Implementation**: DOL and CMS would convene a technical advisory committee of actuaries, clinicians, and compliance experts to develop the methodology. The committee would produce a publicly available comparison framework, updated biennially.

**Cost/Resources**: $5 million for initial development; $2 million annually for updates and technical assistance.

**Timeline**: 12-18 months for methodology development; 12 months for plan adoption.

**Challenges**: Industry will argue that one-size-fits-all methodology cannot accommodate plan design diversity. Actuarial complexity of comparing NQTLs across benefit classifications.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of NQTL analyses found sufficient by DOL; reduction in enforcement time per investigation; consistency of compliance determinations across jurisdictions.

### Solution 7: Prior Authorization Reform for MH/SUD Services

**Description**: Require health plans to meet specific prior authorization standards for MH/SUD services, including: (1) electronic, real-time authorization for routine outpatient services; (2) maximum 24-hour turnaround for urgent care authorizations; (3) prohibition on concurrent review more frequently for MH/SUD than for medical/surgical inpatient care; (4) automatic approval for continuation of established treatment regimens unless the plan can demonstrate a clinical basis for review.

**Evidence Base**: The American Medical Association's 2023 prior authorization survey found that 94% of physicians reported that prior authorization delayed necessary care, with MH/SUD services disproportionately affected. States that have enacted prior authorization reforms -- including Arkansas, Texas, and Colorado -- have reported reduced treatment delays without significant cost increases (NCOIL, 2023). Gold-carding programs in Texas and other states that exempt providers with high approval rates from prior authorization have been effective in reducing administrative burden.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation or regulation establishing prior authorization timing and process standards for MHPAEA-covered plans. States would be free to exceed federal minimums.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal net cost; administrative savings from streamlined processes may offset increased utilization. CBO has scored prior authorization reform proposals as approximately budget-neutral.

**Timeline**: 12 months for regulatory development; 18 months for plan compliance.

**Challenges**: Insurers will argue that prior authorization is a clinically necessary tool. Plans may resist real-time authorization requirements as technically burdensome.

**Impact Metrics**: Average prior authorization turnaround time; patient care abandonment rate during authorization process (baseline: 29%); MH/SUD prior authorization denial rate.

## International Models

### Australia: Better Access Program

**Description**: Australia's Better Access program, established in 2006, provides subsidized access to psychologists and other mental health professionals through Medicare (Australia's universal health care system). Patients receive up to 10 subsidized sessions per year with no prior authorization requirement. The program was expanded during COVID-19 to 20 sessions per year.

**Results**: Mental health service utilization increased 57% from 2006 to 2016. Out-of-pocket costs for psychological services decreased by 40%. Wait times for initial appointments decreased by 20% in the first five years (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2023). Patient satisfaction with mental health care increased from 63% to 78%.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The key lesson is that reducing administrative barriers (no prior authorization) and providing adequate reimbursement directly increases utilization and access. The U.S. could adopt a similar model within commercial insurance by eliminating prior authorization for initial and follow-up MH/SUD outpatient visits.

### United Kingdom: Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)

**Description**: The NHS's IAPT program provides evidence-based psychological therapies (primarily CBT) for common mental health conditions with no gatekeeping or prior authorization. Patients can self-refer, and services are delivered within a stepped care model with defined waiting time standards (6 weeks for initial assessment, 18 weeks for treatment).

**Results**: Over 1 million patients treated annually. Recovery rates of 50% for depression and anxiety (NHS Digital, 2023). Cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately 1:4 (every pound invested saves four pounds in reduced disability and healthcare costs).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The self-referral model and defined waiting time standards could inform U.S. parity standards. A maximum wait time standard for MH/SUD initial appointments (e.g., 14 days) would be a measurable parity compliance metric.

### Germany: Statutory Health Insurance Parity

**Description**: Germany's statutory health insurance system provides comprehensive MH/SUD coverage with parity standards enforced through the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA). Psychotherapy is covered with no visit limits, and patients can choose between psychoanalytic, cognitive behavioral, and systemic therapy modalities.

**Results**: Germany has one of the highest rates of psychotherapy utilization in Europe. Wait times remain a challenge (average 3-6 months for initial psychotherapy appointment), but coverage itself is comprehensive and equivalent to medical coverage.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Germany demonstrates that parity in benefit design is achievable within a regulated insurance market. The challenge of wait times despite comprehensive coverage underscores that parity in benefits must be accompanied by workforce adequacy.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

### Colorado Parity Enforcement Pilot

Colorado established a dedicated parity enforcement unit within its Division of Insurance in 2019, funded by a dedicated assessment on insurers. The unit conducts proactive market conduct examinations focused on NQTL compliance, network adequacy, and denial rate disparities. In its first three years, the unit identified parity violations in 78% of plans examined and required corrective actions including network expansion, reimbursement rate increases, and prior authorization reforms. Out-of-network MH/SUD utilization in fully insured Colorado plans decreased by 18% from 2019 to 2023 (Colorado Division of Insurance, 2024).

### Connecticut Parity Reporting Program

Connecticut requires all health plans to annually report MH/SUD denial rates, out-of-network utilization, and reimbursement rates alongside comparable medical/surgical data. The Connecticut Insurance Department publishes comparative reports, creating transparency and competitive pressure. Plans with the worst disparities face targeted examinations. Since implementation, Connecticut has seen a 22% reduction in the MH/SUD to medical/surgical denial rate gap (Connecticut Insurance Department, 2024).

## Complementary Policies

Parity enforcement alone cannot achieve equal access to mental health care without parallel reforms:

- **Behavioral health workforce expansion**: Increased graduate medical education funding for psychiatry; loan repayment programs for MH/SUD providers in underserved areas. See [Workforce Shortage](../workforce-shortage/07-solutions.md).
- **Telehealth integration**: Permanent extension of pandemic-era telehealth flexibilities for MH/SUD services; parity standards for telehealth benefits. See [Telehealth](../telehealth/07-solutions.md).
- **Medicaid reimbursement reform**: Increased Medicaid MH/SUD reimbursement rates to reduce cost-shifting to commercial insurance. See [Funding Systems](../funding-systems/07-solutions.md).
- **Crisis services expansion**: Investment in 988 crisis infrastructure and crisis stabilization units to reduce emergency department utilization. See [Crisis Services](../crisis-services/07-solutions.md).
