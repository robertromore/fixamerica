# Mental Health Insurance Parity: What You Can Do

Mental health insurance parity is one of the few policy areas where individual action -- filing an appeal, submitting a complaint, or contacting a regulator -- directly advances systemic reform. Every appeal that overturns a wrongful denial generates enforcement data. Every complaint filed with DOL or a state insurance department adds to the evidentiary base that regulators use to identify and correct parity violations. The gap between parity law and parity practice persists in large part because fewer than 0.5% of denied MH/SUD claims are ever appealed (DOL EBSA, 2023). Closing that gap requires informed, persistent citizen engagement.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- **Know your rights**: Read NAMI's "Understanding the Mental Health Parity Act" guide (<https://www.nami.org/Your-Rights/Mental-Health-Parity>) to understand what parity law requires and what questions to ask your insurer
- **Review your plan documents**: Request your plan's Summary Plan Description (SPD) and Evidence of Coverage (EOC). Look for prior authorization requirements, visit limits, and medical necessity criteria that apply differently to MH/SUD vs. medical services
- **Follow the 2024 final rule rollout**: The new NQTL comparative analysis requirements take effect in 2025-2026. Track implementation through the Kennedy Forum (<https://www.thekennedyforum.org>) and DOL EBSA updates
- **Read Milliman's parity research**: Milliman publishes the most comprehensive data on denial rate, out-of-network, and reimbursement rate disparities. Their reports are available at <https://www.milliman.com>
- **Subscribe to NAMI Advocacy Updates**: Monthly email updates on federal and state parity legislation and enforcement. Sign up at <https://www.nami.org/Advocacy>

### Exercise Your Insurance Rights

- **Appeal every wrongful MH/SUD denial**: If your MH/SUD claim is denied, file an internal appeal within the plan's deadline (typically 180 days). Cite MHPAEA if the denial involves prior authorization, medical necessity, or visit limitations that appear more restrictive than for medical services. The overturn rate on appeal is 40-60% for internal appeals and 50-75% for external reviews (NAIC, 2023).
- **Request your plan's NQTL comparative analysis**: Under the CAA of 2021, you have the right to request the comparative analysis your plan has conducted on each nonquantitative treatment limitation. If the plan fails to provide it within 30 days, file a complaint with DOL.
- **File external review requests**: If your internal appeal is denied, request external review through your state insurance department (for fully insured plans) or through the plan's external review process. External reviews are decided by independent reviewers, not the insurer.
- **Document everything**: Keep records of all communications, denials, authorizations, wait times, and appointment availability. This documentation is essential for complaints and appeals.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact your representatives**: Call or write your U.S. Senators and Representative to support increased funding for DOL parity enforcement (currently underfunded relative to the 2024 final rule's requirements)
- **Submit public comments**: When DOL, CMS, or state regulators issue proposed rules related to parity, submit public comments during the comment period. Instructions are posted at <https://www.regulations.gov>
- **Write letters to the editor**: When your local newspaper covers mental health, insurance, or healthcare policy, write a letter emphasizing parity enforcement. Use specific data: "MH/SUD claims are denied at nearly twice the rate of medical claims (22.4% vs. 11.7%, Milliman 2023)."
- **Share your story**: NAMI, the Kennedy Forum, and Mental Health America collect patient stories about parity violations. These stories are used in Congressional testimony, regulatory comments, and media coverage. Submit your story at <https://www.nami.org/Get-Involved/Share-Your-Story>

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- **Form a parity enforcement working group**: Partner with local NAMI affiliates, mental health providers, and patient advocates to monitor insurer compliance in your community. Track appointment wait times, denial experiences, and network availability.
- **Host "Know Your Rights" workshops**: Organize community events explaining parity law, how to read plan documents, and how to file appeals and complaints. Partner with legal aid organizations to provide free assistance.
- **Engage local employers**: Approach HR departments at local businesses to discuss parity compliance in their health plans. Many employers are unaware that their plans may be out of compliance. Provide them with DOL's compliance checklist and the Kennedy Forum's employer guide.
- **Connect with your state insurance department**: Many state insurance departments have dedicated consumer assistance divisions. Establish a relationship so that community members can easily report suspected violations.

### Build Coalitions

- **Join or support your local NAMI affiliate**: NAMI has over 600 state and local affiliates across the country. These organizations provide the grassroots infrastructure for parity advocacy. Find your local affiliate at <https://www.nami.org/Find-Your-Local-NAMI>
- **Partner with provider organizations**: Psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers experience parity violations daily through prior authorization denials and low reimbursement rates. They are natural allies for community advocacy.
- **Engage recovery community organizations**: Substance use disorder parity violations are often the most severe. Recovery community organizations like Faces & Voices of Recovery provide advocacy infrastructure for SUD parity.
- **Coordinate with legal aid**: Organizations like the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and the National Health Law Program can provide legal support for parity complaints and litigation.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When DOL or CMS budget appropriations are under consideration (typically February-September of each fiscal year)
- When mental health or insurance legislation is pending in Congress or your state legislature
- When your state's insurance commissioner race is on the ballot (in states where the position is elected)
- When you or a family member experiences a parity violation -- specific constituent stories are powerful

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Strong Mental Health Parity Enforcement

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State] writing to urge your support for
stronger enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act
(MHPAEA). Mental health claims are denied at nearly twice the rate of
medical claims (22.4% vs. 11.7%), and out-of-network utilization for
behavioral health is 5.4 times higher than for medical services -- clear
evidence that parity law is not being enforced.

I ask that you:

1. Support increased appropriations for DOL's Employee Benefits Security
   Administration to hire the investigators needed to enforce the 2024
   final rule on mental health parity.
2. Co-sponsor legislation to close the ERISA preemption gap that prevents
   states from enforcing parity in self-insured employer plans.
3. Support the extension of parity protections to Medicare fee-for-service,
   including elimination of the 190-day psychiatric inpatient limit.

[Optional: Personal story of how a parity violation affected you or your
family -- this is the most persuasive element of any constituent letter.]

Mental health parity is the law of the land, but millions of Americans are
denied the care they are legally entitled to. Please act to close the
enforcement gap.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling
to ask [Representative/Senator] [Last Name] to support stronger enforcement
of mental health parity law. Right now, mental health claims are denied at
twice the rate of medical claims, and the Department of Labor doesn't have
enough investigators to enforce the law. I'd like [Representative/Senator]
to support increased funding for DOL parity enforcement and legislation to
close the ERISA preemption gap. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act**: Would authorize the Parity Scorecard, fund independent compliance audits, and increase civil penalties for violations -- Contact members of the Senate HELP Committee and House Education & Workforce Committee
- **ERISA Parity Enforcement Amendment**: Would create federal-state delegation authority for parity enforcement of self-insured plans -- Contact Senate Finance Committee and House Ways & Means Committee members
- **Medicare Mental Health Parity Act**: Would extend MHPAEA to Medicare fee-for-service and eliminate the 190-day psychiatric inpatient limit -- Contact Senate Finance Committee members
- **State-level parity bills**: Check Parity Track (<https://www.paritytrack.org>) for pending legislation in your state. Many states are considering bills to require proactive parity reporting by insurers, dedicate enforcement staff, or increase penalties for violations.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support increased funding for DOL to enforce the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act? If so, how much additional funding would you support?"
2. "Do you support closing the ERISA preemption gap so that state insurance departments can enforce parity for self-insured employer plans?"
3. "Do you support extending parity protections to Medicare fee-for-service, including eliminating the 190-day psychiatric inpatient limit?"
4. "What specific actions would you take to ensure that mental health insurance parity is enforced, not just written into law?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who support specific enforcement mechanisms, not just general statements of support for mental health. Most politicians support "mental health" in the abstract; the differentiator is willingness to fund enforcement and hold insurers accountable.
- Insurance commissioner races (in the 11 states where the position is elected) are particularly important for parity enforcement. Ask candidates about their enforcement priorities and staffing plans.
- State legislative races matter for fully insured plan parity enforcement. Check whether your state representatives have supported parity bills.

## Professional Actions

- **For healthcare providers**: Document every parity violation you encounter -- prior authorization delays, claim denials, reimbursement rate disparities, and network exclusion. Report these to your professional association (APA, APA, NASW) and file complaints with DOL or your state insurance department. Consider joining your state's parity enforcement advisory board if one exists.
- **For employer benefits managers**: Request your plan's NQTL comparative analysis and review it. Compare MH/SUD denial rates, prior authorization requirements, and network adequacy metrics to medical/surgical equivalents. Require your insurer or TPA to demonstrate compliance. Use the Kennedy Forum's employer parity compliance guide.
- **For attorneys**: Familiarize yourself with MHPAEA case law, particularly *Wit v. United Behavioral Health* and *New York State Psychiatric Association v. UnitedHealth Group*. Consider pro bono representation of patients in parity appeals and litigation. Contact the Bazelon Center or National Health Law Program for referrals.
- **For journalists**: The 2024 final rule creates new transparency requirements that will generate enforceable compliance data beginning in 2025-2026. Request plan-level data from DOL and state insurance departments. Compare MH/SUD denial rates across major insurers. Contact the Kennedy Forum's media team for expert sources.
- **For researchers**: Access SAMHSA NSDUH data, Milliman reports, and DOL enforcement data to study parity compliance trends. The 2024 final rule's outcomes data requirement will create new research opportunities beginning in 2026. Consider applying for NIMH or AHRQ grants focused on insurance barriers to MH/SUD care.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing mental health insurance parity with others, emphasize:

1. **The denial gap is measurable and severe**: "Mental health claims are denied at 22.4% compared to 11.7% for medical claims -- nearly double the rate. When these denials are appealed, 50-75% are overturned, proving the initial denials were not clinically justified." (Milliman 2023, NAIC 2023)
2. **The network gap is real**: "Patients must go out-of-network for behavioral health services at 5.4 times the rate of medical services, because only 38% of psychiatrists accept commercial insurance vs. 86% of primary care doctors." (Milliman 2023, Bishop et al., JAMA 2023)
3. **The law exists but enforcement is failing**: "Federal parity law has been on the books since 2008, but the Department of Labor found that 100% of initial plan compliance analyses were insufficient. Parity is the law; enforcement is the problem." (DOL EBSA, 2023)
4. **Non-compliance costs more than compliance**: "Untreated mental health conditions cost employers $47.6 billion annually in lost productivity. Enforcing parity costs a fraction of that." (National Safety Council, 2023)
5. **This affects everyone**: "57.8 million American adults have a mental health condition, and 48.7 million have a substance use disorder. Insurance parity affects nearly every family in the country." (SAMHSA, 2023)

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Mental health parity is already the law, so the problem is solved." | Parity is the law, but enforcement is failing: denial rates remain 2x higher for MH/SUD, and 100% of initial plan compliance analyses were found insufficient by DOL. | DOL EBSA, 2023; Milliman, 2023 |
| "The provider shortage is the real problem, not insurers." | Low reimbursement rates (20-40% below medical rates) drive providers out of networks. Only 38% of psychiatrists accept commercial insurance. | Milliman, 2024; Bishop et al., JAMA, 2023 |
| "Parity enforcement will increase premiums significantly." | CBO estimates parity compliance costs at less than 1% of premiums for most plans. Industry predictions of 3-5% increases have never materialized. | CBO, 2024; DOL, 2012 |
| "Prior authorization is just good clinical practice." | PA is applied to 30-40% of MH/SUD services vs. 10-15% of medical services, and 29% of patients abandon care during the process. | APA, 2023; Kennedy Forum, 2023 |
| "My self-insured employer plan is already regulated." | Self-insured plans are overseen by DOL, not state insurance departments, and DOL has only ~500 investigators for ~2.5 million plans. | DOL EBSA, FY2024 |
