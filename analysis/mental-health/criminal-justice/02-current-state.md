# Criminal Justice and Mental Health: Current State

## Mental Health Prevalence in Jails and Prisons

The scale of mental illness in the criminal justice system is staggering and has grown steadily over the past two decades. People with mental health conditions are dramatically overrepresented at every stage of the system.

### Prevalence Rates

| Population | Any Mental Health Condition | Serious Mental Illness (SMI) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| U.S. jails | 44% | 17% | Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023 |
| State prisons | 37% | 14.5% | Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023 |
| Federal prisons | 25% | 9% | Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023 |
| General U.S. adult population | 22.8% | 5.5% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |

| **Total incarcerated** | **~1,863,400** | **~717,100** | **~278,000** | |

### Co-Occurring Conditions

Mental illness in the criminal justice population rarely occurs in isolation.

## Crisis Response Systems

### Police as First Responders

Law enforcement remains the de facto front line of the mental health crisis response system across most of the United States.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Police calls involving mental health crises | 10-20% of all calls | Police Executive Research Forum, 2020 |
| Officer time spent on mental health calls | 21% of total duty hours | PERF, 2020 |

| Percentage of fatal police shootings involving mental illness | ~25% | Washington Post, 2024 |

### Crisis Intervention Teams (CIT)

The Memphis Model CIT program, developed in 1988, is the most widely adopted law enforcement-based mental health response model.

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |

## Jail Diversion Programs

### Sequential Intercept Model

The Sequential Intercept Model (SIM), developed by Munroe-Meyer Institute researchers Mark Munetz and Patricia Griffin in 2006, identifies five intercept points where people with mental illness can be diverted from deeper criminal justice involvement.

| Intercept | Point | Examples | Estimated Programs | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Intercept 0** | Community services (pre-crisis) | Community mental health centers, ACT teams | ~3,000+ CMHCs | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| **Intercept 1** | Law enforcement/emergency services | CIT, co-responders, crisis stabilization | ~3,500 combined | CIT International, 2023 |
| **Intercept 2** | Initial detention/court hearings | Pretrial diversion, arraignment screening | ~800 | CSG Justice Center, 2023 |
| **Intercept 3** | Jails/courts | Mental health courts, treatment courts | ~450 mental health courts | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| **Intercept 4** | Reentry | Transition planning, APIC model | Limited; ~200 formal programs | Vera Institute, 2023 |

### Stepping Up Initiative

The Stepping Up Initiative, launched in 2015 by the National Association of Counties, the Council of State Governments Justice Center, and the American Psychiatric Association, aims to reduce the number of people with mental illness in jails.

| Average reduction in bookings of people with SMI (Innovator counties) | 20-40% | CSG Justice Center, 2023 |

## Mental Health Courts

### National Overview

Mental health courts (MHCs) are specialized court dockets that connect defendants with mental illness to judicially supervised treatment plans as alternatives to traditional prosecution.

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |

- **Medicaid Reentry Waiver (2023)**: CMS final rule allows pre-release Medicaid coverage, with 20 states applying or approved (CMS, 2025)
- **Solitary Confinement Restrictions**: 18 states plus D.C. now ban or restrict solitary for people with SMI, up from 5 states in 2015 (Vera Institute, 2024)
- **CAHOOTS Model Replication**: Civilian crisis response programs launched in 20+ cities inspired by Eugene, Oregon model (White Bird Clinic, 2023)
- **Outpatient Competency Restoration**: At least 12 states now authorize community-based competency restoration as alternative to state hospital (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2024)

### Worsening Trends (2019-2024)

- **Competency Backlogs**: IST waitlists grew 150% from 2019 to 2024, with 23 states facing litigation (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2024)
- **Correctional Staffing Crisis**: Correctional mental health positions have 30-40% vacancy rates nationally (NCCHC, 2023)

- **Housing Shortage**: People with SMI released from jail face average 6-month waitlists for supportive housing (HUD, 2023)
- **Forensic Bed Shortage**: 32 states report forensic psychiatric bed shortages exceeding 50% of need (NASMHPD, 2023)

## Emerging Challenges

### Fentanyl and Polysubstance Use

The fentanyl crisis has dramatically increased the complexity of mental health presentations in the criminal justice system. Co-occurring opioid use disorder among incarcerated people with mental illness increased from 38% in 2018 to 52% in 2023 (National Commission on Correctional Health Care, 2023), requiring integrated treatment approaches that few jails and prisons can deliver.

### Artificial Intelligence in Risk Assessment

A growing number of jurisdictions use algorithmic risk assessment tools to make pretrial release and sentencing decisions. Research indicates these tools may systematically disadvantage people with mental illness by scoring behavioral health symptoms as risk factors (Brookings Institution, 2023). The use of AI in determining who gets diverted to treatment versus prosecuted raises concerns about bias and transparency.

### Post-Pandemic Workforce Collapse

The behavioral health workforce crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, has created cascading effects throughout the criminal justice-mental health system. Community mental health centers report 25-30% staff vacancy rates (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023), reducing the capacity of diversion programs, mental health courts, and reentry services to accept referrals from the justice system.
