# Criminal Justice and Mental Health

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of the intersection between mental illness and the criminal justice system in the United States, examining how the failure of community mental health infrastructure has transformed jails and prisons into the nation's largest psychiatric facilities.

## Overview

An estimated 2 million people with serious mental illness are booked into U.S. jails each year, and approximately 44% of people in jails and 37% of people in state prisons have a diagnosed mental health condition (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023). The criminalization of mental illness represents one of the most significant failures of American public policy, tracing directly to the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1960s-1980s, which closed state psychiatric hospitals without building adequate community-based alternatives.

This analysis examines the full scope of how mental illness intersects with every stage of the criminal justice process -- from initial police encounters through arrest, pretrial detention, adjudication, incarceration, and reentry. It explores evidence-based alternatives including Crisis Intervention Teams (CIT), mental health courts, jail diversion programs, the Sequential Intercept Model, and competency restoration reform. The analysis proposes a comprehensive framework for decriminalizing mental illness while maintaining public safety and expanding treatment access.
