# Criminal Justice and Mental Health: What You Can Do

The criminalization of mental illness in the United States is not inevitable -- it is the result of policy choices that can be changed. Citizens, professionals, families, and communities can take concrete actions to reduce the number of people with mental illness in jails and prisons, improve crisis response, and expand access to treatment. This guide provides specific, actionable steps at every level of engagement.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the Treatment Advocacy Center's annual "Grading the States" report on psychiatric bed capacity and crisis services in your state (<https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/>)
- Follow the Stepping Up Initiative dashboard to track your county's progress on reducing mental illness in jails (<https://stepuptogether.org/>)
- Subscribe to the Marshall Project newsletter for investigative reporting on criminal justice and mental health (<https://www.themarshallproject.org/>)
- Read *Insane: America's Criminal Treatment of Mental Illness* by Alisa Roth for a comprehensive narrative of the crisis
- Review your state's 988 implementation status and crisis response capacity through SAMHSA's 988 dashboard (<https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/988>)

### Make Personal Changes

- Program 988 into your phone and your family's phones. In a mental health emergency, call 988 before calling 911 when there is no immediate danger to life.
- Learn Mental Health First Aid through the National Council for Mental Wellbeing's 8-hour training course (<https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/>). Over 3 million Americans have been trained.
- If you serve on a jury, understand that defendants with mental illness may present differently in court. Ask whether mental health was assessed and what treatment options were considered.
- If you encounter a person in apparent mental health distress in public, contact 988 or your local crisis line rather than calling 911 unless there is an immediate safety threat.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call or write your U.S. Senators and Representative about mental health crisis funding, Medicaid reentry policy, and competency restoration reform. Key moments: during federal budget deliberations (typically February-September) and when mental health legislation is introduced.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS proposes Medicaid rules affecting mental health coverage or reentry, submit comments during the public comment period. Federal Register notices are posted at <https://www.regulations.gov/>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: After high-profile incidents involving mental illness and violence, counter the "dangerous mental patient" narrative with data: people with mental illness commit only 3-5% of violent acts and are 10 times more likely to be victims than perpetrators (NIMH, 2022).
- **Share Information**: Use social media to share Treatment Advocacy Center data, Stepping Up Initiative progress reports, and CAHOOTS model outcomes. Evidence-based messaging changes public perception.

---

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- **Attend county commission meetings** when jail budgets, mental health funding, or Stepping Up resolutions are on the agenda. Over 530 counties have passed Stepping Up resolutions; if yours has not, advocate for one.
- **Host a community screening** of documentaries on the topic, such as *Ernie & Joe: Crisis Cops* (HBO, 2019), which follows two San Antonio CIT officers, or *Bedlam* (2019), which documents the Los Angeles mental health crisis.
- **Organize a joint forum** with local law enforcement, mental health providers, and families affected by the criminal justice system. Invite your sheriff, police chief, and county mental health director to discuss crisis response alternatives.
- **Start a local NAMI affiliate** or join an existing one. NAMI's 600+ local affiliates are the backbone of grassroots mental health advocacy. Find your nearest affiliate at <https://www.nami.org/Find-Your-Local-NAMI>.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect mental health advocacy organizations with criminal justice reform groups in your area. The Stepping Up Initiative's success depends on collaboration between health and justice stakeholders.
- Partner with local faith communities, which often serve as de facto mental health support systems. Many Religious Right and progressive faith organizations share common ground on compassion for people with mental illness.
- Engage business leaders by framing mental health crisis response as an economic issue: communities with effective crisis systems have lower emergency room costs, lower jail costs, and fewer lost-productivity impacts.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During federal budget season (February-September), advocate for SAMHSA, BJA, and CMS mental health funding
- When 988 implementation legislation is introduced in your state legislature
- When your state considers Medicaid Reentry waiver applications
- When competency restoration reforms are debated in state courts or legislatures
- After high-profile incidents involving mental illness, to counter calls for punitive responses

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Mental Health Crisis Alternatives to Incarceration

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge your support
for policies that address the criminalization of mental illness in our
community.

Currently, 2 million people with serious mental illness are booked
into American jails each year, and the three largest psychiatric
facilities in the country are jails, not hospitals. This is not a
public safety strategy -- it is an expensive failure. We spend
approximately $15 billion annually on correctional mental health care
that makes people sicker, while community-based alternatives cost less
and reduce recidivism.

I urge you to support:
- Full funding for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and mobile
  crisis team infrastructure
- Medicaid continuity during and after incarceration
- Mental health court expansion
- Competency restoration reform to eliminate unconstitutional delays

Treatment makes communities safer. Every $1 invested in mental health
courts returns $2.21 in avoided criminal justice costs. I ask you to
invest in solutions that work.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm
calling to urge [Representative/Senator] [Last Name] to support
mental health crisis response funding, including full 988
implementation and mobile crisis teams. Two million people with mental
illness are booked into jails each year, and we need clinical
alternatives to arrest. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **988 Implementation Act** (state level): Establishes dedicated funding for 988 crisis call centers and mobile crisis teams. Contact your state legislators to advocate for 988 funding in your state's budget.
- **Medicaid Reentry Act**: Makes the 2023 CMS Medicaid Reentry waiver permanent. Contact your U.S. Senators to support federal legislation.
- **Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act Reauthorization**: Expands funding for mental health courts and diversion programs. Contact your Representative and Senators to support reauthorization with increased appropriations.
- **Solitary Confinement Reform Act** (state and federal): Prohibits solitary confinement for people with serious mental illness. Contact your state legislators and federal representatives.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your position on funding 988 crisis services and mobile crisis teams as alternatives to police response for mental health emergencies?"
2. "Do you support expanding Medicaid coverage during and after incarceration to ensure treatment continuity?"
3. "What is your plan to address the competency restoration backlog in our state, where defendants wait [X months] for evaluation?"
4. "Do you support restricting the use of solitary confinement for people with serious mental illness in our state's prisons and jails?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- County sheriff races are among the most consequential elections for mental health-criminal justice reform. Sheriffs control most U.S. jails and have discretion over screening, diversion, and crisis response.
- District attorney races determine whether prosecutors will support diversion programs and mental health courts or oppose them.
- State legislators control Medicaid policy, crisis system funding, and competency restoration law. Identify candidates who support specific reform measures, not just general sympathy for mental health.

## Professional Actions

- **For Law Enforcement Officers**: Request CIT training through your department. If your department does not offer CIT, contact CIT International (<https://www.citinternational.org/>) for resources to advocate for it. Over 130,000 officers have been CIT-trained; fewer than 15% of agencies participate.
- **For Mental Health Clinicians**: Volunteer with local mental health courts, co-responder programs, or 988 crisis centers. Forensic and crisis settings have the highest vacancy rates (25-40%) and the greatest need for qualified professionals.
- **For Attorneys**: Volunteer with legal aid organizations representing defendants with mental illness in competency proceedings. Contact the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law (<https://www.bazelon.org/>) for pro bono opportunities.
- **For Judges**: Explore mental health court training through the National Judicial College or the CSG Justice Center. Consider whether your jurisdiction would benefit from a mental health court docket.
- **For Educators**: Incorporate crisis de-escalation and Mental Health First Aid into school staff training. Schools are often the first system to encounter youth with mental health conditions before they enter the juvenile justice system.
- **For Healthcare Providers**: Advocate for universal psychiatric screening in emergency departments and establish warm handoff protocols with community mental health providers. Support Medicaid reentry enrollment in your facility.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing criminal justice and mental health reform with others, emphasize:

1. **The scale**: 2 million people with serious mental illness are booked into jails every year. The three largest psychiatric facilities in the country are jails, not hospitals (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023).
2. **The cost**: We spend $15 billion annually on correctional mental health care that makes people sicker. Community treatment costs $8,000-$15,000 per year versus $40,000-$60,000 for jail (SAMHSA, 2023; Vera Institute, 2023).
3. **The evidence**: Mental health courts reduce recidivism by 20%, and every $1 invested returns $2.21 in avoided criminal justice costs (RAND, 2022). CIT programs reduce arrests by 50-60% for mental health calls (Watson et al., 2021).
4. **The alternative**: Programs like CAHOOTS in Eugene, Oregon, have safely handled 24,000 crisis calls annually for over 30 years with fewer than 1% requiring police backup (White Bird Clinic, 2023).
5. **The reform**: This is not about being "soft on crime." It is about being smart on public safety. Treatment reduces risk; incarceration increases it.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "People with mental illness are dangerous" | People with mental illness commit only 3-5% of violent acts and are 10 times more likely to be victims than perpetrators | NIMH, 2022 |
| "Diversion programs are revolving doors" | Mental health court participants have 20% lower recidivism than traditionally prosecuted defendants | RAND Corporation, 2022 |
| "We can't afford community treatment" | The current system costs $15 billion annually in correctional MH care; community alternatives cost less and produce better outcomes | Vera Institute, 2023 |
| "Sending civilians to crisis calls is dangerous" | CAHOOTS has operated for 30+ years with <1% of calls requiring police backup and zero team member deaths on duty | White Bird Clinic, 2023 |
| "Mental health is an excuse for criminal behavior" | Diversion programs impose structured accountability through treatment plans, judicial oversight, and graduated sanctions | SAMHSA, 2023 |
