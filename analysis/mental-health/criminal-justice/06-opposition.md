# Criminal Justice and Mental Health: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to divert people with mental illness from the criminal justice system, expand community-based treatment, and reform correctional mental health care face resistance from a range of actors who believe that public safety requires criminal justice responses, that diversion programs are soft on crime, or that the costs of reform are unjustifiable. Understanding these arguments -- and their strengths and weaknesses -- is essential to building effective reform strategies.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| District attorneys' associations | Maintain prosecutorial discretion; preserve ability to leverage charges for plea deals | Political influence; large budgets; "tough on crime" electoral advantage | Lobbying against mandatory diversion; framing reform as endangering public safety |
| Police unions | Protect officer roles and staffing levels; resist civilian alternative response models | Collective bargaining power; political endorsements; media access | Opposing CAHOOTS-style programs; arguing only armed officers can safely respond to crisis calls |
| Private corrections companies (CoreCivic, GEO Group) | Maintain jail and prison census and per-diem revenue | $13 million in lobbying, $8 million in campaign contributions (2022 cycle) | Indirectly opposing diversion through political contributions to tough-on-crime candidates |
| Private correctional healthcare companies (Wellpath, YesCare) | Maintain contracts for in-facility mental health services | Multi-billion dollar contracts with state and county facilities | Opposing reforms that shift care to community settings; lobbying for contract renewals |
| Victims' rights organizations | Ensure accountability for people who commit crimes, including those with mental illness | Moral authority; legislative coalitions; media sympathy | Opposing diversion for violent offenses; advocating for victim notification and participation in MHC proceedings |
| Forensic psychiatry industry | Revenue from competency evaluations and inpatient restoration | Professional associations; expert witness fees | Opposing community-based restoration models that reduce state hospital referrals |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Law-and-order conservatives**: Believe that criminal behavior must be met with consequences regardless of mental health status. View diversion as undermining deterrence and personal responsibility. Concerned that mental health diagnosis becomes an "excuse" for criminal conduct.

- **Libertarian skeptics**: While generally supportive of reducing incarceration, some libertarians oppose government-funded mental health programs and mandatory treatment as state overreach. They prefer voluntary, market-based treatment solutions and view mental health courts as expanding judicial power.

- **Public safety populists**: Believe that crime -- particularly visible street crime associated with mental illness and homelessness -- should be addressed through enforcement. Support "quality of life" policing. Often influenced by high-profile cases of violence committed by people with untreated mental illness.

- **Fiscal conservatives**: Oppose new spending on mental health infrastructure even when evidence shows long-term cost savings. Demand proof of return on investment before committing public funds and resist the upfront costs required to build crisis and diversion systems.

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: Diversion Programs Endanger Public Safety

**Claim**: Diverting people with mental illness from the criminal justice system puts the public at risk. Without the accountability structure of criminal prosecution, people will not comply with treatment and will commit additional crimes. Mental health courts and diversion programs are "revolving doors" that cycle dangerous people through the system without consequences.

**Evidence Cited**: Opponents point to high-profile cases of violence committed by people with untreated mental illness who had prior criminal justice contact, such as mass shootings and subway attacks. They cite studies showing that a subset of people with untreated schizophrenia and co-occurring substance use have elevated violence risk.

**Reality**: The overwhelming weight of evidence shows that diversion programs reduce recidivism. A 2022 RAND Corporation meta-analysis of mental health court outcomes found a 20% average reduction in recidivism compared to traditional adjudication. CIT programs reduce arrest rates for mental health calls by 50-60% (Watson et al., 2021). The MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study found that people with mental illness who are in treatment have violence rates comparable to the general population. Conversely, incarceration without treatment increases recidivism: people with SMI have a 65% rearrest rate within one year of release, compared to 44% for the general released population (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2022).

**Rebuttal**: The evidence consistently demonstrates that treatment reduces risk more effectively than incarceration. The current system -- which provides inadequate treatment during incarceration and virtually none upon release -- is the actual "revolving door." Diversion programs that connect people to sustained treatment are the evidence-based alternative. For the small subset of individuals who present genuine violence risk, risk assessment tools and graduated supervision within diversion frameworks can provide appropriate public safety safeguards.

### Argument 2: Mental Illness Should Not Be an "Excuse" for Criminal Behavior

**Claim**: Allowing mental illness to mitigate criminal responsibility undermines the principle that all people are equal before the law. If people with mental illness can avoid prosecution through diversion, the system creates a perverse incentive to claim mental illness and erodes the deterrent effect of criminal law.

**Evidence Cited**: Opponents point to cases where defendants are perceived to have "gamed" the mental health system, or where mental health courts imposed lighter consequences than would have resulted from traditional prosecution. They argue that personal responsibility is essential to recovery and that excusing behavior enables further dysfunction.

**Reality**: Diversion programs do not excuse criminal behavior or eliminate accountability. Mental health courts impose structured treatment plans with regular judicial oversight, drug testing, and graduated sanctions -- often more intensive supervision than traditional probation. Participants who fail to comply with treatment conditions face reinstatement of criminal charges. The eligibility criteria for most diversion programs are stringent, requiring clinically documented diagnoses from qualified professionals, not self-report. Malingering is relatively rare: a 2020 meta-analysis published in *Psychological Bulletin* found that only 8-17% of forensic defendants show signs of symptom exaggeration, and standardized assessment tools detect most cases.

**Rebuttal**: Accountability and treatment are not mutually exclusive. Mental health courts and diversion programs create a different form of accountability -- one focused on behavioral change rather than punishment. The question is not whether people should be held accountable, but what form of accountability produces the best outcomes. The evidence strongly favors treatment-based accountability over incarceration for people with mental illness.

### Argument 3: We Cannot Afford the Upfront Investment

**Claim**: Building a comprehensive crisis response and diversion infrastructure requires billions of dollars in new spending that governments cannot afford. In a fiscal environment of competing priorities, mental health reform must compete with education, transportation, and other essential services. The promised cost savings are speculative and long-term, while the costs are immediate and certain.

**Evidence Cited**: Opponents point to the cost of implementing 988 (estimated at $6 billion annually for full implementation), building crisis stabilization centers, hiring mobile crisis teams, and expanding community mental health capacity. They note that the 2023 CMS Medicaid Reentry waiver will cost an estimated $3.5 billion over 10 years.

**Reality**: The current system is already extraordinarily expensive. The United States spends approximately $15 billion annually on correctional mental health care (Vera Institute, 2023), $40,000-$60,000 per jail inmate per year, and $130,000-$250,000 per defendant for inpatient competency restoration (NASMHPD, 2023). Studies consistently show that diversion and community treatment are less expensive than incarceration: mental health court participants cost $8,000-$15,000 per year, compared to $40,000-$60,000 for jail (SAMHSA, 2023). The RAND Corporation estimated that every $1 invested in mental health courts returns $2.21 in avoided criminal justice costs (RAND, 2022). The choice is not between spending and not spending; it is between spending on costly, ineffective incarceration or investing in less expensive, more effective community alternatives.

**Rebuttal**: Every fiscal analysis of jail diversion programs shows that the savings from reduced incarceration, emergency room visits, and recidivism outweigh the costs of treatment programs. The question is not whether the nation can afford community-based mental health infrastructure; it is whether the nation can afford to continue spending $15 billion annually on a system that makes people sicker and increases future costs.

### Argument 4: Alternative Response Models Cannot Ensure Safety

**Claim**: Programs like CAHOOTS that dispatch civilian crisis teams instead of police are dangerous. Mental health crises are unpredictable, and civilians without law enforcement training and authority cannot safely manage situations that may turn violent. Removing police from mental health calls will result in injuries and deaths.

**Evidence Cited**: Opponents point to incidents where mental health calls have turned violent, including the assaults and killings of mental health professionals by clients. They argue that the unpredictability of crisis situations requires the presence of armed officers who can use force if necessary.

**Reality**: The CAHOOTS program in Eugene, Oregon, has operated since 1989, responding to approximately 24,000 calls annually, and reports that fewer than 1% of calls require police backup (White Bird Clinic, 2023). In over 30 years of operation, no CAHOOTS team member has been killed on duty. Studies of co-responder programs show a 28-36% reduction in injuries to both officers and civilians compared to police-only responses (Compton et al., 2022). The evidence indicates that clinical responses to behavioral health crises are safer, not more dangerous, than law enforcement-led responses. This is because the presence of armed officers in uniform can escalate situations involving people in psychotic or agitated states.

**Rebuttal**: The safety data for civilian crisis response programs is extensive and positive. No program model sends civilians to situations involving weapons, active violence, or imminent threats -- those calls go to law enforcement. The question is whether the 80-90% of mental health calls that do not involve immediate danger are better handled by clinicians or by officers with guns and handcuffs. The evidence overwhelmingly supports clinical response for these calls. The strongest model is a tiered dispatch system that routes calls appropriately based on assessed risk level.

### Argument 5: Mental Health Courts Are Coercive and Expand the Carceral State

**Claim**: Mental health courts and other therapeutic courts are not genuine alternatives to incarceration but rather extensions of criminal justice authority into the health sphere. They condition treatment on criminal justice involvement, require guilty pleas or charges as entry criteria, and impose mandatory treatment with the threat of incarceration for noncompliance. They expand the reach of the state over individuals' bodies and minds.

**Evidence Cited**: Civil liberties organizations point to research showing that mental health courts can result in longer periods of supervision than traditional sentencing, that racial disparities persist in who gets referred to versus excluded from mental health courts, and that mandatory treatment constitutes a form of coercion that undermines therapeutic relationships. Some studies suggest that defendants who decline mental health court fare no worse than those who participate.

**Reality**: The coercion critique raises legitimate concerns. A 2022 study by Redlich et al. found that racial disparities in mental health court referral rates mirror those in the broader criminal justice system. Some mental health courts do impose longer supervision periods than would result from traditional prosecution of the same charges. These are genuine design flaws that require reform. However, the alternative is not freedom from coercion; it is incarceration, which is far more coercive than court-supervised treatment. The relevant comparison is not between mental health court and liberty, but between mental health court and jail.

**Rebuttal**: The coercion argument is strongest when mental health courts are the *only* path to treatment. The appropriate response is not to eliminate mental health courts but to build a continuum of treatment options so that criminal justice involvement is not a prerequisite for accessing care. Simultaneously, mental health courts should be reformed to eliminate racial disparities in referrals, limit supervision duration to what is therapeutically necessary, and expand voluntary participation options.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

Opposition to diverting people with mental illness from criminal justice has followed a consistent pattern over several decades:

1. **High-profile incident narrative**: A person with untreated mental illness commits a violent act. Media coverage frames the event as evidence that diversion and community treatment are dangerous.

2. **Political backlash**: Elected officials, particularly district attorneys and sheriffs running for reelection, call for stronger enforcement and oppose "soft on crime" policies.

3. **Reform retreat**: Pending legislation for diversion programs or community mental health funding is shelved, modified, or defunded in response to public fear.

4. **Evidence ignored**: Research showing that incarceration worsens mental illness and increases long-term risk is dismissed as irrelevant in the face of public outrage.

This pattern played out after the Virginia Tech shooting (2007), the Sandy Hook shooting (2012), the New York City subway attacks (2022), and numerous other incidents. The challenge for reformers is that the evidence base for diversion is built on aggregate data and long-term outcomes, while opposition is fueled by individual narratives and immediate fear.

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Bipartisan framing**: Mental health and criminal justice reform has genuine bipartisan appeal. Conservative arguments about government waste and personal liberty align with progressive arguments about treatment access and racial justice. The Stepping Up Initiative's bipartisan leadership (NACo, APA, CSG) demonstrates this potential.
- **Sheriff and law enforcement champions**: Sheriffs who publicly advocate for mental health diversion -- such as those in the Stepping Up "Innovator" counties -- are among the most credible voices for reform with conservative audiences. Elevating these voices is strategically essential.
- **Fiscal conservatism appeal**: Framing diversion as a cost-saving measure rather than a soft-on-crime measure changes the political calculation. Every dollar spent on community treatment that saves two dollars in incarceration costs appeals to fiscal conservatives regardless of ideology.

### Communication Strategies

- **Lead with safety**: Rather than framing reform as compassion for people with mental illness, lead with data showing that treatment-based approaches reduce crime and improve community safety. The message "treatment makes communities safer" is more politically resilient than "people with mental illness deserve compassion."
- **Humanize with stories**: Aggregate data alone does not overcome fear-based opposition. Personal narratives from families, people in recovery, law enforcement officers, and judges who have seen diversion work are essential communication tools.
- **Acknowledge legitimate concerns**: Dismissing public safety concerns as ignorant or callous alienates potential allies. Effective communication acknowledges that some people with mental illness do commit serious crimes and explains how graduated intervention frameworks address risk proportionally.

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Tiered response models**: Design alternative response systems with clear protocols for escalation, so that critics cannot claim civilians are being sent into dangerous situations. Maintain a police response option for calls involving weapons, active violence, or imminent threats.
- **Include accountability mechanisms**: Build monitoring, reporting, and graduated sanctions into diversion programs so that they cannot be characterized as "free passes." Mental health courts and diversion programs that demonstrate accountability are harder to attack politically.
- **Start with non-controversial populations**: Pilot diversion programs with populations that generate the least opposition (misdemeanor defendants, veterans, juveniles) and expand eligibility as programs demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
