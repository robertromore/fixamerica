# Criminal Justice and Mental Health: Solutions

Addressing the criminalization of mental illness requires a multi-faceted approach that simultaneously builds community-based crisis infrastructure, reforms the criminal justice system's treatment of people with mental illness, and eliminates the structural barriers -- funding gaps, workforce shortages, and fragmented governance -- that perpetuate the status quo. No single intervention can solve this problem; effective reform must operate at every intercept point where people with mental illness encounter the justice system.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- **Treatment, not punishment**: Mental illness is a health condition, not a crime. Policy should ensure that behavioral health emergencies are met with clinical responses and that incarceration is never the consequence of untreated illness alone.
- **Intercept at the earliest possible point**: The further a person with mental illness penetrates into the criminal justice system, the harder and more expensive it is to divert them. Crisis response and pre-arrest diversion should be the primary intervention points.
- **Continuity of care across systems**: People with mental illness must not lose treatment when they move between community, jail, court, prison, and reentry. Seamless transitions require shared data systems, Medicaid continuity, and coordinated discharge planning.
- **Proportionality and due process**: Diversion programs and mental health courts must not impose supervision that exceeds what the original charge would warrant. Competency restoration must not result in detention longer than the potential sentence.
- **Equity and accountability**: Reform must address racial and socioeconomic disparities in who is diverted to treatment versus prosecuted. Programs must track outcomes by race, ethnicity, and income.

### Theory of Change

The current system criminalizes mental illness because community-based alternatives are unavailable or inaccessible at the moment of crisis. Building a robust crisis continuum -- from 988 call centers to mobile crisis teams to crisis stabilization centers to supported community treatment -- creates viable alternatives to arrest at the front end. Simultaneously, reforming competency restoration, correctional mental health care, and reentry planning addresses the population already in the system. As community infrastructure strengthens, the volume of people entering the criminal justice system through mental health crises declines, reducing costs and freeing resources for further investment in treatment. This virtuous cycle -- community investment reduces criminalization, which reduces costs, which enables more community investment -- is the core theory of change.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: National Crisis Response Infrastructure

**Description**: Fully fund and implement a national behavioral health crisis continuum consisting of three core components: (1) regional 988 crisis call centers with capacity to dispatch mobile teams, (2) mobile crisis teams in every community with a population over 50,000, and (3) crisis stabilization centers providing short-term (up to 23-hour and 72-hour) observation and treatment as alternatives to emergency departments and jails. This continuum ensures that every person in a behavioral health crisis has access to a clinical response, not just a law enforcement response.

**Evidence Base**: The CAHOOTS program in Eugene, Oregon, has operated since 1989, responding to approximately 24,000 calls annually with fewer than 1% requiring police backup (White Bird Clinic, 2023). A 2022 study by Compton et al. found that co-responder programs reduce injuries to officers and civilians by 28-36%. SAMHSA reports that mobile crisis teams reduce emergency room visits by 23% and arrests by 60% (SAMHSA, 2023). Crisis stabilization centers divert 70% of people from emergency departments and jails (NASMHPD, 2023). Internationally, crisis response systems in the United Kingdom and Australia demonstrate that civilian-led models can operate safely at scale.

**Implementation**: Federal grants through SAMHSA to fund crisis infrastructure in every state, with requirements that states develop crisis continuum plans. Mandate 988 call centers to develop dispatch capacity for mobile crisis teams within 36 months. Provide startup funding for crisis stabilization centers through the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant.

**Cost/Resources**: Full national implementation estimated at $6 billion annually (SAMHSA, 2023), including $2 billion for 988 operations, $2.5 billion for mobile crisis teams, and $1.5 billion for crisis stabilization centers. Federal share approximately $4 billion; state/local share approximately $2 billion.

**Timeline**: 988 dispatch capacity in all states within 3 years; mobile crisis teams in all communities over 50,000 population within 5 years; crisis stabilization centers in every metropolitan area within 7 years.

**Challenges**: Behavioral health workforce shortage limits immediate scaling capacity (25-30% vacancy rates in community mental health, per National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023). Rural areas face the steepest implementation barriers due to distance and provider scarcity.

**Impact Metrics**: Reduction in mental health-related 911 calls routed to police; reduction in arrests of people in mental health crisis; reduction in psychiatric emergency department boarding hours; 988 answer rate exceeding 95%.

### Solution 2: Universal Pretrial Mental Health Screening and Diversion

**Description**: Require all jails receiving federal funding to conduct validated mental health screenings within 6 hours of booking and to establish formal diversion pathways for people with serious mental illness charged with nonviolent offenses. Screening must use evidence-based instruments (e.g., Brief Jail Mental Health Screen, BJMHS) administered by trained staff. People identified with SMI and charged with misdemeanors or low-level felonies must be referred to a diversion coordinator who assesses eligibility for community-based alternatives.

**Evidence Base**: The Stepping Up Initiative's "Innovator" counties have demonstrated that systematic screening and diversion protocols reduce bookings of people with SMI by 20-40% (CSG Justice Center, 2023). Currently, only 62% of jail inmates in Stepping Up counties are screened for mental illness, and most jails outside the initiative have no systematic screening (Stepping Up Initiative, 2024). A 2022 RAND Corporation meta-analysis found that pretrial diversion reduces recidivism by 15-25% compared to standard prosecution.

**Implementation**: Amend the Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program to require mental health screening as a condition of federal funding. Provide technical assistance through the Bureau of Justice Assistance for screening implementation. Establish minimum standards for screening instruments, timeframes, and referral protocols.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $500 million annually in federal grants for screening infrastructure and diversion coordinator positions. Per-jail implementation costs average $200,000-$400,000 annually for screening staff and data systems.

**Timeline**: Screening requirement effective within 24 months of enactment; full diversion pathway implementation within 48 months.

**Challenges**: Prosecutorial resistance to mandatory diversion referrals; community treatment capacity insufficient in many jurisdictions to absorb diverted individuals; rural jails with minimal staff may struggle to implement screening within 6 hours.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of jail bookings screened within 6 hours (target: 95%); percentage of eligible individuals referred to diversion (target: 80%); recidivism rate for diverted individuals compared to traditionally prosecuted controls.

### Solution 3: Mental Health Court Expansion and Standardization

**Description**: Expand mental health courts from approximately 450 to 1,500 nationwide, covering at least 30% of U.S. counties. Establish national standards for mental health court operations, including required availability of medication-assisted treatment, trauma-informed programming, peer support, and housing assistance. Limit supervision duration to 18 months for misdemeanors and 36 months for felonies. Mandate data collection on outcomes disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and offense type.

**Evidence Base**: Mental health courts reduce recidivism by an average of 20% compared to traditional adjudication (McNiel & Binder meta-analysis, 2022) and cost $8,000-$15,000 per participant annually versus $40,000-$60,000 for jail (SAMHSA, 2023). The RAND Corporation estimated that every $1 invested in mental health courts returns $2.21 in avoided criminal justice costs (RAND, 2022). Currently, mental health courts exist in only approximately 7% of U.S. counties (CSG Justice Center, 2023).

**Implementation**: Reauthorize and expand funding under the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act. Create a National Mental Health Court Center to develop standards, provide training, and conduct quality assurance. Incentivize states to establish mental health courts through federal matching grants.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $1.2 billion annually for full expansion (average $800,000 per court for operations, treatment, and supervision). Net savings estimated at $2-3 billion annually through reduced incarceration.

**Timeline**: 500 new courts within 3 years; 1,500 total courts within 7 years.

**Challenges**: Workforce shortage for mental health court teams (judges, coordinators, treatment providers); racial disparities in referral patterns require active monitoring; community treatment capacity must expand simultaneously.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of operating mental health courts; annual participants served; graduation rates; recidivism rates disaggregated by race and offense type; average cost per participant versus comparable jail costs.

### Solution 4: Competency Restoration Reform

**Description**: Reform the competency to stand trial system through three mechanisms: (1) establish a 21-day maximum wait time for competency evaluations, (2) authorize and fund community-based outpatient competency restoration as the default for nonviolent offenses, and (3) require dismissal of charges when restoration is not achieved within a period equal to the lesser of 18 months or the maximum sentence for the charged offense. Expand forensic psychiatric bed capacity by 5,000 beds nationally for defendants who genuinely require inpatient restoration.

**Evidence Base**: Community-based competency restoration programs in Texas, Virginia, and Oregon achieve restoration rates of 65-75%, comparable to inpatient programs at approximately one-third the cost ($40,000-$60,000 vs. $130,000-$250,000 per defendant, per NASMHPD, 2023). Currently, 23 states face litigation over competency restoration delays (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2024), and average wait times for state hospital beds range from 6 to 12 months (Stepping Up Initiative, 2023). The *Trueblood v. DSHS* litigation in Washington State demonstrated that court orders alone cannot solve the problem without investment in alternatives.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation establishing maximum timelines for competency evaluation and restoration. SAMHSA grants for community-based restoration program development. CMS waivers allowing Medicaid reimbursement for outpatient competency restoration services.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $1.5 billion annually for expanded community restoration programs and new forensic beds. Net savings estimated at $2-4 billion annually by reducing extended jail stays and inpatient restoration costs.

**Timeline**: 21-day evaluation requirement within 18 months; community restoration programs in all 50 states within 3 years; charge dismissal provisions effective within 24 months.

**Challenges**: Resistance from prosecutors and judges accustomed to inpatient restoration; constitutional questions about mandatory charge dismissal timelines; state hospital unions may oppose shift to community settings.

**Impact Metrics**: Average wait time for competency evaluation; percentage of defendants receiving community-based restoration; restoration success rates by setting; average cost per defendant.

### Solution 5: Medicaid Continuity and Reentry Coverage

**Description**: Require all states to suspend (rather than terminate) Medicaid during incarceration and to reactivate coverage no later than 30 days before release. Build on the 2023 CMS Medicaid Reentry waiver by making pre-release coverage a permanent Medicaid requirement rather than a waiver option. Require jails and prisons to initiate Medicaid enrollment or reactivation, prescribe a 30-day supply of medication at release, and schedule a community mental health appointment within 7 days of release.

**Evidence Base**: An estimated 70% of Medicaid-eligible people leaving jails are not enrolled on the day of release (Bazelon Center, 2023). The average time to a first mental health appointment post-release is 45 days (Vera Institute, 2023). Formerly incarcerated people have a 12.7 times higher risk of death in the first two weeks after release (Binswanger et al., NEJM, 2007). The CMS Medicaid Reentry waiver, with 20 states applying or approved as of Q1 2025, demonstrates growing support for this approach (CMS, 2025). Studies show that Medicaid enrollment at release reduces rearrest by 16% within one year (RAND Corporation, 2021).

**Implementation**: Federal legislation amending the Social Security Act to mandate Medicaid suspension (not termination) during incarceration. Regulatory guidance from CMS requiring pre-release enrollment. Federal matching funds for correctional facility enrollment assistance.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated additional federal Medicaid cost of $3-5 billion over 10 years. Offset by reduced emergency department utilization, reduced recidivism, and improved health outcomes.

**Timeline**: Medicaid suspension mandate effective within 12 months; pre-release enrollment requirement effective within 24 months; 7-day post-release appointment standard within 36 months.

**Challenges**: States that have not expanded Medicaid have limited coverage for single adults; correctional facilities require new administrative infrastructure for enrollment; community providers must expand capacity to accommodate rapid post-release appointments.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of people with active Medicaid on day of release (target: 90%); average time to first post-release mental health appointment; rearrest rates at 6 months and 12 months post-release.

### Solution 6: End Solitary Confinement for People with Serious Mental Illness

**Description**: Enact federal legislation prohibiting the placement of people with diagnosed serious mental illness in solitary confinement (defined as isolation for 22 or more hours per day) in all federal prisons, and condition federal correctional funding on state adoption of equivalent restrictions. Require jails and prisons to provide alternative housing units for people with SMI who require separation from the general population, with a minimum of 20 hours per week of structured therapeutic programming.

**Evidence Base**: Solitary confinement causes and exacerbates psychiatric illness. People with SMI in solitary have a 6.9 times higher rate of self-harm (JAMA Psychiatry, 2022) and a 6-12 times higher suicide rate (WHO/UNODC, 2022) compared to the general prison population. Approximately 29% of people in restrictive housing have SMI (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2021). Eighteen states and D.C. have already enacted laws or policies restricting solitary for people with SMI (Vera Institute, 2024). The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture classified prolonged solitary (more than 15 consecutive days) as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment in 2011.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation amending the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) framework to include solitary confinement restrictions. Bureau of Prisons implementation within 12 months. State compliance required within 36 months for continued eligibility for Justice Assistance Grant funding.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $500 million annually for alternative housing units and therapeutic programming. Partially offset by reduced self-harm-related medical costs and litigation.

**Timeline**: Federal prison implementation within 12 months; state compliance within 36 months.

**Challenges**: Correctional officer unions argue solitary is necessary for facility safety; alternative housing units require staffing that facilities already struggle to fill; some states will resist federal conditions on state prison operations.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of people with SMI in solitary confinement nationally; self-harm rates; suicide rates; litigation costs.

### Solution 7: Behavioral Health Workforce Pipeline

**Description**: Address the behavioral health workforce shortage through a comprehensive pipeline strategy: (1) a federal loan repayment program for mental health professionals who work in correctional or criminal justice diversion settings for at least 3 years, (2) expansion of the National Health Service Corps to include forensic mental health as a designated shortage area, (3) funding for graduate training programs in forensic psychology and forensic social work, and (4) a certified peer specialist training program focused on justice-involved populations.

**Evidence Base**: Community mental health centers report 25-30% vacancy rates for clinical positions (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023). HRSA estimates a shortfall of 14,280 psychiatrists (HRSA, 2023). Correctional mental health positions have 30-40% vacancy rates nationally (NCCHC, 2023). States that have implemented loan repayment programs for mental health professionals in underserved areas have seen 20-30% increases in retention (HRSA, 2022). Peer specialists have been shown to reduce recidivism by 22% and crisis service utilization by 18% in justice-involved populations (SAMHSA, 2022).

**Implementation**: Legislation expanding the National Health Service Corps and creating a dedicated Forensic Mental Health Workforce Program within HRSA. Grants to universities to establish or expand forensic training programs. SAMHSA funding for certified peer specialist training programs in 50 states.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $800 million annually for loan repayment, training expansion, and peer specialist programs.

**Timeline**: Loan repayment program launch within 12 months; training program expansion within 24 months; 10,000 additional forensic mental health professionals and 5,000 certified peer specialists trained within 5 years.

**Challenges**: Pipeline programs take 3-7 years to produce fully trained professionals; rural areas remain difficult to staff even with incentives; competitive salary differentials between correctional settings and private practice persist.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of forensic mental health professionals in practice; vacancy rates in correctional and community mental health settings; retention rates for loan repayment participants.

## International Models

### United Kingdom: Liaison and Diversion Services

**Description**: NHS England operates Liaison and Diversion services in every police custody suite and criminal court in England, providing mental health assessments and referrals to treatment at the point of first contact with the criminal justice system. Trained clinicians screen every person who enters police custody, with vulnerable individuals referred to appropriate health and social care services.

**Results**: Coverage reached 100% of police custody suites and courts in England by 2020. Evaluations show 25% reduction in reoffending for diverted individuals, 30% reduction in custodial sentences, and estimated savings of 2 pounds for every 1 pound invested (NHS England, 2022).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The model demonstrates that universal screening at the point of arrest is feasible and cost-effective. Adaptation to the U.S. would require addressing the decentralized nature of American policing (18,000+ agencies) and the absence of a universal health system for referral. The Stepping Up Initiative's screening protocols provide a foundation for replication.

### Australia: Police, Ambulance and Clinical Early Response (PACER)

**Description**: The PACER model, operating in Victoria, Australia, pairs a police officer with a mental health clinician for joint response to mental health crisis calls. The clinician conducts on-scene assessments, provides immediate intervention, and facilitates transport to appropriate services rather than police custody.

**Results**: PACER teams have reduced psychiatric emergency department presentations by 25% and police time on mental health calls by 33%. The model achieves a 92% diversion rate from custody for mental health-related encounters (Victoria Police, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The co-responder model has already been adopted by approximately 350 programs in the U.S. (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023). Scaling requires dedicated funding for clinician positions and protocols for integration with police dispatch systems.

### Canada: Mental Health Commission Diversion Framework

**Description**: Canada's Mental Health Commission developed a national framework for diverting people with mental illness from the criminal justice system, including standardized assessment tools, training curricula for police and courts, and outcome benchmarks. The framework operates across provinces with federal funding and coordination.

**Results**: Provinces implementing the framework report 15-20% reductions in arrests of people with mental illness and 30% reductions in time spent in pretrial detention for diverted individuals (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2022).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The federal coordination model is instructive, demonstrating that standardized national frameworks can operate across jurisdictions with different criminal justice structures. The U.S. Sequential Intercept Model provides a similar conceptual framework but lacks the dedicated federal funding and implementation infrastructure that Canada's approach includes.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Miami-Dade County Criminal Mental Health Project**: Judge Steve Leifman's comprehensive diversion program reduced Miami-Dade's jail population by 4,000, closed an entire jail facility, and saved the county an estimated $12 million annually. The program combines CIT training, pre-arrest diversion, a mental health court, and a crisis stabilization unit (Miami-Dade County, 2023).

- **Los Angeles County Office of Diversion and Reentry (ODR)**: Launched in 2015, ODR provides intensive case management, interim and permanent supportive housing, and clinical treatment to people with serious mental illness diverted from jail. An independent evaluation found 86% housing retention, 74% reduction in jail days, and estimated savings of $7.20 for every $1 invested (RAND Corporation, 2021).

- **Johnson County, Kansas Stepping Up Innovator**: Johnson County implemented universal jail screening, a mental health co-responder program, and a reentry coordination model. Bookings of people with SMI declined by 34% between 2017 and 2023 (Stepping Up Initiative, 2024).

- **Bexar County, Texas Jail Diversion Program**: Bexar County's program, led by former Sheriff Susan Pamerleau, includes a 48-bed crisis center (the Restoration Center) that diverts people from jail and emergency departments. The center handles over 27,000 contacts annually and has reduced jail bookings of people with mental illness by 50% (Bexar County, 2023).

## Sequencing and Prioritization

### Quick Wins (0-2 years)

- Require all jails to screen for mental illness within 6 hours of booking as a condition of federal funding
- Mandate Medicaid suspension (not termination) during incarceration in all states
- Establish 21-day maximum for competency evaluations
- Fund 100 new mobile crisis teams through SAMHSA grants
- Launch forensic mental health loan repayment program

### Medium-term Reforms (2-5 years)

- Expand mental health courts to 1,000 (from ~450)
- Achieve 988 dispatch capability in all states
- Implement community-based competency restoration in all 50 states
- Build 200 new crisis stabilization centers
- Train 5,000 certified peer specialists for justice-involved populations

### Long-term Transformation (5-10 years)

- Achieve 1,500 mental health courts nationwide
- Eliminate solitary confinement for people with SMI in all state and federal facilities
- Establish mobile crisis teams in every community over 50,000 population
- Reduce annual jail bookings of people with SMI from 2 million to below 500,000
- Close the forensic mental health workforce gap by 75%

## Complementary Policies

Effective criminal justice-mental health reform depends on parallel reforms in related policy areas:

- **Affordable housing**: People with SMI released from jail face average 6-month waitlists for supportive housing (HUD, 2023). Expanding permanent supportive housing through HUD programs is essential to preventing re-incarceration.
- **Substance use treatment**: 72% of incarcerated people with mental health conditions have co-occurring substance use disorders (BJS, 2023). Integrated treatment addressing both conditions simultaneously is critical.
- **Medicaid expansion**: 12 states have not expanded Medicaid. Expansion would extend coverage to hundreds of thousands of low-income adults with mental illness who currently have no insurance.
- **Decriminalization of homelessness**: Repealing laws that criminalize sleeping in public, camping, and panhandling would remove a primary pathway from mental illness to criminal justice involvement.
- **Police reform**: Broader reforms to use-of-force policies, training requirements, and accountability mechanisms complement mental health-specific crisis response programs.
