# Criminal Justice and Mental Health: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Reform of the criminal justice system's treatment of people with mental illness requires a phased strategy that builds infrastructure before mandating systemic change. The approach follows three principles: (1) establish crisis alternatives so that diversion from arrest is practically possible, (2) reform the criminal justice system's internal processes -- screening, courts, competency, solitary -- to improve outcomes for those who do enter the system, and (3) build seamless transitions so that people move from the justice system back into treatment without gaps in care. Each phase creates the conditions for the next. Crisis infrastructure (Phase 1) makes pretrial diversion feasible. Diversion programs and court reforms (Phase 2) reduce the population requiring correctional mental health care. Sustained community treatment and workforce development (Phase 3) reduce recidivism and prevent future criminalization.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Establish national crisis response infrastructure capable of providing clinical alternatives to law enforcement for behavioral health emergencies
- Implement universal jail mental health screening and create formal diversion pathways
- Eliminate Medicaid termination during incarceration and begin pre-release enrollment
- Establish maximum timelines for competency evaluations

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Pass the Mental Health Crisis Response Act funding 988 dispatch and mobile crisis teams | Congress | Months 1-12 | $4 billion annual authorization | Bill enacted |
| Issue CMS guidance mandating Medicaid suspension during incarceration | CMS | Months 6-12 | Administrative action; no new appropriation | All states implement suspension policy |
| Amend JAG program to require jail mental health screening within 6 hours of booking | Congress/BJA | Months 1-12 | $500 million annual appropriation for screening infrastructure | Screening requirement in effect |
| Establish 21-day maximum for competency evaluations via federal legislation | Congress | Months 1-12 | $200 million for evaluation infrastructure | Legislation enacted |
| Launch forensic mental health loan repayment program through HRSA | HRSA | Months 6-18 | $150 million year-one allocation | Program accepting applications |
| Fund 100 new mobile crisis teams through SAMHSA emergency grants | SAMHSA | Months 3-18 | $250 million | 100 teams operational |
| Begin 988 dispatch capability development in all 50 states | SAMHSA/States | Months 1-24 | $500 million in planning and technology grants | All states have dispatch development plans |

### Legislative Requirements

- Mental Health Crisis Response Act: Authorizes $6 billion annually for crisis continuum infrastructure (988, mobile crisis, crisis stabilization)
- Medicaid Continuity of Care Act: Mandates Medicaid suspension (not termination) during incarceration and pre-release enrollment
- Competency Evaluation Timeliness Act: Establishes 21-day federal standard for competency evaluations
- Amendment to JAG program requiring mental health screening as funding condition

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, the federal framework for reform will be in place: crisis infrastructure funding authorized, Medicaid continuity mandated, jail screening required, and competency evaluation timelines established. Approximately 100 new mobile crisis teams will be operational, 988 dispatch planning will be underway in all states, and the forensic workforce pipeline will have launched. These actions create the conditions for the systemic reforms of Phase 2.

## Phase 2: Systemic Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Expand mental health courts to cover at least 20% of U.S. counties
- Implement community-based competency restoration in all 50 states
- Achieve 988 dispatch capability in all states and mobile crisis coverage in all communities over 100,000 population
- Eliminate solitary confinement for people with serious mental illness in federal prisons
- Build 200 crisis stabilization centers nationally

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Reauthorize and expand Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act | Congress | Year 3 | $1.2 billion annual authorization | 1,000 mental health courts operational by year 5 |
| Establish National Mental Health Court Center for standards and training | DOJ/SAMHSA | Year 3-4 | $50 million annual operations | Center operational; national standards published |

| Enact federal solitary confinement restriction for people with SMI | Congress | Year 3 | $500 million for alternative housing units | Federal prisons compliant; state compliance timeline set |
| Expand Medicaid Reentry waiver to all 50 states | CMS | Years 3-5 | Administrative action; est. $3.5 billion over 10 years (CBO) | All states participating |
| Build 200 crisis stabilization centers through SAMHSA capital grants | SAMHSA/States | Years 3-5 | $1.5 billion in capital funding | 200 centers operational |
| Achieve 988 dispatch to mobile crisis teams in all states | SAMHSA/States | Year 4-5 | $2 billion annually for sustained 988 operations | All states dispatching mobile teams via 988 |
| Train 5,000 certified peer specialists for justice-involved populations | SAMHSA | Years 3-5 | $100 million | 5,000 peer specialists certified and deployed |

### Legislative Requirements

- Expanded Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization Act
- Solitary Confinement Reform Act: Prohibits solitary for people with SMI in federal facilities; conditions state funding on compliance
- Mental Health Court Improvement Act: Establishes national standards and funding for court expansion
- Workforce Development Authorization: Expands NHSC forensic mental health designation

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, the system will have been substantially reformed. Mental health courts will operate in 20% of U.S. counties. Community-based competency restoration will be the default for nonviolent offenses in all states. 988 will dispatch mobile crisis teams nationwide. Solitary confinement of people with SMI will be prohibited in federal prisons and restricted in states receiving federal funding. The Medicaid reentry gap will be closed in all participating states.

---

## Phase 3: System Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Achieve 1,500 mental health courts nationwide (30% of counties)
- Reduce annual jail bookings of people with SMI from 2 million to below 500,000
- Achieve mobile crisis team coverage in all communities over 50,000 population
- Close the forensic mental health workforce gap by 75%
- Eliminate solitary confinement for people with SMI in all state facilities

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Expand mental health courts to 1,500 | DOJ/States | Years 6-10 | $1.2 billion annually sustained | 1,500 courts operational |
| Achieve mobile crisis coverage for all communities over 50,000 | SAMHSA/States | Years 6-8 | $2.5 billion annually sustained | Coverage verified in all target communities |
| Complete state compliance with solitary confinement restrictions | DOJ/States | Years 6-8 | $500 million annually for alternative programming | All states compliant |

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 3, the United States will have a fundamentally different system for responding to mental illness at the intersection of criminal justice. Crisis alternatives to arrest will be available in most communities. People with SMI who enter the justice system will encounter screening, diversion, specialized courts, and reentry support. Solitary confinement for people with SMI will be eliminated nationally. Annual jail bookings of people with SMI will have declined by at least 75% from the 2 million baseline.

## Governance and Oversight

**Interagency Coordination**: Establish a Federal Interagency Council on Mental Health and Criminal Justice, co-chaired by the SAMHSA Administrator and the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs. The Council will coordinate federal policy, align funding streams, and publish biennial progress reports to Congress.

**State Implementation**: Each state will be required to submit a Criminal Justice Mental Health Plan as a condition of receiving SAMHSA and BJA mental health-related grants. Plans must include screening protocols, diversion pathways, crisis response capacity, reentry procedures, and outcome benchmarks.

**Independent Evaluation**: The Government Accountability Office (GAO) will be directed to conduct independent evaluations of the crisis response infrastructure, mental health court expansion, and competency restoration reform at 3-year intervals. RAND Corporation or equivalent research organizations will be contracted for rigorous outcome studies.

**Transparency**: All federal grantees will report outcome data to a publicly accessible dashboard maintained by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, including screening rates, diversion rates, recidivism, and outcomes disaggregated by race, ethnicity, and gender.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Behavioral Health Workforce Shortage Limits Implementation

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Front-load workforce pipeline investments in Phase 1. Launch loan repayment and training programs before crisis infrastructure and court expansion create demand. Use certified peer specialists and telehealth to bridge gaps while the professional pipeline develops.

**Contingency Plan**: If workforce gaps persist beyond Year 3, implement telehealth-based crisis response and competency evaluation as interim measures. Authorize interstate telehealth compacts for forensic mental health services.

### Risk 2: Political Backlash from High-Profile Incident

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build bipartisan coalition including law enforcement champions (sheriffs, chiefs) and fiscal conservatives. Publish quarterly safety data from crisis response and diversion programs. Pre-position rapid response communications emphasizing that treatment reduces risk.

**Contingency Plan**: If backlash threatens funding, redirect focus to programs with strongest safety records (CIT, crisis stabilization) and defer expansion of programs perceived as higher risk. Engage law enforcement leaders as public advocates for reform.

### Risk 3: State Resistance to Federal Mandates

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Structure most reforms as funding conditions rather than direct mandates. Provide generous federal matching rates (75% federal, 25% state) for new programs. Offer technical assistance and peer learning through the CSG Justice Center and NACo.

**Contingency Plan**: For states that refuse participation, direct federal resources to county-level programs within those states. Use litigation (e.g., competency restoration, solitary confinement) as a parallel reform mechanism.

### Risk 4: Community Treatment Capacity Insufficient for Diverted Population

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Sequence reforms so that community capacity building precedes diversion mandates. Phase 1 invests in crisis infrastructure and workforce before Phase 2 expands diversion. Require state plans to demonstrate treatment capacity before implementing screening and diversion mandates.

**Contingency Plan**: If capacity shortfalls emerge, pause expansion of diversion eligibility in affected jurisdictions until capacity catches up. Prioritize SMI populations for limited capacity.

### Risk 5: Medicaid Cost Overruns

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Phase in Medicaid reentry coverage gradually; begin with pre-release services (90 days) and expand as cost data becomes available. CBO scoring of the 2023 Medicaid Reentry waiver projects $3.5 billion over 10 years, which is modest relative to total Medicaid spending.

**Contingency Plan**: If costs exceed projections, adjust the pre-release coverage window or implement per-capita caps. Offset increased Medicaid spending with documented reductions in emergency department utilization and criminal justice costs.
