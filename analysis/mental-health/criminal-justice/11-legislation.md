# Criminal Justice and Mental Health: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to reforming the intersection of mental illness and criminal justice requires action at both the federal and state levels. Federal legislation is needed to establish national crisis infrastructure, reform Medicaid policy, set minimum standards for competency proceedings and correctional mental health care, and fund diversion programs. State legislation is needed to implement crisis response systems, authorize mental health courts and community-based competency restoration, and restrict solitary confinement for people with serious mental illness. The approach is comprehensive rather than incremental, because the root causes -- documented in [Root Causes](04-root-causes.md) -- are systemic and interlocking. Addressing one intercept point without building capacity at others simply shifts the problem.

No constitutional amendments are required for these reforms. The federal legislative authority derives from the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8), the Commerce Clause, and the enforcement powers of the Fourteenth Amendment. State authority derives from the police power and the state's responsibility for health, safety, and welfare.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish a comprehensive framework for reducing the criminalization
of mental illness, expanding behavioral health crisis response
infrastructure, reforming competency proceedings, and improving mental
health outcomes in the criminal justice system.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Mental Health and Criminal Justice
Reform Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (2023),
approximately 44% of people in local jails and 37% of people in
state prisons have been told by a mental health professional that
they have a mental health disorder.

(2) The Treatment Advocacy Center (2023) estimates that 2 million
people with serious mental illness are booked into American jails
each year.

(3) State psychiatric hospital bed capacity has declined 93% since
1955, from 559,000 beds to approximately 37,000 beds in 2022, with
only 11.7 beds per 100,000 population (Treatment Advocacy Center,
2022).

(4) People with untreated serious mental illness are 16 times more
likely to be killed during a police encounter than other civilians
(Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022).

(5) The RAND Corporation (2022) found that mental health courts
reduce criminal recidivism by an average of 20% and return $2.21 in
avoided criminal justice costs for every $1 invested.

(6) Approximately 70% of Medicaid-eligible people leaving jails are
not enrolled in Medicaid on the day of release, creating dangerous
gaps in treatment (Bazelon Center, 2023).

(7) Formerly incarcerated people have a 12.7 times higher risk of
death in the first two weeks after release (Binswanger et al., New
England Journal of Medicine, 2007).

(8) The United States spends approximately $15 billion annually on
correctional mental health care that is widely acknowledged as
inadequate (Vera Institute of Justice, 2023).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.--The term "serious mental illness" means
a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that results
in serious functional impairment which substantially interferes with
or limits one or more major life activities, as defined by SAMHSA.

(2) CRISIS STABILIZATION CENTER.--The term "crisis stabilization
center" means a facility offering short-term (up to 72 hours)
observation and crisis intervention services as an alternative to
emergency departments, jails, or state psychiatric hospitals.

(3) MOBILE CRISIS TEAM.--The term "mobile crisis team" means a team
of behavioral health professionals, which may include peer
specialists, dispatched to the location of a behavioral health
crisis to provide assessment, de-escalation, and referral services.

(4) COMPETENCY EVALUATION.--The term "competency evaluation" means
a court-ordered assessment of a defendant's ability to understand
the proceedings against them and to assist in their own defense, as
required under Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402 (1960).

(5) COMPETENCY RESTORATION.--The term "competency restoration" means
clinical services provided to a defendant found incompetent to stand
trial for the purpose of restoring the defendant's competency.

(6) RESTRICTIVE HOUSING.--The term "restrictive housing" means any
confinement in which an incarcerated person is isolated from the
general population and confined to a cell for 22 or more hours per
day.

SEC. 4. NATIONAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS CONTINUUM.

    based competency restoration programs; and
    (3) publish standards for community restoration programs within
    18 months of enactment.

(c) CHARGE DISMISSAL.--In any case involving federal charges, if a
defendant has not been restored to competency within a period equal
to the lesser of 18 months or the maximum sentence for the charged
offense, the court shall dismiss the charges without prejudice unless
the government demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that
continued restoration is likely to succeed within 90 days.

SEC. 7. MENTAL HEALTH COURT EXPANSION.

(a) REAUTHORIZATION.--The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime
Reduction Act of 2004 (Pub. L. 108-414) is reauthorized and amended

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Crisis Continuum)**: Establishes the infrastructure that makes diversion possible. Without crisis alternatives, law enforcement has no option but arrest. The 988 dispatch requirement and mobile crisis team funding ensure that clinical responses are available in every community.
- **Section 5 (Medicaid Continuity)**: Addresses the coverage gap that causes treatment disruption at arrest and upon release. Mandatory suspension (not termination) eliminates re-enrollment delays. Pre-release enrollment and the 7-day appointment requirement address the deadly first-two-weeks risk period documented by Binswanger et al. (2007).
- **Section 6 (Competency Reform)**: The 21-day evaluation timeline responds to the unconstitutional delays documented in *Trueblood v. DSHS* and similar litigation in 23 states. Community-based restoration reduces costs from $130,000-$250,000 (inpatient) to $40,000-$60,000 (outpatient) per defendant. The charge dismissal provision prevents indefinite detention of people who cannot be restored.
- **Section 7 (Mental Health Courts)**: Quadruples authorized funding from the current $30 million to $400 million to support expansion from approximately 450 to 1,500 courts. National standards address the quality and equity gaps identified in current court operations.
- **Section 8 (Restrictive Housing)**: Addresses the well-documented psychiatric harm of solitary confinement for people with SMI (6.9x self-harm rate, 6-12x suicide rate). The alternative housing requirement ensures facility safety without solitary.
- **Section 12 (Appropriations)**: The 5-year authorization totaling $33 billion reflects the scale of investment needed. Offset analysis projects $80-120 billion in savings over 10 years from reduced incarceration, emergency department utilization, and recidivism.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| SAMHSA publishes crisis continuum grant guidance | 180 days after enactment | SAMHSA |
| CMS issues Medicaid suspension guidance | 12 months after enactment | CMS |
| States submit crisis continuum plans | 18 months after enactment | State governors |
| Competency evaluation 21-day standard takes effect | 18 months after enactment | Federal courts |
| DOJ/SAMHSA publish mental health court national standards | 18 months after enactment | DOJ/SAMHSA |
| Federal restrictive housing prohibition takes effect | 12 months after enactment | Bureau of Prisons |
| Loan repayment program begins accepting applications | 12 months after enactment | HRSA |
| First annual report to Congress | 12 months after enactment | SAMHSA/DOJ |

**Regulatory Authority**: SAMHSA administers crisis continuum grants and workforce programs. DOJ/BJA administers mental health court grants and jail screening requirements. CMS administers Medicaid provisions. Bureau of Prisons implements federal restrictive housing restrictions.

**Challenges**:

- **Fiscal**: $33 billion authorization over 5 years is substantial; appropriations may lag authorizations
- **Federalism**: Medicaid suspension mandate and jail screening requirements may face state resistance
- **Workforce**: Programs cannot be staffed without parallel workforce pipeline development

**Refinements**:

- **Phase appropriations**: Authorize smaller amounts in early years, ramping up as infrastructure develops
- **State flexibility**: Allow states to submit alternative plans demonstrating equivalent outcomes
- **Telehealth bridge**: Authorize telehealth-based crisis response and competency evaluation to bridge workforce gaps

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Behavioral Health Crisis Response Act

**Purpose**: Establish a statewide behavioral health crisis response system as an alternative to law enforcement-led response for mental health emergencies.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize based on population density (rural states may rely more heavily on telehealth and regional mobile teams), existing crisis infrastructure (states with 988 implementation may need less foundational work), and Medicaid status (expansion states have broader coverage for crisis services).

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Behavioral
Health Crisis Response Act of 2025".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature of [State] finds the following:

(1) Law enforcement officers in [State] spend an estimated 21% of
their duty hours responding to mental health-related calls.

(2) Approximately [State-specific percentage] of people in [State]
jails have a diagnosed mental health condition.

(3) Community-based crisis response models reduce arrests for
mental health calls by 50-60% and injuries by 28-36%.

(4) The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline requires state-funded
dispatch capability and mobile crisis infrastructure to function
as intended.

SECTION 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM.

(a) The [State Department of Health/Behavioral Health Authority]
shall establish and maintain a statewide behavioral health crisis
response system consisting of:
    (1) a state-coordinated 988 crisis call center or centers with
    dispatch capability;
    (2) mobile crisis teams available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
    week, in every county or regional service area; and
    (3) crisis stabilization centers providing up to 72 hours of
    observation and stabilization.

(b) TIERED DISPATCH.--The [State 911/Dispatch Authority] shall
develop and implement tiered dispatch protocols that:
    (1) route behavioral health crisis calls to 988 or mobile
    crisis teams when no immediate safety threat exists;
    (2) dispatch co-responder teams (clinician and officer) when
    moderate safety concerns are present; and
    (3) dispatch law enforcement when weapons, active violence, or
    imminent threats are reported.

SECTION 4. FUNDING.

(a) There is established in the state treasury the Behavioral
Health Crisis Response Fund, consisting of:
    (1) appropriations by the Legislature;
    (2) federal grants received for crisis response purposes;
    (3) a surcharge on telecommunications services of $[0.50-1.00]
    per line per month, modeled on existing 911 funding mechanisms.

SECTION 5. REPORTING.

The [Department] shall submit an annual report to the Legislature
including call volume, dispatch type, outcomes, arrest rates, and
demographic data for crisis response contacts.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], with full implementation
required within 36 months.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: SAMHSA (crisis infrastructure, workforce), DOJ/BJA (jail screening, mental health courts), CMS (Medicaid continuity), BOP (restrictive housing)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Crisis Continuum Grant Standards**: SAMHSA must publish grant criteria, state plan requirements, and performance benchmarks within 180 days of enactment
2. **Medicaid Suspension Guidance**: CMS must issue guidance to states on Medicaid suspension during incarceration and pre-release enrollment procedures within 12 months
3. **Mental Health Court National Standards**: DOJ must publish operational standards including MAT requirements, supervision limits, and data collection protocols within 18 months
4. **Restrictive Housing Implementation**: BOP must publish rules for alternative housing units, mental health screening for restrictive housing, and programming requirements within 12 months

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Grant Conditions**: SAMHSA and BJA grants conditioned on state compliance with crisis plans, screening requirements, and data reporting
- **Medicaid Sanctions**: CMS may reduce Medicaid matching rates for states that fail to implement suspension and pre-release enrollment requirements
- **JAG Funding Conditions**: Jail screening requirements enforced through Justice Assistance Grant eligibility
- **Private Right of Action**: Individuals subjected to restrictive housing in violation of Section 8 may bring suit under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: The federal government may condition grant funding on state compliance with crisis plan, screening, and data reporting requirements under *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987). Conditions must be related to the federal interest and not coercive. The Medicaid suspension requirement is more aggressive but falls within the scope of the existing Medicaid program, distinguishable from the coercive Medicaid expansion struck down in *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), because it modifies an existing enrollment rule rather than imposing a new coverage requirement.

**Eighth Amendment**: The restrictive housing prohibition is grounded in extensive case law establishing that deliberate indifference to the serious mental health needs of incarcerated people violates the Eighth Amendment (*Estelle v. Gamble*, 429 U.S. 97 (1976); *Brown v. Plata*, 563 U.S. 493 (2011)). The provision codifies existing constitutional standards rather than creating new ones.

**Due Process**: The competency evaluation and charge dismissal provisions implicate due process rights of defendants. The 21-day evaluation standard and charge dismissal for non-restorable defendants are consistent with the due process requirement that defendants not be detained indefinitely without trial, as established in *Jackson v. Indiana*, 406 U.S. 715 (1972).

### Preemption

Federal Medicaid provisions preempt contrary state laws under the Supremacy Clause. Federal restrictive housing restrictions apply only to federal facilities; state incentives operate through conditional spending rather than direct preemption. Mental health court standards are voluntary for state courts, enforced through grant conditions.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through grant conditions (SAMHSA, BJA), Medicaid matching rates (CMS), and litigation (private right of action for restrictive housing violations). GAO audits provide additional oversight. Annual reporting requirements create transparency and public accountability.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| "Serious mental illness" definition excludes personality disorders, TBI | People with borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, or traumatic brain injury -- who are overrepresented in jails -- may not qualify for diversion or restrictive housing protections | High | Amend definition to include "serious behavioral health condition" encompassing personality disorders and TBI that result in functional impairment |
| Community restoration "preferred" but not mandatory for nonviolent offenses | Prosecutors may argue that inpatient restoration is necessary, circumventing community-based default | Medium | Require courts to make written findings of dangerousness before ordering inpatient restoration for nonviolent offenses |
| 6-hour screening window may be circumvented by delayed booking | Facilities may hold individuals in police vehicles or booking areas without formally booking them, delaying the screening clock | Medium | Amend to require screening within 6 hours of arrival at the facility, not 6 hours of booking |
| State crisis plans may be pro forma without enforceable benchmarks | States may submit plans that satisfy the letter but not the spirit of the requirement, with vague timelines and no accountability | High | Require SAMHSA to publish minimum plan criteria including specific milestones, capacity targets, and consequences for failure to meet benchmarks |
| 7-day post-release appointment standard unenforceable if no providers available | Correctional facilities may schedule appointments that community providers cannot keep due to capacity constraints | Medium | Require states to demonstrate treatment capacity before imposing discharge planning mandates; fund community provider expansion in parallel |
| Restrictive housing prohibition covers only "diagnosed" SMI | Facilities may fail to diagnose mental illness to avoid the restriction, or apply narrow diagnostic criteria | High | Require independent mental health screening before any restrictive housing placement, regardless of prior diagnosis; create oversight mechanism for undiagnosed cases |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Appropriations may not match authorizations | Programs authorized but not funded cannot be implemented | Political constraints on federal spending | Build bipartisan coalition; demonstrate cost savings through pilot program data |
| Workforce shortage limits implementation speed | Crisis teams, courts, and restoration programs cannot operate without staff | Decades of underinvestment in behavioral health workforce | Front-load workforce pipeline; authorize telehealth bridge measures |
| 12 non-expansion Medicaid states have limited coverage | Medicaid suspension is less meaningful in states where many low-income adults are uninsured | State decisions not to expand Medicaid under the ACA | Provide enhanced federal matching for crisis services in non-expansion states; advocate for Medicaid expansion separately |
| Voluntary state participation in restrictive housing reform | Federal incentives may not persuade states with entrenched corrections interests | Federalism constraints; limited federal authority over state prisons | Use litigation as a parallel reform mechanism; increase JAG funding differential for compliant states |
| Mental health court standards are voluntary for state courts | Courts may operate below national standards and still receive funding | Judicial independence; federalism | Tie national standard compliance to enhanced funding rather than baseline eligibility |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Expand SMI definition**: Introduce an amendment broadening "serious mental illness" to "serious behavioral health condition" within the first reauthorization cycle (Year 5), capturing personality disorders and TBI.
2. **Strengthen community restoration default**: Add regulatory guidance requiring written judicial findings before inpatient restoration orders for nonviolent offenses.
3. **Fix screening clock**: Amend Section 9 to specify "within 6 hours of arrival at the facility" in technical corrections legislation.
4. **Enforceable crisis plans**: SAMHSA rulemaking should include minimum benchmarks, annual progress reviews, and funding consequences for plans that fail to demonstrate progress.
5. **Address restrictive housing diagnosis gap**: Require BOP and incentivize states to conduct independent mental health assessments within 24 hours of any restrictive housing placement. Create an inspector general oversight mechanism.
6. **Workforce bridge**: If workforce shortfalls persist beyond Year 3, authorize emergency telehealth compacts for forensic mental health services across state lines.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The authorization of appropriations sunsets after 5 years (FY2030), requiring reauthorization. The annual reporting requirement (Section 11) ensures that Congress has data on implementation progress, outcomes, and costs to inform reauthorization decisions. GAO is directed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation by Year 4 to inform the reauthorization process.
