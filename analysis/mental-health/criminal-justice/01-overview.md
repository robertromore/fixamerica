# Criminal Justice and Mental Health: Overview

## Overview

The United States has effectively criminalized mental illness. An estimated 2 million people with serious mental illness (SMI) are booked into American jails each year, and the three largest psychiatric facilities in the country are not hospitals but jails: Los Angeles County Jail, Cook County Jail in Chicago, and Rikers Island in New York City (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023). Approximately 44% of people in jails and 37% of people in state prisons have been told by a mental health professional that they have a mental health disorder (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023). People with untreated mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter than other civilians (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022).

This crisis did not emerge overnight. The deinstitutionalization movement that began in the 1960s closed hundreds of state psychiatric hospitals, reducing psychiatric beds from 559,000 in 1955 to approximately 37,000 in 2022 -- a decline of 93% (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). The community mental health centers that were supposed to replace institutional care were never adequately funded. The result was a massive transfer of people with mental illness from hospitals to jails, prisons, shelters, and streets. Today, there are roughly 10 times more people with serious mental illness in jails and prisons than in state psychiatric hospitals (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023).

The consequences extend beyond the individuals directly affected. Law enforcement officers spend an estimated 21% of their time responding to mental health-related calls (Police Executive Research Forum, 2020), diverting resources from crime prevention and investigation. Correctional facilities spend an estimated $15 billion annually on mental health services that are widely acknowledged as inadequate (Vera Institute of Justice, 2023). Jails and prisons are not therapeutic environments, and incarceration frequently worsens mental health conditions, creating a revolving door of arrest, brief detention, release without treatment, and re-arrest.

The intersection of mental illness and criminal justice also raises fundamental questions about justice itself. People found incompetent to stand trial may spend longer awaiting competency restoration than the maximum sentence for their charged offense. Solitary confinement -- used extensively in American prisons -- causes and exacerbates psychiatric illness, yet an estimated 29% of people in restrictive housing have serious mental illness (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2021). The system punishes illness rather than treating it, at enormous human and fiscal cost.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of the mental health and criminal justice intersection:

- **Crisis Response and Police Contact**: How law enforcement encounters with people in mental health crisis lead to arrest or escalation, and how Crisis Intervention Teams (CIT) and co-responder models can redirect outcomes
- **Jail Diversion and the Sequential Intercept Model**: Programs that divert people with mental illness away from the criminal justice system at multiple intercept points, from pre-arrest through reentry
- **Mental Health Courts**: Specialized court dockets that connect defendants with mental illness to treatment as an alternative to traditional prosecution
- **Competency to Stand Trial**: The growing crisis of competency evaluation and restoration backlogs, including the legal and ethical dimensions of forced restoration
- **Correctional Mental Health Care**: Standards of care inside jails and prisons, the impact of incarceration on mental health, solitary confinement, and psychotropic medication management
- **Reentry and Community Supervision**: The challenges of maintaining treatment continuity during transitions from incarceration to the community, including Medicaid enrollment gaps and housing barriers

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Public Safety vs. Treatment Access**: Communities want protection from disruptive or dangerous behavior, but arrest and incarceration worsen mental illness and increase future risk. Balancing immediate safety concerns with the long-term benefits of treatment requires accepting short-term uncertainty about outcomes.

- **Individual Liberty vs. Involuntary Treatment**: Diversion programs and mental health courts often require mandatory treatment participation, raising civil liberties concerns. People have a right to refuse treatment, but untreated illness can lead to criminal behavior, homelessness, and death. Finding the boundary between coercive treatment and therapeutic intervention remains contested.

- **Cost Savings vs. Upfront Investment**: Diversion and community treatment cost less than incarceration over time, but require significant upfront investment in crisis services, housing, and provider workforce. Legislators face pressure to show immediate budget savings rather than fund programs whose returns accrue over years.

- **Specialization vs. System Integration**: Mental health courts and CIT programs demonstrate success but serve a fraction of those who need help. Building parallel specialized tracks risks creating boutique programs while the larger system remains unchanged. Reformers must decide whether to scale specialized programs or transform mainstream criminal justice practice.

- **Competency Restoration vs. Due Process**: Defendants found incompetent to stand trial have a right to restoration, but restoration processes can take longer than the potential sentence. Forced medication raises ethical concerns, while indefinite detention without trial raises constitutional ones. Courts must navigate competing rights with no clean solution.

## Key Questions

1. How can the United States build a crisis response infrastructure that prevents unnecessary criminalization of people with mental illness without creating public safety gaps?
2. What funding mechanisms can sustainably support community-based mental health services at a scale sufficient to serve as genuine alternatives to incarceration?
3. How should the legal system balance the due process rights of defendants found incompetent to stand trial with the practical reality that competency restoration is slow, coercive, and often unsuccessful?
4. What evidence-based models can be scaled nationally to reduce the 2 million annual jail bookings of people with serious mental illness?

## Vision of Success

A successful policy framework for criminal justice and mental health in the 21st century would feature:

- **Robust Crisis Response**: Every community would have 24/7 mobile crisis teams, crisis stabilization centers, and co-responder programs so that behavioral health emergencies are met with clinical responses, not handcuffs. Law enforcement would be a last resort, not a first responder, for mental health crises.
- **Effective Diversion at Every Intercept**: The Sequential Intercept Model would be fully implemented nationwide, offering diversion opportunities from pre-arrest through reentry. No person with a serious mental illness would be incarcerated solely because community treatment was unavailable.
- **Constitutional Correctional Care**: Jails and prisons that continue to house people with mental illness would meet enforceable minimum standards of care, eliminate the use of solitary confinement for people with SMI, and ensure continuity of treatment upon release.
- **Competency System Reform**: Competency evaluations would occur within 21 days of court order, restoration programs would operate in community-based settings, and charges would be dismissed when restoration is unlikely and the charged offense is minor.
