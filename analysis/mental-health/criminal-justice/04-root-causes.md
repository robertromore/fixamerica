# Criminal Justice and Mental Health: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current crisis of mental illness in the criminal justice system is not the result of a single policy failure but of several long-term, interlocking trends. The closure of state psychiatric hospitals without building community alternatives, the simultaneous expansion of the criminal justice system, fragmented governance across health and justice agencies, and the absence of a right to mental health treatment have converged to make jails and prisons the nation's default psychiatric facilities. These root causes are structural, financial, political, and cultural, and they reinforce each other in ways that make reform exceptionally difficult.

## Failure of Community Mental Health Infrastructure

### The Unfulfilled Promise of Deinstitutionalization

Deinstitutionalization was never completed as envisioned. The 1963 Community Mental Health Act projected 2,000 community mental health centers; only 789 were built. Federal funding was converted to block grants in 1981 under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, and states reduced their own mental health spending as hospital costs declined. The result was a massive net reduction in mental health capacity: state hospital beds declined from 559,000 in 1955 to approximately 37,000 in 2022 (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022), but community services were never funded at a level sufficient to absorb the discharged population.

**Evidence**: The United States has 11.7 state psychiatric beds per 100,000 population, far below the minimum of 40-60 beds per 100,000 recommended by the Treatment Advocacy Center as necessary to prevent criminalization and homelessness. Forty-three states have fewer than 25 beds per 100,000 (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022).

### The Medicaid IMD Exclusion

The Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, embedded in Medicaid since 1965, prohibits federal reimbursement for care in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds for people aged 21-64. This single provision has distorted the entire architecture of American mental health care. It incentivizes states to close large psychiatric facilities (which cannot receive Medicaid) and shift care to community settings (which can), even when community capacity is inadequate. It also prevents the development of medium-sized psychiatric facilities that could serve as step-down alternatives between hospitalization and outpatient care.

**Evidence**: A 2023 analysis by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD) estimated that the IMD exclusion reduces federal mental health spending by $3-5 billion annually, leaving states to bear costs that would otherwise be shared with the federal government.

### Workforce Shortage

Community mental health centers report 25-30% vacancy rates for clinical positions (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023). The shortage is particularly acute for psychiatrists willing to serve Medicaid populations, forensic psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers in rural areas. Without staff, programs cannot accept referrals from the justice system, and diversion becomes impossible even where it is authorized.

**Evidence**: There are approximately 30,000 practicing psychiatrists in the United States, but the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) estimates a shortfall of 14,280 psychiatrists needed to meet current demand, with the gap projected to grow to 31,100 by 2030 (HRSA, 2023).

## Criminal Justice System Expansion

### Mass Incarceration and Low-Level Offending

The total incarcerated population in the United States grew from approximately 500,000 in 1980 to over 2.3 million by 2010. This expansion was driven by mandatory minimum sentencing, three-strikes laws, the War on Drugs, and broken-windows policing. People with untreated mental illness -- who are more likely to commit minor offenses like trespassing, disorderly conduct, and petty theft, and less likely to navigate the bail and court systems -- were disproportionately swept into the system.

**Evidence**: A 2023 Bureau of Justice Statistics report found that 64% of jail inmates with mental illness were incarcerated for nonviolent offenses, compared to 47% of inmates without mental illness.

### Criminalization of Survival Behaviors

Many of the behaviors associated with untreated mental illness and homelessness -- sleeping in public, trespassing, public urination, disorderly conduct, panhandling -- have been increasingly criminalized. Laws targeting these behaviors function as a de facto mechanism for removing people with mental illness from public spaces, channeling them into jails rather than treatment.

**Evidence**: The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty found that between 2006 and 2019, citywide bans on camping increased by 92%, bans on sitting/lying in public increased by 78%, and bans on panhandling increased by 103%. A 2022 study in the *Journal of Urban Health* found that people with serious mental illness are 40 times more likely to be arrested for "quality of life" offenses than the general population.

## Structural and Governance Failures

### Fragmented Authority

Mental health and criminal justice systems operate under entirely separate governance structures. Mental health services are administered by state and county behavioral health authorities, funded through Medicaid, state general funds, and federal block grants. Criminal justice is governed by police departments, district attorneys, judges, and corrections agencies, funded through state and local criminal justice budgets. There is no structural mechanism requiring coordination between these systems, and the incentives of each system often conflict.

**Evidence**: A 2021 Council of State Governments Justice Center analysis found that only 12 states had formal interagency agreements between their behavioral health and corrections agencies, and only 7 states had shared data systems allowing tracking of individuals across systems.

### No Right to Mental Health Treatment

Unlike criminal defendants, who have a constitutional right to counsel, people with mental illness have no enforceable right to treatment in the community. The Supreme Court's 1999 *Olmstead v. L.C.* decision established a right to community-based services for people with disabilities, but enforcement has been slow and piecemeal. Without a legal right to treatment, the mental health system can simply run out of capacity, leaving law enforcement as the only entity obligated to respond.

**Evidence**: The federal government funds 50% of Medicaid-covered mental health services but provides no entitlement to community mental health care for the uninsured. In 2022, SAMHSA estimated that only 46.2% of adults with any mental illness received mental health services, and only 65.4% of adults with serious mental illness received treatment (NSDUH, 2023).

### Medicaid Coverage Gap at Incarceration

Federal Medicaid policy terminates or suspends coverage for people during incarceration, creating immediate treatment disruption at arrest and a gap in coverage upon release. People with mental illness who lose Medicaid at arrest often go without medication and treatment during detention. Upon release, the average time to regain Medicaid coverage is 45-90 days (Bazelon Center, 2023), during which the risk of crisis, re-arrest, and death peaks.

**Evidence**: An estimated 70% of Medicaid-eligible people leaving jails are not enrolled in Medicaid on the day of release (Bazelon Center, 2023). A landmark New England Journal of Medicine study found that formerly incarcerated people have a 12.7 times higher risk of death in the first two weeks after release, with overdose and suicide as leading causes (Binswanger et al., 2007).

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Private prison and jail operators | Per-diem payments increase with population; mental health inmates have longer stays | $5.6 billion industry (2023) | Diversion reduces census; fewer inmates means less revenue |
| Private correctional healthcare companies | Contracts to provide mental health care inside facilities | $12 billion+ market (2023) | Community-based care reduces their captive market |
| Bail bond industry | People with mental illness are less likely to make bail, generating bond revenue | $2 billion annually | Pretrial diversion reduces bail-eligible population |
| Police unions | Mental health calls justify staffing levels and overtime | Varies by jurisdiction | Alternative response models reduce law enforcement role and funding |
| Forensic psychiatry providers | Competency evaluations and restoration generate revenue | ~$1.5 billion market | Reforms reducing IST referrals shrink the market |
| Local governments reliant on fines and fees | People with mental illness cycle through courts generating revenue | Varies; see justice/fines-and-fees analysis | Diversion reduces court-generated revenue |

### Perverse Incentives

The current system creates multiple perverse incentives that perpetuate criminalization:

- **For law enforcement**: Arrest is the path of least resistance. Officers can transport someone to jail in 30 minutes but may wait 6-8 hours in an emergency department for a psychiatric evaluation. The structure of the response system makes criminalization the easiest option.

- **For hospitals**: Emergency departments may board psychiatric patients for hours or days, creating financial losses. Refusing to accept patients (leading to jail) has no legal consequence for the hospital.

- **For states**: The IMD exclusion means states pay 100% of state hospital costs but only 25-50% of community Medicaid costs. This creates incentive to shift care to community settings, but when those settings lack capacity, the cost falls to the criminal justice system -- a different budget line.

- **For counties**: Jails are funded through county budgets, but community mental health is funded through state Medicaid and behavioral health allocations. Counties that invest in diversion programs save their own jail costs but may not recoup equivalent state mental health funding to sustain alternatives.

## Cultural and Behavioral Factors

### Stigma and Fear

Public attitudes toward mental illness remain shaped by stigma and fear, particularly regarding perceived dangerousness. Media coverage disproportionately links mental illness to violence, despite consistent research showing that people with mental illness commit only 3-5% of violent acts and are 10 times more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence (NIMH, 2022). This fear drives support for punitive responses and resistance to community-based treatment facilities ("not in my backyard" opposition to group homes, crisis centers, and supportive housing).

**Evidence**: A 2023 American Psychiatric Association poll found that 46% of Americans said they would be uncomfortable having a person with serious mental illness as a neighbor, and 67% believed people with serious mental illness are "somewhat" or "very" dangerous.

### Substance Use Comorbidity and Moral Framing

Seventy-two percent of incarcerated people with mental health conditions also have co-occurring substance use disorders (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023). Public discourse frequently treats substance use as a moral failing rather than a health condition, and the co-occurrence of mental illness and substance use undermines sympathy for treatment-based approaches. The result is a political environment where "treatment" and "accountability" are framed as opposing concepts.

## Why Reform Has Failed

### Attempted Reforms and Their Limitations

1. **Community Mental Health Act (1963)**: Created the vision of community-based care but was never adequately funded. Only 789 of 2,000 planned centers were built, and federal funding was converted to block grants in 1981.

2. **Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act (2004)**: Authorized grants for mental health courts and diversion programs, but annual appropriations ($30 million in 2023) cover a fraction of national need.

3. **Affordable Care Act Mental Health Parity (2010)**: Expanded Medicaid coverage for mental health services, but the IMD exclusion limits institutional care, 12 states have not expanded Medicaid, and workforce shortages prevent access even where coverage exists.

4. **Stepping Up Initiative (2015)**: Generated political commitment in 530+ counties, but most have not achieved measurable reductions in jail mental illness prevalence because resolutions are not binding and do not come with funding.

5. **988 Lifeline (2022)**: Created national crisis line infrastructure, but only 7 states have dedicated funding for 988, and the system cannot dispatch mobile crisis teams to most communities because those teams do not yet exist.

Each reform addresses one piece of the problem -- crisis response, diversion, treatment access, insurance coverage -- without transforming the underlying system. The fundamental failure is the absence of a comprehensive, adequately funded national strategy that addresses all intercept points simultaneously.
