# Criminal Justice and Mental Health: Stakeholders

The intersection of mental illness and criminal justice is shaped by the interests and actions of a wide range of stakeholders -- from the individuals directly affected to the government agencies, professional organizations, and advocacy groups that influence policy. Understanding who has power, who is affected, and where interests align or conflict is essential to building viable reform coalitions.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| People with mental illness in jails and prisons | Inadequate treatment, worsened conditions, trauma, extended detention | ~717,000 on any given day (BJS, 2023) | Access to treatment, humane conditions, diversion from incarceration |
| People with SMI booked into jails annually | Cycle of arrest, detention, release without treatment, re-arrest | ~2 million annually (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023) | Community-based treatment, crisis alternatives to police, stable housing |
| Families of incarcerated people with mental illness | Emotional distress, financial burden, navigation of fragmented systems | ~5-8 million family members (NAMI estimate, 2023) | Access to information, treatment for loved ones, system navigation support |
| People found incompetent to stand trial (IST) | Extended detention awaiting competency restoration, forced medication | ~30,000-35,000 annually (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023) | Timely evaluation, community-based restoration, charge dismissal for minor offenses |
| People with mental illness in solitary confinement | Psychiatric deterioration, self-harm, suicide risk | ~23,000-29,000 on any given day (BJS, 2021) | Elimination of solitary for people with SMI, access to programming and treatment |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Communities of color**: African Americans are 2.4 times more likely to be arrested than white Americans for the same offenses and are less likely to be diverted to mental health services (Vera Institute, 2023). The intersection of racial disparities in policing and mental health creates compounded disadvantage.
- **People experiencing homelessness**: An estimated 30% of people with SMI in jails were homeless in the year before arrest (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023). Criminalization of homelessness is a primary pathway to justice involvement for people with mental illness.
- **Children of incarcerated parents with mental illness**: An estimated 2.7 million children have a parent in jail or prison (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2022). Parental mental illness combined with incarceration creates compounded adverse childhood experiences.
- **Taxpayers**: The current system costs approximately $15 billion annually in correctional mental health care alone (Vera Institute, 2023), in addition to the broader economic costs of lost productivity, emergency services, and recidivism.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| State legislatures | Set criminal codes, authorize diversion programs, appropriate mental health funding | Legislative authority over both criminal justice and health budgets | Varies by state; total state MH spending ~$44 billion (2023) | High |
| County commissions/boards | Fund jails, local mental health services; implement Stepping Up resolutions | Local budget authority; jail oversight | County budgets; ~$25 billion on jails nationally (2023) | High |
| Governors | Appoint state MH directors, set executive priorities, issue executive orders | Executive authority; budget proposals | State budget authority; appointment power | High |
| District attorneys | Decide whether to prosecute, divert, or dismiss cases involving mental illness | Prosecutorial discretion | Office budgets; charging authority | High |
| Judges | Preside over mental health courts; order competency evaluations; set bail | Judicial authority; sentencing power | Court budgets; contempt authority | High |
| SAMHSA (federal) | Administers federal mental health block grants and programs | Grant-making; guidance; data collection | $9.5 billion budget (FY2024) | Medium-High |
| CMS (federal) | Sets Medicaid policy including IMD exclusion and reentry waivers | Regulatory authority over Medicaid | Oversees $800+ billion in Medicaid spending | High |
| Bureau of Justice Assistance (DOJ) | Administers justice-related mental health grants | Grant-making; technical assistance | ~$150 million in MH-related grants (FY2024) | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: The largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization, with 600+ state and local affiliates. NAMI has been a leading voice for CIT training, mental health court expansion, and the 988 Lifeline. Influence is primarily through public advocacy, grassroots organizing, and legislative testimony.

- **Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC)**: Focused specifically on policy barriers to treatment for people with serious mental illness. TAC produces widely cited data on psychiatric bed capacity, criminalization, and the consequences of untreated mental illness. Has advocated for assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) laws, which are controversial among civil liberties organizations.

- **Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center**: The primary technical assistance provider for the Stepping Up Initiative and state-level criminal justice-mental health reform. CSG provides data, research, and policy guidance to states and counties implementing diversion programs. Influence is through expert authority and direct engagement with policymakers.

- **National Association of Counties (NACo)**: Co-sponsor of the Stepping Up Initiative. NACo represents 3,069 county governments that operate most of the nation's 3,000+ jails. NACo has been influential in framing jail mental health as a county governance issue, not just a clinical one.

- **National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC)**: Sets voluntary accreditation standards for health care in jails and prisons, including mental health care. Only ~8% of jails and ~22% of state prisons meet NCCHC accreditation standards (NCCHC, 2023). Influence is through standard-setting and accreditation.

- **American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)**: Active in litigation challenging solitary confinement of people with mental illness, competency restoration delays, and inadequate correctional mental health care. The ACLU's National Prison Project has been involved in major class-action lawsuits in multiple states.

### Influencers

- **CIT International**: The national organization promoting the Memphis Model CIT program. Provides training standards, certification, and technical assistance to the ~2,700 CIT-trained agencies. Influence is through training infrastructure and program fidelity standards.

- **Vera Institute of Justice**: Produces research on incarceration costs, jail conditions, and diversion alternatives. The Vera Institute's cost-of-incarceration data is widely used to argue for diversion. Influence is through research credibility and policy analysis.

- **National Sheriffs' Association (NSA)**: Represents the sheriffs who operate most U.S. jails. The NSA has increasingly acknowledged the burden of mental illness on jails and has supported CIT training and jail diversion, though positions vary among individual sheriffs.

- **Police Executive Research Forum (PERF)**: Conducts research on policing and mental health, including response time data and alternative response models. PERF studies are frequently cited by reformers and policymakers.

- **Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law**: A leading legal advocacy organization focused on the rights of people with mental disabilities. The Bazelon Center has been involved in major litigation on community integration (*Olmstead*), Medicaid access, and correctional mental health care.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAMI, TAC, families, mental health providers | Treatment access and diversion from incarceration | Strong |
| Sheriffs, NACo, county commissioners | Reducing jail populations and costs associated with mental illness | Moderate-Strong |
| ACLU, Bazelon Center, disability rights organizations | Civil rights protections, ending solitary confinement, due process for IST defendants | Strong |
| CIT International, PERF, progressive police chiefs | Alternative crisis response models that improve officer safety and outcomes | Moderate |
| Medicaid advocates, public health organizations, CMS | Expanding Medicaid coverage during and after incarceration | Strong |
| Fiscal conservatives, libertarians, progressive reformers | Reducing incarceration costs through more effective community-based alternatives | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Treatment advocacy vs. civil liberties**: The Treatment Advocacy Center supports expanded assisted outpatient treatment (mandatory community treatment) and broader involuntary commitment criteria. The ACLU and Bazelon Center argue these approaches violate individual autonomy and disproportionately affect people of color. This is the most divisive intra-reform conflict.

- **Law enforcement unions vs. alternative response advocates**: Police unions generally oppose models like CAHOOTS that dispatch civilian teams to mental health calls, arguing that officer safety requires police presence. Alternative response advocates argue police presence escalates situations and that civilian models have strong safety records.

- **District attorneys vs. diversion advocates**: Many prosecutors support mental health courts but oppose broad pretrial diversion that removes prosecutorial leverage. Defense attorneys and civil liberties organizations argue that prosecutorial control over diversion eligibility perpetuates disparities.

- **State hospital staff unions vs. community care advocates**: Unions representing state hospital workers (AFSCME, SEIU in some states) have historically opposed hospital closures and the shift to community-based care, which threatens union jobs. Community mental health advocates argue that institutional care is more expensive and less effective.

### The Correctional-Industrial Triangle

The criminal justice response to mental illness is sustained by a political economy in which multiple actors benefit financially from the status quo:

```text
Private Corrections Industry ←→ Political Campaign Contributions
         ↓                                    ↓
    Contract Revenue ←→ Legislature → Criminal Justice Budgets
         ↓                                    ↓
    Jail/Prison Census ←→ Arrests ← Law Enforcement Budgets
```

Private prison operators (CoreCivic, GEO Group), correctional healthcare companies (Wellpath, YesCare), and electronic monitoring firms benefit from high incarceration rates. These companies spent $13 million on lobbying and $8 million on campaign contributions in the 2022 election cycle (OpenSecrets, 2023). While these interests do not explicitly oppose mental health diversion, their business models depend on maintaining a large incarcerated population.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on mental health and criminal justice policy:

- **Lobbying**: Private corrections companies and their trade association (the American Legislative Exchange Council has promoted model legislation favorable to incarceration). Conversely, NAMI and the National Council for Mental Wellbeing lobby for increased mental health funding and diversion programs.

- **Campaign Contributions**: District attorney and sheriff races are influenced by contributions from bail bond companies, police unions, and law-and-order political action committees. Mental health advocacy organizations have historically spent less on electoral politics.

- **Litigation**: The ACLU, Bazelon Center, Disability Rights organizations, and legal aid societies use litigation to enforce constitutional standards in jails and prisons, compel competency restoration within reasonable timeframes, and challenge solitary confinement practices. Litigation has been the single most effective mechanism for forcing systemic change.

- **Public Advocacy**: NAMI's grassroots network, the 988 Lifeline campaign, and media coverage of jail deaths have been powerful tools for building public support for reform. The National Sheriffs' Association's public statements about jail mental health burden have been particularly influential in building bipartisan support.

- **Expertise and Data**: Organizations like the CSG Justice Center, Treatment Advocacy Center, and Vera Institute of Justice shape policy through research, data collection, and technical assistance. Their reports are frequently cited in legislation and executive orders.
