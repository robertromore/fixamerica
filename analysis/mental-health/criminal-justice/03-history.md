# Criminal Justice and Mental Health: History

## Historical Development

The relationship between mental illness and the criminal justice system in the United States has undergone dramatic transformations over three centuries. The story is fundamentally one of institutional transfer: from poorhouses to asylums, from asylums to communities, and -- when communities failed to provide care -- from communities to jails and prisons. Understanding this history is essential to grasping why the current crisis exists and why reform efforts keep falling short.

### The Asylum Era (1773-1950): Institutionalization as Default

- **Colonial Period**: People with mental illness were treated as the responsibility of local communities. Those who were not cared for by family were confined in poorhouses, almshouses, or jails. There was no meaningful distinction between mental illness and criminal behavior in many communities.

- **Moral Treatment Movement (1840s-1870s)**: Dorothea Dix led a national campaign to build state psychiatric hospitals after documenting the horrific conditions in jails and poorhouses where people with mental illness were held. Between 1843 and 1880, she persuaded states to build or expand 32 psychiatric hospitals. The movement was grounded in the belief that humane, structured environments could cure mental illness.

- **Growth of the State Hospital System**: By 1900, every state operated at least one psychiatric hospital. The number of state hospital patients grew from approximately 150,000 in 1903 to 559,000 in 1955 -- the peak of American institutionalization. At that point, state hospitals housed approximately 340 patients per 100,000 population (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022).

- **Overcrowding and Deterioration**: The state hospital system became a victim of its own growth. Institutions designed for hundreds housed thousands. Treatment gave way to custodial care. Conditions deteriorated to the point that journalist Albert Deutsch described state hospitals as "little more than concentration camps" in his 1948 expose *The Shame of the States*. Staff-to-patient ratios in some facilities reached 1:100.

- **Criminal Justice During the Asylum Era**: During this period, the criminal justice system's involvement with mental illness was relatively limited. People exhibiting signs of mental illness were typically diverted to state hospitals through civil commitment rather than prosecuted. Jails housed a small fraction of people with mental illness -- the "revolving door" had not yet been created because the institutional system, however flawed, absorbed this population.

### Deinstitutionalization (1955-1985): The Great Emptying

- **Thorazine and the Psychopharmacological Revolution (1954)**: The introduction of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) -- the first effective antipsychotic medication -- convinced policymakers that people with serious mental illness could be treated outside institutional settings. The drug transformed the landscape of possibility, even as its limitations were not yet understood.

- **Community Mental Health Act (1963)**: President John F. Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act, envisioning a network of 2,000 community mental health centers (CMHCs) to replace state hospitals. Congress authorized construction funding but provided only limited operating funds. Kennedy's assassination and the escalation of the Vietnam War shifted national attention away from implementation.

- **Medicaid and the IMD Exclusion (1965)**: The creation of Medicaid included the "Institutions for Mental Diseases" (IMD) exclusion, which prohibited federal Medicaid reimbursement for care in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds. This created a powerful financial incentive for states to discharge patients from state hospitals (which received no federal funding) into smaller settings or the community (where Medicaid would pay). The IMD exclusion remains in effect and continues to distort mental health financing.

- **Civil Rights Movement and Patient Rights (1960s-1970s)**: A series of landmark court decisions established constitutional protections for people in psychiatric institutions. *Wyatt v. Stickney* (1971) established a right to treatment in the least restrictive setting. *O'Connor v. Donaldson* (1975) held that non-dangerous mentally ill people could not be confined against their will if they could survive safely in the community. *Addington v. Texas* (1979) required clear and convincing evidence for civil commitment. These decisions, while advancing civil liberties, accelerated the discharge of patients without ensuring adequate community services existed.

- **The Numbers**: State psychiatric hospital populations dropped from 559,000 in 1955 to 272,000 by 1970, 132,000 by 1980, and 72,000 by 1994 (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). Hundreds of hospitals closed entirely. Between 1955 and 2000, the number of state psychiatric beds fell from 340 per 100,000 population to approximately 22 per 100,000.

- **The Broken Promise of Community Care**: Of the 2,000 CMHCs envisioned in Kennedy's 1963 legislation, only 789 were ever built. Federal block grant funding replaced categorical CMHC funding in 1981 under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, and many centers shifted their focus toward less severely ill populations who were easier and cheaper to serve. People with serious mental illness -- the very population discharged from state hospitals -- were systematically underserved.

### Criminalization and the Rise of "Trans-Institutionalization" (1970-2000)

- **Penrose's Law in Action**: In 1939, British psychiatrist Lionel Penrose observed an inverse relationship between psychiatric bed capacity and prison population. As state hospitals emptied, American jails and prisons filled with people with mental illness -- a phenomenon scholars would later call "trans-institutionalization."

- **The War on Crime (1970s-1990s)**: The simultaneous expansion of criminal justice and contraction of mental health services created a perfect storm. Mandatory minimum sentencing, three-strikes laws, the War on Drugs, and broken-windows policing dramatically increased the likelihood that people with untreated mental illness -- who were increasingly visible on streets, in shelters, and in public spaces -- would be arrested. Homelessness among people with mental illness surged.

- **Jail as Mental Hospital**: By the late 1980s, researchers began documenting the growing presence of mental illness in jails. Linda Teplin's landmark 1990 study in Cook County Jail found that 9% of male detainees and 18.5% of female detainees had severe psychiatric disorders. The proportion of jail inmates with mental illness has continued to grow in every subsequent study.

- **Larry Hogue and the Media Narrative**: The case of Larry Hogue, a homeless man with mental illness and substance use disorder who terrorized an Upper West Side neighborhood in New York City in the early 1990s, became national news and crystallized public fear. The "violent mentally ill person" narrative -- despite evidence that people with mental illness are far more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence -- drove punitive policy responses.

- **Competency to Stand Trial**: As more people with serious mental illness entered the criminal justice system, the number of competency evaluations began to grow. Annual competency evaluations increased from approximately 25,000 in 1990 to 60,000-70,000 by 2023 -- a nearly threefold increase (Gowensmith et al., 2023).

### Emergence of Alternatives (1988-2010): Building the Reform Infrastructure

- **Memphis CIT Model (1988)**: Following the fatal police shooting of Joseph DeWayne Robinson, a man with mental illness wielding a knife, the Memphis Police Department partnered with the University of Memphis, the Memphis chapter of NAMI, and mental health providers to create the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) model. The 40-hour training program for volunteer officers became the most widely replicated mental health-law enforcement program in the country.

- **First Mental Health Court (1997)**: Broward County, Florida, established the nation's first mental health court, modeled on the drug court movement that began in 1989. The concept spread rapidly: by 2005, there were 125 mental health courts; by 2023, approximately 450.

- **Sequential Intercept Model (2006)**: Researchers Mark Munetz and Patricia Griffin published the Sequential Intercept Model, providing a conceptual framework for diverting people with mental illness at five points along the criminal justice continuum. The model became the standard framework for policy development and program planning.

- **Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act (2004)**: Congress passed the first federal legislation specifically addressing the criminalization of mental illness, authorizing grants for mental health courts, diversion programs, and reentry services. Reauthorized in 2008 as the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act.

- **Stepping Up Initiative (2015)**: The National Association of Counties, the Council of State Governments Justice Center, and the American Psychiatric Association launched the Stepping Up Initiative, challenging counties to reduce the number of people with mental illness in jails. Over 530 counties have passed Stepping Up resolutions as of 2024.

### Contemporary Era (2010-Present): Crisis, Litigation, and Incremental Reform

- **Competency Restoration Litigation Wave**: Beginning with *Trueblood v. DSHS* in Washington State (2015), federal courts began ordering states to provide timely competency evaluations and restoration. By 2024, at least 23 states faced active litigation over competency restoration delays (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2024).

- **Solitary Confinement Reform**: Growing evidence of the psychiatric harm of solitary confinement led to a wave of state-level restrictions. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture classified prolonged solitary confinement (more than 15 consecutive days) as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment in 2011. By 2024, 18 states and D.C. had enacted laws or policies restricting solitary for people with mental illness (Vera Institute, 2024).

- **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (2022)**: The activation of the 988 three-digit crisis number represented the most significant federal investment in crisis response infrastructure in decades. The system handled 5.6 million contacts in its first 18 months (SAMHSA, 2024), though funding remains inadequate in most states.

- **Medicaid Reentry Waiver (2023)**: CMS issued a final rule allowing Medicaid reimbursement for services provided to incarcerated people in the 90 days before release, potentially covering 500,000+ people annually (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2024). This represented the first federal policy explicitly addressing the Medicaid coverage gap at reentry.

- **CAHOOTS and Alternative Response Movement**: The CAHOOTS (Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets) program in Eugene, Oregon, which had operated since 1989, became a national model after the 2020 protests over police violence. By 2023, over 20 cities had launched or were developing CAHOOTS-inspired civilian crisis response programs (White Bird Clinic, 2023).

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Institutional Transfer Without Adequate Alternatives

The most persistent pattern in this history is the transfer of responsibility for people with mental illness from one institution to another without building the community infrastructure needed to support them. Dorothea Dix moved people from jails to asylums. Deinstitutionalization moved them from asylums to communities. But when communities lacked resources, people ended up back in jails -- completing a 175-year circle. Each transfer was motivated by genuine reform impulses, but each was implemented without adequate funding for the receiving system. The lesson is clear: closing institutions without building alternatives does not reform care; it relocates suffering.

### Pattern 2: Reform Through Crisis and Litigation

Virtually every major reform in this area has been driven by crisis, tragedy, or litigation rather than proactive policy. The CIT model emerged from a fatal police shooting. Competency restoration reform is being driven by federal lawsuits, not legislative initiative. Solitary confinement restrictions have been imposed by courts, not voluntarily adopted. This pattern suggests that policy change in this area requires sustained external pressure and that reforms achieved through litigation alone may lack the political durability and funding commitments needed for long-term success.

### Pattern 3: The Gap Between Policy Innovation and Scale

The United States has developed numerous effective models for addressing mental illness in the criminal justice system -- CIT, mental health courts, CAHOOTS, the Sequential Intercept Model, forensic assertive community treatment. The problem has never been a lack of evidence-based programs; it has been a failure to fund and scale them. Mental health courts exist in only 7% of U.S. counties. CIT training reaches only 15% of law enforcement agencies. The gap between innovation and implementation has been the defining failure of reform efforts.
