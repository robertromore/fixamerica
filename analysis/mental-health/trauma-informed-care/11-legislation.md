# Trauma-Informed Care: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to trauma-informed care requires action at federal, state, and regulatory levels. No single law can transform an entire system; rather, a coordinated package of legislation, appropriations, and regulation is needed to establish standards, create financing mechanisms, build workforce capacity, and incentivize adoption. The strategy is incremental rather than comprehensive, beginning with voluntary adoption incentives and progressing toward universal requirements as capacity grows. Federal legislation sets the framework and provides resources; state model legislation adapts to local contexts; and regulatory action ensures implementation fidelity.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for trauma-informed care reform.* The federal government has ample authority under the Spending Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8) to condition federal funding on TIC adoption, under the Commerce Clause to regulate health insurance and healthcare standards, and through existing statutory frameworks (SAMHSA authorization, Medicaid, Title I, Title IV-E) to direct resources toward trauma-informed system transformation.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish a comprehensive federal framework for trauma-informed care
integration across public systems, to authorize trauma screening
reimbursement, workforce development, and community resilience
programs, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Trauma-Informed Care Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2021), approximately
61 percent of United States adults (approximately 155,000,000
people) report at least one adverse childhood experience (ACE),
and 16 percent (approximately 40,500,000 people) report four or
more ACEs.

(2) The landmark Adverse Childhood Experiences Study (Felitti et
al., 1998) and subsequent research demonstrate a graded
dose-response relationship between childhood adversity and leading
causes of adult morbidity and mortality, including heart disease,
cancer, depression, substance use disorders, and suicide.

(3) The annual economic burden of adverse childhood experiences
in the United States is estimated at $748,000,000,000, encompassing
healthcare costs, lost productivity, child welfare expenditures,
and criminal justice involvement (CDC, 2022).

(4) Evidence-based trauma treatments, including Cognitive
Processing Therapy, Prolonged Exposure, and Eye Movement
Desensitization and Reprocessing, demonstrate recovery rates of
53 to 80 percent for post-traumatic stress disorder (VA/DoD
Clinical Practice Guideline, 2023), yet only 36.3 percent of
adults with PTSD receive evidence-based treatment (SAMHSA National
Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2023).

(5) Fewer than 4 percent of pediatricians routinely screen for
adverse childhood experiences (Pediatrics, 2020), despite the
availability of validated screening instruments and evidence that
screening is feasible and acceptable to patients (ACEs Aware
Annual Report, 2023).

(6) The mental health workforce is insufficient to meet current
demand, with 1,563 counties lacking a single psychologist (APA,
2023) and projected shortages of 31,091 psychologists and 12,040
psychiatrists by 2030 (HRSA, 2022).

(7) Twenty-six States have enacted trauma-informed care
legislation or resolutions as of 2023 (NCSL, 2023), demonstrating
bipartisan interest in trauma-informed system transformation.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) ACE.--The term "adverse childhood experience" or "ACE"
means an experience occurring before age 18 that is potentially
traumatic, including but not limited to physical, emotional, or
sexual abuse; physical or emotional neglect; household dysfunction
including substance abuse, mental illness, incarceration, domestic
violence, or parental separation; and community-level adversity
including racism, poverty, and community violence.

(2) EVIDENCE-BASED TRAUMA TREATMENT.--The term "evidence-based
trauma treatment" means a psychotherapeutic intervention that has
demonstrated efficacy for trauma-related conditions in randomized
controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals, including
but not limited to Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Prolonged
Exposure (PE), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing
(EMDR), and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT).

(3) TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE.--The term "trauma-informed care"
means an approach to service delivery that incorporates the six
principles identified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration: safety; trustworthiness and transparency;
peer support; collaboration and mutuality; empowerment, voice, and
choice; and cultural, historical, and gender responsiveness.

(4) VALIDATED TRAUMA SCREENING.--The term "validated trauma
screening" means the use of a psychometrically validated
instrument to assess trauma exposure or trauma-related symptoms,

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the congressional record with specific data on ACE prevalence, economic burden, treatment efficacy, and system gaps. These findings provide the factual foundation for federal action and support the constitutional basis under the Spending Clause.
- **Section 4 (National Standards)**: Creates the baseline for consistent TIC implementation. Standards are developed collaboratively with professional associations and include survivor input, ensuring both scientific rigor and practical acceptability.
- **Section 5 (Training Center)**: Addresses the root cause of most implementation failures -- an unprepared workforce -- by creating national training infrastructure modeled on the VA's successful CPT/PE rollout.
- **Section 6 (Screening Integration)**: Operationalizes the most actionable near-term reform by embedding screening in existing healthcare encounters. The referral pathway requirement prevents screening without follow-up capacity.
- **Section 7 (Schools Initiative)**: Targets the setting where children spend 1,000+ hours annually. Phased funding increases allow for progressive implementation.
- **Section 8 (Justice Initiative)**: Addresses the system with the highest trauma prevalence (85-95% of incarcerated individuals have significant trauma histories) and the greatest potential for cost savings through diversion and recidivism reduction.
- **Section 9 (Workforce Development)**: Leverages existing infrastructure (NHSC, VA training) to expand the trauma treatment workforce and addresses secondary traumatic stress to ensure workforce sustainability.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| National TIC competency standards published | 12 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| CMS reimbursement codes for trauma screening issued | 12 months after enactment | CMS |
| National Trauma Training Center operational | 18 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| Screening guidelines published | 12 months after enactment | SAMHSA/CDC |
| Trauma-Informed Schools Initiative grants awarded | 18 months after enactment | Department of Education |
| DOJ Trauma-Informed Justice Initiative operational | 12 months after enactment | DOJ/BJA |
| First annual report to Congress | 18 months after enactment | HHS |
| GAO implementation review | 3 years after enactment | GAO |

**Regulatory Authority**: SAMHSA serves as the lead agency for standards, training, and screening guidelines. CMS implements reimbursement through Medicaid and Medicare regulation. The Department of Education administers school grants. DOJ/BJA administers justice grants. The interagency coordination body ensures alignment.

**Challenges**:

- **Appropriations risk**: Authorization does not guarantee appropriation. The phased funding structure requires sustained congressional support over five or more fiscal years.
- **State implementation variation**: Federal-state partnerships create 50 different implementation contexts, risking uneven adoption.
- **Workforce bottleneck**: Even with training center and loan repayment expansion, building workforce capacity to match screening expansion will take 5-7 years.

**Refinements**:

- **Contingent screening mandates**: Tie screening requirements to workforce capacity metrics rather than fixed timelines, ensuring that screening expansion does not outpace treatment availability.
- **Maintenance of effort**: Require states to maintain existing behavioral health spending to prevent federal funds from substituting for state investment.
- **Quality assurance**: Add accreditation requirements for organizations claiming trauma-informed status, preventing performative adoption.

## State Model Legislation

### Model Trauma-Informed Systems Act

**Purpose**: Provide a framework for states to integrate trauma-informed care across public systems, building on existing federal standards while adapting to state-specific governance structures, workforce conditions, and populations.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize provisions based on their existing TIC infrastructure (26 states have already passed some form of TIC legislation), Medicaid program design, educational governance structure, and workforce availability. States with existing ACE task forces or commissions should integrate this legislation with ongoing initiatives.

**Draft Text**:

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), with coordination from CMS, CDC, Department of Education, and DOJ.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Trauma Screening Reimbursement Rule**: CMS must issue a final rule establishing reimbursement codes and rates for validated trauma screening in Medicaid and Medicare. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.
2. **National TIC Competency Standards**: SAMHSA must publish competency standards through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.
3. **Screening Guidelines**: SAMHSA and CDC must jointly publish clinical screening guidelines through guidance documents. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.
4. **Privacy Protections for Trauma Screening Data**: HHS must issue regulations governing the collection, storage, and disclosure of trauma screening data, with protections comparable to 42 CFR Part 2 (substance use disorder records). Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Organizations receiving federal TIC funding that fail to comply with grant conditions may face suspension or termination of funding.
- **Administrative Actions**: CMS may withhold enhanced Medicaid matching for states that fail to implement screening coverage requirements within 24 months.
- **No Private Right of Action**: The Act does not create a private right of action. Enforcement is administrative through grant conditions and Medicaid requirements.
- **GAO Oversight**: Biennial GAO reviews provide independent assessment of implementation and expenditure.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: The primary constitutional basis for the Trauma-Informed Care Act is the Spending Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1), under which Congress may condition federal funding on state compliance with federal requirements. Under *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), such conditions must be (1) in pursuit of the general welfare, (2) unambiguous, (3) related to the federal interest in the funded program, and (4) not independently unconstitutional. The TIC Act satisfies all four requirements. Under *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), conditions must not be so coercive as to compel state participation; the phased, incentive-based approach avoids this concern.

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Insurance mandate provisions (requiring coverage of evidence-based trauma treatments) are supported by Commerce Clause authority over the health insurance industry, as upheld in *NFIB v. Sebelius* for the individual mandate.

**Tenth Amendment**: The Act avoids Tenth Amendment concerns by conditioning funding rather than commanding state action. States may decline federal TIC funding, though doing so would forfeit significant resources.

### Preemption

The Act includes a savings clause preserving state laws that provide greater protection or more expansive services than federal requirements. States are permitted to exceed federal standards but may not fall below them when receiving federal TIC funding. The Act does not preempt state professional licensing requirements but encourages alignment with federal competency standards.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through three mechanisms: (1) grant conditions that require evidence of implementation as a prerequisite for continued funding; (2) Medicaid state plan requirements that condition enhanced federal matching on screening coverage; and (3) annual reporting requirements that create public transparency about implementation progress.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| "Trauma-informed" without fidelity standards | Organizations could claim TIC status based on minimal training or policy adoption without genuine practice change, qualifying for funding while delivering performative compliance | High | Add accreditation requirements with external validation; tie continued funding to outcome metrics (client-reported improvements, workforce retention) |
| Screening without follow-up capacity | Providers could screen patients to earn reimbursement without maintaining adequate referral pathways, generating positive screens with no treatment access | High | Strengthen Section 6(c) referral pathway requirement with specific capacity thresholds; require annual capacity audits for screening programs |
| Workforce credential gaming | Providers could claim trauma training completion through brief, low-quality courses that do not build genuine competency | Medium | Establish minimum training hour requirements and competency assessments aligned with national standards; require supervised practice for evidence-based treatment endorsement |
| Data misuse | Trauma screening data could be accessed by employers, insurers, law enforcement, or child welfare agencies for purposes that harm the screened individual | High | Strengthen privacy protections to match 42 CFR Part 2 standards; prohibit use of screening data in custody, employment, insurance, or law enforcement proceedings without explicit individual consent |
| State opt-out | States could decline federal TIC funding to avoid requirements, leaving their residents without access to trauma-informed systems | Medium | Make Medicaid screening reimbursement universally available regardless of state plan adoption; offer enhanced matching rates as carrots rather than withholding as sticks |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| No insurance mandate for commercial plans | Leaves privately insured populations without guaranteed trauma screening coverage | Political opposition to insurance mandates; Commerce Clause limitations | Pursue separate mental health parity enforcement legislation; encourage states to mandate coverage through state insurance regulation |
| Reliance on annual appropriations | Funding could be cut in any fiscal year, undermining long-term implementation | Federal budget process; competing spending priorities | Include mandatory spending provisions for core programs (screening reimbursement); build bipartisan support through demonstrated outcomes |
| Five-year authorization limit | Programs expire after 5 years unless reauthorized, creating implementation uncertainty | Standard legislative practice for limited authorizations | Include 10-year authorization for core provisions (training center, workforce development); build reauthorization momentum through outcome reporting |
| Limited enforcement mechanisms | No private right of action means individuals cannot sue for non-compliance; administrative enforcement may be slow | Political compromise; federalism concerns | Strengthen administrative enforcement timelines; require annual compliance reporting; consider adding qui tam provisions for systemic violations |
| Cultural adaptation gap | Evidence-based treatments were predominantly developed with white, English-speaking populations; federal standards may not adequately address cultural diversity | Historical research bias; cultural validation takes time | Earmark funding for cultural adaptation research and validation; require community input in local implementation design; fund community-defined practices alongside EBTs |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Accreditation requirement amendment**: Add a provision requiring organizations receiving more than $500,000 in federal TIC funding to obtain independent accreditation against national standards within 3 years, with annual renewal based on outcome metrics.

2. **Capacity-linked screening mandate**: Amend Section 6 to include a trigger mechanism: screening mandates in a given state or system activate only when the state demonstrates treatment capacity to serve at least 60% of anticipated positive screens within 30 days.

3. **Commercial insurance extension**: Introduce companion legislation amending the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act to explicitly include validated trauma screening as a covered preventive service for all health plans, including ERISA-regulated employer plans.

4. **Mandatory spending conversion**: In reauthorization, convert core programs (screening reimbursement, training center) from discretionary to mandatory spending to insulate them from annual appropriations volatility.

5. **Cultural competency requirements**: Amend workforce development provisions to require that 20% of training center funding be dedicated to cultural adaptation, community-defined practices, and training of providers from underrepresented communities.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Act authorizes programs for 5 fiscal years (FY2026-FY2030) with the following review mechanisms:

- **Annual reports** from HHS to Congress beginning 18 months after enactment
- **Biennial GAO reviews** beginning 3 years after enactment
- **Five-year comprehensive evaluation** by an independent entity contracted by HHS, examining outcomes against baseline metrics
- **Reauthorization requirement**: All programs must be reauthorized by Congress to continue beyond FY2030; reauthorization legislation should incorporate lessons from the five-year evaluation

If outcome metrics demonstrate a positive return on investment (reduced downstream costs exceeding program costs), reauthorization should include 10-year authorization and transition to mandatory spending for core provisions.
