# Trauma-Informed Care: Stakeholders

The landscape of trauma-informed care is shaped by the interactions of multiple groups -- from the millions of Americans directly affected by trauma to the professionals who serve them, the policymakers who allocate resources, and the organizations that advocate for reform. Understanding these stakeholders, their interests, and their power dynamics is essential for building effective coalitions and overcoming barriers to implementation.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Adults with trauma histories | Reduced health outcomes, mental illness, substance use, shortened lifespan | ~155 million (61% of adults with 1+ ACE) | Access to evidence-based treatment, destigmatization, systemic understanding |
| Children currently experiencing adversity | Disrupted brain development, academic failure, behavioral problems, removal from homes | ~35 million children (46% of U.S. children with 1+ ACE, NSCH 2022) | Safe environments, stable caregivers, access to therapeutic services |
| Parents and caregivers with unresolved trauma | Difficulty providing stable caregiving, intergenerational trauma transmission | ~30 million parents with 4+ ACEs (est.) | Parenting support, treatment access, family preservation |
| Foster children and youth in state care | Placement instability, compounded trauma, poor adult outcomes | 391,098 in foster care (FY2022) | Trauma-specific treatment, placement stability, permanency |
| Incarcerated individuals with trauma histories | Untreated trauma driving behavior, re-traumatization in custody | ~1.9 million (85-95% have significant trauma) | Trauma treatment in custody, alternatives to incarceration |
| Veterans with combat and military sexual trauma | PTSD, TBI, substance use, suicide risk | ~7 million with service-connected conditions | VA treatment access, evidence-based therapies, peer support |
| Communities of color disproportionately exposed to trauma | Compounded effects of racism, poverty, violence, and historical trauma | Varies; AI/AN adults 1.68x national ACE rate | Culturally responsive care, community-level investment, equity |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Employers and the workforce**: Adults with unaddressed trauma histories experience higher rates of absenteeism, disability, and reduced productivity. The annual lost productivity attributable to ACEs is estimated at $212 billion (CDC, 2022).
- **Healthcare payers (Medicaid, Medicare, private insurers)**: Trauma-related health conditions drive disproportionate healthcare utilization. Individuals with 4+ ACEs have 1.6x higher healthcare costs than those with 0 ACEs (Miller et al., 2020).
- **Taxpayers**: The $748 billion annual economic burden of ACEs (CDC, 2022) is ultimately borne by taxpayers through public health systems, criminal justice, child welfare, and safety net programs.
- **Faith communities**: Religious institutions serve as de facto support systems for many trauma-affected individuals, particularly in rural and minority communities. They are stakeholders in how trauma is understood and addressed.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Authorizes and appropriates funding for SAMHSA, HRSA, CDC, DOJ programs | Legislative authority over federal behavioral health spending | Federal budget allocations | High |
| SAMHSA Administrator | Leads federal behavioral health agency; sets TIC policy direction | Administrative authority over $9.5 billion (FY2024) | Staff, grants, guidance documents | High |
| State governors and legislatures | Enact TIC legislation, direct state agency implementation | State legislative and executive authority | State budgets, Medicaid authority | High |
| CMS Administrator | Sets Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement policy | Regulatory authority over $1.5 trillion in health spending | Reimbursement rates, coverage decisions | High |
| State Medicaid directors | Determine state Medicaid coverage, screening, and reimbursement | State plan amendments, waivers | State Medicaid budgets (avg $30 billion) | High |
| School superintendents and school boards | Adopt discipline policies, allocate school mental health resources | District-level authority over 50+ million students | Local education budgets | Medium |
| Judges and court administrators | Implement trauma-informed court practices | Judicial authority, court rules | Court budgets, diversionary programs | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)**: The primary federal agency for behavioral health, administers the NCTSI ($82 million, FY2024) and the Community Mental Health Block Grant ($1.86 billion, FY2024). Sets national TIC framework and disseminates guidance.
- **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**: Leads ACE surveillance through the BRFSS, publishes research on ACE prevention, and maintains the ACE data portal. The Division of Violence Prevention houses the primary ACE research program.
- **National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN)**: Federally funded network of 150+ centers developing and disseminating evidence-based child trauma treatments. Has trained over 1 million professionals since 2001.
- **Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)**: Funds community health centers, workforce development, and the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access program ($36 million, FY2024).
- **Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)**: Operates the largest integrated healthcare system with extensive trauma treatment infrastructure. Has trained thousands of clinicians in CPT and PE through national rollout programs.
- **Administration for Children and Families (ACF)**: Administers child welfare programs including Family First Prevention Services Act implementation, which expanded Title IV-E funding for trauma treatment.

### Influencers

- **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)**: Has issued policy statements supporting ACE screening and trauma-informed pediatric care. Represents 67,000 pediatricians.
- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: Largest grassroots mental health organization, with 600+ affiliates. Advocates for mental health parity, funding, and access.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Pediatricians + educators + child welfare advocates | Early identification and intervention for children experiencing adversity | Strong |
| Veterans' organizations + law enforcement + first responders | PTSD treatment access, occupational stress support, peer programs | Strong |
| Criminal justice reformers + public health advocates + fiscal conservatives | Reducing incarceration costs through trauma-informed diversion | Moderate |
| Insurance companies + employers + public health | Reducing downstream healthcare costs through prevention | Moderate |
| Faith communities + family advocacy organizations + parenting programs | Strengthening families and community support systems | Moderate |
| Trauma survivors + peer support networks + advocacy organizations | Centering lived experience in policy design and service delivery | Strong |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Treatment access vs. fiscal restraint**: Mental health advocates push for expanded coverage and workforce investment; budget hawks resist new spending, particularly unfunded mandates to states
- **Universal screening vs. privacy and autonomy**: Public health advocates favor universal ACE screening; civil libertarians and some clinicians worry about data collection, surveillance, and retraumatization
- **Professional autonomy vs. standardized protocols**: Many clinicians resist mandated training or standardized screening protocols as infringements on professional judgment; quality advocates argue that evidence-based standards are necessary
- **Family preservation vs. child safety**: TIC advocates emphasize keeping families together and addressing parental trauma; child protection advocates prioritize immediate safety, sometimes through removal
- **Pharmaceutical vs. psychotherapeutic approaches**: The pharmaceutical industry profits from medication-first approaches; trauma therapy advocates argue for psychotherapy as first-line treatment

### The Implementation Iron Triangle

The slow pace of TIC adoption is reinforced by three interconnected structures:

1. **Professional education institutions** that do not teach trauma science maintain a workforce unequipped for TIC
2. **Licensing and credentialing bodies** that do not require trauma competency perpetuate the training gap
3. **Healthcare payment systems** that do not reimburse TIC activities provide no financial incentive for adoption

These three structures reinforce each other: education programs do not teach what licensing does not require, licensing does not require what payment does not support, and payment does not support what professionals are not trained to deliver.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on trauma-informed care policy:

- **Lobbying**: Pharmaceutical companies spent $374 million on federal lobbying in 2022 (OpenSecrets, 2023), far exceeding the combined advocacy budgets of trauma-informed care organizations. Mental health advocacy organizations, while politically active, have far fewer resources.
- **Campaign Contributions**: Health sector political contributions totaled $740 million in the 2022 cycle (OpenSecrets), with pharmaceutical and insurance industries dominating. Behavioral health contributions are a small fraction.
- **Professional Associations**: The AAP, APA, NASW, and other professional organizations influence policy through position statements, practice guidelines, continuing education requirements, and testimony before legislative bodies.
- **Public Advocacy**: Organizations like NAMI, CTIPP, and ACEs Connection mobilize grassroots support through community education, media campaigns, and legislative advocacy days.
- **Research and Expertise**: Academic trauma researchers and federally funded centers (NCTSN, CDC) shape policy through published evidence, technical assistance, and expert testimony. The research base for TIC is extensive and growing.
- **Lived Experience Advocacy**: Trauma survivors increasingly participate in policy development, program design, and public education through peer support organizations, survivor-led advocacy groups, and advisory councils.
