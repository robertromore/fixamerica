# Trauma-Informed Care

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of trauma-informed care (TIC) in the United States, encompassing Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) research, trauma screening and assessment, trauma-responsive systems across public institutions, and evidence-based treatment approaches for individuals and communities affected by trauma.

## Overview

Trauma-informed care represents a paradigm shift in how public institutions, healthcare systems, schools, and justice agencies understand and respond to the widespread impact of trauma. Rooted in the landmark 1998 ACE Study, which documented the dose-response relationship between childhood adversity and adult health outcomes, TIC moves beyond asking "What is wrong with you?" to asking "What happened to you?" This reframing has profound implications for policy design, service delivery, workforce development, and system reform across virtually every domain of American public life.

Despite strong evidence supporting trauma-informed approaches, implementation remains fragmented. An estimated 61% of American adults have experienced at least one ACE, and 16% have experienced four or more, yet fewer than 4% of pediatricians routinely screen for ACEs. Trauma-responsive systems have been piloted in schools, courts, child welfare agencies, and healthcare settings with promising outcomes, but no federal framework mandates or coordinates these efforts. The result is a patchwork of state initiatives, grant-funded pilots, and voluntary adoption that leaves millions of trauma-affected Americans without access to appropriate, evidence-based care.

This analysis examines the science of trauma and resilience, the current state of implementation across major systems, historical development of the field, systemic barriers to adoption, and a comprehensive reform agenda. It proposes federal legislation, state model acts, workforce development strategies, and a phased roadmap for building a truly trauma-responsive nation.
