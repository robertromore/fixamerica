# Trauma-Informed Care: What You Can Do

Advancing trauma-informed care in the United States requires action at every level -- from individual awareness to systemic advocacy. The science is clear: 61% of U.S. adults have experienced at least one adverse childhood experience, and the annual economic burden of ACEs is $748 billion (CDC, 2022). Yet the gap between what we know about trauma and what our public systems do about it remains vast. Closing that gap requires informed, persistent citizen engagement.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read *The Deepest Well* by Dr. Nadine Burke Harris for an accessible introduction to ACE science and its policy implications
- Complete the free ACEs Aware training module (originally developed for California providers but available to all) at <https://www.acesaware.org/learn-about-screening/>
- Take the ACE questionnaire yourself to understand your own ACE score and its potential health implications: <https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/aces/> (Note: ACE scores are population-level indicators, not individual diagnoses)
- Follow the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) for evidence-based resources on child trauma: <https://www.nctsn.org>
- Subscribe to the ACEs Connection newsletter for monthly updates on state and local TIC initiatives: <https://www.acesconnection.com>

### Make Personal Changes

- If you are a parent or caregiver, learn about the science of toxic stress and how to build protective factors (stable routines, responsive relationships, emotional regulation) in your family
- If you have experienced trauma, know that evidence-based treatments (CPT, PE, EMDR) have recovery rates of 53-80% for PTSD (VA/DoD CPG, 2023). Ask your provider specifically about these treatments. The Psychology Today therapist directory (<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists>) allows filtering by trauma specialization.
- Practice and model emotional regulation and conflict resolution skills in your relationships and community
- Learn to recognize signs of trauma in others -- withdrawal, hypervigilance, difficulty trusting, emotional dysregulation -- and respond with patience and compassion rather than judgment

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge your members of Congress to support the Trauma-Informed Care Act and expanded funding for SAMHSA, NCTSN, and community mental health programs. The most impactful times are during budget season (February-September) and when behavioral health legislation is pending.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS proposes Medicaid or Medicare rule changes affecting behavioral health, submit public comments supporting trauma screening reimbursement and mental health parity enforcement. Federal Register comment periods are tracked at <https://www.regulations.gov>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Local newspapers influence state and local policymakers. Write about the need for trauma-informed schools, adequately funded school mental health services, and community-based prevention programs.
- **Share Information**: Share ACE science and trauma-informed care information with your personal and professional networks, using plain language rather than clinical jargon.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Start or join a local ACEs initiative. Over 350 communities across the U.S. have formed ACE-aware coalitions. The ACEs Connection Network (<https://www.acesconnection.com>) provides toolkits for launching a community initiative.
- Organize a community screening of the documentary *Resilience: The Biology of Stress and the Science of Hope* (2016), followed by a discussion with local mental health professionals, educators, and policymakers.
- Partner with your local school district to advocate for trauma-informed discipline policies, expanded school counseling, and social-emotional learning programs.
- Work with faith communities to create trauma-aware congregations. Many religious organizations already provide de facto support for trauma-affected individuals; adding trauma awareness training makes these efforts more effective.
- Advocate with local law enforcement for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training. Contact CIT International (<https://www.citinternational.org>) for resources on how to approach your local police department.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect pediatricians, teachers, social workers, law enforcement, faith leaders, and parents in a cross-sector trauma-informed coalition. The most effective TIC initiatives operate across systems.
- Invite local elected officials to visit trauma-informed schools, courts, or healthcare settings to see the approach in action. Experiential learning is more persuasive than policy briefs.
- Partner with local business leaders to articulate the economic case for TIC: workforce productivity losses from untreated trauma cost employers approximately $212 billion annually (CDC, 2022).

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During federal budget deliberations (February-September), to advocate for SAMHSA, HRSA, NCTSN, and CDC behavioral health funding
- When mental health legislation is introduced or pending in committee
- When your state legislature is considering TIC-related bills (26 states have passed some form of TIC legislation; check NCSL's tracker)
- After mass casualty events or community crises, when political attention to trauma and mental health is heightened
- During school board elections and meetings, to advocate for trauma-informed school policies

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Trauma-Informed Care Legislation and Funding

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge your support for trauma-informed care (TIC) policies and funding. Research from the CDC shows that 61% of American adults have experienced at least one adverse childhood experience (ACE), and the annual economic burden of untreated childhood trauma is $748 billion.

I urge you to:
1. Support the Trauma-Informed Care Act to establish national TIC standards and screening integration
2. Increase funding for SAMHSA ($9.5 billion in FY2024) and the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative ($82 million in FY2024), which are insufficient to meet demand
3. Support mental health parity enforcement to ensure insurance coverage of evidence-based trauma treatments

Evidence-based trauma treatments like Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure have recovery rates of 53-80% for PTSD, yet only 36.3% of adults with PTSD currently receive evidence-based treatment. This is a solvable problem that saves both lives and taxpayer money.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling to urge [Representative/Senator] [Last Name] to support increased funding for trauma-informed care programs, including SAMHSA and the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. Research shows that 61% of Americans have experienced childhood adversity, costing our economy $748 billion annually. Evidence-based trauma treatments work, but we need investment in screening, workforce development, and community prevention. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Trauma-Informed Care Act (proposed)**: Establishes a national framework for TIC integration across public systems, authorizes trauma screening reimbursement, and creates a National Trauma Training Center. Contact your representative to co-sponsor this legislation.
- **RISE From Trauma Act (proposed)**: Comprehensive federal TIC legislation championed by CTIPP. Contact the Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee.
- **Mental Health Parity enforcement**: Urge your state insurance commissioner and federal representatives to enforce the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act for trauma treatment coverage.
- **Family First Prevention Services Act implementation**: Encourage your state child welfare agency to fully implement Title IV-E prevention services, including evidence-based trauma treatments for at-risk families.
- **MIECHV (home visiting) reauthorization and expansion**: Support expansion of the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program to serve all eligible families (currently serving approximately 140,000 of 3 million eligible).

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your position on funding trauma-informed care and evidence-based mental health treatment in our schools, healthcare system, and justice system?"
2. "Do you support expanding SAMHSA funding and the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative to address the $748 billion annual cost of childhood adversity?"
3. "How would you address the mental health workforce shortage, given that nearly half of U.S. counties lack a single psychologist?"
4. "Do you support enforcing mental health parity laws to ensure insurance coverage of evidence-based trauma treatments?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who support behavioral health funding, mental health parity enforcement, and school mental health investment
- Key congressional committees: Senate HELP Committee, House Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Appropriations subcommittees for Labor-HHS-Education
- At the state level, education committees and health committees are the primary venues for TIC legislation

## Professional Actions

- **For Healthcare Providers**: Integrate validated trauma screening (ACE questionnaire, PC-PTSD-5) into your practice. Pursue training in evidence-based trauma treatments through NCTSN, the VA's training partnerships, or professional associations. The EMDR International Association (<https://www.emdria.org>) and the Center for Deployment Psychology (<https://deploymentpsych.org>) offer accessible training programs.
- **For Educators**: Advocate within your school or district for trauma-informed discipline policies, social-emotional learning integration, and expanded school mental health staffing. Complete trauma awareness training through your state's trauma-informed schools initiative or NCTSN resources.
- **For Law Enforcement**: Advocate for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training in your department. Support co-responder models that pair officers with mental health professionals for crisis calls.
- **For Social Workers and Counselors**: Seek training in evidence-based trauma treatments and advocate for manageable caseloads that allow therapeutic relationship-building. Use the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale to monitor your own secondary traumatic stress.
- **For Attorneys and Judges**: Advocate for trauma-informed court practices, including trauma screening at intake, therapeutic jurisprudence approaches, and trauma-specific programming in correctional settings. The National Drug Court Institute provides training resources.
- **For Researchers**: Prioritize research on TIC implementation fidelity measurement, cultural adaptation of evidence-based treatments, expanded ACE frameworks, and cost-effectiveness of trauma-informed system transformation.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing trauma-informed care with others, emphasize:

1. **The scale of the problem**: 61% of U.S. adults report at least one ACE, and 16% report four or more. This is not a niche issue -- it is a foundational public health challenge affecting the majority of Americans (CDC BRFSS, 2021).
2. **The cost of inaction**: Untreated childhood trauma costs the U.S. economy $748 billion annually in healthcare, criminal justice, child welfare, and lost productivity (CDC, 2022). Investing in prevention and treatment is fiscal responsibility.
3. **Treatment works**: Evidence-based trauma therapies have recovery rates of 53-80% for PTSD (VA/DoD CPG, 2023). The problem is not that we lack effective treatments -- it is that only 36.3% of those who need them receive them (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023).
4. **Prevention is possible**: Programs like the Nurse-Family Partnership reduce child abuse and neglect by 48% and return $6.20 for every $1 invested (RAND, 2022). We can break cycles of adversity before they start.
5. **This is bipartisan**: Protecting children, strengthening families, reducing incarceration costs, and improving public safety are values shared across the political spectrum. Twenty-six states have already passed TIC-related legislation with bipartisan support (NCSL, 2023).

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Trauma-informed care means making excuses for bad behavior" | TIC contextualizes behavior to enable more effective responses; it does not eliminate accountability. Trauma-informed discipline in schools reduces suspensions 30-50% while improving academic outcomes. | Maynard et al., 2019 |
| "ACE screening labels people and does more harm than good" | California's ACEs Aware Initiative screened 2.5 million patients with no documented increase in adverse events; 93% of patients reported the screening was acceptable. | ACEs Aware Annual Report, 2023 |
| "We can't afford trauma-informed care" | We cannot afford *not* to. The annual cost of ACEs ($748 billion) dwarfs the investment in prevention and treatment. Every $1 invested in child trauma treatment produces an estimated $7-11 in avoided downstream costs. | CDC, 2022; NCTSN, 2022 |
| "Trauma is a personal issue, not a government concern" | Trauma drives utilization in every public system -- healthcare, education, criminal justice, child welfare. Failing to address it costs taxpayers hundreds of billions and undermines the effectiveness of public institutions. | CDC, 2022 |
| "Only certain populations experience trauma" | 61% of all U.S. adults have at least one ACE, spanning every demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic group. Disparities exist in exposure rates and access to care, but trauma is a universal American experience. | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
