# Trauma-Informed Care: Current State

## Prevalence of Trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences

The epidemiological burden of trauma in the United States is extensive and well-documented. The CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which added an ACE module adopted by 48 states as of 2023, provides the most comprehensive population-level data on childhood adversity.

### ACE Prevalence Among U.S. Adults

| ACE Category | Prevalence | Population Estimate | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| At least 1 ACE | 61% | ~155 million adults | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| 2 or more ACEs | 38% | ~96 million adults | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| 4 or more ACEs | 16% | ~40.5 million adults | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| 6 or more ACEs | 5.6% | ~14.2 million adults | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |

### ACE Types and Frequency

| ACE Type | Prevalence Among U.S. Adults | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Emotional abuse | 34.4% | Stable | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Parental separation/divorce | 27.6% | Stable | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Substance abuse in household | 26.3% | Slight increase | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Physical abuse | 17.9% | Declining | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Household mental illness | 17.3% | Increasing | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Sexual abuse | 11.6% | Stable | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Domestic violence witnessed | 11.5% | Stable | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Incarcerated household member | 7.9% | Increasing | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |

### Disparities in ACE Exposure

ACE exposure is not evenly distributed across the population. Structural inequities produce significant disparities in who experiences childhood adversity and who has access to healing resources.

| Population | 4+ ACEs Prevalence | Comparison to National Average (16%) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Black adults | 20.1% | 1.26x higher | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Hispanic/Latino adults | 18.3% | 1.14x higher | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| American Indian/Alaska Native adults | 26.8% | 1.68x higher | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Multiracial adults | 28.3% | 1.77x higher | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| LGBTQ+ youth | 34.5% (3+ ACEs) | 2.1x higher than peers | Trevor Project, 2022 |
| Adults below poverty line | 27.3% | 1.71x higher | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Adults without high school diploma | 23.2% | 1.45x higher | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |
| Rural residents | 19.4% | 1.21x higher | CDC BRFSS, 2021 |

## Health Consequences of Trauma

### ACE-Associated Health Outcomes

The dose-response relationship between ACEs and poor health outcomes is among the most replicated findings in public health research. Each additional ACE incrementally increases risk across multiple disease categories.

| Health Outcome | Risk Increase (4+ ACEs vs. 0 ACEs) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Depression | 4.6x | Felitti et al., 1998; Hughes et al., 2017 |
| Suicide attempt | 12.2x | Felitti et al., 1998 |
| Alcoholism | 7.4x | Felitti et al., 1998 |
| Illicit drug use | 4.7x | Felitti et al., 1998 |
| Ischemic heart disease | 2.2x | Felitti et al., 1998 |
| Cancer | 1.9x | Felitti et al., 1998; Brown et al., 2013 |
| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | 3.9x | Felitti et al., 1998 |
| Smoking (current) | 2.2x | CDC, 2021 |
| Obesity | 1.6x | CDC, 2021 |
| PTSD (lifetime) | 7.3x | Koenen et al., 2017 |

| Criminal justice costs linked to childhood trauma | $91 billion | NCTSN, 2022 |
| Special education costs linked to trauma | $42 billion | Blodgett & Lanigan, 2018 |
| Lifetime cost per child maltreatment victim | $830,928 | CDC, 2022 |

## Trauma-Informed Care Implementation by System

### Healthcare System

Healthcare represents the most advanced but still incomplete sector for TIC adoption. Integration varies widely by setting and specialty.

#### Screening Practices

| Setting | ACE/Trauma Screening Rate | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pediatric primary care | Fewer than 4% routinely screen | Slowly increasing | Pediatrics, 2020 |
| Adult primary care | ~8% report routine screening | Increasing | Annals of Internal Medicine, 2023 |
| Emergency departments | 12% have trauma screening protocols | Increasing | Academic Emergency Medicine, 2023 |
| Behavioral health intake | 67% include trauma assessment | Stable | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Obstetric care | 23% screen for ACEs/trauma | Increasing | ACOG practice bulletin adoption, 2023 |

#### Treatment Access

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Adults with PTSD who received evidence-based treatment in past year | 36.3% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |
| Average wait time for trauma therapy | 48 days | NAMI survey, 2023 |
| Counties without a single psychologist | 1,563 (nearly half of U.S. counties) | APA, 2023 |
| Therapists trained in CPT, PE, or EMDR | ~98,000 | Professional association registries, 2023 |
| Medicaid reimbursement for CPT/PE (avg per session) | $89.50 | CMS fee schedules, 2024 |
| Medicare reimbursement for CPT/PE (avg per session) | $112.30 | CMS fee schedules, 2024 |

### Education System

Schools represent a critical setting for trauma identification and intervention, given that children spend approximately 1,000 hours per year in school.

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Schools with trauma-informed framework | ~24% of districts report some TIC initiative | Increasing | Education Week survey, 2023 |
| School counselor-to-student ratio | 1:385 (recommended 1:250) | Slowly improving | ASCA, 2023 |
| School psychologist-to-student ratio | 1:1,127 (recommended 1:500) | Stable | NASP, 2023 |
| School social worker-to-student ratio | 1:2,106 (recommended 1:250) | Worsening | SSWAA, 2023 |
| States requiring trauma training for educators | 14 | Increasing | NCSL, 2023 |
| Schools using PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports) | ~27,000 schools | Increasing | PBIS.org, 2023 |
| Reduction in suspensions in TIC-adopting schools | 30-50% | Documented across studies | Maynard et al., 2019 |

### Justice System

The justice system both encounters and sometimes inflicts trauma. Trauma-informed justice practices remain in early stages of adoption.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Incarcerated individuals with significant trauma history | 85-95% | SAMHSA, 2014; Wolff & Shi, 2012 |

| Reductions in recidivism from trauma-informed programming | 15-25% | Kubiak et al., 2017; Miller & Najavits, 2012 |

### Child Welfare System

The child welfare system is perhaps the most trauma-proximate public institution, yet its own practices can compound the adversity children experience.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Children in foster care (FY2022) | 391,098 | HHS ACF, 2023 |
| Foster children with clinical-level trauma symptoms | 60-80% | National Child Traumatic Stress Network, 2023 |

| Placement changes (avg) before permanency | 3.2 moves | HHS ACF, 2023 |
| Child welfare caseworker turnover rate | 30-40% annually | Casey Family Programs, 2022 |

## SAMHSA Framework and Federal Activity

### SAMHSA Six Principles of Trauma-Informed Care

SAMHSA's 2014 framework provides the most widely adopted definition of TIC. The six principles are:

1. **Safety**: Physical and psychological safety for staff and clients
2. **Trustworthiness and Transparency**: Operations conducted with transparency to build trust
3. **Peer Support**: Recognition of the healing value of shared experience
4. **Collaboration and Mutuality**: Leveling power differences between staff and clients
5. **Empowerment, Voice, and Choice**: Prioritizing individual agency and self-determination
6. **Cultural, Historical, and Gender Issues**: Incorporating cultural responsiveness and addressing historical trauma

## Recent Trends

### Developments in the Last 5-10 Years

- **Post-COVID trauma surge**: The COVID-19 pandemic produced a documented increase in trauma exposure, with childhood abuse reports increasing 8.5% and youth mental health emergency department visits increasing 31% between 2019 and 2023 (CDC, 2023)
- **ACEs science expansion**: Researchers have expanded beyond the original 10 ACEs to include community-level adversity (racism, poverty, neighborhood violence), sometimes called "expanded ACEs" or "PCEs" (positive childhood experiences)
- **Telehealth expansion**: Virtual delivery of CPT, PE, and EMDR demonstrated comparable efficacy to in-person delivery, expanding access in underserved areas (Morland et al., 2020)
- **International Classification of Diseases recognition**: ICD-11 (2022) introduced Complex PTSD as a formal diagnosis, recognizing trauma responses that extend beyond traditional PTSD
- **Bipartisan legislative interest**: TIC legislation has passed in both red and blue states, with 26 states enacting some form of TIC-related law by 2023

## Emerging Challenges

- **Implementation fidelity**: Many organizations claim to be "trauma-informed" without evidence of meaningful practice change or outcome improvement, creating a risk of TIC becoming a diluted buzzword
- **Secondary traumatic stress**: Frontline workers in trauma-proximate fields (child welfare, emergency response, education) experience high rates of burnout and secondary trauma, with turnover rates of 30-40% in child welfare (Casey Family Programs, 2022)
- **Workforce pipeline**: The mental health workforce is not growing fast enough to meet demand, with projected shortages of 31,091 psychologists and 12,040 psychiatrists by 2030 (HRSA, 2022)
- **Cultural adaptation**: Evidence-based treatments were predominantly developed and validated with white, English-speaking populations, raising questions about cultural appropriateness for diverse communities
- **Measurement challenges**: No consensus exists on how to measure whether an organization has truly become "trauma-informed" versus merely adopting the language
