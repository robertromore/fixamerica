# Inpatient Psychiatric Care: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Rebuilding America's inpatient psychiatric care infrastructure requires a sequenced, three-phase strategy that begins with executive and regulatory actions that can be taken without new legislation, progresses to major legislative reforms, and culminates in a decade-long transformation of the psychiatric care landscape. Each phase builds on the preceding one: Phase 1 establishes the financial and informational foundations; Phase 2 enacts the structural reforms and begins construction; Phase 3 completes the buildout and achieves target capacity.

The strategy is grounded in a recognition that the psychiatric bed crisis is fundamentally a financing crisis. The IMD exclusion distorts the entire market for psychiatric inpatient care, and no amount of incremental investment will overcome its effects. Therefore, the roadmap prioritizes removing the IMD exclusion as the central legislative action, while simultaneously building the workforce, crisis stabilization infrastructure, and data systems needed to ensure that new capacity is used effectively.

The theory of change assumes that removing financial barriers will enable organic market growth in psychiatric beds (as occurred with general hospital beds after the Hill-Burton Act), while targeted federal investments address areas where the market alone will not produce adequate capacity -- particularly state psychiatric hospitals, rural and underserved communities, and the psychiatric workforce pipeline.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Expand IMD waiver access to all 50 states as a bridge to full repeal
- Launch national psychiatric bed registry development and pilot deployment
- Issue strengthened MHPAEA enforcement guidance for inpatient psychiatric care
- Begin first round of crisis stabilization unit grants
- Initiate psychiatric workforce pipeline programs

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Expand Section 1115 IMD waivers to all states; increase stay limit from 30 to 60 days | CMS | Months 1-6 | Existing CMS waiver authority; estimated $2-3 billion/year in new federal Medicaid spending | All 50 states with active IMD waivers by Month 12 |
| Issue joint CMS/DOL enforcement guidance strengthening MHPAEA for inpatient care | CMS, Department of Labor | Months 3-9 | Existing regulatory authority | Guidance published by Month 9 |
| Fund national psychiatric bed registry development; select 5 pilot states | SAMHSA | Months 1-12 | $50 million initial appropriation | Registry operational in 5 pilot states by Month 18 |
| Award first round of crisis stabilization unit (CSU) construction grants | SAMHSA | Months 6-18 | $300 million (Year 1 of $1.5 billion 5-year program) | 50 CSU grants awarded by Month 18 |
| Fund 200 new psychiatric residency positions through Medicare GME expansion | CMS/HRSA | Months 6-18 | $200 million/year | 200 new residency slots filled by Year 2 |
| Launch psychiatric workforce loan repayment program (first cohort of 500 providers) | HRSA | Months 6-12 | $50 million/year | 500 providers enrolled by Month 12 |
| Establish interagency task force on psychiatric bed capacity (HHS, DOJ, VA, HUD) | White House | Month 1 | Executive order; no new appropriation | Task force operational by Month 3 |

### Legislative Requirements

- Appropriations bill or continuing resolution including $600 million for CSU grants, bed registry development, and workforce programs (Year 1)
- Medicare GME expansion legislation authorizing 200 additional psychiatric residency positions
- No new legislation required for IMD waiver expansion or MHPAEA enforcement guidance (executive authority)

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, all 50 states should have active IMD waivers enabling Medicaid reimbursement for short-term stays in psychiatric facilities of any size. The national bed registry should be operational in 5 pilot states, demonstrating reduced ED boarding times. The first 50 crisis stabilization units should be under construction or operational, and 200 new psychiatric residency positions should be filled. MHPAEA enforcement guidance should be producing measurable increases in authorized psychiatric inpatient stays by commercial insurers.

---

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Enact full IMD exclusion repeal through legislation
- Launch Federal Psychiatric Infrastructure Investment Program
- Deploy national bed registry to all 50 states
- Achieve 500+ operational crisis stabilization units
- Fund 1,000 total new psychiatric residency positions
- Begin state psychiatric hospital modernization program

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Enact IMD exclusion repeal legislation | Congress | Year 3 | CBO-estimated $10-15 billion/year in new Medicaid spending | Legislation signed by end of Year 3 |
| Launch Federal Psychiatric Infrastructure Investment Program (first construction grants) | SAMHSA/HRSA | Year 3-4 | $1 billion/year for 5 years ($5 billion total) | First 100 construction grants awarded by Year 4 |
| Deploy national bed registry to all 50 states | SAMHSA | Year 3 | $15-20 million/year for operations | Registry operational in all 50 states by end of Year 3 |
| Award remaining CSU grants (total 500+) | SAMHSA | Years 3-5 | $300 million/year (Years 3-5) | 500 CSUs operational by Year 5 |
| Fund cumulative 1,000 new psychiatric residency positions | CMS/HRSA | Years 3-5 | $500 million/year | 1,000 total new residency positions filled |
| Begin state psychiatric hospital modernization grants | SAMHSA | Year 4 | $300 million/year ($3 billion over 10 years) | First 20 modernization projects funded by Year 5 |
| Establish national inpatient psychiatric quality reporting program | CMS | Year 3-4 | $25 million for development; existing CMS quality infrastructure | Quality measures publicly reported by Year 4 |

### Legislative Requirements

- IMD exclusion repeal bill (amending 42 U.S.C. 1396d to remove the IMD exclusion)
- Federal Psychiatric Infrastructure Investment Act authorizing $5 billion over 5 years
- State Psychiatric Hospital Modernization Act authorizing $3 billion over 10 years (65% federal / 35% state match)
- Psychiatric Workforce Development Act expanding Medicare GME to 1,000 positions and authorizing $2.5 billion for workforce programs

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, the IMD exclusion should be fully repealed, removing the central financial distortion from the psychiatric care market. The first new psychiatric facilities funded through the Infrastructure Investment Program should be under construction or completed. The national bed registry should be reducing ED boarding times in all 50 states. At least 500 crisis stabilization units should be operational, diverting an estimated 300,000+ annual ED presentations. The psychiatric workforce pipeline should be expanding with 1,000 new residency positions and thousands of providers in loan repayment programs. National psychiatric bed capacity should be increasing toward 20 beds per 100,000 population (from 11.7 in 2024).

---

## Phase 3: System Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Achieve minimum 30 psychiatric beds per 100,000 population nationally
- Complete state psychiatric hospital modernization program
- Eliminate psychiatric ED boarding exceeding 2 hours
- Reduce 30-day readmission rate from 19.3% to below 12%
- Achieve psychiatric workforce density sufficient to staff all available beds

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Continue infrastructure investment grants (remaining $2 billion) | SAMHSA/HRSA | Years 6-8 | $1 billion/year (Years 6-7) | Cumulative 300+ facility grants awarded |
| Complete state psychiatric hospital modernization (remaining projects) | SAMHSA/States | Years 6-10 | $300 million/year federal + state match | All priority facilities modernized by Year 10 |
| Expand crisis stabilization network to 1,000+ CSUs | SAMHSA | Years 6-10 | Ongoing Medicaid reimbursement | 1,000 CSUs operational by Year 10 |
| Conduct comprehensive 5-year evaluation of IMD repeal impact | GAO/CMS | Year 8 | $10 million evaluation contract | Evaluation report published by Year 8 |
| Achieve target workforce density: 20+ psychiatrists per 100,000 | HRSA | Year 10 | Ongoing workforce programs | Measurable increase in psychiatrist density |
| Implement value-based payment models for psychiatric inpatient care | CMS | Years 8-10 | $50 million for model development | Value-based models operational by Year 10 |

### Expected Outcomes

By Year 10, the United States should have a functional, adequately funded inpatient psychiatric care system with at least 30 beds per 100,000 population (approaching the 40-60 range recommended by the Treatment Advocacy Center). Emergency department psychiatric boarding should be eliminated as a systemic problem, with no patient waiting more than 2 hours for placement. The 30-day readmission rate should be below 12%, reflecting adequate lengths of stay and effective discharge planning. The psychiatric workforce should be sufficient to staff available beds without chronic vacancies. State psychiatric hospitals should be modernized, safe facilities meeting current accreditation standards.

## Governance and Oversight

Implementation governance requires clear accountability across federal agencies and levels of government:

- **Interagency Task Force**: The White House-led interagency task force (established in Phase 1) provides overall coordination, with quarterly progress reports to the President and Congress. Members include HHS (lead), DOJ, VA, HUD, DOL, and OMB.
- **SAMHSA**: Lead agency for infrastructure grants, CSU grants, bed registry operations, and state technical assistance. Annual reports to Congress on bed capacity, CSU operations, and grant outcomes.
- **CMS**: Lead agency for Medicaid implementation (IMD repeal), quality reporting, parity enforcement, and value-based payment models. Quarterly data releases on psychiatric utilization and spending.
- **HRSA**: Lead agency for workforce programs, loan repayment, and residency position tracking. Annual workforce reports to Congress.
- **GAO**: Independent 5-year comprehensive evaluation (Year 8) and annual performance audits of major programs.
- **State Mental Health Authorities**: State-level coordination of bed expansion, facility modernization, and crisis system deployment. Annual reporting to SAMHSA as condition of federal funding.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Congressional Failure to Enact IMD Repeal

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High -- without IMD repeal, the central financial barrier remains, and capacity expansion depends entirely on state and private investment.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Phase 1 executive actions (IMD waiver expansion, MHPAEA enforcement) provide partial relief without legislation. Build bipartisan support through CBO scoring that includes offsets (reduced ED boarding, reduced incarceration costs). Frame IMD repeal as completing the work of the 21st Century Cures Act.

**Contingency Plan**: If full repeal fails, pursue incremental legislation: extend waiver stay limits to 90 days, create permanent IMD waiver authority (eliminating need for individual state applications), and expand the existing exception for patients under age 21 and over age 65.

### Risk 2: Workforce Shortages Limiting Capacity Expansion

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High -- new beds without staff to operate them provide no benefit.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Begin workforce pipeline investments in Phase 1 (before major construction begins). Use multiple pathways simultaneously: residency expansion, loan repayment, international recruitment, scope of practice expansion. Target 4-year lead time between workforce investment and facility completion.

**Contingency Plan**: Implement emergency visa pathways for international psychiatrists. Deploy telepsychiatry to extend specialist coverage to new facilities during staffing ramp-up. Expand psychiatric nurse practitioner and physician assistant scope of practice to reduce reliance on psychiatrists.

### Risk 3: NIMBY Opposition to Facility Siting

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: Medium -- delays or prevents construction in specific locations, not the program overall.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Require community engagement as a condition of federal grants. Provide technical assistance to grantees on community relations. Offer additional federal funding to communities that host facilities (similar to payments in lieu of taxes). Design facilities to modern architectural standards that integrate with surrounding communities.

**Contingency Plan**: Include federal preemption of local zoning restrictions for federally funded psychiatric facilities, modeled on the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA). Identify alternative sites on federal or state-owned land.

### Risk 4: Cost Overruns on Construction Projects

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium -- reduces the number of facilities that can be built within the authorized budget.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Require cost estimates and contingency budgets in all grant applications. Establish construction cost benchmarks based on recent comparable projects. Use design-build contracting to control costs. Require 10% contingency reserves.

**Contingency Plan**: Redirect funding from higher-cost projects to lower-cost renovation and expansion projects. Prioritize bed additions to existing facilities over new construction when cost-effective.

### Risk 5: Quality Failures in Expanded System

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High -- patient harm or institutional abuse would undermine public support and validate opposition arguments.

**Mitigation Strategy**: Establish national quality standards as a condition of all federal funding (Phase 1). Require Joint Commission or equivalent accreditation. Implement public reporting of quality measures. Create independent inspection and enforcement mechanisms. Mandate trauma-informed care training for all staff.

**Contingency Plan**: Immediate suspension of federal funding for facilities that fail quality inspections. Emergency transfer protocols for patients in substandard facilities. Public reporting of violations.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Annual Federal Cost | Funding Source | Notes |
|-------|-------------------------------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Years 1-2) | $3.5-4.5 billion/year | Appropriations (CSU grants, workforce, bed registry); existing CMS authority (IMD waivers) | IMD waiver costs: $2-3B; new programs: $1.5B |
| Phase 2 (Years 3-5) | $12-17 billion/year | IMD repeal ($10-15B); infrastructure grants ($1B); modernization ($300M); workforce ($500M) | IMD repeal is the largest cost |
| Phase 3 (Years 6-10) | $12-16 billion/year | Ongoing IMD coverage ($10-15B); remaining construction ($500M-1B); modernization ($300M) | Costs stabilize as one-time investments complete |
| **Total (10 years)** | **$110-150 billion** | | **Includes $100-150B for ongoing IMD Medicaid coverage** |

The 10-year total is dominated by the ongoing Medicaid cost of IMD repeal ($10-15 billion annually). However, CBO projections do not currently include offsets from reduced emergency department boarding (estimated at $4-8 billion annually), reduced incarceration of individuals with serious mental illness (estimated $5-10 billion annually in state and local corrections costs), and reduced homelessness service costs. When these offsets are considered, the net federal cost is substantially lower.

### Personnel

- **Federal**: Approximately 200-300 new FTEs across SAMHSA, CMS, and HRSA for program administration, grant management, quality oversight, and bed registry operations
- **State**: Each state mental health authority will need 5-15 additional staff for grant management, facility licensing, bed registry coordination, and quality monitoring (total: 250-750 state FTEs)
- **Clinical workforce**: Target net addition of 5,000+ psychiatrists, 10,000+ psychiatric nurses, and 15,000+ other psychiatric professionals over 10 years to staff expanded capacity

### Infrastructure

- **National Bed Registry**: Cloud-based technology platform with real-time data feeds from all psychiatric facilities. Estimated $50 million development cost plus $15-20 million annual operations.
- **Construction**: An estimated 300-500 facility construction or major renovation projects over 10 years, including new psychiatric hospitals, hospital unit expansions, and crisis stabilization units.
- **State hospital modernization**: An estimated 50-100 state psychiatric hospital renovation projects, many involving replacement of buildings dating to the mid-20th century.
