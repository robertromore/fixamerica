# Inpatient Psychiatric Care: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current challenges in inpatient psychiatric care are not the result of a single failure but of several long-term, interlocking structural problems. These include a federal reimbursement policy that actively discourages investment in psychiatric beds, a fragmented financing system that separates responsibility from authority, a workforce pipeline that cannot supply enough clinicians, and a political dynamic that has consistently favored cutting institutional capacity without building adequate alternatives. Together, these factors create a self-reinforcing crisis in which inadequate capacity produces poor outcomes, poor outcomes discourage further investment, and the cycle deepens.

## Financial and Regulatory Barriers

### The IMD Exclusion: The Central Distortion

The Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(B)) is the single most consequential policy driving the inpatient psychiatric bed shortage. By barring federal Medicaid reimbursement for adults ages 21-64 in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds, it removes the largest payer of mental health services from the inpatient psychiatric market.

**Evidence**: Medicaid covers approximately 21% of all adults with mental illness and a substantially higher share of those with serious mental illness (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023). In states that have not obtained IMD waivers, state psychiatric hospitals must be funded entirely through state general funds, with no federal match. This creates an enormous fiscal disadvantage compared to medical/surgical care, where states receive a 50-76% federal match for Medicaid patients (depending on state FMAP rates). The result is predictable: states invest in services that draw federal matching funds and disinvest from services that do not.

### Insurance Reimbursement Disparities

Even outside the IMD exclusion, psychiatric inpatient care is systematically underpaid relative to medical/surgical inpatient care.

**Evidence**: A 2023 Milliman study found that behavioral health reimbursement rates averaged 20-40% lower than comparable medical/surgical rates across commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid payers. Psychiatric per-diem rates in many states fall below the cost of care, resulting in operating margins of -5% to -15% for psychiatric units (Milliman, 2023). General hospitals cite financial losses as the primary reason for closing psychiatric units: between 2010 and 2023, more than 170 general hospital psychiatric units closed nationally (AHA, 2023).

### Fragmented Financing

The financing of inpatient psychiatric care is split across multiple payers and levels of government with misaligned incentives:

- **State governments** fund state psychiatric hospitals with state general funds (no federal Medicaid match due to IMD exclusion)
- **Medicaid** pays for psychiatric care in general hospital units (under 16 beds) and for non-IMD facilities, but not in dedicated psychiatric hospitals for adults 21-64
- **Medicare** pays for inpatient psychiatric care for beneficiaries over 65 with a 190-day lifetime limit
- **Commercial insurers** cover acute inpatient stays but typically authorize only 3-7 days
- **Uncompensated care** accounts for a disproportionate share of psychiatric admissions, as many patients with serious mental illness are uninsured

**Evidence**: This fragmentation means no single entity has both the financial incentive and the authority to ensure adequate bed capacity. States want to shift costs to Medicaid; the federal government refuses due to the IMD exclusion; private insurers minimize authorization; and patients fall through the gaps.

## Structural and Institutional Factors

### Workforce Shortage

The psychiatric workforce is the binding constraint on bed expansion. Even if physical beds were built and funded, staffing them is increasingly difficult.

**Evidence**:

- 60% of all U.S. counties have no psychiatrist (HRSA, 2023)
- The average practicing psychiatrist is 55 years old, with large cohorts approaching retirement (AAMC, 2023)
- Psychiatric nursing vacancy rates exceed 20% nationally (ANA, 2023)
- Psychiatric technician turnover exceeds 30% annually (BLS, 2023)
- Psychiatric residency positions have grown only modestly (approximately 7% since 2015) while demand has surged (AAMC, 2023)

The workforce shortage is driven by multiple factors: lower compensation than other medical specialties, high rates of burnout and workplace violence, stigma associated with psychiatric practice, insufficient residency training slots, and immigration barriers for international medical graduates who could fill psychiatry positions.

### Certificate of Need and Regulatory Barriers

In 35 states that maintain Certificate of Need (CON) laws, new psychiatric facilities or bed expansions require state approval, a process that can take 12-24 months and is subject to challenge by competing facilities. CON laws were originally intended to control healthcare costs but often function as barriers to entry.

**Evidence**: States with CON requirements for psychiatric beds have, on average, 15% fewer psychiatric beds per capita than states without such requirements, after controlling for population and income (Mercatus Center, 2022). Incumbent facilities use the CON process to block new competitors, reducing supply even when demand is clearly unmet.

### Physical Infrastructure Deficit

Many existing psychiatric facilities are decades old and do not meet modern standards. State psychiatric hospitals, in particular, were largely built in the mid-20th century and require substantial renovation or replacement.

**Evidence**: A 2023 NASMHPD survey found that the average age of state psychiatric hospital buildings was 47 years, with many predating modern fire codes, accessibility standards, and trauma-informed design principles. The estimated capital investment needed to bring existing state psychiatric infrastructure to modern standards exceeds $10 billion nationally (NASMHPD, 2023).

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| State budget offices | Avoiding cost of funding adequate state hospital capacity | Billions in avoided state spending annually | Repealing IMD exclusion could increase state Medicaid matching obligations; status quo keeps costs off budget |
| CMS/federal government | Avoiding open-ended Medicaid liability for psychiatric inpatient care | Estimated $10-15 billion/year in avoided federal spending if IMD exclusion were repealed | Fear that full repeal would create fiscal exposure without quality safeguards |
| General hospitals without psych units | No obligation to treat psychiatric patients they refer elsewhere | Avoided operating losses from psych units | Would face competitive pressure if psychiatric capacity expanded |
| Private insurers | Low inpatient authorization rates reduce claims costs | Billions in reduced behavioral health claims annually | Expanded capacity could increase utilization and costs |
| For-profit psychiatric hospital chains | Limited competition due to CON laws and workforce scarcity | Higher occupancy rates and revenue per bed | May publicly support expansion while privately preferring constrained supply |

### Perverse Incentives

The current system creates several destructive incentive misalignments:

1. **States benefit from closing beds**: The IMD exclusion means states save money by closing state hospital beds and forcing patients into emergency departments (where EMTALA guarantees treatment and Medicaid/Medicare pays).
2. **Hospitals benefit from short stays**: Low reimbursement rates incentivize hospitals to discharge patients as quickly as possible, contributing to high readmission rates (19.3% within 30 days).
3. **Insurers benefit from denied authorizations**: Managed care organizations profit by limiting inpatient authorizations, often to 3-7 days even when clinical need exceeds that duration.
4. **No one is accountable for outcomes**: The fragmented system means no single entity is responsible for ensuring patients receive adequate care across the continuum.

## Cultural and Behavioral Factors

### Stigma Against Psychiatric Facilities

Public resistance to psychiatric facilities in local communities (a "Not In My Backyard" or NIMBY dynamic) creates siting challenges for new or expanded facilities.

**Evidence**: Studies of psychiatric facility proposals show that community opposition based on safety fears occurs in approximately 40% of proposed projects, despite evidence that psychiatric facilities do not increase local crime rates (Psychiatric Services, 2021). Zoning challenges can add 6-18 months and significant legal costs to facility development.

### Pervasive Mental Health Stigma

Broader societal stigma against mental illness contributes to political willingness to underfund psychiatric care.

**Evidence**: Public opinion surveys consistently find that while approximately 90% of Americans say mental health is a priority, willingness to fund inpatient psychiatric care through taxation ranks lower than willingness to fund cancer treatment, emergency medical care, and substance abuse services (Pew Research, 2023). This creates a "say-do" gap in which elected officials can express concern about mental health without facing political consequences for underfunding inpatient care.

## Why Reform Has Failed

Reform efforts have been incremental, partial, and repeatedly undermined by the same structural dynamics they seek to address:

1. **The 1963 Community Mental Health Act** envisioned community centers replacing state hospitals, but the centers were never fully funded, leaving a gap that has persisted for 60 years.
2. **The 2008 Parity Act** required equal insurance coverage for mental health but did not address the supply-side shortage of beds and providers.
3. **The 21st Century Cures Act (2016)** created IMD waivers but limited them to 30-day stays and imposed community service matching requirements that many states find burdensome.
4. **State-level reforms** have been piecemeal, with individual states adding beds or crisis services without addressing the underlying federal financing structure.
5. **Political dynamics** consistently favor visible, low-cost interventions (crisis hotlines, anti-stigma campaigns) over the expensive, long-term infrastructure investment needed to expand inpatient capacity.

The fundamental reason reform has failed is that the actors with the most power to change the system (Congress, CMS, state legislatures) also have the strongest financial incentives to maintain the status quo. Repealing the IMD exclusion would cost the federal government an estimated $10-15 billion annually in new Medicaid spending, while rebuilding state hospital systems would cost states billions in capital and operating expenditures. Without political pressure sufficient to overcome these fiscal barriers, incremental half-measures remain the norm.
