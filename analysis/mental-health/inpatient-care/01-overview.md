# Inpatient Psychiatric Care: Overview

## Overview

Inpatient psychiatric care represents the most intensive level of treatment in the mental health system, providing 24-hour supervised care for individuals experiencing acute psychiatric crises, severe mental illness, or imminent danger to themselves or others. In the United States, this care is delivered through a patchwork of state psychiatric hospitals, private psychiatric facilities, general hospital psychiatric units, and crisis stabilization units. The system serves patients with conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression with suicidal ideation, acute psychosis, and substance use disorders requiring medical detoxification.

The United States is experiencing a severe psychiatric bed shortage that has been decades in the making. From a peak of approximately 559,000 state psychiatric hospital beds in 1955 (roughly 340 per 100,000 population), the nation has fallen to approximately 37,679 total psychiatric beds across all facility types by 2024, or roughly 11.7 per 100,000 population (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2024). This represents a decline of more than 95% on a per-capita basis. The shortage manifests most visibly in emergency department boarding, where psychiatric patients wait an average of 8 hours nationally for inpatient placement, with some waiting days (American College of Emergency Physicians, 2023). An estimated 1 in 5 emergency department visits involving a psychiatric complaint results in a boarding episode exceeding 6 hours.

The crisis is compounded by the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, a provision of the Social Security Act of 1965 that bars federal Medicaid reimbursement for care provided to adults ages 21-64 in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds. This policy, originally intended to prevent states from shifting costs to the federal government, has become the single most significant financial barrier to psychiatric bed expansion. Because Medicaid covers approximately 21% of all adults with mental illness and an even higher share of those with serious mental illness, the IMD exclusion effectively removes the largest payer from the inpatient psychiatric market (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023).

The consequences of inadequate inpatient capacity extend far beyond the healthcare system. An estimated 44% of individuals in jails and 37% of those in state prisons have a diagnosed mental health condition (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023). People with untreated severe mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed in encounters with law enforcement than the general population (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). The economic costs are staggering: avoidable psychiatric emergency department visits, incarceration costs, homelessness services, and lost productivity associated with untreated serious mental illness are estimated to cost the U.S. economy over $280 billion annually (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2023).

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of inpatient psychiatric care:

- **Psychiatric Bed Capacity**: Total bed counts by facility type (state hospitals, private psychiatric hospitals, general hospital units, VA facilities), per-capita rates, and geographic distribution
- **The IMD Exclusion**: History, mechanics, impact on bed supply, waiver programs, and reform proposals for the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases exclusion
- **Emergency Department Boarding**: Wait times, patient outcomes during boarding, hospital financial impacts, and strategies to reduce psychiatric boarding
- **Involuntary Commitment**: 72-hour hold procedures, state variation in civil commitment laws, due process protections, and outcomes of involuntary treatment
- **Readmission and Length of Stay**: Average length of stay trends, 30-day readmission rates, discharge planning, and continuity of care
- **Facility Types and Quality**: State psychiatric hospitals, private facilities, crisis stabilization units, bed registries, and accreditation standards

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total psychiatric beds (all types) | 37,679 beds (2024) | Treatment Advocacy Center, 2024 |
| Psychiatric beds per 100,000 population | 11.7 per 100,000 (2024) | Treatment Advocacy Center, 2024 |
| Peak state hospital beds (1955) | ~559,000 beds (340 per 100,000) | SAMHSA, Historical Data |
| Average ED wait for psychiatric placement | 8 hours nationally | ACEP, 2023 |
| Medicaid share of adults with mental illness | 21% of all adults with mental illness | Kaiser Family Foundation, 2023 |
| Average inpatient psychiatric length of stay | 7.2 days (general hospitals, 2023) | HCUP/AHRQ, 2023 |
| 30-day psychiatric readmission rate | 19.3% (all-payer, 2023) | CMS Hospital Compare, 2023 |

| Jail/prison population with mental health condition | 44% of jail inmates; 37% of state prisoners | Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023 |
| Estimated annual economic cost of untreated SMI | Over $280 billion | NAMI, 2023 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Liberty vs. Safety**: Involuntary commitment laws must balance protecting individuals' civil liberties and autonomy against the need to provide treatment for those who are gravely disabled or dangerous, a tension with no easy resolution
- **Community-Based vs. Institutional Care**: Advocates disagree on whether resources should prioritize expanding inpatient beds or strengthening community services that could prevent the need for hospitalization, though the evidence suggests both are needed simultaneously
- **Federal vs. State Responsibility**: The IMD exclusion reflects a long-standing tension over whether inpatient psychiatric care is primarily a state or federal obligation, with states arguing the exclusion unfairly shifts costs and the federal government wary of open-ended fiscal liability
- **Access vs. Cost Containment**: Expanding psychiatric bed capacity requires substantial capital investment and ongoing operating costs, creating tension with fiscal constraints and the pressure to reduce healthcare spending overall
- **Acute Stabilization vs. Adequate Treatment**: The trend toward shorter lengths of stay (averaging 7.2 days in general hospitals) may reduce costs per admission but can lead to premature discharge and higher readmission rates of 19.3% within 30 days
- **Voluntary vs. Involuntary Treatment**: The mental health system must navigate between respecting patient choice and ensuring that individuals too impaired to make informed decisions receive necessary care

## Key Questions

1. Should the IMD exclusion be fully repealed, modified through expanded waivers, or maintained with enhanced community alternatives to compensate for its effects?
2. What is the minimum per-capita psychiatric bed capacity needed to eliminate emergency department boarding and ensure timely access to acute care?
3. How can involuntary commitment laws be reformed to protect both patient rights and public safety while ensuring adequate due process?
4. What combination of inpatient, crisis stabilization, and community-based services would produce the best outcomes for individuals with serious mental illness at sustainable cost?

## Vision of Success

A successful inpatient psychiatric care system in the 21st century would feature:

- **Adequate Capacity**: A minimum of 40-60 psychiatric beds per 100,000 population (consistent with recommendations from the Treatment Advocacy Center and comparable to peer nations), with no patient waiting more than 2 hours in an emergency department for psychiatric placement
- **Seamless Care Continuum**: A fully integrated system linking crisis services, inpatient stabilization, step-down residential care, and outpatient follow-up, with no patient discharged to homelessness or without a follow-up appointment scheduled within 7 days
- **Financial Sustainability**: Full Medicaid reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care on par with medical/surgical care, eliminating the IMD exclusion's distortions and enabling private and public investment in psychiatric bed capacity
- **Quality and Accountability**: National standards for inpatient psychiatric care quality, including maximum readmission rate targets, minimum staffing ratios, trauma-informed care requirements, and public reporting of outcomes data
