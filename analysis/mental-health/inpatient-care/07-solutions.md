# Inpatient Psychiatric Care: Solutions

Rebuilding America's inpatient psychiatric care system requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to eliminate the financial distortions that created the bed shortage, expand capacity through both public and private investment, build the psychiatric workforce, create alternatives to emergency department boarding, and establish quality standards that prevent a return to institutional neglect.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Address the root financial cause (IMD exclusion) rather than layering incremental patches over a broken financing structure
- Expand inpatient capacity and community services simultaneously, rejecting the false choice between institutional and community-based care
- Build psychiatric bed capacity to a minimum of 40-60 beds per 100,000 population, consistent with Treatment Advocacy Center recommendations and international benchmarks
- Include strong patient rights protections, quality standards, and civil rights safeguards in all capacity expansion legislation
- Invest in the psychiatric workforce as a necessary precondition for any facility expansion

### Theory of Change

The current bed shortage is primarily a product of financial incentive structures, not clinical evidence or patient preference. By restructuring Medicaid reimbursement to treat psychiatric inpatient care on par with medical/surgical inpatient care, establishing federal capital investment programs, and building the workforce to staff new capacity, the reform framework removes the barriers that have prevented organic growth. At the same time, pairing bed expansion with community service investment creates a complete continuum of care that reduces demand for inpatient beds over time while ensuring beds are available when needed.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Repeal the IMD Exclusion

**Description**: Fully repeal the Institutions for Mental Diseases exclusion from the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(B)), allowing federal Medicaid reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care in facilities of any size for adults ages 21-64. This is the single most impactful reform that could be enacted, as it removes the financial distortion at the center of the capacity crisis.

**Evidence Base**: The 12 states that have obtained Section 1115 IMD waivers for serious mental illness have reported reduced ED boarding times (averaging 23% reductions), increased bed availability, and improved discharge planning within the first two years of waiver implementation (CMS Waiver Evaluation Reports, 2023). The Congressional Research Service has documented the IMD exclusion's role in driving bed closures and ED boarding. International comparisons confirm that nations without comparable exclusions (every other OECD nation) maintain substantially higher per-capita bed rates.

**Implementation**: Congress would amend 42 U.S.C. 1396d to remove the IMD exclusion. CMS would issue implementing regulations within 12 months establishing reimbursement rates, quality standards, and reporting requirements for Medicaid-covered psychiatric inpatient stays.

**Cost/Resources**: CBO has estimated the cost of full IMD exclusion repeal at $10-15 billion annually in new federal Medicaid spending. However, offsets from reduced ED boarding, reduced Medicaid-funded emergency department visits, and reduced incarceration costs would partially mitigate this figure.

**Timeline**: Legislative passage within 1-2 years; full implementation within 3 years.

**Challenges**: Significant fiscal cost; resistance from CBO and budget-conscious members of Congress; need for accompanying quality standards to prevent re-institutionalization.

**Impact Metrics**: Psychiatric beds per 100,000 population; average ED boarding time; 30-day readmission rates; total Medicaid psychiatric spending.

### Solution 2: Federal Psychiatric Infrastructure Investment Program

**Description**: Create a federal grant and low-interest loan program to fund construction, renovation, and expansion of psychiatric inpatient facilities, modeled on the Hill-Burton Act of 1946 that built America's general hospital infrastructure. Target funding to states and regions with the most severe bed shortages (below 15 beds per 100,000 population).

**Evidence Base**: The Hill-Burton Act funded construction of nearly 7,000 healthcare facilities over four decades and is credited with substantially expanding hospital access, particularly in rural and underserved areas. A comparable psychiatric infrastructure program would address the capital investment gap identified by NASMHPD ($10+ billion needed to modernize existing state psychiatric hospital stock, plus additional billions for new construction).

**Implementation**: Federal appropriation of $5 billion over 5 years for construction grants and loan guarantees. States apply for funding with plans demonstrating bed shortfall, community service integration, workforce recruitment strategy, and quality assurance frameworks. Priority given to states below 15 beds per 100,000.

**Cost/Resources**: $5 billion over 5 years ($1 billion per year) in federal grants and loan guarantees; additional state matching funds.

**Timeline**: Authorization within 1-2 years; first construction grants awarded by Year 2; first new beds online by Year 4.

**Challenges**: Capital construction timelines (18-36 months per facility); workforce to staff new beds; NIMBY opposition to facility siting; ensuring beds are used for acute care, not long-term warehousing.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of new beds constructed by state; beds per 100,000 population change; geographic access (percentage of population within 60 miles of psychiatric inpatient bed).

### Solution 3: National Psychiatric Bed Registry

**Description**: Establish a real-time, nationwide electronic bed registry that tracks available psychiatric inpatient beds across all facility types (state hospitals, private facilities, general hospital units, crisis stabilization units, VA facilities). Emergency departments would use the registry to identify available beds, reducing search time and boarding durations.

**Evidence Base**: State-level bed registries in Georgia, North Carolina, and Oklahoma have demonstrated 20-40% reductions in ED boarding times (SAMHSA, 2023). Georgia's Georgia Crisis and Access Line (GCAL) reduced average time to psychiatric bed placement from 8.2 hours to 4.7 hours within two years of implementation (Georgia DBHDD, 2022). National implementation would extend these benefits across state lines and address the problem of patients who could be placed at out-of-state facilities.

**Implementation**: SAMHSA or CMS would develop and operate a national registry platform, building on existing state registry systems. Participation would be mandatory for all Medicaid-certified psychiatric facilities. Real-time bed availability updates would be required at least every 4 hours.

**Cost/Resources**: Approximately $50-75 million for initial development and first-year operations; $15-20 million annually for ongoing maintenance. Minimal cost relative to impact.

**Timeline**: Development within 12-18 months; pilot in 5 states by Year 2; national rollout by Year 3.

**Challenges**: Interoperability between existing state systems; facility compliance with real-time reporting; liability questions when patients are transferred across state lines.

**Impact Metrics**: Average time from ED presentation to bed identification; percentage of facilities reporting in real time; cross-state transfer volume.

### Solution 4: Psychiatric Workforce Pipeline Expansion

**Description**: Comprehensive investment in psychiatric workforce development, including expanded psychiatric residency positions, loan repayment programs for psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses who practice in underserved areas, visa streamlining for international psychiatric professionals, and expanded scope of practice for psychiatric nurse practitioners and physician assistants.

**Evidence Base**: The National Health Service Corps loan repayment program has successfully recruited physicians to underserved areas, with 86% of participants remaining in underserved practice after completing their obligations (HRSA, 2023). International medical graduates fill approximately 30% of U.S. psychiatry residency positions, demonstrating the potential of immigration-based workforce strategies (AAMC, 2023). States that have expanded psychiatric nurse practitioner scope of practice have seen 12-18% increases in psychiatric provider availability within 3 years (Rand Corporation, 2022).

**Implementation**: Federal legislation would fund 1,000 additional psychiatric residency positions over 5 years (through Medicare GME expansion), create a dedicated loan repayment program for psychiatric providers in shortage areas ($100,000 per provider for 4-year commitment), streamline J-1 and H-1B visa processes for international psychiatrists, and provide grants to states that expand NP/PA scope of practice for psychiatric care.

**Cost/Resources**: $2.5 billion over 5 years ($500 million/year) for residency expansion, loan repayment, and workforce development programs.

**Timeline**: Residency positions begin filling within 2 years; first loan repayment cohort active by Year 2; workforce impact measurable by Year 5 (psychiatry residency is 4 years).

**Challenges**: Long training pipeline for psychiatrists (4-year residency after medical school); scope of practice opposition from physician organizations; geographic distribution challenges even with incentives.

**Impact Metrics**: Psychiatrists per 100,000 population by state; percentage of counties with no psychiatrist; psychiatric nursing vacancy rates; psychiatric residency fill rates.

### Solution 5: Crisis Stabilization Network Expansion

**Description**: Fund a national network of crisis stabilization units (CSUs) and crisis receiving centers (CRCs) that provide up to 23-hour observation and stabilization, diverting patients who do not need full hospitalization from emergency departments while connecting those who do need inpatient care to available beds via the national bed registry.

**Evidence Base**: SAMHSA's National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care (2020) identified crisis stabilization units as a core component of effective crisis systems. Existing CSUs divert 60-70% of psychiatric ED presentations from hospitalization (SAMHSA, 2023). Tucson, Arizona's Crisis Response Center handles over 10,000 contacts annually and diverts 70% of contacts from ED visits or arrest (Connections Health Solutions, 2023).

**Implementation**: Federal grants to states and communities to establish CSUs in areas with high psychiatric ED boarding rates. Minimum capacity of 1 CSU per 200,000 population. CSUs would be connected to the national bed registry and staffed by psychiatric professionals with authority to initiate voluntary admission to available inpatient beds.

**Cost/Resources**: $1.5 billion over 5 years for construction and startup grants; ongoing operating costs covered by Medicaid (CSUs are not subject to the IMD exclusion if structured as less-than-16-bed facilities or as outpatient-classified programs).

**Timeline**: First CSUs funded by Year 1; target network of 500+ CSUs operational by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Workforce to staff CSUs; integration with existing emergency systems; Medicaid billing classifications; community siting resistance.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of CSUs operational; annual diversions from ED; average CSU length of stay; percentage of CSU patients connected to outpatient follow-up within 7 days.

### Solution 6: Parity Enforcement for Inpatient Psychiatric Care

**Description**: Strengthen enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) as it applies to inpatient psychiatric care, including requiring transparent utilization review criteria, banning step-therapy requirements for acute psychiatric admissions, establishing minimum length-of-stay standards based on clinical guidelines, and creating a private right of action for patients denied medically necessary inpatient care.

**Evidence Base**: A 2023 report by the Department of Labor found that over 50% of health plans subjected behavioral health inpatient claims to more restrictive prior authorization than comparable medical/surgical claims, violating MHPAEA requirements. The Milliman behavioral health parity report found that in-network reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care averaged 20-40% below comparable medical/surgical rates (Milliman, 2023). Stronger enforcement would increase the financial viability of psychiatric inpatient units.

**Implementation**: CMS and the Department of Labor would issue joint enforcement guidance specifying prohibited utilization review practices for psychiatric inpatient care. Congress would amend MHPAEA to create a private right of action, establish minimum medical necessity review standards, and require annual parity compliance audits by all insurers.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct federal cost; increased insurance claims costs borne by insurers and passed to premiums (estimated 0.5-1.0% premium impact based on Milliman analysis).

**Timeline**: Regulatory guidance within 12 months; legislative amendments within 2 years.

**Challenges**: Insurance industry lobbying against stronger enforcement; difficulty defining "parity" in clinical terms; potential premium increases.

**Impact Metrics**: Average authorized length of stay (commercial insurance); denial rates for psychiatric inpatient claims; reimbursement rate ratios (psychiatric vs. medical/surgical); parity compliance audit results.

### Solution 7: State Psychiatric Hospital Modernization Program

**Description**: Create a dedicated federal-state partnership program to modernize existing state psychiatric hospital infrastructure, replacing outdated buildings with modern, trauma-informed facilities that meet current accreditation and safety standards.

**Evidence Base**: NASMHPD's 2023 survey found the average age of state psychiatric hospital buildings was 47 years, with many predating modern building codes, ADA requirements, and evidence-based facility design. Studies of modern psychiatric facility design demonstrate reductions in patient aggression (35-40%), use of seclusion and restraint (50%), and staff injury (25-30%) compared to older facilities (Health Environments Research and Design Journal, 2022).

**Implementation**: Federal grants covering 65% of modernization costs, with states providing 35% match. Competitive application process prioritizing facilities with safety violations, accessibility deficiencies, or operating under consent decrees. Projects must incorporate evidence-based design principles including natural light, outdoor spaces, single-occupancy rooms, and de-escalation spaces.

**Cost/Resources**: $3 billion over 10 years ($300 million/year) in federal grants; $1.6 billion in state matching funds.

**Timeline**: First grants awarded by Year 2; first modernized facilities completed by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Construction timelines and cost overruns; maintaining operations during renovation; state budget constraints for matching funds.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of facilities modernized; seclusion and restraint rates; patient and staff safety incident rates; accreditation outcomes.

## International Models

### Australia: Mental Health Bed and Community Integration Model

**Description**: Australia maintains approximately 29 psychiatric beds per 100,000 population (2.5 times the U.S. rate) alongside robust community mental health services, funded through a combination of federal (Medicare) and state government funding without an IMD-equivalent exclusion.

**Results**: Australia's average ED boarding time for psychiatric patients is approximately 4 hours (compared to 8 hours in the U.S.), and 30-day readmission rates average 14% (compared to 19.3% in the U.S.) (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The key transferable lesson is that federal health insurance (Medicare in Australia) covers psychiatric inpatient care without discriminatory exclusions, demonstrating that removing the IMD exclusion would not necessarily produce the fiscal catastrophe that opponents predict. Australia's per-capita mental health spending is approximately 20% higher than the U.S., suggesting that adequate care requires additional investment but not an unreasonable amount.

### United Kingdom: Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Teams

**Description**: The NHS operates Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment (CRHT) teams that provide intensive home-based crisis support as an alternative to hospitalization. Every area in England has a CRHT team available 24/7. These teams can visit patients at home multiple times per day during acute episodes.

**Results**: CRHT teams have reduced acute psychiatric admissions by approximately 20% in areas where they operate effectively, while maintaining patient safety outcomes (Lancet Psychiatry, 2020). The UK maintains approximately 34 psychiatric beds per 100,000 population.

**Applicability to U.S.**: CRHT teams could be adapted as an extension of the 988 crisis system, providing home-based crisis intervention for patients who do not require hospitalization but need more support than a crisis hotline. However, they require a dense workforce and cannot replace inpatient beds for patients with the most severe presentations.

### Germany: Integrated Psychiatric Care Districts

**Description**: Germany maintains 128 psychiatric beds per 100,000 population and organizes care through regional psychiatric care districts, each with a defined catchment area responsible for providing the full continuum of care (inpatient, day treatment, outpatient, and community support).

**Results**: Germany's 30-day readmission rate is approximately 12%, substantially lower than the U.S. rate of 19.3%. Average length of stay is approximately 22 days (compared to 7.2 days in U.S. general hospital units), allowing more complete stabilization before discharge (Federal Statistical Office of Germany, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The regional catchment area model could inform state-level reorganization of psychiatric services, ensuring that each geographic area has a defined provider responsible for the full care continuum. However, Germany's substantially higher bed count and longer stays reflect a different philosophical approach that would require significant investment to replicate.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Georgia Crisis and Access Line (GCAL)**: Statewide bed registry and crisis line serving 10+ million Georgians. Reduced average psychiatric bed search time from 8.2 hours to 4.7 hours. Demonstrates feasibility of statewide bed registry model.
- **Arizona's Crisis Now system (Tucson)**: Crisis Response Center handling 10,000+ contacts annually with 70% diversion from ED and arrest. Demonstrates crisis stabilization model with law enforcement partnership.
- **Oregon's Section 1115 IMD Waiver**: Among the first states to implement an SMI IMD waiver, Oregon reported 18% reduction in psychiatric ED boarding within 18 months (Oregon Health Authority, 2023).
- **New York City's NYC Safe program**: Mobile crisis teams paired with hospital-based crisis stabilization to reduce psychiatric boarding and incarceration. Early results show 25% reduction in psychiatric arrests in target areas (NYC Mayor's Office, 2023).

## Sequencing and Prioritization

### Quick Wins (0-2 years)

- Expand Section 1115 IMD waivers to all states and increase stay limits from 30 to 60 days
- Fund national psychiatric bed registry development and pilot deployment
- Issue strengthened MHPAEA enforcement guidance for inpatient psychiatric care
- Establish first round of crisis stabilization unit grants

### Medium-term Reforms (2-5 years)

- Enact full IMD exclusion repeal through legislation
- Launch psychiatric infrastructure investment program with first construction grants
- Fund 1,000 additional psychiatric residency positions through Medicare GME expansion
- Deploy national bed registry to all 50 states
- Target 500+ crisis stabilization units operational

### Long-term Transformation (5-10 years)

- Achieve minimum 30 beds per 100,000 population nationally (from 11.7 in 2024)
- Complete state psychiatric hospital modernization program
- Achieve psychiatric workforce density sufficient to staff all available beds
- Reduce 30-day readmission rate from 19.3% to below 12%
- Eliminate psychiatric ED boarding exceeding 2 hours

## Complementary Policies

- **Supported housing expansion**: Patients cannot be discharged safely without stable housing. Federal investment in supported housing for people with serious mental illness is essential to reducing readmissions and freeing inpatient beds for acute patients.
- **Outpatient civil commitment (Assisted Outpatient Treatment)**: Court-ordered outpatient treatment for individuals with serious mental illness who meet specific criteria can reduce hospitalization, incarceration, and homelessness. Currently authorized in 47 states but underutilized.
- **988 crisis system buildout**: The 988 Lifeline identifies people in crisis but needs a care delivery system behind it. Crisis stabilization units, mobile crisis teams, and inpatient beds are the infrastructure that makes 988 effective.
- **Medicaid reentry coverage**: Extending Medicaid coverage to incarcerated individuals 30 days before release (as authorized by recent CMS guidance) can improve continuity of care for people with serious mental illness leaving jails and prisons.
