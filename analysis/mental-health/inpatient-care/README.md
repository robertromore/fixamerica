# Inpatient Psychiatric Care

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of inpatient psychiatric care in the United States, encompassing the acute capacity crisis, regulatory barriers, involuntary commitment processes, and pathways toward a functional acute care system.

## Overview

The United States faces a severe shortage of psychiatric inpatient beds, with the number of available beds per capita falling from approximately 340 per 100,000 population in 1955 to roughly 11.7 per 100,000 by 2024. This shortage has produced cascading consequences: patients in psychiatric crisis board for hours or days in emergency departments, jails and prisons have become the largest de facto mental health facilities, and individuals with severe mental illness cycle between emergency rooms, brief hospitalizations, homelessness, and incarceration.

At the center of this crisis lies the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, a 1965 federal policy that prohibits Medicaid reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care in facilities with more than 16 beds for adults ages 21-64. This single policy distorts the entire psychiatric care landscape, discouraging investment in dedicated psychiatric hospitals and leaving states to fund inpatient care through limited state budgets. Meanwhile, the emergency department boarding crisis has reached alarming proportions, with psychiatric patients waiting an average of 8 hours for inpatient placement nationally, and far longer in many states.

This analysis examines the structural, financial, and regulatory roots of the inpatient psychiatric care crisis, explores stakeholder dynamics, evaluates reform proposals including IMD exclusion repeal, and proposes a phased approach to rebuilding America's acute psychiatric care infrastructure.
