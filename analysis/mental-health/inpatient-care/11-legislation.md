# Inpatient Psychiatric Care: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to rebuilding America's inpatient psychiatric care system centers on removing the financial distortion that caused the capacity crisis (the IMD exclusion), investing in infrastructure and workforce, establishing quality standards, and strengthening parity enforcement. This requires a combination of federal legislation (only Congress can repeal the IMD exclusion or authorize new spending programs), state model legislation (states control facility licensing, civil commitment laws, and crisis system deployment), and regulatory action (CMS and DOL enforcement of existing parity law).

The legislative strategy is incremental in structure but transformative in effect. The centerpiece is the Inpatient Psychiatric Care Access Act, which repeals the IMD exclusion, creates the infrastructure investment program, and establishes quality standards. Companion legislation addresses workforce development and parity enforcement. State model legislation provides a framework for crisis system deployment and bed registry participation.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for inpatient psychiatric care reform.* The federal government has clear authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1) to set conditions on Medicaid funding, and under the Commerce Clause to regulate the healthcare market. State authority over civil commitment and facility licensing is well-established under the police power. The proposed reforms operate entirely within existing constitutional frameworks.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To repeal the Medicaid institutions for mental diseases exclusion,
establish a federal psychiatric infrastructure investment program,
create a national psychiatric bed registry, and set quality standards
for inpatient psychiatric care.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Inpatient Psychiatric Care Access
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The United States has approximately 37,679 psychiatric
    inpatient beds as of 2024, yielding a rate of 11.7 beds per
    100,000 population, a decline of more than 95 percent on a
    per-capita basis since 1955 (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2024).

(2) The Medicaid institutions for mental diseases exclusion,
    codified at section 1905(a)(B) of the Social Security Act
    (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(B)), prohibits federal Medicaid
    reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care for adults ages
    21 through 64 in facilities with more than 16 beds, creating
    a discriminatory financing barrier that does not apply to any
    other medical condition.

(3) Psychiatric patients wait an average of 8 hours in hospital
    emergency departments for inpatient placement, a phenomenon
    known as "boarding" that harms patient outcomes and disrupts
    emergency department operations (American College of Emergency
    Physicians, 2023).

(4) An estimated 44 percent of individuals in jails and 37 percent
    of those in state prisons have a diagnosed mental health
    condition, reflecting the criminalization of mental illness
    resulting from inadequate treatment capacity (Bureau of Justice
    Statistics, 2023).

(5) The economic costs of untreated serious mental illness,
    including avoidable emergency department visits, incarceration,
    homelessness services, and lost productivity, exceed
    $280 billion annually (National Alliance on Mental Illness,
    2023).

(6) Every other member nation of the Organisation for Economic
    Co-operation and Development (OECD) maintains a higher
    per-capita psychiatric bed rate than the United States, and
    none maintains an equivalent to the IMD exclusion.

(7) Congress has the authority and responsibility to remove
    discriminatory barriers to psychiatric care within the
    Medicaid program and to invest in the psychiatric care
    infrastructure necessary to serve the American people.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

program administration.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

Except as otherwise provided, this Act shall take effect on the
date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual basis for Congressional action with specific, sourced data points. Cites the 95% per-capita bed decline, 8-hour average ED boarding time, 44% jail mental illness rate, and $280 billion annual cost. Establishes Congressional authority by reference to OECD comparisons and the discriminatory nature of the exclusion.
- **Section 4 (IMD Repeal)**: The core provision. Strikes the IMD exclusion language from the Social Security Act and requires states to cover psychiatric inpatient care on the same terms as medical/surgical care. Includes quality conditions to prevent the reform from enabling substandard facilities. The 18-month effective date provides time for CMS to issue implementing regulations.
- **Section 5 (Infrastructure Investment)**: Modeled on the Hill-Burton Act, this section creates a $5 billion grant and loan program for psychiatric facility construction and renovation. Priority criteria target the most underserved communities. Design standards ensure new facilities reflect current evidence-based practices.
- **Section 6 (Bed Registry)**: Creates a national real-time bed tracking system to reduce ED boarding by enabling rapid identification of available beds. Mandatory participation for Medicaid-reimbursed facilities ensures comprehensive coverage.
- **Section 7 (Quality Standards)**: Establishes national minimum standards as a condition of Medicaid reimbursement, addressing concerns that capacity expansion without quality safeguards could enable institutional abuse. Public reporting creates accountability.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| CMS publishes proposed rules for IMD repeal implementation | 6 months after enactment | CMS |
| Public comment period on proposed rules closes | 9 months after enactment | CMS/Public |
| National Bed Registry development begins | 6 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| CMS publishes final rules for IMD repeal | 15 months after enactment | CMS |
| IMD exclusion repeal takes effect | 18 months after enactment | CMS/States |
| National Bed Registry operational (pilot states) | 18 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| First infrastructure investment grants awarded | 24 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| Quality standards regulations promulgated | 24 months after enactment | CMS |
| National Bed Registry fully deployed (all states) | 36 months after enactment | SAMHSA |

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS has primary implementation responsibility for the IMD repeal, quality standards, and Medicaid reimbursement. SAMHSA has primary responsibility for the infrastructure investment program and bed registry. Joint CMS-SAMHSA coordination is required for quality standard development.

**Challenges**:

- **Fiscal cost**: CBO will likely score IMD repeal at $10-15 billion annually in new Medicaid spending. This is the primary obstacle to passage and will require offsets or waiver of pay-as-you-go requirements.
- **State readiness**: Some states lack the administrative capacity to rapidly implement expanded Medicaid coverage. The 18-month effective date and CMS technical assistance address this.
- **Quality enforcement**: CMS has historically struggled to enforce quality standards in psychiatric facilities. The public reporting and Medicaid suspension provisions strengthen enforcement, but dedicated inspection resources are needed.

**Refinements**:

- **Phased repeal option**: If full immediate repeal is not politically feasible, an alternative approach would phase in repeal over 5 years, starting with states below 15 beds per 100,000 and expanding to all states.
- **Cost offset package**: Pair IMD repeal with provisions that generate savings, such as reduced Medicaid emergency department spending, reduced Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, and criminal justice cost avoidance.

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for IMD repeal implementation and quality standards; SAMHSA for infrastructure grants and bed registry.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Medicaid Coverage of IMD Services**: CMS must issue regulations specifying reimbursement rates, coverage criteria, and state plan amendment requirements for Medicaid coverage of inpatient psychiatric care in IMDs. Statutory deadline: 15 months after enactment.
2. **National Inpatient Psychiatric Quality Standards**: CMS must promulgate standards for staffing ratios, restraint use, discharge planning, and public reporting. Statutory deadline: 24 months after enactment.
3. **Infrastructure Investment Program Grant Criteria**: SAMHSA must publish grant solicitation criteria, application requirements, and design standards. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.
4. **Bed Registry Technical Standards**: SAMHSA must establish interoperability standards, update frequency requirements, and data security protocols. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: CMS may impose civil monetary penalties on facilities that fail to meet quality standards or bed registry participation requirements, up to $10,000 per day of noncompliance.
- **Administrative Actions**: CMS may suspend or terminate Medicaid reimbursement for facilities that fail quality inspections after notice and opportunity for corrective action.
- **Private Right of Action**: The Psychiatric Parity Enforcement Act (companion legislation) would create a private right of action for patients denied medically necessary inpatient psychiatric care in violation of MHPAEA.
- **State Enforcement**: States retain authority to license, inspect, and regulate psychiatric facilities. Federal quality standards establish a floor, not a ceiling.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: Congress has broad authority under the Spending Clause to set conditions on Medicaid funding, including requiring states to cover psychiatric inpatient care in IMDs. The IMD exclusion itself was enacted under this authority, and its repeal operates within the same framework. *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), established that Congress may condition federal funds on state compliance with federal requirements, provided the conditions are related to the federal interest in the funded program.

**Commerce Clause Authority**: The infrastructure investment program and bed registry operate under Congress's Commerce Clause authority to regulate interstate commerce, including the national healthcare market. Psychiatric patients frequently cross state lines for care; a national bed registry and uniform quality standards serve clear interstate commerce interests.

**Due Process Concerns**: Quality standards that affect involuntary commitment processes must comply with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. *Addington v. Texas*, 441 U.S. 418 (1979), requires "clear and convincing evidence" for civil commitment. The proposed legislation does not alter commitment standards but requires legal counsel protections during involuntary commitment proceedings.

### Preemption

The federal quality standards established under Section 7 set a floor for inpatient psychiatric care. States may adopt more stringent standards. The IMD repeal provision does not preempt state facility licensing, commitment laws, or other state regulation of psychiatric care. An express savings clause should be included to prevent courts from inferring preemption of state consumer protection or patient safety laws.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through four mechanisms: (1) Medicaid reimbursement conditioned on accreditation, quality standard compliance, and bed registry participation; (2) civil monetary penalties for noncompliance; (3) public reporting of quality measures; and (4) state licensing and inspection authority. Annual Congressional reports provide legislative oversight.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Quality standards apply only to Medicaid-reimbursed facilities | Facilities that do not accept Medicaid could operate below quality standards, creating a two-tier system | Medium | Extend quality standards to all licensed psychiatric facilities through state model legislation or condition Medicare reimbursement on the same standards |
| 18-month implementation delay for IMD repeal | States may delay state plan amendments, extending the effective gap beyond 18 months | Medium | Include automatic enrollment provision: if a state fails to submit a conforming plan amendment within 18 months, CMS shall apply the new coverage requirements directly |
| No cap on length of stay after IMD repeal | Removal of the exclusion could incentivize states to shift long-term care costs to Medicaid through extended psychiatric hospitalizations | High | Add utilization review requirements: after 30 days, continued stay must be justified by independent medical review. Cap initial authorization at 60 days with 30-day renewal periods requiring clinical justification |
| Infrastructure grants could be used for cosmetic renovations rather than bed expansion | Grantees could use funds for building upgrades that do not increase bed capacity | Medium | Require that at least 70% of grant funds be used for projects that result in a net increase in psychiatric beds or crisis stabilization capacity |
| Bed registry participation requirement applies only to Medicaid-certified facilities | Non-Medicaid facilities could remain outside the registry, reducing its comprehensiveness | Medium | Condition state block grant funding on requiring all licensed psychiatric facilities to participate in the bed registry |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| CBO cost estimate of $10-15 billion annually for IMD repeal | Creates significant political obstacle to passage; requires offsets or budget waiver | The IMD exclusion has suppressed Medicaid psychiatric spending for 60 years; restoring it is inherently costly | Include cost offset provisions (reduced ED boarding costs, DSH adjustments, criminal justice savings estimates). Consider phased repeal starting with highest-shortage states |
| Workforce shortage limits ability to staff new beds | New facilities cannot open without qualified staff; construction may outpace workforce pipeline | Psychiatry training requires 4+ years after medical school; workforce expansion has long lead time | Begin workforce programs in Phase 1, before major construction; use telepsychiatry and NP/PA scope expansion as bridge strategies |
| No enforcement mechanism for state model legislation | States may adopt crisis system legislation but fail to fund or implement it | Federal government cannot compel state legislative action | Condition federal infrastructure grants on state adoption of crisis system legislation. Provide technical assistance. Use Medicaid administrative match as incentive |
| Quality standards may be set too low to prevent institutional abuse | Minimum standards that accommodate the most resource-constrained facilities may not adequately protect patients | Political pressure to set achievable standards rather than aspirational ones | Build in automatic escalation of standards at 3-year intervals. Create an independent quality review board with patient and family representation |
| Bill does not address civil commitment law reform | Involuntary commitment standards vary widely across states and significantly affect access to inpatient care | Civil commitment is a state law issue; federal legislation traditionally defers to states on police power questions | Include findings encouraging states to adopt evidence-based commitment standards. Condition some funding on states meeting minimum commitment process protections |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Long-stay safeguard**: Amend Section 4 to include an automatic utilization review requirement for any Medicaid-covered psychiatric inpatient stay exceeding 30 days, performed by an independent review organization. Stays exceeding 90 days require state mental health authority approval and documented discharge plan.
2. **Universal quality standard application**: Add a provision conditioning Medicare psychiatric reimbursement (not just Medicaid) on compliance with Section 7 quality standards, ensuring coverage of facilities that do not accept Medicaid.
3. **Infrastructure grant bed-expansion requirement**: Add language requiring grantees to demonstrate a net increase in psychiatric bed capacity or crisis stabilization capacity as a result of the funded project. Cosmetic renovations and deferred maintenance projects are eligible only if bundled with capacity expansion.
4. **Automatic state plan amendment**: Add a provision that if a state fails to submit a conforming Medicaid state plan amendment within 18 months of enactment, the Secretary shall apply the IMD coverage requirements directly to the state's Medicaid program under existing authority.
5. **Quality standard escalation**: Add a sunset provision requiring the Secretary to update quality standards at 3-year intervals, with each update reflecting current evidence-based practices and achievable best-practice benchmarks.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The infrastructure investment program ($5 billion over 5 years) has a built-in sunset at the end of the 5-year authorization period, requiring reauthorization to continue. The quality standards program includes a mandatory 5-year comprehensive evaluation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), with findings and recommendations submitted to Congress. The IMD repeal itself is permanent and does not sunset, consistent with the permanent nature of other Medicaid coverage requirements.

The bed registry program should include a 7-year reauthorization requirement, with a GAO evaluation at Year 5 assessing its impact on ED boarding times and bed utilization.
