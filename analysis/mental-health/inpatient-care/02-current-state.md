# Inpatient Psychiatric Care: Current State

## Psychiatric Bed Capacity

The United States has experienced a dramatic and sustained decline in psychiatric inpatient bed capacity over the past seven decades. As of 2024, the nation has approximately 37,679 total psychiatric beds across all facility types, yielding a rate of roughly 11.7 beds per 100,000 population (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2024). This figure represents a more than 95% per-capita decline from the 1955 peak of approximately 340 beds per 100,000.

### Beds by Facility Type

| Facility Type | Bed Count (2024) | Share of Total | Trend (2019-2024) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| State and county psychiatric hospitals | 37,679 total reported; ~14,000 state/county | ~37% | Declining | SAMHSA NMHSS, 2024 |
| Private psychiatric hospitals | ~10,500 | ~28% | Stable to increasing | AHA Annual Survey, 2024 |
| General hospital psychiatric units | ~9,800 | ~26% | Declining | AHA Annual Survey, 2024 |
| VA psychiatric beds | ~2,500 | ~7% | Stable | VA, 2024 |
| Other (residential treatment, crisis stabilization) | ~880 | ~2% | Increasing | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| **Total** | **~37,679** | **100%** | **Net declining** | **Treatment Advocacy Center, 2024** |

### Per-Capita Rates by State

State-level variation in psychiatric bed availability is extreme. The best-served states have more than four times the per-capita bed rate of the worst-served states.

| Rank | State | Beds per 100,000 | Category | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (highest) | Mississippi | 29.9 | Above recommended minimum | TAC State Data, 2024 |
| 2 | West Virginia | 26.8 | Above recommended minimum | TAC State Data, 2024 |
| 3 | South Dakota | 25.1 | Above recommended minimum | TAC State Data, 2024 |
| 48 | Arizona | 5.4 | Critical shortage | TAC State Data, 2024 |
| 49 | Nevada | 5.1 | Critical shortage | TAC State Data, 2024 |
| 50 | Iowa | 4.8 | Critical shortage | TAC State Data, 2024 |
| National average | All states | 11.7 | Severe shortage | TAC, 2024 |

### International Comparison

| Country | Psychiatric Beds per 100,000 | Year | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Japan | 260 | 2022 | OECD Health Statistics, 2023 |
| South Korea | 117 | 2022 | OECD, 2023 |
| Germany | 128 | 2022 | OECD, 2023 |
| France | 83 | 2022 | OECD, 2023 |
| United Kingdom | 34 | 2022 | OECD, 2023 |
| Canada | 30 | 2022 | OECD, 2023 |
| Australia | 29 | 2022 | OECD, 2023 |
| **United States** | **11.7** | **2024** | **TAC, 2024** |
| OECD Average | 68 | 2022 | OECD, 2023 |

The United States has fewer psychiatric beds per capita than any other OECD nation except Italy and Turkey.

## Emergency Department Boarding

### The Boarding Crisis

Emergency department (ED) boarding occurs when a patient requiring psychiatric inpatient admission remains in the ED because no inpatient bed is available. Psychiatric patients board at far higher rates and for far longer durations than medical/surgical patients.

| Metric | Value | Trend (2019-2024) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Average ED wait for psychiatric bed placement | 8 hours | Increasing (up from 6.8 hours in 2019) | ACEP, 2023 |
| ED visits with psychiatric boarding >6 hours | 1 in 5 psychiatric ED visits | Increasing | ACEP, 2023 |
| ED visits with psychiatric boarding >24 hours | 1 in 10 psychiatric ED visits | Increasing | Psychiatric Services, 2023 |
| Longest reported ED boarding episodes | >7 days in multiple states | Stable (persistent) | Investigative media reports, 2023 |
| Pediatric psychiatric boarding rate | 37% higher than adult rate | Increasing sharply since 2020 | AAP, 2023 |
| Psychiatric ED visits as share of all ED visits | 4.4% of visits but 12% of ED boarding hours | Increasing | HCUP/AHRQ, 2023 |

### Impact of Boarding on Patients and Hospitals

Psychiatric boarding produces measurable harm:

- **Patient outcomes**: Patients boarding >24 hours show increased agitation, self-harm attempts, and need for physical restraint (Nicks & Manthey, 2012; Psychiatric Services, 2023)
- **ED operations**: Psychiatric boarding reduces ED capacity for other patients, contributing to ambulance diversion and longer wait times for all patients
- **Hospital finances**: Boarded psychiatric patients generate minimal revenue while occupying ED beds, costing hospitals an estimated $2,264 per boarding episode (ACEP, 2023)
- **Staff safety**: Psychiatric boarding is associated with increased rates of staff assault and burnout (Emergency Medicine Journal, 2022)

## Involuntary Commitment

### 72-Hour Hold Procedures

All 50 states and the District of Columbia have civil commitment statutes that allow involuntary psychiatric evaluation and short-term hold, typically for 72 hours (excluding weekends and holidays in most jurisdictions). The criteria and processes vary significantly by state.

| Element | Most Common Standard | Variation Range | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Initial hold duration | 72 hours | 24 hours (some states) to 120 hours | TAC State Survey, 2023 |
| Who can initiate a hold | Physicians, law enforcement, designated mental health professionals | Some states allow family petition; some require only law enforcement | State statutes |
| Standard for hold | "Danger to self or others" or "gravely disabled" | Some states require "imminent" danger; others allow "substantial" risk | State statutes |
| Judicial review timeline | Within 72 hours of hold initiation | 48 hours to 14 days | State statutes |
| Right to counsel | Required in all states | Quality and availability vary | State statutes |
| Extended commitment (after initial hold) | Requires court hearing, clear and convincing evidence | Some states allow 90-day renewals; others require 6-month review | State statutes |

### Civil Commitment Volume

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Estimated annual involuntary psychiatric evaluations | ~2.0 million | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Share of inpatient admissions that are involuntary | ~35-40% | Psychiatric Services, 2022 |
| States using "danger to self/others" standard | 50 + DC | TAC, 2023 |
| States also using "gravely disabled" standard | 45 + DC | TAC, 2023 |
| States with "need for treatment" standard (broadest) | 7 states | TAC, 2023 |

## Length of Stay and Readmission

### Average Length of Stay (ALOS)

The average length of stay for inpatient psychiatric admissions has declined dramatically over the past three decades, driven by insurance pressures, utilization review, and the shift toward community-based care.

| Setting | Average LOS (2023) | Change from 2010 | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| General hospital psychiatric units | 7.2 days | Down from 8.4 days | HCUP/AHRQ, 2023 |
| State psychiatric hospitals | 45-60 days (median ~30 days) | Stable | SAMHSA NMHSS, 2023 |
| Private psychiatric hospitals | 10.3 days | Down from 12.1 days | AHA, 2023 |
| VA psychiatric units | 14.2 days | Down from 17.8 days | VA, 2023 |
| Pediatric psychiatric admissions | 8.5 days | Down from 10.1 days | HCUP, 2023 |

### Readmission Rates

High readmission rates are a key indicator of system failure, suggesting patients are being discharged before they are stable or without adequate community supports.

| Metric | Value | Benchmark/Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30-day all-cause psychiatric readmission rate | 19.3% | Increasing (was 17.5% in 2018) | CMS Hospital Compare, 2023 |
| 30-day readmission for schizophrenia | 22.8% | Highest among diagnostic groups | CMS, 2023 |
| 30-day readmission for bipolar disorder | 18.7% | Above average | CMS, 2023 |
| 30-day readmission for major depression | 14.2% | Below average | CMS, 2023 |
| Patients discharged without follow-up within 7 days | ~38% | Improving slowly (was 42% in 2018) | HEDIS/NCQA, 2023 |
| "Revolving door" patients (3+ admissions/year) | ~8% of psychiatric inpatients | Stable | Psychiatric Services, 2022 |

## Regulatory and Legal Framework

### Key Laws and Regulations

| Law/Regulation | Year | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **IMD Exclusion** (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(B)) | 1965 | Bars Medicaid payment for adults 21-64 in psychiatric facilities with >16 beds |
| **EMTALA** (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act) | 1986 | Requires EDs to stabilize psychiatric emergencies regardless of ability to pay |
| **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act** | 2008 | Requires insurance plans to cover mental health on par with medical/surgical |
| **21st Century Cures Act** (Section 12003) | 2016 | Created Medicaid IMD waiver demonstration for SUD; expanded to SMI in 2018 |
| **CMS IMD Waiver for SMI** (Section 1115) | 2018 | Allows states to seek Medicaid reimbursement for short-term (up to 30-day) stays in IMDs for SMI |
| **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline** | 2022 | Established national crisis number; created demand for crisis receiving capacity |
| **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act** | 2022 | Provided $8.6 billion for mental health programs including crisis services |
| **EMTALA psychiatric boarding cases** | Ongoing | CMS enforcement actions against hospitals that fail to stabilize psychiatric patients |

### IMD Exclusion Waiver Status

As of 2024, 12 states have approved Section 1115 IMD waivers for serious mental illness, and an additional 6 states have applications pending (CMS, 2024). However, the waivers are limited to stays of 30 days or fewer and require states to provide matching community-based services.

| Waiver Category | Count | Key Limitation | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| States with approved SMI IMD waivers | 12 | 30-day maximum stay; community service requirements | CMS, 2024 |
| States with pending SMI IMD waiver applications | 6 | Same limitations as approved waivers | CMS, 2024 |
| States with SUD IMD waivers (broader program) | 37 | SUD-specific; does not cover psychiatric-only | CMS, 2024 |
| States with no IMD waiver activity | 32 (for SMI) | Full exclusion still applies | CMS, 2024 |

## Geographic Variation

### Regional Disparities

The psychiatric bed shortage is not uniform. Rural areas and certain regions face particularly acute shortages.

- **Rural areas**: 65% of rural counties have no psychiatrist, and many have no inpatient psychiatric beds within a 60-mile radius (HRSA, 2023)
- **Southern states**: Despite higher per-capita bed counts in some states (Mississippi, West Virginia), overall bed quality and community follow-up services are often weaker
- **Western states**: Many Western states (Nevada, Arizona, Colorado) have among the lowest per-capita bed counts and highest ED boarding rates
- **Northeastern states**: Generally higher capacity but also higher cost and older facility stock
- **Tribal and frontier areas**: Extremely limited access; IHS facilities have minimal psychiatric inpatient capacity

### State Mental Health Authority (SMHA) Spending

| Expenditure Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total state mental health spending (all states) | $44.5 billion (FY2023) | Stable in real terms | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| Per-capita SMHA spending (national average) | $133 per capita (FY2023) | Declining in real terms since 2009 | NRI/NASMHPD, 2023 |
| Highest per-capita SMHA spending | Washington, D.C.: $428 per capita | Stable | NRI, 2023 |
| Lowest per-capita SMHA spending | Texas: $42 per capita | Declining | NRI, 2023 |
| Share of SMHA spending on inpatient care | ~29% nationally | Declining (was 38% in 2010) | NRI, 2023 |

## Recent Trends

### Post-COVID Surge (2020-2024)

The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically worsened the psychiatric bed crisis:

- Psychiatric ED visits increased 31% from 2019 to 2022 among adults and 45% among adolescents (CDC, 2023)
- ED boarding times for psychiatric patients increased approximately 18% from pre-pandemic levels (ACEP, 2023)
- Staff shortages in psychiatric facilities intensified, with vacancy rates for psychiatric nurses exceeding 20% in many states (ANA, 2023)
- Several states temporarily relaxed IMD exclusion rules during the public health emergency, but most reversion occurred after emergency declarations ended

### 988 Implementation

The launch of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in July 2022 created significant new demand for crisis receiving and stabilization capacity. In its first full year of operation, 988 received over 5.5 million contacts (calls, texts, and chats), a 50% increase from the prior 10-digit number (SAMHSA, 2024). This surge highlighted the gap between crisis identification and crisis care delivery: many callers in acute distress have nowhere to go when inpatient beds are unavailable.

## Emerging Challenges

### Pediatric Psychiatric Emergency

The mental health crisis among children and adolescents has created unprecedented demand for pediatric psychiatric beds. Pediatric psychiatric ED visits increased 45% from 2019 to 2022 (CDC, 2023), but pediatric psychiatric bed capacity did not expand to match. Children routinely board in EDs for 2-3 days or longer, with some boarding episodes exceeding a week. The U.S. Surgeon General declared youth mental health a national crisis in 2021.

### Workforce Shortage

The psychiatric workforce shortage is a binding constraint on bed expansion. Even if physical beds were available, staffing them is increasingly difficult:

- 60% of all U.S. counties lack a single psychiatrist (HRSA, 2023)
- The average age of practicing psychiatrists is 55 years, with large cohorts nearing retirement (AAMC, 2023)
- Psychiatric nursing vacancy rates exceed 20% nationally (ANA, 2023)
- Average annual turnover for psychiatric technicians exceeds 30% (BLS, 2023)

### Medicaid Redetermination

The unwinding of continuous Medicaid enrollment (post-pandemic) resulted in over 19 million people losing Medicaid coverage between April 2023 and early 2024 (KFF, 2024). This disproportionately affected individuals with serious mental illness, potentially increasing the number of uninsured patients seeking psychiatric care through emergency departments.
