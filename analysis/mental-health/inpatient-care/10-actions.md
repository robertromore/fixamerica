# Inpatient Psychiatric Care: What You Can Do

The crisis in psychiatric inpatient care -- a 95% per-capita reduction in psychiatric beds since 1955, emergency department boarding averaging 8 hours, and jails functioning as the largest psychiatric facilities in the country -- is sustained in part by public silence. Mental illness remains heavily stigmatized, and individuals experiencing psychiatric crises and their families are often too overwhelmed to advocate for systemic change. Citizen engagement is essential to building the political will for reforms that will cost billions of dollars and require overcoming entrenched opposition from fiscal conservatives, insurers, and some disability rights advocates who view bed expansion as a return to institutionalization.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the Treatment Advocacy Center's state-by-state data on psychiatric bed capacity to understand your state's shortage: <https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/evidence-and-research/learn-more-about/3696>
- Review your state's per-capita psychiatric bed rate (national average: 11.7 per 100,000 in 2024) and compare it to the recommended minimum of 40-60 per 100,000
- Subscribe to NAMI's policy newsletter for monthly federal and state legislative updates: <https://www.nami.org/advocacy>
- Follow SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Barometer for annual data on mental health treatment access in your state: <https://www.samhsa.gov/data/behavioral-health-barometer>
- Read Pete Earley's *Crazy: A Father's Search Through America's Mental Health Madness* for a powerful first-person account of navigating the inpatient system

### Make Personal Changes

- If you or a family member have experienced the psychiatric care system, document your experience (wait times, boarding incidents, discharge without follow-up, readmissions). Personal stories are among the most powerful advocacy tools.
- Learn your state's civil commitment process and the rights of patients and families during psychiatric emergencies. Most states have a 72-hour hold process; know the specific procedures in your state.
- If you have private insurance, request your insurer's medical necessity criteria for inpatient psychiatric care and compare them to criteria for medical/surgical inpatient care. Report discrepancies to your state insurance commissioner.
- Consider becoming a trained Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) volunteer or supporting CIT training for local law enforcement.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call your U.S. senators and representative to advocate for IMD exclusion repeal. This is the single most impactful federal legislative action (see phone script below). Contact your state legislators about state psychiatric bed investments and crisis stabilization funding.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS proposes rules related to Medicaid psychiatric coverage or MHPAEA enforcement, submit comments during the public comment period. Federal Register notices are published at <https://www.federalregister.gov>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When local news covers emergency department closures, homelessness, or criminal justice issues involving mental illness, write letters connecting these problems to the psychiatric bed shortage.
- **Share Information**: Share Treatment Advocacy Center and NAMI data on social media, particularly your state's specific psychiatric bed rate and how it compares to both the national average and international benchmarks.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a local mental health advocacy chapter through NAMI's affiliate network. If your community does not have a NAMI affiliate, consider starting one: <https://www.nami.org/Get-Involved/NAMI-Affiliates>
- Organize a community screening of a documentary on the mental health system (such as *Out of the Shadows* or *Bedlam*) and host a post-screening discussion with local mental health professionals and elected officials
- Partner with your local hospital's emergency department to understand the extent of psychiatric boarding in your community. Ask hospital administrators for data on average psychiatric wait times and boarding hours
- Attend your local mental health board meetings or county behavioral health authority meetings. These bodies often make funding decisions about crisis services and inpatient capacity
- Organize a Mental Health First Aid training course for community members, teachers, clergy, and first responders: <https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org>

### Build Coalitions

- Connect mental health advocates with emergency medicine professionals. The American College of Emergency Physicians is a powerful ally on psychiatric boarding reform and can provide data and testimony for legislative efforts.
- Build relationships with local law enforcement who regularly encounter individuals in psychiatric crisis. Officers are often among the most vocal advocates for expanded crisis services and psychiatric beds.
- Engage faith communities. Churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious institutions often serve as informal support systems for families affected by mental illness and can be powerful advocacy voices.
- Partner with homeless service providers and supportive housing organizations that regularly see the consequences of inadequate psychiatric care.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During federal budget and appropriations season (typically February through September), when SAMHSA, CMS, and HRSA budgets are being set
- When mental health legislation is pending in committee (check NAMI's legislative tracker at <https://www.nami.org/advocacy/policy-priorities>)
- After high-profile incidents involving untreated mental illness (mass violence, police encounters, homelessness crises), when political attention is momentarily focused on mental health
- During state legislative sessions when behavioral health budgets, crisis service funding, and civil commitment laws are considered

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support IMD Exclusion Repeal and Psychiatric Bed Expansion

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City] to urge your support for
repealing the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD)
exclusion, which bars Medicaid reimbursement for adults ages 21-64
in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds.

The United States has only 11.7 psychiatric beds per 100,000
population, a more than 95% decline from 1955 levels. In [State],
psychiatric patients wait an average of [X] hours in emergency
departments for inpatient placement. The IMD exclusion is the single
largest financial barrier to expanding psychiatric bed capacity.

I ask you to co-sponsor legislation to repeal the IMD exclusion and
to support full funding for SAMHSA's crisis stabilization and
psychiatric workforce programs. Every major mental health
organization, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the
National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors
support this reform.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City].
I'm calling about the psychiatric bed shortage and the Medicaid IMD
exclusion. Our state has only [X] psychiatric beds per 100,000
people, well below the recommended minimum. I'd like the
[Representative/Senator] to support repealing the IMD exclusion,
which blocks Medicaid from paying for psychiatric hospital care.
Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **IMD Exclusion Repeal Bills**: Multiple bills have been introduced in recent Congresses to repeal or modify the IMD exclusion. Check the current Congress for active bills through NAMI's legislative tracker or Congress.gov.
- **Mental Health Parity Enforcement**: Support legislation strengthening MHPAEA enforcement, including creating a private right of action for patients denied medically necessary psychiatric care.
- **988 Implementation Funding**: The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline needs a crisis care delivery system behind it. Support full appropriations for SAMHSA's crisis care programs.
- **Psychiatric Workforce Bills**: Support Medicare GME expansion for psychiatric residency positions and loan repayment programs for psychiatric providers in underserved areas.
- **State-Level Crisis Service Legislation**: Many states are considering legislation to fund crisis stabilization units, mobile crisis teams, and bed registries. Contact your state legislators to support these initiatives.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support repealing the Medicaid IMD exclusion, which prevents Medicaid from paying for psychiatric hospital care for adults in facilities with more than 16 beds?"
2. "What is your plan to address emergency department psychiatric boarding, where patients in mental health crises wait an average of 8 hours -- and sometimes days -- for an inpatient bed?"
3. "Will you support federal investment in expanding psychiatric bed capacity, which has declined by more than 95% per capita since 1955?"
4. "How do you plan to address the psychiatric workforce shortage, which leaves many new psychiatric units unable to find staff?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who serve on health, appropriations, or judiciary committees where mental health legislation is considered
- Check candidates' positions on Medicaid expansion and mental health parity -- support for these programs is a strong indicator of willingness to support psychiatric care reform
- Evaluate whether candidates distinguish between inpatient and outpatient mental health needs; effective reform requires both

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing inpatient psychiatric care reform with others, emphasize:

1. **The numbers are stark**: The U.S. has only 11.7 psychiatric beds per 100,000 population, a 95%+ per-capita decline since 1955. Comparable nations average 30-70 beds per 100,000. We have fewer psychiatric beds per capita than at any point since the 1850s.
2. **Jails are the new asylums**: 44% of jail inmates and 37% of state prisoners have a diagnosed mental health condition. The three largest psychiatric facilities in the country are the Los Angeles County Jail, Cook County Jail, and Rikers Island.
3. **A single policy is at the center**: The Medicaid IMD exclusion, enacted in 1965, bars federal Medicaid reimbursement for psychiatric inpatient care in facilities with more than 16 beds. No other medical condition has a comparable exclusion. Repealing it is the single most impactful reform.
4. **Emergency departments are overwhelmed**: Psychiatric patients wait an average of 8 hours for inpatient placement -- far longer than any other patient population. This harms psychiatric patients and delays care for all other ED patients.
5. **It costs more to do nothing**: Untreated serious mental illness costs the U.S. economy over $280 billion annually through emergency department visits, incarceration, homelessness services, and lost productivity (NAMI, 2023).

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "We closed the asylums because they were inhumane; we should not go back." | Modern inpatient care bears no resemblance to mid-century state hospitals. The goal is modern, accredited, short-stay acute care facilities -- not long-term warehousing. | Treatment Advocacy Center, 2020 |
| "Community services can replace inpatient beds." | Community services are essential but cannot substitute for inpatient care when a patient is acutely psychotic, suicidal, or gravely disabled. Both are needed simultaneously. | SAMHSA National Guidelines, 2020 |
| "Expanding beds will lead to mass involuntary commitment." | The vast majority of psychiatric admissions (approximately 70%) are voluntary. Expanding beds primarily reduces wait times for patients who want treatment. | HCUP/AHRQ, 2023 |
| "The IMD exclusion protects against institutionalization." | The exclusion has not prevented institutionalization; it has redirected it to jails, prisons, and emergency departments -- settings far less therapeutic than psychiatric hospitals. | Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023 |
| "We cannot afford to expand psychiatric beds." | The U.S. spends over $280 billion annually on the downstream consequences of untreated serious mental illness. Investing in psychiatric beds reduces these costs. | NAMI, 2023 |
