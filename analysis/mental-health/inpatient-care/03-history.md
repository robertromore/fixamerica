# Inpatient Psychiatric Care: History

## Historical Development

The history of inpatient psychiatric care in the United States is a story of pendulum swings between institutional and community-based approaches, shaped by evolving understandings of mental illness, changing political ideologies, the development of psychiatric medications, and recurring failures of implementation. Understanding this history is essential because many of today's problems, including the bed shortage, the IMD exclusion, and the criminalization of mental illness, are the direct consequences of policy decisions made decades ago.

### The Asylum Era (1773-1945): Rise of Institutional Care

- **Early institutions**: The first American psychiatric hospital was the Public Hospital of Williamsburg, Virginia, established in 1773. Throughout the early 1800s, states began building public asylums based on the "moral treatment" philosophy, which held that structured environments could cure mental illness.
- **Dorothea Dix's crusade**: Beginning in 1841, Dorothea Dix launched a national campaign to improve treatment of the mentally ill, successfully lobbying more than 30 states and the federal government to establish or expand state psychiatric hospitals. By 1880, the U.S. had 140 public psychiatric hospitals.
- **Overcrowding and decline**: By the late 1800s, the moral treatment model had given way to custodial warehousing. State hospitals became severely overcrowded, understaffed, and underfunded. Average institutional populations grew from hundreds to thousands per facility. Conditions deteriorated as states treated hospitals as repositories for the unwanted rather than therapeutic institutions.
- **Peak institutionalization**: State psychiatric hospital populations peaked at approximately 559,000 patients in 1955, representing roughly 340 per 100,000 population. The average length of stay was measured in years or decades, and many patients spent their entire adult lives institutionalized.

### The Deinstitutionalization Era (1945-1980): Emptying the Hospitals

- **Expose journalism**: A series of journalistic exposes in the 1940s and 1950s, including Albert Deutsch's *The Shame of the States* (1948) and the Life magazine photo essay "Bedlam 1946," revealed horrific conditions in state hospitals, generating public outrage and political pressure for reform.
- **Chlorpromazine revolution**: The introduction of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) in 1954 provided the first effective pharmacological treatment for psychosis, making it conceivable to manage severe mental illness outside of hospital settings. This pharmaceutical breakthrough provided the clinical rationale for deinstitutionalization.
- **Community Mental Health Act (1963)**: President John F. Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act, which authorized federal funding for community mental health centers intended to replace state hospitals. Kennedy envisioned a nationwide network of 2,000 centers; fewer than 800 were ever built, and most never provided the full range of services originally intended.
- **Medicaid and the IMD exclusion (1965)**: When Congress created Medicaid in 1965 as part of the Social Security Amendments, it included the Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, barring federal Medicaid payments for care of adults ages 21-64 in facilities with more than 16 beds that primarily treat mental illness. The exclusion was intended to prevent states from simply shifting the cost of their existing state hospital populations to the new federal program. However, it created a powerful financial incentive for states to close state hospital beds, since they received no federal matching funds for those patients.
- **Rapid depopulation**: State hospital populations plummeted from 559,000 in 1955 to approximately 215,000 by 1974 and continued falling. Between 1955 and 1980, the state hospital census declined by more than 60%.
- **O'Connor v. Donaldson (1975)**: The Supreme Court ruled that a state cannot constitutionally confine a non-dangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom, either alone or with the help of willing and responsible family members or friends. This decision, along with other court rulings expanding patients' rights, further accelerated deinstitutionalization.

### The Failed Transition (1980-2000): Community Care That Never Arrived

- **Reagan-era retrenchment**: In 1981, President Reagan signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, which converted federal community mental health center funding into block grants with reduced funding levels. This effectively ended the federal commitment to building community mental health centers that Kennedy had envisioned.
- **Homelessness crisis**: The combined effect of deinstitutionalization without adequate community alternatives and the loss of federal mental health funding produced a visible homelessness crisis in the 1980s. Estimates suggested that one-third or more of the homeless population had a serious mental illness.
- **Trans-institutionalization to jails**: As hospital beds disappeared, jails and prisons became the de facto mental health system. By 1999, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that 16% of state prison inmates and 16% of jail inmates had a mental health condition, and advocacy groups noted that the Los Angeles County Jail, Cook County Jail, and Rikers Island had become the three largest psychiatric facilities in the nation.
- **Continued bed closures**: State hospital beds continued to decline throughout this period, falling to approximately 57,000 by 2000 (SAMHSA). Community services grew, but never at a pace or scale sufficient to replace institutional capacity.

### The Modern Crisis (2000-Present): Capacity Collapse and Emergency System Strain

- **Accelerated bed losses**: Between 2000 and 2024, the nation lost an additional 20,000+ psychiatric beds. Many general hospitals closed or downsized psychiatric units due to low Medicaid reimbursement, workforce shortages, and the IMD exclusion's financial disincentives.
- **Emergency department boarding emerges**: By the mid-2000s, psychiatric boarding in emergency departments had become a widely recognized crisis. The American College of Emergency Physicians began tracking and publicizing the problem, with average boarding times steadily increasing.
- **Parity legislation**: The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 required insurance plans to cover mental health services on par with medical/surgical services. While an important step, it did not address the supply-side shortage of beds and providers.
- **21st Century Cures Act (2016)**: This legislation included provisions allowing states to apply for Medicaid Section 1115 waivers to receive Medicaid reimbursement for short-term stays (up to 30 days) in IMDs, initially for substance use disorders and later expanded to serious mental illness in 2018.
- **COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2024)**: The pandemic produced a surge in psychiatric emergencies, particularly among adolescents, while simultaneously reducing available inpatient capacity due to infection control measures, staff illness, and burnout. Psychiatric ED visits increased 31% among adults and 45% among adolescents from 2019 to 2022.
- **988 launch (2022)**: The implementation of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline created an accessible entry point to crisis care, but exposed the lack of crisis receiving and inpatient capacity to serve callers in acute distress.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Deinstitutionalization Without Community Investment

The central lesson of the past 70 years is that closing institutional beds without building adequate community alternatives produces catastrophic results. The community mental health center system envisioned by Kennedy was never fully funded or built, and the 1981 block grant conversion further weakened it. The pattern has repeated at the state level: states close hospital beds to reduce costs, promise to redirect savings to community services, and then redirect the savings elsewhere. The result is a system with neither sufficient institutional nor community capacity.

### Pattern 2: Financial Incentives Drive System Design

The IMD exclusion demonstrates how a single financial policy can reshape an entire system of care. By making it financially advantageous for states to close large psychiatric facilities (which received no federal Medicaid match) and shift patients to general hospital EDs (which do receive Medicaid reimbursement under EMTALA), the exclusion created the very boarding crisis that plagues the system today. Financial incentive structures, not clinical evidence or patient needs, have been the dominant force shaping inpatient psychiatric capacity.

### Pattern 3: Pendulum Swings Between Extremes

The history of psychiatric care oscillates between institutional overreliance and institutional avoidance. Neither extreme has served patients well. The asylum era produced warehousing and abuse; the deinstitutionalization era produced homelessness and incarceration. A sustainable system requires a middle path that includes adequate inpatient capacity alongside robust community services, but achieving this balance has proven politically and financially difficult.

### Pattern 4: Crisis Drives Reform, But Reform Is Incomplete

Major policy changes, from the Community Mental Health Act to the 21st Century Cures Act, have consistently been prompted by visible crises (institutional abuse, homelessness, ED boarding). However, each reform has addressed only part of the problem, often creating new unintended consequences. Comprehensive reform that addresses the entire continuum of care has never been enacted.
