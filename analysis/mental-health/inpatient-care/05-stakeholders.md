# Inpatient Psychiatric Care: Stakeholders

The inpatient psychiatric care system is shaped by the interactions of patients, families, healthcare providers, payers, government agencies, and advocacy organizations, each with distinct and sometimes conflicting interests, resources, and levels of power.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Adults with serious mental illness (SMI) | Directly affected by bed availability, quality of care, length of stay, and discharge planning | ~14.2 million adults (5.6% of U.S. adults) with SMI (SAMHSA, 2023) | Access to timely inpatient care when needed, humane treatment conditions, effective discharge planning, continuity of care |
| Psychiatric emergency patients | Subjected to ED boarding when beds are unavailable; face restraint, sedation, and prolonged waits | ~4.3 million psychiatric ED visits annually (HCUP, 2023) | Rapid assessment and placement, safety during boarding, connection to appropriate care |
| Children and adolescents with acute psychiatric needs | Board in EDs at higher rates than adults; limited pediatric psychiatric beds | ~2.6 million youth with severe emotional disturbance (SAMHSA, 2023) | Age-appropriate care, educational continuity during hospitalization, family involvement |
| Families and caregivers of people with SMI | Bear emotional, financial, and caregiving burden; navigate fragmented system | ~8.4 million family caregivers of adults with SMI (NAMI, 2023) | Accessible crisis care, communication from providers, discharge planning that includes family, respite |
| Involuntarily committed patients | Loss of liberty; subjected to forced treatment; legal rights at stake | ~2.0 million involuntary evaluations annually (SAMHSA, 2023) | Due process protections, access to legal representation, least restrictive treatment, restoration of rights |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **People experiencing homelessness with mental illness**: An estimated 250,000+ people who are homeless have a serious mental illness (HUD, 2023). Lack of inpatient beds contributes to chronic homelessness and cycling between shelters, streets, and emergency departments.
- **Incarcerated individuals with mental illness**: 44% of jail inmates and 37% of state prisoners have a diagnosed mental health condition (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023). Many would be better served by psychiatric hospitalization but are diverted to the criminal justice system due to bed shortages.
- **Emergency department patients with non-psychiatric conditions**: ED boarding of psychiatric patients reduces capacity for all patients, extending wait times and contributing to ambulance diversion.
- **Law enforcement officers**: Police are often the first responders to mental health crises. They spend an estimated 21% of their time responding to mental health calls (PERF, 2022), frequently transporting individuals to EDs that cannot place them.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Writes legislation governing Medicaid, Medicare, and mental health programs | Can repeal or modify IMD exclusion; authorizes funding | Controls federal appropriations | High |
| Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) | Administers Medicaid/Medicare; approves Section 1115 waivers | Regulates IMD exclusion enforcement; approves waiver applications | $1.5 trillion in annual spending authority | High |
| State legislatures | Appropriate state mental health budgets; set civil commitment laws | Control state psychiatric hospital funding; write involuntary hold statutes | State general fund budgets | High |
| State mental health authorities (SMHAs) | Operate state psychiatric hospitals; administer community mental health systems | Direct authority over state-funded psychiatric beds and programs | $44.5 billion nationally (FY2023) | Medium-High |
| State Medicaid directors | Administer state Medicaid programs; negotiate managed care contracts | Determine reimbursement rates; apply for IMD waivers | State Medicaid budgets (federal/state) | Medium-High |
| Hospital CEOs/boards | Decide whether to operate psychiatric units; set bed counts | Control capital allocation and service line decisions | Individual hospital budgets | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration)**: Federal agency that funds mental health programs, collects data on bed capacity through the National Mental Health Services Survey, and administers block grants. Annual budget of approximately $7.5 billion (FY2024). Influence: medium-high on policy direction; limited direct authority over bed capacity.
- **National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD)**: Represents state mental health commissioners. Coordinates state positions on federal policy, publishes research on state psychiatric hospital systems, and advocates for increased funding. Influence: high on state-level decisions and federal advocacy.
- **American Hospital Association (AHA)**: Represents approximately 5,000 hospitals. Advocates on reimbursement rates, regulatory burden, and EMTALA enforcement. Has mixed record on psychiatric bed advocacy, as many member hospitals have closed psychiatric units.
- **Joint Commission**: Accredits hospitals including psychiatric facilities. Sets safety and quality standards. Influence: high on facility operations and quality metrics.

### Influencers

- **Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC)**: Leading advocacy organization focused on psychiatric bed capacity and involuntary treatment laws. Produces widely cited bed-count data and state-level rankings. Primary advocacy position: expand psychiatric beds and strengthen civil commitment laws. Influence: high on public narrative around bed shortage.
- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: Largest grassroots mental health organization with 600+ affiliates. Represents families and individuals affected by mental illness. Advocates for increased funding, parity enforcement, and system reform. Influence: high on grassroots advocacy and congressional engagement.
- **Mental Health America (MHA)**: National advocacy organization that publishes annual state-level mental health rankings. Emphasizes prevention and community-based services alongside inpatient capacity. Influence: medium on policy; high on public awareness.
- **Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law**: Leading legal advocacy organization focused on disability rights and community integration. Emphasizes alternatives to hospitalization and opposes expansion of involuntary commitment. Influence: high on legal and civil rights dimensions.
- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: Professional organization for psychiatrists. Publishes clinical guidelines, advocates for workforce development and reimbursement parity. Influence: high on clinical standards; medium on policy.
- **American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP)**: Represents emergency physicians. Has been a leading voice documenting and opposing psychiatric boarding. Influence: high on ED boarding policy and EMTALA enforcement.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAMI, TAC, APA, ACEP | Increasing psychiatric bed capacity and reducing ED boarding | Strong |
| State Medicaid directors, NASMHPD, AHA | Repealing or reforming the IMD exclusion to draw federal funding | Strong |
| Law enforcement organizations, NAMI, TAC | Reducing criminalization of mental illness through better acute care access | Moderate |
| Pediatric groups (AAP), children's hospitals, NAMI | Expanding pediatric psychiatric bed capacity specifically | Strong |
| NASMHPD, state legislatures, SAMHSA | Modernizing state psychiatric hospital infrastructure | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Bed expansion vs. community investment**: TAC and some family groups prioritize expanding inpatient beds, while the Bazelon Center and disability rights organizations argue resources should go to community-based alternatives that prevent hospitalization. This is the most persistent stakeholder conflict in the field.
- **Involuntary treatment vs. patient autonomy**: TAC and some family advocates support broadening involuntary commitment criteria, while the Bazelon Center, ACLU, and many consumer/survivor organizations oppose any expansion of forced treatment.
- **Federal fiscal responsibility vs. state needs**: Congress and CMS resist repealing the IMD exclusion due to cost concerns ($10-15 billion/year in new federal Medicaid spending), while states argue the exclusion is unjust and forces them to bear costs that Medicaid covers for every other medical condition.
- **Hospital financial interests vs. patient needs**: Hospitals facing financial pressure from psychiatric care may prefer to close psychiatric units rather than operate them at a loss, even though communities need the beds.

### The Iron Triangle of Inpatient Psychiatric Care

A self-reinforcing power structure maintains the status quo:

1. **State governments** avoid investing in state hospitals because the IMD exclusion means they get no federal match
2. **The federal government** maintains the IMD exclusion because repealing it would create massive new spending obligations
3. **Private insurers and managed care organizations** limit inpatient authorizations because shorter stays reduce costs
4. **Result**: All three powerful actors have financial incentives to limit psychiatric bed capacity, while the stakeholders most affected (patients and families) have the least political power

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on inpatient psychiatric care policy:

- **Lobbying**: The American Hospital Association spends approximately $25 million annually on federal lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023). Insurance industry lobbying exceeds $150 million annually across all health issues. Mental health advocacy organizations (NAMI, TAC, MHA combined) spend less than $5 million annually, creating a significant asymmetry.
- **Campaign Contributions**: Hospital and insurance industry PACs contribute tens of millions per election cycle to congressional campaigns. Mental health advocacy PACs contribute comparatively minimal amounts.
- **Litigation**: The Bazelon Center and ACLU use federal court litigation to enforce community integration requirements under *Olmstead v. L.C.* and to challenge conditions in state psychiatric hospitals. This legal strategy has been effective at driving state compliance but has sometimes contributed to bed closures without community alternatives.
- **Public Advocacy**: NAMI and TAC leverage family stories, media coverage of ED boarding and psychiatric homelessness, and grassroots campaigns (e.g., NAMI Walks, NAMI's "StigmaFree" campaign) to build public support. The 988 launch amplified public awareness of crisis care gaps.
- **Data and Expertise**: TAC's bed-count database, SAMHSA's National Mental Health Services Survey, and academic research from institutions like the National Bureau of Economic Research provide the evidence base that shapes policy debates.
