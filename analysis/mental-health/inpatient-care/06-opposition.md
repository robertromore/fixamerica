# Inpatient Psychiatric Care: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to expand inpatient psychiatric capacity and reform the IMD exclusion face resistance from several directions: fiscal conservatives concerned about federal spending, disability rights advocates who view institutional expansion as a step backward, libertarians who oppose involuntary treatment, and entrenched financial interests that benefit from the current system's constraints.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Federal budget hawks (OMB, CBO, fiscal conservatives in Congress) | Preventing $10-15 billion/year in new federal Medicaid spending from IMD exclusion repeal | Control of budget scoring and appropriations process | Classify IMD repeal as "budget-busting"; insist on offsets; delay legislation in committee |
| Disability rights organizations (Bazelon Center, ADAPT, DREDF) | Preventing a return to institutional warehousing; protecting community integration under *Olmstead* | Legal expertise; federal court litigation capacity; alliance with broader disability community | Litigation to enforce community integration; advocacy against bed expansion without community investment |
| Managed care organizations and commercial insurers | Maintaining low utilization and authorization rates for inpatient psychiatric care | $150+ billion lobbying apparatus across health insurance industry | Lobby against mandates to extend length of stay; resist reimbursement rate increases; support utilization review restrictions |
| Psychiatric survivor/consumer movement | Opposing expansion of involuntary treatment; protecting patient autonomy | Grassroots networks; lived experience authority; alliance with disability rights and civil liberties organizations | Public testimony; coalition with ACLU and Bazelon Center; challenge commitment law expansions in court |
| State budget offices (paradoxically) | Avoiding increased state Medicaid match obligations that could accompany IMD repeal | Control of state budget processes | Resist reforms that require new state spending even if federal match is available |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Libertarian**: Opposes involuntary commitment as a fundamental violation of individual liberty. Views forced treatment as government overreach, regardless of clinical justification. Favors voluntary treatment and private market solutions.
- **Disability rights**: Views institutional expansion as inconsistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Supreme Court's *Olmstead* decision requiring community integration. Argues that resources should go to supported housing, assertive community treatment, and peer support rather than inpatient beds.
- **Fiscal conservative**: Opposes the estimated $10-15 billion annual cost of repealing the IMD exclusion without identified offsets. Questions whether bed expansion is cost-effective compared to community alternatives.
- **Anti-coercion/civil liberties**: Views expansion of involuntary commitment criteria as a threat to civil liberties, particularly for marginalized populations. Notes racial disparities in involuntary commitment (Black individuals are committed at 2.4 times the rate of white individuals, according to Psychiatric Services, 2022).

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: IMD Exclusion Repeal Would Be Fiscally Irresponsible

**Claim**: Repealing the IMD exclusion would cost $10-15 billion annually in new federal Medicaid spending with no guaranteed improvement in outcomes, creating an open-ended fiscal liability at a time of record federal deficits.

**Evidence Cited**: CBO scoring estimates of IMD exclusion repeal; historical federal spending growth in Medicaid programs that lacked adequate cost controls.

**Reality**: While the direct cost of IMD repeal is significant, it must be weighed against the costs the current system already imposes. Avoidable psychiatric ED visits, incarceration of people with mental illness, homelessness services, and lost productivity associated with untreated serious mental illness cost an estimated $280 billion annually (NAMI, 2023). A portion of IMD repeal costs would be offset by reduced ED boarding costs (estimated at $2,264 per boarding episode, with hundreds of thousands of episodes annually), reduced jail/prison costs, and reduced Medicaid spending on repeat ED visits.

**Rebuttal**: The federal government already pays for psychiatric crises through the most expensive and least effective channels (emergency departments under EMTALA, Medicaid-funded general hospital admissions, federal disability programs). Investing upstream in adequate inpatient capacity is likely to reduce total system costs, not increase them. Phased implementation with spending caps could address legitimate fiscal concerns.

### Argument 2: Expanding Beds Would Reverse Deinstitutionalization Progress

**Claim**: Building more psychiatric beds risks recreating the abusive institutional system that the disability rights movement spent decades dismantling. Any expansion of institutional capacity violates the *Olmstead* principle that people with disabilities should receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate.

**Evidence Cited**: Historical abuses in state psychiatric hospitals documented by Dorothea Dix, Albert Deutsch, and subsequent investigations; *Olmstead v. L.C.*, 527 U.S. 581 (1999); Department of Justice investigations finding inadequate conditions in state psychiatric facilities.

**Reality**: The current system produces its own set of abuses: patients boarding for days in emergency departments without treatment, people with severe mental illness incarcerated in jails and prisons, and individuals dying on the streets from untreated illness. The choice is not between institutional care and community care; both are needed. *Olmstead* itself recognizes that institutional placement is appropriate when "the individual's treatment professionals determine that such placement is appropriate" and "the affected persons do not oppose such treatment." The 2024 system lacks adequate capacity at every level, inpatient and community alike.

**Rebuttal**: Modern inpatient psychiatric care, with accreditation standards, patient rights protections, trauma-informed care models, and quality reporting, is fundamentally different from the asylum system of the 1950s. Advocates for expansion can and do support robust community services simultaneously. The false dichotomy between beds and community services has paralyzed reform for decades; both must be expanded.

### Argument 3: Community Alternatives Are More Effective and Humane

**Claim**: Evidence-based community programs like Assertive Community Treatment (ACT), crisis stabilization units, supported housing, and peer support services produce better outcomes at lower cost than inpatient hospitalization. Resources should be directed to these alternatives rather than beds.

**Evidence Cited**: Research on ACT teams showing reduced hospitalization (Cochrane Review, 2010); crisis stabilization units diverting 60-70% of ED presentations from hospitalization (SAMHSA, 2023); supported housing reducing homelessness among people with SMI (HUD studies).

**Reality**: Community alternatives are effective for many individuals and should be expanded. However, they cannot replace inpatient care for patients who are acutely psychotic, actively suicidal, or gravely disabled. Crisis stabilization units typically have maximum stays of 23 hours and cannot manage patients requiring longer stabilization. ACT teams reduce but do not eliminate hospitalization. The evidence consistently shows that a functioning mental health system requires both robust community services and adequate inpatient capacity.

**Rebuttal**: The community vs. institutional framing is a false choice. International models (Australia, United Kingdom, Canada) demonstrate that adequate inpatient capacity and strong community services are complementary, not competing priorities. The U.S. has the worst of both worlds: insufficient community services and insufficient beds.

### Argument 4: Expanding Involuntary Commitment Would Violate Civil Rights

**Claim**: Proposals to broaden involuntary commitment criteria or extend hold durations threaten fundamental constitutional rights, particularly for racial minorities and low-income individuals who are disproportionately subject to involuntary commitment.

**Evidence Cited**: Racial disparities in involuntary commitment rates (Black individuals committed at 2.4 times the rate of white individuals); historical misuse of psychiatry to control dissent; constitutional protections under the 14th Amendment and *O'Connor v. Donaldson*.

**Reality**: Racial and socioeconomic disparities in involuntary commitment are real and must be addressed. However, the alternative to involuntary commitment for individuals who are gravely disabled or dangerous is often not freedom but rather homelessness, incarceration, or death. An estimated 10% of all law enforcement-related fatalities involve people with untreated mental illness (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). The civil rights of people with serious mental illness must include the right to receive treatment when illness impairs their capacity to seek it voluntarily.

**Rebuttal**: Reform proposals can and should include strong due process protections, independent oversight, racial disparity monitoring, and regular judicial review. The goal is not to expand coercive power but to ensure that people in psychiatric crisis receive appropriate care rather than being jailed, left to deteriorate, or killed in encounters with law enforcement.

### Argument 5: The Private Market Will Solve the Shortage

**Claim**: If government gets out of the way by removing CON requirements and reducing regulation, private psychiatric hospital companies will build beds where demand exists. Market forces are more efficient than government planning at allocating resources.

**Evidence Cited**: Growth of for-profit psychiatric hospital chains (Acadia Healthcare, Universal Health Services); responsiveness of private sector to market signals.

**Reality**: For-profit psychiatric hospitals have expanded in some areas, but they tend to concentrate in affluent suburban markets, avoid Medicaid-heavy populations, and select patients with better insurance and less acute conditions. The most underserved populations, Medicaid recipients, uninsured individuals, and patients with the most severe illness, are not profitable to serve. Market forces alone cannot solve a shortage driven primarily by a federal reimbursement policy (the IMD exclusion) that removes the largest payer from the market.

**Rebuttal**: Removing regulatory barriers like CON laws is a useful complement to reform, but it is not sufficient. The core problem is financial, not regulatory. Without Medicaid reimbursement for psychiatric facilities (currently blocked by the IMD exclusion), no amount of market deregulation will produce adequate bed capacity for the populations most in need.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

The opposition to inpatient psychiatric care expansion has followed a consistent pattern since the 1960s:

1. **1960s-1970s**: Opposition to institutional care focused on documented abuses and the civil rights of patients. This was legitimate and necessary, producing important legal protections.
2. **1980s-1990s**: Fiscal opposition became dominant as states sought to close hospitals to save money, framing the closures as "community integration" even when community alternatives were not available.
3. **2000s-present**: The disability rights and fiscal arguments have merged, with advocacy organizations citing *Olmstead* while budget offices cite cost. The result is a coalition of convenience that effectively blocks both inpatient expansion and adequate community investment.

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Build a bipartisan coalition**: Mental health has unusual bipartisan appeal. Frame bed expansion as public safety (conservative appeal), social justice (liberal appeal), and cost-effectiveness (centrist appeal). The 988 launch and post-COVID mental health awareness create a political window.
- **Link to criminal justice reform**: Connect psychiatric bed expansion to reducing jail populations, which appeals to both progressive reformers and fiscal conservatives concerned about incarceration costs.
- **Leverage the pediatric crisis**: The children's mental health emergency has generated broad public sympathy. Using pediatric boarding as the leading narrative can build support that extends to the broader system.

### Communication Strategies

- **Replace "institutional expansion" with "crisis care access"**: Framing matters. "Building more psychiatric institutions" evokes the asylum era; "ensuring crisis care access for people in psychiatric emergencies" focuses on patient needs.
- **Lead with stories**: Individual stories of patients boarding in emergency departments for days, families unable to get care for loved ones, and law enforcement officers describing mental health calls are more persuasive than statistics.
- **Acknowledge the history**: Proactively acknowledge the abuses of the asylum era and explain how modern reforms include safeguards (accreditation, patient rights, community integration requirements).

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Pair bed expansion with community investment**: Design legislation that funds both inpatient capacity and community services (ACT teams, supported housing, crisis stabilization), making it harder for opponents to argue that one comes at the expense of the other.
- **Include strong civil rights protections**: Build in racial disparity monitoring, independent oversight, maximum hold durations with judicial review, and patient advocate positions to address disability rights and civil liberties concerns.
- **Phase IMD exclusion repeal**: Start with expanded waivers (increasing from 30-day to 60-day stays) before moving to full repeal, allowing CBO to score manageable fiscal impacts and building evidence of cost-effectiveness.
