# Mental Illness and Homelessness

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of the intersection between mental illness and homelessness in the United States, examining how untreated psychiatric conditions contribute to housing instability and how the experience of homelessness exacerbates mental health crises.

## Overview

Mental illness is both a cause and consequence of homelessness. Approximately 30% of people experiencing chronic homelessness have a serious mental illness, and an estimated 50% or more have some form of mental health condition. The legacy of deinstitutionalization -- which closed most state psychiatric hospitals between the 1960s and 1990s without building adequate community-based alternatives -- left hundreds of thousands of people with severe mental illness without stable housing or consistent treatment. Today, jails and emergency rooms have become the de facto mental health system for many unhoused individuals.

Federal programs including the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program, HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH), and the Continuum of Care (CoC) framework provide critical but insufficient resources. The Housing First model, which provides permanent supportive housing without requiring sobriety or treatment compliance as a precondition, has demonstrated strong evidence of effectiveness. However, the supply of supportive housing units remains far below demand, and the 2024 Supreme Court decision in *Grants Pass v. Johnson* has reshaped the legal landscape governing encampment enforcement and the rights of people experiencing homelessness.

This analysis examines the prevalence and nature of mental illness among homeless populations, the historical trajectory of deinstitutionalization, evidence-based interventions including Housing First and street outreach, the federal and state policy framework, and proposals for closing the gap between current services and demonstrated need.
