# Mental Illness and Homelessness: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes mental illness and homelessness policy through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. The topic raises fundamental questions about the government's obligation to provide housing and treatment for people who cannot care for themselves, the limits of individual autonomy when mental illness impairs decision-making, and whether public resources should be directed toward enforcement or services. Each perspective offers a distinct vision of the proper relationship between the state, the individual, and the community in addressing this crisis.

Different political traditions offer distinct visions for how to approach mental illness and homelessness. This analysis examines the issue through 9 distinct political perspectives, exploring how each tradition approaches the core questions and proposed solutions.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of January 2025)

| Bill/Amendment | Type | Current Status | Last Action |
|----------------|------|----------------|-------------|
| Permanent Supportive Housing Expansion Act | Federal | Proposed | Drafted; not yet introduced |
| Community Mental Health Infrastructure Act | Federal | Proposed | Drafted; not yet introduced |
| Model Institutional Discharge Planning Act | State Model | Proposed | Available for state adoption |

*Note: Status reflects 119th Congress. See [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md) for full bill text.*

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is fiscal responsibility and personal accountability; underlying concern often includes NIMBY resistance and ideological opposition to "enabling" |
| Principle consistency | Fiscal conservatism should support PSH (which saves money), but many conservatives oppose PSH spending despite cost-offset evidence |
| Goalpost stability | Goalposts shift: opposition to Housing First shifts from "too expensive" to "enables substance use" when cost data is presented |
| Zero-sum behavior | Sometimes frames housing vs. treatment as either/or rather than both/and |

**Justification:** Conservative positions on homelessness and mental health display mixed consistency. The principled fiscal conservative position supports cost-effective interventions (PSH saves $30,000-$50,000 per person per year), but many conservatives oppose PSH funding for ideological reasons unrelated to cost. The treatment-first position is principled but sometimes serves as a proxy for opposing any housing expansion.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Manhattan Institute publications critique Housing First while advocating enforcement-oriented approaches, despite cost data favoring Housing First
- Congressional Republicans have historically underfunded CoC and PATH programs relative to demonstrated need and cost-effectiveness
- Conservative support for HUD-VASH (veteran homelessness) demonstrates willingness to fund PSH when the population is politically sympathetic

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Generally accepts data on homelessness prevalence and mental illness rates; may dispute emphasis on systemic causes over individual factors |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Disagrees with emphasis on housing market failure and government disinvestment; attributes greater weight to substance abuse, personal choices, and permissive policies |

**Source references:**

- Manhattan Institute. "A New Approach to Homelessness." 2023.
- American Enterprise Institute. "Rethinking Homelessness Policy." 2022.
- Heritage Foundation budget analyses opposing expanded HUD spending.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion | 4/10 | Too expensive; no accountability | Ideological opposition to government housing programs; NIMBY in conservative districts |
| CCBHC Expansion | 6/10 | Reasonable if fiscally responsible | Acceptable as community-level intervention; concerns about Medicaid spending growth |
| ACT Team Expansion | 5/10 | Support if includes treatment accountability | Would prefer mandatory treatment components |
| Discharge Planning | 7/10 | Supports institutional accountability | Aligns with law-and-order values; prevents jail revolving door |
| Crisis Response Redesign | 4/10 | Concerned about displacing police | Resistance to civilian-led crisis response; support for law enforcement authority |
| Housing First Approach | 3/10 | Enables substance use; no personal responsibility | Fundamental philosophical disagreement with unconditional housing |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion Act | 3/10 | Opposes new mandatory spending; too much federal control | Deficit concerns; opposition to by-right zoning mandate as federal overreach |
| Community MH Infrastructure Act | 5/10 | Supports MH services; opposes Medicaid expansion mandate | Fiscal concerns about mandatory Medicaid benefit; supports voluntary CCBHC expansion |
| Discharge Planning Act (State) | 7/10 | Supports accountability; consistent with law-and-order values | May support if costs are manageable and enforcement is reasonable |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would support: expanding assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) and Kendra's Law models nationwide; requiring treatment compliance for continued housing assistance; enforcement-first approaches authorized by *Grants Pass*; faith-based and private-sector partnership models; block-granting homeless funding to states with maximum flexibility.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Religious Right (faith-based services), Populist (enforcement), Constitutionalist (states' rights in implementation)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (cost-effectiveness data may bridge), Liberal (discharge planning reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (fundamental disagreement on Housing First), Democratic Socialist (opposition to market-based approaches)

---

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern for compassionate, evidence-based policy generally aligns with actual priorities |
| Principle consistency | Consistently supports Housing First and expanded government services; occasional tension between housing rights and neighborhood concerns in liberal districts |
| Goalpost stability | Goals remain stable: expand PSH, fund services, protect civil rights |
| Zero-sum behavior | Minimal; generally supports both housing and treatment expansion |

**Justification:** Liberals have been the most consistent supporters of Housing First, PSH expansion, and increased federal spending on homelessness services. The main inconsistency arises in liberal cities where NIMBY opposition to supportive housing comes from liberal residents who support the concept but oppose specific projects in their neighborhoods.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic platform consistently supports expanded homeless services funding and Housing First
- Liberal cities (San Francisco, Portland, Seattle) have adopted Housing First but struggled with NIMBY opposition from liberal neighborhoods
- Congressional Democrats have supported CCBHC expansion, 988 funding, and HUD budget increases

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with data on homelessness, mental illness prevalence, and system failures |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees with deinstitutionalization analysis, housing market failures, and systemic causes; may place additional emphasis on racial disparities |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress. Reports on homelessness and mental health policy, 2022-2024.
- Democratic Party platform, 2024.
- Congressional Progressive Caucus budget priorities including HUD and SAMHSA increases.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion | 9/10 | Strongly supports; core policy priority | Would prefer even larger investment |
| CCBHC Expansion | 9/10 | Strongly supports nationwide expansion | Wants permanent program, not demonstration |
| ACT Team Expansion | 8/10 | Supports; wants voluntary model | May resist mandatory treatment components |
| Discharge Planning | 8/10 | Supports institutional accountability | Wants to ensure due process protections |
| Crisis Response Redesign | 9/10 | Strongly supports civilian-led crisis response | Wants to reduce police involvement in mental health |
| Housing First Approach | 9/10 | Core commitment; evidence-based | Strongly defends unconditional housing access |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion Act | 9/10 | Strong support; would cosponsor | May want to increase authorization levels |
| Community MH Infrastructure Act | 9/10 | Strong support; long-sought priority | Fully aligns with liberal mental health policy goals |
| Discharge Planning Act (State) | 8/10 | Supports with due process protections | Wants to ensure individual rights are protected in discharge process |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would add: racial equity requirements for PSH siting and services; expanded Medicaid coverage beyond ACT to include all housing-related services; repeal of the Medicaid IMD exclusion; greater investment in homelessness prevention (eviction diversion, rental assistance).

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (shared commitment to government solutions), Democratic Socialist (shared commitment to public investment), Centrist (evidence-based overlap)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (cost-effectiveness arguments), Religious Right (compassion framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (fundamental disagreement on government role)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated commitment to structural reform and racial justice aligns with actual priorities |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies systemic analysis; may resist incremental solutions that do not address root causes |
| Goalpost stability | Goals are expansive (housing as a right) but stable; may reject compromise proposals as insufficient |
| Zero-sum behavior | Can view incremental reforms as co-optation rather than progress |

**Justification:** Progressives are philosophically aligned with the analysis of systemic failure and Housing First principles. However, their insistence on comprehensive solutions can lead to opposing incremental reforms that would produce immediate improvements. The progressive tendency to frame homelessness as primarily a housing affordability problem sometimes underweights the specific role of serious mental illness.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus budget proposals include substantial HUD and SAMHSA increases
- Progressive organizations (Center for Popular Democracy, National Homelessness Law Center) consistently advocate for housing as a right
- Some progressive voices resist involuntary treatment expansion, even when targeted at SMI populations

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement; would add more emphasis on racial disparities and systemic racism as drivers |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with deinstitutionalization analysis, housing market failure, and political economy; would add capitalism and commodified housing as root causes |

**Source references:**

- National Homelessness Law Center. Policy positions on criminalization and housing rights, 2023.
- Center for Popular Democracy. "Homes for All" campaign framework.
- Congressional Progressive Caucus. Budget priorities, FY2024-2025.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion | 8/10 | Supports but views as insufficient without broader housing reform | Wants universal housing guarantee, not just targeted PSH |
| CCBHC Expansion | 8/10 | Supports; wants to go further with universal mental health care | Views as incremental step toward single-payer mental health |
| ACT Team Expansion | 7/10 | Supports voluntary model; opposes coercive treatment | Concerned about civil liberties, racial disparities in involuntary treatment |
| Discharge Planning | 8/10 | Supports institutional accountability | Strong support for ending the jail-to-street pipeline |
| Crisis Response Redesign | 10/10 | Priority issue; defund police + invest in community response | Wants fundamental transformation of crisis response away from law enforcement |
| Housing First Approach | 10/10 | Non-negotiable principle; housing is a human right | Would expand beyond PSH to universal right to housing |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion Act | 7/10 | Supports but views as insufficient; would increase funding levels | Wants housing as a right, not just a program |
| Community MH Infrastructure Act | 8/10 | Supports; views as step toward universal mental health care | Would prefer single-payer model |
| Discharge Planning Act (State) | 8/10 | Strong support; would add stronger enforcement and racial equity requirements | Wants to ensure reform does not increase institutional control |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would add: a federal right to housing; social housing (publicly owned, permanently affordable); universal mental health care through single-payer system; reparations-informed housing policy addressing racial disparities; full repeal of anti-camping ordinances; decriminalization of all status offenses related to homelessness.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist (systemic reform), Liberal (Housing First commitment)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (evidence-based framing may find overlap), Populist (anti-elite framing of housing market failure)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (fundamental disagreement on government role), Libertarian (opposite views on state intervention)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Principled commitment to individual liberty and minimal government consistently applied |
| Principle consistency | Consistently opposes both government housing programs and involuntary treatment; internally coherent |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are stable: reduce government, expand markets, protect individual autonomy |
| Zero-sum behavior | Minimal; applies principles consistently even when politically inconvenient |

**Justification:** Libertarians apply their anti-government principles with high internal consistency. They oppose both government housing programs (which progressives support) and involuntary treatment expansion (which conservatives support). This consistency makes them principled but isolated -- their policy preferences are rarely adopted in full. Their support for zoning deregulation offers a genuine point of agreement with housing advocates.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute publications consistently oppose government housing subsidies while also opposing involuntary treatment
- Libertarian Party platform opposes both government housing programs and forced psychiatric treatment
- Reason Foundation supports zoning deregulation and land-use reform as the primary housing solution

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Accepts data on homelessness but attributes causes primarily to government failure (zoning, regulation) rather than market failure |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Strongly disagrees with the analysis's emphasis on inadequate government spending; views government as the cause, not the solution |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute. "Zoning, Land Use, and Housing Affordability." Policy Analysis series, 2022-2024.
- Reason Foundation. "Housing First Without Government." 2023.
- Libertarian Party Platform, Section on Housing and Health Care.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion | 2/10 | Government housing programs are wasteful and paternalistic | Opposes government provision of housing on principle |
| CCBHC Expansion | 3/10 | Government clinics crowd out private providers | Prefers market-based mental health delivery |
| ACT Team Expansion | 3/10 | Opposes if government-funded; opposes involuntary components | Bodily autonomy is paramount; cannot force treatment |
| Discharge Planning | 4/10 | Reasonable regulation of institutions; opposes unfunded mandates | Accepts minimal regulation of facilities receiving government funds |
| Crisis Response Redesign | 5/10 | Supports reducing police role; opposes government alternative | Agrees police should not handle mental health; prefers private/nonprofit crisis response |
| Housing First Approach | 3/10 | Opposes government implementation; respects voluntary principle | Appreciates non-coercive philosophy but opposes public funding |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion Act | 2/10 | Opposes new federal spending and zoning mandates | Fundamental opposition to federal housing programs |
| Community MH Infrastructure Act | 2/10 | Opposes Medicaid mandate and government clinic expansion | Prefers deregulation of mental health markets |
| Discharge Planning Act (State) | 4/10 | Accepts at state level; opposes federal version | State authority is more tolerable than federal mandates |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would support: comprehensive zoning deregulation to increase housing supply through market mechanisms; deregulation of mental health licensing to expand the provider pool; allowing nurse practitioners and other non-physicians to prescribe psychiatric medications without physician supervision; tax incentives for private charitable contributions to homelessness organizations; elimination of certificates of need for psychiatric facilities.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Constitutionalist (limited government), Conservative (market solutions)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (zoning deregulation, anti-coercion in treatment), Liberal (civil liberties on involuntary treatment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on government role), Populist (disagree on government intervention)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Principled commitment to federalism and enumerated powers generally consistent |
| Principle consistency | Applies federalism and limited government principles consistently across policy areas |
| Goalpost stability | Positions stable: federal government should not be doing this; states should decide |
| Zero-sum behavior | Minimal; genuinely prefers state-level solutions |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists apply federalism principles consistently. They object to federal housing and mental health mandates not because they oppose helping homeless people with mental illness, but because they believe these are state responsibilities. Their willingness to support state-level reforms makes them a potential partner for model legislation approaches.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Federalist Society publications emphasize state authority over housing and health policy
- Constitutional arguments against conditional spending and Medicaid mandates are consistently applied
- Support for state-level involuntary treatment reform (e.g., CARE Act) demonstrates willingness to address the problem through state action

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Generally accepts data; questions federal responsibility for what they view as state/local issues |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agrees that deinstitutionalization was mismanaged but views the appropriate remedy as state-level, not federal |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society. "The Constitutional Limits of Federal Homelessness Policy." Policy analysis, 2023.
- *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012) -- Limits on conditional Medicaid expansion as a constitutional principle.
- State legislatures as the appropriate venue for mental health and housing policy.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion | 3/10 | Federal government should not build housing; state/local responsibility | Enumerated powers do not include housing provision |
| CCBHC Expansion | 4/10 | Prefers state-administered programs without federal mandates | Supports concept at state level; opposes federal mandate |
| ACT Team Expansion | 4/10 | State decision; opposes federal Medicaid mandate | Prefers state Medicaid flexibility |
| Discharge Planning | 6/10 | Supports at state level; opposes federal CMS mandate | Model state legislation is appropriate; federal mandates are not |
| Crisis Response Redesign | 5/10 | Local government decision; not a federal role | Accepts local innovation; opposes federal program |
| Housing First Approach | 4/10 | Not a federal policy question; states should decide | Objects to HUD imposing Housing First on local CoCs |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion Act | 2/10 | Unconstitutional federal overreach; zoning is a state matter | By-right zoning condition violates federalism |
| Community MH Infrastructure Act | 3/10 | Medicaid mandate exceeds federal authority after *NFIB* | Coercive conditional spending |
| Discharge Planning Act (State) | 7/10 | Strong support for state model legislation approach | Appropriate use of state authority; consistent with federalism |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would support: block-granting all federal homelessness and mental health funds to states with minimal conditions; state-level involuntary treatment reform; repealing the Medicaid IMD exclusion to give states flexibility; state-administered supportive housing programs funded through state revenues; constitutional amendments only if needed to clarify state authority.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (limited government), Libertarian (anti-federal mandate)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (pragmatic state-level approaches), Populist (anti-federal establishment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (opposite views on federal role), Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on government expansion)

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern for "regular Americans" and public safety; underlying motivation often driven by cultural resentment toward homeless populations |
| Principle consistency | Anti-elite principles are applied selectively; supports government spending for "deserving" populations but not for homeless individuals perceived as undeserving |
| Goalpost stability | Positions shift based on political salience; enforcement demands increase when homelessness is in the news |
| Zero-sum behavior | High; frames resources for homeless people as coming "at the expense of" working families |

**Justification:** Populist positions on homelessness are among the least consistent. The populist anti-elite framework could logically support systemic analysis of how government and corporate failures created the crisis, but in practice, populist rhetoric tends to blame homeless individuals and advocate enforcement. The "deserving vs. undeserving poor" distinction drives inconsistent positions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Populist rhetoric in 2024 campaigns framed homelessness as a public safety issue requiring enforcement, despite cost data showing enforcement is more expensive than housing
- Populist support for veteran homelessness programs but opposition to general homeless services illustrates the deserving/undeserving distinction
- Encampment sweep proposals are populist priorities despite evidence they do not reduce homelessness

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Accepts that homelessness is a problem; frames it as public safety and quality-of-life issue rather than systemic policy failure |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Attributes homelessness primarily to drug use, personal choice, and permissive policies; rejects systemic/structural analysis |

**Source references:**

- Populist rhetoric in 2024 presidential and local campaigns emphasizing "clean up our streets" messaging
- Public opinion polls showing majority support for encampment enforcement (Pew Research Center, 2024)
- Media coverage framing homelessness as a public safety crisis rather than a housing or health crisis

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion | 3/10 | Taxpayer money should not go to people who "refuse help" | Views homeless people as choosing their condition |
| CCBHC Expansion | 4/10 | Supports mental health treatment if mandatory | Wants accountability; opposes voluntary-only approach |
| ACT Team Expansion | 5/10 | Supports if includes enforcement of treatment compliance | Wants mandatory treatment for people on the streets |
| Discharge Planning | 6/10 | Supports keeping people from "dumping" on communities | Frames as protecting neighborhoods from institutional releases |
| Crisis Response Redesign | 3/10 | Supports police; opposes "defund" framing | Strong support for law enforcement authority |
| Housing First Approach | 2/10 | Opposes unconditional housing; demands accountability | "Free housing" framing generates strong opposition |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion Act | 2/10 | Opposes "handouts" to people who refuse treatment | Views as rewarding bad behavior with housing |
| Community MH Infrastructure Act | 4/10 | Supports mental health treatment; opposes voluntary model | Wants mandatory treatment, not voluntary services |
| Discharge Planning Act (State) | 6/10 | Supports; frames as protecting communities | Aligns with "not in my backyard" concerns |

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would support: expanded involuntary commitment authority; mandatory treatment-conditional shelter access; enforcement of anti-camping ordinances under *Grants Pass*; drug courts with mandatory treatment; deportation of undocumented homeless individuals; preference for veterans and "local" homeless populations over "outsiders."

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (enforcement), Religious Right (personal responsibility)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (if framed as supporting working families), Centrist (cost-effectiveness framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (fundamental disagreement on enforcement vs. services), Libertarian (disagree on government intervention)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated commitment to evidence-based, pragmatic solutions generally aligns with priorities |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies cost-effectiveness and evidence criteria; pragmatism is a genuine principle |
| Goalpost stability | Goals are stable: what works, at what cost, with bipartisan support |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; genuinely seeks compromise and multi-stakeholder solutions |

**Justification:** Centrists are among the most reliable coalition partners on this issue because their commitment to evidence-based policy aligns with the strong research base for Housing First and PSH. The centrist position -- fund what works, measure results, build bipartisan coalitions -- provides a practical framework for moving legislation forward. The main limitation is that centrists may accept suboptimal compromises to secure bipartisan support.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center reports on homelessness emphasize cost-effectiveness and evidence-based approaches
- No Labels and Problem Solvers Caucus members have supported CCBHC expansion and HUD-VASH funding
- Centrist mayors (Houston, Columbus) have achieved significant homelessness reductions through pragmatic approaches

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with data-driven analysis of homelessness, mental illness, and system failures |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Largely agrees with systemic analysis; may place more weight on individual factors and local variation |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center. "Homelessness Policy Solutions." 2023.
- Third Way. "Evidence-Based Approaches to Homelessness and Mental Health." 2022.
- Houston model cited as centrist success story; Coalition for the Homeless of Houston/Harris County, 2023.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion | 8/10 | Supports; emphasizes cost-effectiveness data | Wants rigorous evaluation and performance accountability |
| CCBHC Expansion | 8/10 | Strong support; evidence base is compelling | Wants nationwide evaluation before full permanent authorization |
| ACT Team Expansion | 7/10 | Supports evidence-based model with fidelity standards | Pragmatic about workforce constraints |
| Discharge Planning | 8/10 | Strong support; prevents costly institutional cycling | Low-cost, high-impact intervention |
| Crisis Response Redesign | 7/10 | Supports co-response models (police + clinicians) | Prefers partnership over replacement of police |
| Housing First Approach | 7/10 | Supports based on evidence; willing to fund treatment alongside | May accept treatment-encouraging components to build conservative support |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion Act | 7/10 | Supports with fiscal accountability measures | May want lower authorization levels or phased approach |
| Community MH Infrastructure Act | 8/10 | Strong support; CCBHC evidence is compelling | Wants cost controls on Medicaid spending growth |
| Discharge Planning Act (State) | 8/10 | Strong support; practical, low-cost reform | Ideal centrist policy: evidence-based, bipartisan, cost-effective |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would emphasize: outcomes-based funding (pay for success); public-private partnerships for PSH development; local flexibility with federal performance standards; phased implementation with evaluation at each stage; bipartisan framing that avoids "Housing First" label while maintaining evidence-based principles.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (shared evidence base), Conservative (fiscal responsibility framing)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (evidence-based overlap), Religious Right (compassion framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (emotional rather than evidence-based approach), Libertarian (oppose government programs centrists support)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine compassion for suffering coexists with moral judgments about substance use and lifestyle |
| Principle consistency | Christian charity principles support helping homeless individuals; moral conservatism creates conditions on that help |
| Goalpost stability | Positions may shift based on faith community leadership and framing |
| Zero-sum behavior | Sometimes frames government programs as competing with faith-based services |

**Justification:** The Religious Right presents a complex picture. The Christian imperative to care for "the least of these" generates genuine compassion for homeless individuals with mental illness and has produced significant faith-based service delivery. However, moral conservatism around substance use and personal responsibility leads to support for treatment-conditional models and skepticism of harm reduction. The Religious Right's emphasis on faith-based organizations as the primary response mechanism can complement or compete with government programs.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Faith-based organizations (Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, Union Gospel Mission) are among the largest homeless service providers in the U.S.
- Religious Right politicians have supported faith-based initiatives funding but opposed Housing First's harm reduction philosophy
- National Association of Evangelicals has called for compassionate responses to homelessness while maintaining personal responsibility framing

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Acknowledges the crisis; may attribute greater weight to moral and spiritual causes alongside systemic ones |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Accepts some systemic analysis but adds breakdown of family, faith communities, and moral order as root causes |

**Source references:**

- National Association of Evangelicals. "Caring for the Vulnerable: A Statement on Homelessness." 2022.
- Faith-based service provider positions (Salvation Army, Catholic Charities USA).
- Heritage Foundation reports reflecting Religious Right policy preferences on social services.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion | 5/10 | Supports housing but wants faith-based provider participation | Concerned about excluding faith-based organizations from government contracts |
| CCBHC Expansion | 5/10 | Supports mental health treatment with spiritual component | Wants faith-based counseling included as an option |
| ACT Team Expansion | 6/10 | Supports treatment including spiritual care | Would include chaplaincy and faith-based peer support |
| Discharge Planning | 7/10 | Supports; consistent with caring for vulnerable populations | Wants faith-based organizations included in discharge planning |
| Crisis Response Redesign | 5/10 | Supports compassionate response; wary of replacing police | Prefers faith community involvement in crisis response |
| Housing First Approach | 4/10 | Opposes harm reduction; supports treatment and moral accountability | Theological objection to "enabling" substance use |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion Act | 4/10 | Supports concept; opposes if faith-based providers excluded | Wants explicit faith-based organization eligibility |
| Community MH Infrastructure Act | 5/10 | Supports mental health expansion; wants faith-based inclusion | Concerned about secular-only approach to treatment |
| Discharge Planning Act (State) | 7/10 | Supports; consistent with caring for vulnerable individuals | Natural fit with religious values around compassion |

#### Alternative Proposals

Religious Right would support: expanded funding for faith-based homeless services; "compassionate accountability" models requiring treatment engagement; chaplaincy and spiritual care integration in supportive housing; marriage and family strengthening programs to prevent homelessness; church-based transitional housing programs with mentorship.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (treatment accountability), Populist (personal responsibility)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (shared compassion for vulnerable), Centrist (pragmatic faith-secular partnership)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (disagree on harm reduction), Libertarian (disagree on role of faith in public policy)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to universal public provision and decommodification of housing |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies structural analysis and advocates public solutions across policy areas |
| Goalpost stability | Goals are expansive (housing as right, universal mental health) and stable |
| Zero-sum behavior | May oppose incremental reforms perceived as legitimizing market-based approaches |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists bring the most comprehensive structural analysis to homelessness and mental illness, viewing both as inherent consequences of commodified housing and privatized health care. Their positions are internally consistent and principled. The main limitation for coalition-building is that their insistence on public provision and decommodification can lead to opposing incremental reforms that would produce immediate improvements for people currently suffering.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- DSA platform explicitly calls for housing as a right and universal public mental health care
- Congressional DSA-aligned members (Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez) have introduced legislation for social housing and Medicare for All
- DSA housing committees in major cities advocate for public housing expansion and tenant protections

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with data and systemic analysis; would add emphasis on capitalist housing market as fundamental driver |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strong agreement with structural causes; would add commodification of housing and privatization of health care as root causes |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion | 7/10 | Supports but views as insufficient without decommodification | Wants public housing, not subsidized private development |
| CCBHC Expansion | 7/10 | Supports; step toward universal public mental health care | Prefers publicly owned and operated clinics |
| ACT Team Expansion | 8/10 | Supports public provision of intensive treatment | Wants publicly employed, well-compensated workforce |
| Discharge Planning | 8/10 | Strong support; institutional accountability is important | Aligns with structural analysis of system failures |
| Crisis Response Redesign | 9/10 | Supports transformation of crisis response away from policing | Wants public, community-controlled crisis systems |
| Housing First Approach | 9/10 | Strongly supports; housing is a fundamental right | Would embed in broader right-to-housing framework |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| PSH Expansion Act | 7/10 | Supports; would increase funding and add public ownership requirement | Prefers social housing over subsidized private development |
| Community MH Infrastructure Act | 8/10 | Strong support; step toward universal mental health care | Would expand to Medicare for All framework |
| Discharge Planning Act (State) | 8/10 | Supports; prevents institutional harm | Consistent with structural reform agenda |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic Socialists would support: federal right to housing with publicly owned social housing; Medicare for All including comprehensive mental health and substance use coverage; public employment programs for homeless services workers at living wages; wealth tax or corporate tax to fund housing and mental health; tenant unions and community land trusts; abolition of private prisons and jails.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (systemic reform), Liberal (government solutions)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (evidence-based framing may overlap), Populist (anti-elite framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (fundamental disagreement on government role), Libertarian (opposite views on state), Constitutionalist (oppose federal expansion)

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Discharge Planning | Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Constitutionalist (state), Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist, Populist | Libertarian | -- |
| CCBHC Expansion | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist, Conservative (moderate) | Religious Right, Populist, Constitutionalist | Libertarian |
| ACT Team Expansion | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist, Religious Right | Conservative, Populist, Constitutionalist | Libertarian |
| PSH Expansion | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative (limited), Religious Right | Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist |
| Crisis Response Redesign | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Religious Right | Conservative, Populist |
| Housing First | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | -- | Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right |

**Key insight:** Discharge planning reform has the broadest coalition support (8/9 perspectives). CCBHC and ACT expansion have moderate bipartisan support (5-6 perspectives). PSH expansion, crisis response redesign, and Housing First face significant ideological opposition that requires strategic coalition-building or reframing.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Universal Discharge Planning with Treatment Linkage

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Religious Right + Constitutionalist (state level)

**Core Agreement:** No person should be discharged from a psychiatric facility, hospital, or jail into homelessness. Institutional accountability is a shared value across the political spectrum.

**Policy Description:**

State-level legislation requiring all psychiatric hospitals, general hospital psychiatric units, jails, and emergency departments to develop written discharge plans with confirmed housing placement and linkage to voluntary mental health services. The federal government provides technical assistance and matching funds but does not mandate state action. Treatment linkage is required (a referral and appointment must be provided), but treatment compliance is not a condition of housing placement.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Institutional accountability; prevents "dumping" that creates public safety issues; treatment linkage addresses treatment-first concerns |
| Liberal | Prevents discharge to homelessness; protects individual rights through voluntary treatment model |
| Centrist | Evidence-based, cost-effective (reduced readmissions), bipartisan |
| Religious Right | Compassionate response; consistent with caring for vulnerable individuals |
| Constitutionalist | State-level legislation; respects federalism; no federal mandate |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Cannot require treatment compliance as condition of discharge placement |
| Liberal | Accepts state-by-state approach rather than federal mandate |
| Progressive | Accepts incremental reform that does not address housing supply |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts some federal technical assistance involvement |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives (all except Libertarian and Populist strong support)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High -- institutional accountability is a durable value across perspectives
- **Implementation Path:** Model state legislation introduced in 10+ states within 2 years; federal matching fund program established through SAMHSA

---

### Compromise 2: CCBHC Expansion with Faith-Based Inclusion and State Flexibility

**Bridges:** Liberal + Conservative + Centrist + Religious Right

**Core Agreement:** Community mental health services for people with serious mental illness are inadequate, and CCBHCs have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing emergency room visits and hospitalizations.

**Policy Description:**

Make CCBHC certification available in all 50 states with Prospective Payment System reimbursement through Medicaid. Include explicit eligibility for faith-based behavioral health providers to receive CCBHC certification if they meet clinical standards. Allow states flexibility in phasing implementation and integrating CCBHCs with existing community mental health infrastructure. Require CCBHCs to include street outreach and housing navigation services for homeless populations.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | State flexibility; faith-based inclusion; evidence of cost savings |
| Liberal | Nationwide access to comprehensive mental health services; addresses reimbursement gaps |
| Centrist | Evidence-based program with demonstrated outcomes; phased, pragmatic approach |
| Religious Right | Explicit faith-based provider eligibility; spiritual care as component of treatment |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts Medicaid reimbursement expansion (increased government spending) |
| Liberal | Accepts faith-based provider inclusion and state flexibility rather than uniform federal mandate |
| Progressive | Accepts incremental expansion rather than universal public mental health care |
| Religious Right | Accepts clinical standards requirements for faith-based providers |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Moderate-high -- evidence base strengthens over time; faith-based inclusion reduces opposition
- **Implementation Path:** Bipartisan legislation in Congress; SAMHSA issues updated certification criteria; states apply for CCBHC expansion within 2-3 years

---

### Compromise 3: Cost-Neutral Supportive Housing through Cross-System Savings Capture

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist (fiscal framing)

**Core Agreement:** The current system of cycling homeless individuals with mental illness through emergency rooms, jails, and shelters costs $30,000-$50,000 per person per year. Permanent supportive housing costs $20,000-$25,000 per person per year. Redirecting existing spending to housing is fiscally responsible.

**Policy Description:**

Establish federal demonstration projects in 20 communities that create cross-system savings accounts. Emergency room, jail, and shelter costs avoided through supportive housing placements are calculated annually, and a portion of documented savings is reinvested in additional supportive housing units. The program is designed to be cost-neutral within 3 years by redirecting existing emergency spending to prevention. Independent evaluation verifies savings. No new net federal spending is required after the initial 3-year demonstration investment.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Cost-neutral; reduces government waste; redirects existing spending more efficiently |
| Liberal | Expands supportive housing; evidence-based; demonstrates fiscal responsibility of Housing First |
| Centrist | Ultimate pragmatic proposal: saves money, improves outcomes, builds evidence |
| Populist | Frames as ending government waste on the revolving door; taxpayer savings |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts supportive housing as the mechanism (rather than enforcement or treatment-first) |
| Liberal | Accepts limited scale (20 demonstrations) rather than immediate national expansion |
| Progressive | Accepts cost-neutral framing rather than new investment framing |
| Populist | Accepts housing-based solution rather than enforcement |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (Conservative, Liberal, Centrist core; potential Progressive and Populist support)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Moderate -- depends on demonstrated savings; if savings materialize, coalition strengthens
- **Implementation Path:** Bipartisan pilot legislation; HUD/CMS/DOJ joint implementation; 3-year evaluation by independent researcher; reauthorization based on results

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable coalition for meaningful reform combines **Liberal, Centrist, and moderate Conservative** perspectives around evidence-based, cost-effective interventions. This coalition supports CCBHC expansion, discharge planning reform, and phased supportive housing investment -- the three reforms with the broadest support in the matrices above. Adding **Religious Right** support through faith-based inclusion provisions strengthens the coalition. The Houston model provides the proof of concept: a pragmatic, data-driven approach led by a moderate-conservative city government that achieved a 63% reduction in homelessness.

### Key Obstacles

Three obstacles prevent broader agreement:

1. **The Housing First divide**: Housing First is the evidence-based standard but faces philosophical opposition from 4-5 perspectives. Reframing (using "housing-led" or "rapid resolution" language) and pairing housing with treatment access can bridge some of this divide.
2. **Federal vs. state authority**: Constitutionalists and some Conservatives will oppose any federal mandate. Model state legislation and voluntary federal matching funds reduce this opposition.
3. **Enforcement vs. engagement**: After *Grants Pass*, the enforcement-engagement debate is more polarized than ever. The compromise position -- engagement before enforcement, with services offered during any enforcement action -- can bridge moderate positions.

### Low Consistency Partners

The **Populist** perspective (2/5 consistency) is the most unpredictable partner. Populist positions shift based on political salience and media coverage. The most effective strategy is to frame reforms around fiscal responsibility and protecting communities (which appeals to populist concerns) while designing policy that embeds evidence-based approaches. The **Conservative** and **Religious Right** perspectives (3/5 consistency) can be engaged through targeted framing -- cost-savings for conservatives, compassion and faith-based inclusion for the Religious Right.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with discharge planning reform**: The reform with broadest support (8/9 perspectives) that produces immediate results at minimal cost. State-level model legislation can be introduced in multiple states simultaneously.
2. **Build on CCBHC expansion**: Already has bipartisan Congressional support and a strong evidence base. Include faith-based provider eligibility and state flexibility to broaden the coalition.
3. **Frame supportive housing as fiscal responsibility**: Use the cost-savings argument ($20,000-$25,000 vs. $30,000-$50,000) to build conservative and centrist support. Launch cross-system savings demonstrations to generate new evidence.
4. **Avoid the "Housing First" label**: Use functionally equivalent language ("housing-led," "rapid resolution") when engaging resistant audiences. Maintain the evidence-based principles (no preconditions for housing) while adapting the framing.
5. **Include treatment alongside housing in all legislation**: Defuse the "housing vs. treatment" false binary by always funding both. This addresses conservative and Religious Right concerns without compromising Housing First principles.
