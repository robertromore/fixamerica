# Mental Illness and Homelessness: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to reform homelessness policy for people with mental illness face resistance from multiple directions. Some opposition comes from those who believe current approaches are too permissive and that enforcement and mandatory treatment should take priority. Other opposition comes from those who view expanded government intervention -- whether in housing or involuntary treatment -- as a threat to individual rights. Still other resistance stems from practical concerns about costs, siting, and unintended consequences.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Business improvement districts (BIDs) | Reduce visible homelessness near commercial properties | Millions in annual budgets from property assessments; direct access to city councils | Lobbying for enforcement, funding private security, opposing shelter/PSH siting |
| Neighborhood associations (NIMBY coalitions) | Prevent supportive housing construction in their communities | Volunteer organizing, legal challenges, zoning hearing testimony | Zoning appeals, lawsuits, political campaigns against supportive housing |
| Private prison/corrections companies | Maintain incarcerated population including mentally ill detainees | $8+ billion industry; campaign contributions; lobbying | Opposing diversion programs, supporting enforcement-first policies |
| Some law enforcement unions | Maintain authority over street management; avoid diversion to social services | Political influence, media relationships, collective bargaining power | Opposing civilian-led crisis response, supporting broader arrest authority |
| Conservative think tanks (Manhattan Institute, AEI) | Promote enforcement and accountability-based approaches over Housing First | Substantial research budgets, media access, policy influence | Publishing critiques of Housing First, advocating for treatment-conditional housing |
| ACLU and disability rights organizations | Protect civil liberties of homeless individuals; oppose involuntary treatment expansion | Legal resources, litigation capacity, public advocacy | Challenging involuntary treatment laws, opposing encampment sweeps, litigating forced treatment |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Conservative**: Government should not provide unconditional housing. Personal responsibility and treatment compliance should be required. Housing First "enables" substance use and untreated mental illness. Enforcement is necessary to maintain public order and protect community safety.
- **Libertarian**: Government housing programs are expensive and inefficient. Zoning deregulation and private market solutions should drive housing supply. Involuntary treatment is a violation of bodily autonomy. Reducing government intervention, not expanding it, will address root causes.
- **Progressive/Civil Liberties**: Involuntary treatment expansion threatens the rights of disabled people. Forced institutionalization has a racist history. People experiencing homelessness should have the right to refuse services. Enforcement-oriented approaches criminalize poverty.
- **Fiscal Conservative**: Supportive housing is too expensive per unit. Government programs create dependency. Private-sector solutions and faith-based organizations should lead. Federal mandates infringe on local decision-making.

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: Housing First Enables Substance Use and Mental Illness

**Claim**: Housing First programs allow people to continue using drugs and refusing psychiatric treatment, perpetuating rather than addressing the underlying conditions that cause homelessness. Providing housing without requiring sobriety or treatment engagement removes the motivation to seek help.

**Evidence Cited**: Anecdotal reports of substance use in Housing First units, publicized incidents of death or crime in supportive housing facilities, and studies showing that Housing First does not consistently reduce substance use or improve psychiatric symptoms compared to pre-housing levels.

**Reality**: Housing First was never designed to "cure" mental illness or addiction. Its primary outcome is housing stability, and on this metric it is unambiguous: Housing First programs achieve 80-90% housing retention rates at 12 months, compared to 47% for treatment-first programs (Tsemberis et al., *American Journal of Public Health*, 2004). Research shows that housing stability creates the conditions necessary for treatment engagement: participants in Housing First programs access more psychiatric services over time than those in treatment-first programs, because they are not cycling through shelters, streets, and emergency rooms (Padgett et al., *Housing First: Ending Homelessness, Transforming Systems, and Changing Lives*, Oxford University Press, 2016).

**Rebuttal**: The appropriate comparison is not Housing First vs. a hypothetical perfect program, but Housing First vs. what actually happens without it: cycling between streets, emergency rooms, jails, and shelters at higher cost and worse outcomes. Housing First does not prohibit treatment -- it removes treatment compliance as a precondition for housing, which research consistently shows increases rather than decreases treatment engagement.

### Argument 2: Supportive Housing Is Too Expensive

**Claim**: Permanent supportive housing costs $20,000-$25,000 per person per year and $250,000-$400,000 per unit to build. These costs are unsustainable at the scale needed (300,000+ units), representing a commitment of $37.5-$60 billion in capital costs alone. Taxpayers should not bear this burden.

**Evidence Cited**: Budget estimates from HUD and local housing authorities showing per-unit costs. Comparisons to private-market development costs. Fiscal analyses showing growing federal deficits.

**Reality**: Multiple rigorous cost studies demonstrate that permanent supportive housing produces net savings when compared to the cost of leaving chronically homeless individuals with mental illness on the streets. The most cited study, by Dennis Culhane at the University of Pennsylvania, found that PSH reduced public costs by an average of $16,282 per person per year in New York City through avoided emergency room visits, hospitalizations, psychiatric inpatient stays, and jail days (Culhane et al., *Housing Policy Debate*, 2002). More recent studies in Los Angeles, Denver, and Charlotte confirm savings of $30,000-$50,000 per person per year (Economic Roundtable, 2018; Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, 2019).

**Rebuttal**: The current system is not "free" -- it costs $30,000-$50,000 per person per year in emergency services, incarceration, and crisis response, but those costs are distributed across multiple agency budgets where they are less visible. Supportive housing concentrates costs in one visible budget line, creating the illusion that it is a new expense rather than a redirection of existing spending to a more effective intervention.

### Argument 3: Involuntary Treatment Is Needed, Not Housing

**Claim**: Many chronically homeless people with severe mental illness lack the capacity to make rational decisions about their care due to anosognosia (inability to recognize one's own illness). Providing housing without requiring treatment allows people to continue deteriorating. What is needed is expanded authority for involuntary psychiatric commitment and assisted outpatient treatment, not more housing.

**Evidence Cited**: Cases of individuals with untreated psychosis who committed violent acts, data on anosognosia prevalence among people with schizophrenia (~50% of cases), and examples of successful AOT programs like New York's Kendra's Law.

**Reality**: AOT programs have demonstrated positive outcomes in some studies, particularly the New York Kendra's Law evaluation which found reduced hospitalization, arrest, and homelessness (Duke University, 2009). However, AOT is a complement to housing, not a substitute. Court-ordered treatment cannot work without a place for the person to live and services to connect them with. Expanding involuntary treatment without expanding housing and community mental health capacity simply creates more demand for services that already have multi-week waiting lists.

**Rebuttal**: The evidence strongly supports *both* expanded treatment access and expanded housing. These are not competing priorities. The most effective approach is permanent supportive housing combined with assertive community treatment (ACT) teams that provide intensive, proactive mental health care. The debate between "housing vs. treatment" creates a false binary that delays action on both fronts.

### Argument 4: Encampment Enforcement Is Necessary for Public Safety

**Claim**: Homeless encampments create public safety and health hazards including open drug use, unsanitary conditions, fire risks, and violent crime. Cities have a duty to protect the safety of all residents, including housed neighbors and the homeless individuals themselves. Enforcement of anti-camping laws, authorized by *Grants Pass v. Johnson*, is a legitimate and necessary tool.

**Evidence Cited**: Crime data near encampments, reports of fires in homeless camps, biohazard cleanup costs, and public opinion polls showing majority support for encampment enforcement. The *Grants Pass* majority opinion holding that camping bans are not cruel and unusual punishment.

**Reality**: Encampment sweeps disperse people but do not reduce homelessness. Studies in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle found that encampment clearances moved people to adjacent neighborhoods, disrupted ongoing service engagement, caused loss of personal belongings including identification and medications, and increased emergency service utilization (Herring et al., *Social Problems*, 2020). A 2019 study in San Francisco found that 69% of people cleared from encampments returned to the same area or nearby within 30 days.

**Rebuttal**: Public safety concerns in and around encampments are legitimate and should be addressed. However, enforcement alone is the most expensive and least effective response. Cities that combine enforcement with immediate offers of housing and services (the "engagement-first" model used in Houston) have achieved far better outcomes than cities that rely primarily on sweeps. The question is not whether to address encampments, but whether to do so through displacement or through connection to permanent solutions.

### Argument 5: Federal Programs Create "Magnet Effects"

**Claim**: Cities and states that invest in homeless services attract homeless people from other jurisdictions, creating a "magnet effect" that punishes generosity and rewards inaction. Federal programs should not incentivize this dynamic.

**Evidence Cited**: Reports of homeless individuals moving to cities with better services (San Francisco, Seattle, Portland). Political rhetoric about homelessness as an imported problem.

**Reality**: Migration research consistently shows that the vast majority of homeless people become homeless in the community where they live. A 2019 study by the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at UCSF found that 90% of homeless people in San Francisco lost their housing in San Francisco, and only 8% reported moving from another city (Kushel et al., 2023). Similar findings have been documented in Los Angeles, Seattle, and New York. People become homeless primarily due to loss of housing affordability, health crises, and family breakdown -- not because of the availability of services.

**Rebuttal**: The "magnet" argument is empirically weak but politically potent. It can be addressed through federal policy design: if the federal government ensures that every community has a baseline level of services, there is no incentive for geographic migration. The HEARTH Act's prevention focus and the CoC system's nationwide coverage are designed to distribute responsibility broadly.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

Opposition to reform in this space follows a predictable pattern: when visible homelessness increases, public frustration drives demand for enforcement. When enforcement fails to reduce homelessness (because it does not address underlying causes), pressure mounts for more aggressive enforcement. This cycle has repeated in every decade since the 1980s:

- **1980s**: Sweeps of homeless encampments in major cities, followed by litigation (e.g., *Pottinger v. City of Miami*, 1992)
- **1990s**: Anti-panhandling ordinances, sit-lie laws, and "broken windows" policing applied to homeless populations
- **2000s**: Ten-year plans to end homelessness adopted by 300+ communities, many abandoned before completion
- **2010s**: Housing First adopted as federal policy; encampment bans limited by *Martin v. City of Boise* in Ninth Circuit
- **2020s**: *Grants Pass* restores enforcement authority; cities pursue divergent enforcement vs. engagement strategies

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Build bipartisan coalitions around cost savings**: Frame supportive housing as fiscal responsibility, not just compassion. The conservative case for PSH is that it reduces taxpayer spending on emergency rooms, jails, and shelters. Target fiscal conservatives with cost-benefit data.
- **Engage law enforcement as allies**: Police officers and sheriffs who are frustrated with the revolving door of arrest-release can be powerful advocates for diversion and supportive housing. The Major Cities Chiefs Association has endorsed mental health co-response teams and Housing First.
- **Leverage veteran homelessness success**: The 55.3% reduction in veteran homelessness since 2010 provides a bipartisan success story. Frame broader homelessness reform as extending the model that worked for veterans to all Americans.

### Communication Strategies

- **Lead with stories, follow with data**: Personal narratives of recovery through supportive housing are more persuasive than statistics alone. Organizations like the Corporation for Supportive Housing maintain story banks of successful PSH residents.
- **Reframe "Housing First" language**: For audiences resistant to "Housing First," use alternative framings: "housing-led," "rapid resolution," or "stable housing with services." The concept is more popular than the name.
- **Address safety concerns directly**: Do not dismiss NIMBY concerns. Present data on property values near well-managed PSH (research consistently shows no negative impact), invite neighbors to visit operating programs, and commit to ongoing management standards.

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Include treatment access alongside housing**: Design legislation that funds both housing and mental health services, defusing the "housing vs. treatment" debate by providing both.
- **Create local benefit agreements**: Offset NIMBY opposition by including community benefits in PSH developments (ground-floor retail, public space improvements, local hiring commitments).
- **Use "by-right" zoning**: Eliminate case-by-case siting battles by making supportive housing a by-right use in residential zones, as California has done through AB 2162 (2018).
