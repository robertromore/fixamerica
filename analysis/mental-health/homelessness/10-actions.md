# Mental Illness and Homelessness: What You Can Do

The crisis of mental illness and homelessness affects every American community. While systemic solutions require federal, state, and local policy reform, individual citizens, professionals, and community organizations play essential roles in building political will, providing direct support, and shifting public understanding. This guide provides specific, actionable steps for people at every level of engagement.

---

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- **Read the UCSF Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative study** (*Toward a New Understanding*, 2023) to understand who becomes homeless and why -- the data counters many common myths about homelessness and mental illness
- **Track your local Continuum of Care's performance** at HUD Exchange (<https://www.hudexchange.info/>) -- each community's point-in-time count, housing inventory, and system performance data are publicly available
- **Follow the National Alliance to End Homelessness** (<https://endhomelessness.org/>) for monthly policy updates and data analyses on homelessness trends
- **Subscribe to the Treatment Advocacy Center newsletter** (<https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/>) for updates on psychiatric bed availability, involuntary treatment reform, and criminalization data

### Make Personal Changes

- **Volunteer with a local outreach team or shelter**: Organizations such as PATH outreach programs, Health Care for the Homeless centers, and local CoC agencies consistently need volunteers. Direct contact with people experiencing homelessness builds understanding and combats stigma.
- **Become a trained Mental Health First Aider**: The 8-hour Mental Health First Aid certification course (<https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/>) teaches how to recognize and respond to signs of mental illness and substance use, including among people experiencing homelessness.
- **Donate to effective organizations**: Prioritize organizations that fund permanent supportive housing and evidence-based mental health services over those that fund only emergency shelter. See the Organizations table below for specific recommendations.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call or write your U.S. Representative and Senators when mental health and homelessness legislation is pending. Key ask: full funding for the CoC program, CCBHC expansion, and 988 crisis infrastructure.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When HUD, CMS, or SAMHSA publish proposed rules affecting homelessness and mental health policy, submit public comments. The Federal Register (<https://www.federalregister.gov/>) lists open comment periods. Agencies are required to read and respond to all public comments.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When your local newspaper covers homelessness, respond with evidence-based perspective. Key messages: permanent supportive housing saves taxpayer money ($20,000-$25,000 per year vs. $30,000-$50,000 in emergency costs), Housing First achieves 80-90% housing retention, and 90% of homeless people became homeless in the same community.
- **Speak at Local Government Meetings**: Attend city council, county board, and zoning commission meetings when supportive housing proposals or homelessness policy are on the agenda. Your testimony as a community member carries weight.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- **Form a "Neighbors for Supportive Housing" group**: When supportive housing is proposed in your community, organize proactive support. Research from the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows that well-managed PSH does not reduce property values and reduces 911 calls in surrounding neighborhoods. Counter NIMBY opposition with data and coalition-building.
- **Host a community screening of documentaries on homelessness**: Films like *Lost Angels* (2010) or *The Invisible People* web series (<https://invisiblepeople.tv/>) humanize the experience of mental illness and homelessness. Follow screenings with facilitated discussion.
- **Partner with local faith communities**: Churches, synagogues, mosques, and temples are often the first point of contact for people in crisis. Faith communities can host outreach events, provide meal programs, and advocate for supportive housing in their neighborhoods.
- **Engage local business owners**: Business improvement districts often drive enforcement-first policies. Engage business owners with the evidence that permanent housing solutions reduce street homelessness more effectively than encampment sweeps. Houston's business community supported Housing First after seeing 63% reductions in homelessness.

### Build Coalitions

- **Connect mental health advocates with housing advocates**: NAMI chapters, local housing authorities, and CoC boards often operate in parallel. Facilitating connections between these groups strengthens advocacy for integrated solutions.
- **Engage law enforcement as partners**: Many police officers are frustrated with the revolving door of arresting people with mental illness for low-level offenses. The Major Cities Chiefs Association has endorsed mental health co-response teams. Invite local police leaders to join conversations about diversion and crisis response alternatives.
- **Support peer-led organizations**: Groups led by people with lived experience of homelessness and mental illness bring essential perspective. Support their inclusion in local planning processes, CoC governance, and public forums.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During federal budget and appropriations season (typically February-September), when HUD, SAMHSA, and VA funding levels are being set
- When the CoC program reauthorization or HEARTH Act amendments are under consideration
- When your state legislature considers involuntary treatment reform, Medicaid expansion, or housing policy
- When your city council considers supportive housing zoning, encampment policies, or homelessness service contracts
- Whenever you see news coverage of homelessness policy debates in your community

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Permanent Supportive Housing and Mental Health Services for People Experiencing Homelessness

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State], writing to urge your support for
federal investments in permanent supportive housing and community mental
health services for people experiencing homelessness with serious mental
illness.

The 2023 HUD point-in-time count documented 653,100 people experiencing
homelessness -- the highest number since counting began. An estimated
163,000 of these individuals have a serious mental illness.
Research demonstrates that permanent supportive housing achieves
80-90% housing retention and saves taxpayers $30,000-$50,000 per
person per year in avoided emergency room, jail, and shelter costs.

I urge you to support:
1. Full funding for the HUD Continuum of Care program
2. Nationwide expansion of Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics
3. Adequate funding for 988 crisis response infrastructure
4. A permanent Supportive Housing Trust Fund

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm
calling about federal funding for homelessness and mental health
services. I'd like [Representative/Senator] [Name] to support full
funding for the HUD Continuum of Care program and expansion of
Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. Permanent supportive
housing has been proven to reduce homelessness and save taxpayer
money. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **CCBHC Nondiscrimination and Parity Act**: Would make CCBHCs a permanent, nationwide program rather than a state-by-state demonstration. Contact your Senators and Representative to cosponsor. The bill has bipartisan support.
- **Continuum of Care (CoC) Reauthorization**: Full reauthorization of the HEARTH Act with expanded authorization levels. Contact members of the House Financial Services Committee and Senate Banking Committee.
- **988 Implementation Funding**: Sustained appropriations for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, including mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization centers. Contact members of the Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee.
- **State-level supportive housing zoning reform**: In your state, advocate for by-right zoning that permits supportive housing in residential zones without case-by-case approval (modeled on California AB 2162).

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your plan to address homelessness among people with serious mental illness in our community? Do you support permanent supportive housing expansion?"
2. "Do you support full federal funding for the Continuum of Care program, Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, and 988 crisis services?"
3. "How do you balance enforcement of public space laws with the need to provide housing and treatment for people experiencing homelessness? Do you support engagement-first approaches?"
4. "Will you support Medicaid coverage of housing-related services to help people with mental illness transition out of homelessness?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who distinguish between enforcement and engagement strategies and who reference evidence-based approaches (Housing First, permanent supportive housing, ACT teams)
- Pay attention to city council and county board races, where zoning and local homelessness policy are decided. These down-ballot races often have the most direct impact.
- Check whether candidates have endorsed positions from NAEH, NAMI, or local homelessness advocacy coalitions

## Professional Actions

- **For Health Care Professionals**: Learn about Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) programs at federally qualified health centers. Volunteer or practice at an HCH site. If you prescribe long-acting injectable antipsychotics, make them available to patients experiencing homelessness who have difficulty with daily medication adherence.
- **For Social Workers and Counselors**: Pursue specialized training in homeless-specific interventions including motivational interviewing, trauma-informed care, and harm reduction. The National Health Care for the Homeless Council offers clinical practice guidelines. Consider employment in PATH programs or ACT teams.
- **For Attorneys**: Provide pro bono representation to people experiencing homelessness who face eviction, benefits denial, or civil rights violations. Organizations like the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty coordinate legal advocacy.
- **For Architects and Urban Planners**: Advocate for supportive housing design that integrates into residential neighborhoods. Support zoning reform that permits higher-density development and by-right supportive housing. Design dignified spaces that combat stigma.
- **For Educators and Researchers**: Conduct and publicize research on homelessness and mental health outcomes. Incorporate housing stability and social determinants of health into clinical training curricula. Disseminate evidence-based findings to policymakers.
- **For Business Leaders**: Support supportive housing developments in your community. Offer employment opportunities to people transitioning from homelessness through supported employment programs. Fund workforce development for homeless services professionals.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing mental illness and homelessness with others, emphasize:

1. **Permanent supportive housing works and saves money**: PSH achieves 80-90% housing retention and saves $30,000-$50,000 per person per year in avoided emergency costs. The current approach of cycling people through ERs, jails, and shelters costs more than housing them.
2. **Homelessness is a local problem with local roots**: 90% of people experiencing homelessness became homeless in the community where they currently live (UCSF, 2023). The "magnet effect" is a myth -- people do not move to cities for homeless services.
3. **We know how to solve this**: The United States reduced veteran homelessness by 55.3% using Housing First plus intensive services. The same model can be applied to all people with serious mental illness experiencing homelessness.
4. **Mental illness is a cause, not a choice**: Approximately 25% of people experiencing homelessness have a serious mental illness. Deinstitutionalization without community alternatives -- a government policy failure -- created this crisis.
5. **Both housing and treatment are needed**: The debate between "housing first" and "treatment first" is a false choice. The evidence supports providing housing immediately while making voluntary treatment readily available.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Homeless people choose to live on the streets" | The vast majority of homeless individuals cite economic factors (rent increases, job loss, eviction) or health crises (including mental health) as the reason. Only 1% cite "choice" as the primary reason. | UCSF Benioff Homelessness Study, 2023 |
| "Housing First means giving people housing with no services" | Housing First provides housing without preconditions, but offers voluntary services including psychiatric care, substance use treatment, and case management. Studies show Housing First participants access more services over time. | Tsemberis et al., 2004; Padgett et al., 2016 |
| "Homeless people are mostly from somewhere else" | 90% of people experiencing homelessness became homeless in the community where they are currently living. Migration for services is rare. | UCSF, 2023; HUD AHAR, 2024 |
| "Supportive housing lowers property values" | Multiple studies show that well-managed permanent supportive housing has no negative impact on surrounding property values and may increase them. | Furman Center, NYU, 2008; Denver study, 2016 |
| "We cannot afford to house everyone" | The current system costs $30,000-$50,000 per person per year in emergency services. PSH costs $20,000-$25,000 per person per year. We cannot afford not to house people. | Culhane et al., 2002; Economic Roundtable, 2018 |
| "Encampment sweeps solve homelessness" | Research shows that 69% of people swept from encampments return within 30 days. Sweeps disperse people, disrupt service connections, and increase emergency utilization. | Herring et al., 2020; San Francisco DPH, 2019 |
