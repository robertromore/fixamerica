# Mental Illness and Homelessness: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current crisis of mental illness among homeless populations is not the result of a single failure but of several long-term, interlocking trends. These include the incomplete deinstitutionalization of state psychiatric hospitals, chronic underfunding of community mental health services, a severe shortage of affordable and supportive housing, fragmented service delivery systems, and a political economy that rewards cost-shifting over problem-solving. Each cause reinforces the others, creating a self-perpetuating cycle that is resistant to incremental reform.

## Deinstitutionalization Without Replacement

### The 90% Reduction in Hospital Beds

Between 1955 and 2000, state psychiatric hospital populations fell from 558,922 to fewer than 55,000 -- a reduction of more than 90%. By 2023, approximately 37,000 state hospital beds remained, a rate of roughly 11 per 100,000 population compared to 340 per 100,000 in 1955 (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023). This massive reduction was not matched by a corresponding investment in community-based mental health infrastructure.

**Evidence**: The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 authorized 1,500 community mental health centers, but only 789 were ever built. Federal funding for CMHCs was converted to block grants in 1981, reducing federal support by approximately 30%. States used savings from hospital closures for other budget purposes rather than reinvesting in community alternatives.

### The Missing Continuum of Care

Deinstitutionalization assumed that a range of community-based options would exist: outpatient clinics, day programs, supervised residential settings, crisis stabilization units, and assertive community treatment teams. For most communities, this continuum was never built. The result is a binary system: either a person with SMI is in a (scarce) inpatient bed or they are in the community with minimal support. When they cannot maintain housing or treatment independently, homelessness becomes the default.

**Evidence**: The Treatment Advocacy Center reports that only 10% of people with serious mental illness receive assertive community treatment (ACT), the intervention with the strongest evidence base for this population (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). SAMHSA estimates that only 40% of adults with SMI receive any mental health services (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023).

## Housing Market Failures

### Affordable Housing Shortage

The United States faces a shortage of approximately 7.3 million rental homes affordable and available to extremely low-income renters (National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2024). This shortage is most severe in high-cost metropolitan areas -- the same areas where homelessness is most concentrated. For people with mental illness living on disability income (average SSI benefit: $943/month in 2024), there is virtually no private market housing available at an affordable level (defined as 30% of income, or approximately $283/month).

**Evidence**: The National Low Income Housing Coalition's 2024 "Out of Reach" report found that a full-time worker must earn $28.58/hour to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment at the national average fair market rent. SSI recipients can afford rent of $283/month, but the national average studio apartment costs $1,131/month.

### Loss of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Hotels

SRO hotels historically provided the lowest-cost housing option in American cities, serving many people with mental illness, substance use disorders, and minimal income. Between 1970 and 2000, more than 1 million SRO units were demolished through urban renewal, zoning changes, and market conversion to higher-end uses. This loss eliminated the primary housing stock for the most vulnerable populations.

**Evidence**: Chicago lost approximately 80% of its SRO rooms between 1960 and 2000. New York City lost more than 100,000 SRO units between 1955 and 1995 (Hoch and Slayton, *New Homeless and Old*, 1989; updated estimates).

### Permanent Supportive Housing Gap

The nation has approximately 383,000 permanent supportive housing (PSH) beds, but the National Alliance to End Homelessness estimates that more than 300,000 PSH units are needed for the chronically homeless population alone -- a gap of approximately 150,000+ units. Building each new PSH unit costs $250,000-$400,000 depending on the market, requiring a capital investment of $37.5-$60 billion to close the gap.

**Evidence**: HUD Housing Inventory Count (2023) documents approximately 150,000 PSH beds designated for chronically homeless individuals. The chronically homeless population was 143,105 in the 2023 PIT count, and many additional individuals meet chronic criteria but were sheltered or not counted.

## Fragmented Service Delivery

### Siloed Systems

Mental health, substance use, housing, income support, and health care services are administered by separate federal agencies (SAMHSA, HUD, SSA, CMS), separate state departments, and separate local providers. Each system has its own eligibility criteria, data systems, funding streams, and performance measures. A person with co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorder who is homeless may need to navigate five or more separate intake processes, often with conflicting requirements.

**Evidence**: A 2022 GAO report found that at least 12 federal agencies administer programs serving people experiencing homelessness, with no unified data system or coordinated eligibility determination (GAO-22-104880). HUD's CoC framework was designed to address coordination at the local level, but CoCs vary enormously in capacity and effectiveness.

### The Medicaid Fragmentation

Medicaid is the primary payer for mental health services for low-income adults, but its coverage of homeless-specific services is inconsistent. Street outreach, housing navigation, and peer support -- critical for engaging unsheltered people with mental illness -- are not consistently billable under Medicaid across states. The Medicaid "IMD exclusion" (prohibiting federal reimbursement for care in psychiatric institutions with more than 16 beds) was enacted in 1965 and continues to distort service delivery, discouraging inpatient psychiatric care while failing to adequately fund community alternatives.

**Evidence**: Only 10 states had fully implemented Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) as of 2024. CCBHCs provide a comprehensive reimbursement model that covers outreach, crisis services, and wrap-around supports, but most states rely on fee-for-service Medicaid that does not cover these activities (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2024).

### Criminal Justice System as Default Provider

In the absence of adequate community mental health services, the criminal justice system has become the de facto mental health system for many people with SMI. An estimated 44% of people in jails and 37% in prisons have a diagnosed mental health condition (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023). The three largest mental health facilities in the United States are jails: Cook County Jail (Chicago), Los Angeles County Jail, and Rikers Island (New York City).

**Evidence**: People with SMI are approximately 10 times more likely to be in a jail or prison than in a state psychiatric hospital (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). Approximately 2 million jail bookings per year involve people with SMI (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). Most are arrested for low-level offenses -- trespassing, disorderly conduct, petty theft -- that are often direct consequences of untreated mental illness and homelessness.

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| State governments | Reduced mental health spending; costs shifted to federal programs and localities | Billions in avoided state hospital and community MH costs annually | Supportive housing and community MH expansion would require new state investment |
| Private corrections industry | Incarceration of mentally ill people generates revenue | $8+ billion annual private prison/jail industry | Diversion programs reduce incarcerated population |
| Pharmaceutical industry | Medications are primary treatment; minimal accountability for recovery outcomes | ~$15 billion annual antipsychotic market | Comprehensive care models reduce reliance on medication alone |
| Property owners in high-value areas | Encampment clearances protect property values | Billions in urban real estate value | Supportive housing siting faced with NIMBY opposition |
| Emergency health care providers | ER visits by homeless individuals generate Medicaid/Medicare revenue | ~$8 billion annual ER spending on homeless individuals | Outreach and preventive care reduce ER utilization |

### Perverse Incentives

The current system creates multiple misaligned incentives that perpetuate homelessness among people with mental illness:

- **State governments save money by closing hospitals** but do not bear the full downstream costs of homelessness, which fall on local governments, federal programs, and emergency systems.
- **Local governments are incentivized to enforce anti-camping laws** that move homeless people to other jurisdictions rather than investing in services that might attract more homeless people from neighboring areas (the "magnet" fear).
- **Mental health providers are reimbursed for clinical services delivered in offices** but not for the street outreach and engagement work necessary to reach unsheltered individuals who will not come to offices.
- **Hospitals face financial penalties for readmissions** but no corresponding requirement to ensure discharge to stable housing, creating incentives to discharge patients quickly without adequate post-discharge planning.

## Behavioral Health System Failures

### Workforce Shortage

The behavioral health workforce is fundamentally inadequate for the scale of need. HRSA estimates a shortage of approximately 8,000 psychiatrists and 30,000 other mental health professionals nationally (HRSA, 2023). Workforce shortages are most severe in rural areas and high-cost urban areas -- both of which face high homelessness rates. Annual turnover rates in homeless services programs exceed 30%, driven by low pay (median salary for outreach workers: approximately $38,000), high burnout, and secondary trauma.

**Evidence**: The average wait time for a new psychiatric appointment is 6-8 weeks nationally, and far longer in underserved areas (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023). In many communities, the only pathway to immediate psychiatric care is through an emergency room or jail.

### Involuntary Treatment Gaps

The legal and practical barriers to treating people with severe, untreated mental illness who refuse services are substantial. Most states require proof of imminent danger to self or others before involuntary commitment, a standard that excludes many people who are severely psychotic but not imminently violent. Even when involuntary commitment criteria are met, the shortage of psychiatric beds means many individuals are released after brief stabilization (often 72 hours or less) without follow-up care.

**Evidence**: The average length of stay in state psychiatric hospitals fell from 421 days in 1955 to approximately 10-14 days in 2023 (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023). Assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) programs, which provide court-ordered community treatment, are authorized in 47 states but implemented in far fewer communities.

## Why Reform Has Failed

Reform efforts have been hampered by several recurring obstacles:

1. **Upfront costs vs. distributed savings**: Permanent supportive housing costs $20,000-$25,000 per person per year, and the savings ($30,000-$50,000 per person per year in avoided ER, jail, and shelter costs) accrue to different agencies than those bearing the housing cost. No mechanism exists to capture and reinvest these cross-system savings.

2. **NIMBY opposition**: Every proposed supportive housing development faces opposition from neighbors concerned about property values, safety, and community character. Despite evidence that well-managed PSH does not reduce property values, siting remains the single largest practical barrier to expansion.

3. **Ideological polarization**: Housing First has been effective but politically controversial. Critics view it as "enabling" substance use and mental illness, while supporters view treatment-first approaches as exclusionary. This polarization has stalled federal legislation and divided the advocacy community.

4. **Jurisdictional fragmentation**: No single entity has authority or responsibility for the full population. HUD funds housing, SAMHSA funds mental health services, CMS funds Medicaid, states operate hospitals, and cities manage streets. Each entity can point to the others as responsible.

5. **Short political time horizons**: Addressing chronic homelessness requires sustained 5-10 year investments that span multiple election cycles. Politicians are incentivized to pursue visible short-term responses (encampment sweeps, temporary shelters) over long-term solutions (PSH construction, workforce development).
