# Mental Illness and Homelessness: History

## Historical Development

The relationship between mental illness and homelessness in the United States has been shaped by three major forces: the rise and fall of state psychiatric institutions, the failure to build a community-based mental health system, and the evolution of federal homelessness policy. Understanding this history is essential because today's crisis is not an accident -- it is the predictable result of specific policy choices made over six decades.

### The Institutional Era (1840s-1955): Asylum as Default Housing

- **Dorothea Dix's Crusade (1840s-1880s)**: Dorothea Dix's advocacy documented the confinement of mentally ill people in jails, almshouses, and poorhouses under horrific conditions. Her campaign led to the construction of more than 30 state psychiatric hospitals, establishing the principle that the state bore responsibility for housing and treating people with severe mental illness.
- **Growth of the State Hospital System**: By 1900, every state had at least one public psychiatric hospital. Populations grew steadily as states used these institutions to house not only people with psychotic disorders but also those with intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, dementia, and chronic alcoholism.
- **Peak Institutionalization (1955)**: State psychiatric hospitals reached their maximum population of 558,922 patients in 1955. At that point, the hospitalization rate was approximately 340 per 100,000 population. Conditions in many facilities were overcrowded and dehumanizing, with patients warehoused in locked wards with minimal treatment.
- **The Institutional Model's Failures**: Exposés by journalists including Albert Deutsch (*The Shame of the States*, 1948) and photographers documented filthy, violent, and neglectful conditions. Life magazine's 1946 photo essay "Bedlam 1946" compared state hospitals to Nazi concentration camps, catalyzing public outrage.

### Deinstitutionalization (1955-1990): The Great Emptying

- **Pharmacological Revolution (1950s)**: The introduction of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) in 1954 made it possible to manage psychotic symptoms outside hospital settings for the first time. This pharmacological breakthrough provided the medical rationale for discharge, though it did not address patients' needs for housing, income, or social support.
- **Community Mental Health Act of 1963**: President Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act on October 31, 1963, authorizing federal funding for 1,500 community mental health centers (CMHCs) to replace state hospitals. The law envisioned a network of outpatient clinics, partial hospitalization programs, and emergency services. Only 789 CMHCs were ever built, and few served people with the most severe conditions.
- **Medicare and Medicaid (1965)**: The creation of Medicare and Medicaid inadvertently accelerated deinstitutionalization. The Medicaid "IMD exclusion" (Institution for Mental Diseases exclusion) prohibited federal Medicaid reimbursement for psychiatric care in facilities with more than 16 beds, creating a powerful financial incentive for states to discharge patients from state hospitals (which were state-funded) to nursing homes, board-and-care homes, or the community (where Medicaid could pay).
- **Civil Rights and Legal Reform (1960s-1970s)**: A series of landmark court decisions established patients' rights to treatment, least restrictive environment, and due process before involuntary commitment. Key cases included *Wyatt v. Stickney* (1971, right to treatment), *O'Connor v. Donaldson* (1975, cannot confine non-dangerous mentally ill), and *Addington v. Texas* (1979, clear and convincing evidence standard for commitment). These decisions were legally sound but assumed that community alternatives existed.
- **The Emptying Accelerates (1970s-1980s)**: State hospital populations fell from 558,922 in 1955 to approximately 130,000 by 1980. Between 1965 and 1980, the number of state hospital beds dropped by more than 60%. States embraced deinstitutionalization because it shifted costs from state general funds to federal programs (Medicaid, SSI, SSDI).
- **What Did Not Happen**: The community mental health system envisioned in 1963 was never fully built. Federal funding for CMHCs was converted to block grants under Reagan in 1981 (through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act), reducing federal support by approximately 30%. States used the savings from hospital closures for other purposes rather than reinvesting in community services.

### The Emergence of Mass Homelessness (1980-1995): From Hospitals to Streets

- **Visible Homelessness Appears (Early 1980s)**: For the first time since the Great Depression, large numbers of visibly mentally ill people appeared on American streets in the early 1980s. Advocates estimated that one-third to one-half of the new homeless population had serious mental illness. The image of the "bag lady" or "street person" talking to themselves became a cultural touchstone.
- **Confluence of Factors (1980-1985)**: Homelessness among mentally ill people resulted from the convergence of deinstitutionalization without community alternatives, cuts to the Social Safety net (including SSI/SSDI eligibility restrictions in 1981), the loss of low-cost housing (SRO hotels declined from 1 million units in 1970 to fewer than 400,000 by 1990), and the crack cocaine epidemic.
- **McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (1987)**: The first comprehensive federal homelessness legislation, named after Representatives Stewart McKinney and Bruce Vento, authorized programs for emergency shelter, transitional housing, health care for the homeless, education for homeless children, and mental health services (through what became the PATH program). Initial authorization was $1 billion over two years.
- **PATH Program Established (1990)**: The Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness program was authorized as part of the McKinney-Vento Act amendments, providing formula grants to states specifically for outreach and services to homeless individuals with serious mental illness.
- **Criminalization Begins**: As visible homelessness grew, cities began enacting ordinances against panhandling, loitering, and sleeping in public -- effectively criminalizing the condition of homelessness. Jails increasingly became the de facto housing for mentally ill people who could not access treatment or shelter.

### The Policy Response Era (1995-2015): Housing First and Federal Strategy

- **Pathways to Housing and Housing First (1992-2000)**: Dr. Sam Tsemberis founded Pathways to Housing in New York City in 1992, developing the Housing First model that provided immediate access to independent apartments for chronically homeless individuals with mental illness, without requiring sobriety or treatment compliance as preconditions. The first published research results (2000, 2004) showed 80-88% housing retention rates, dramatically outperforming traditional "treatment first" programs (47% retention).
- **Continuum of Care Framework (1994)**: HUD reorganized its homeless assistance programs into the Continuum of Care model, requiring communities to submit coordinated applications for funding. This framework remains the primary federal mechanism for homeless services planning and funding.
- **Federal Strategic Plans**: USICH issued the first federal strategic plan to end homelessness, "Opening Doors," in 2010. The plan prioritized ending chronic and veteran homelessness and embraced Housing First as the primary strategy. Subsequent plans (2015, 2022) maintained these priorities.
- **HUD-VASH Launch (2008)**: Congress authorized the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program, combining Housing Choice vouchers with VA case management. By 2023, approximately 110,000 vouchers had been allocated, contributing to a 55.3% reduction in veteran homelessness from 2010 to 2023.
- **HEARTH Act (2009)**: The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act reauthorized and updated the McKinney-Vento programs, expanding the definition of homelessness, adding prevention funding, establishing a performance measurement system, and codifying the CoC planning process.
- **HUD Housing First Mandate (2013-2015)**: HUD began prioritizing CoC applications that embraced Housing First principles, effectively making Housing First adoption a condition for competitive federal funding. This policy accelerated Housing First adoption nationwide but also generated backlash from providers committed to abstinence-based or treatment-first models.

### The Current Crisis (2015-Present): Record Numbers and Legal Shifts

- **Rising Homelessness Resumes (2017-Present)**: After modest declines from 2010 to 2016, total homelessness began rising again, driven by escalating housing costs, the opioid/fentanyl crisis, and the economic disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2023 PIT count of 653,100 was the highest on record.
- **COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2023)**: The pandemic created both dangers and opportunities. Shelters became transmission risks, prompting cities to open hotel-based non-congregate shelter (Project Roomkey in California). Congress provided unprecedented one-time funding including $5 billion through HOME-ARP (2021) and expanded Emergency Solutions Grants. The CDC eviction moratorium (September 2020-August 2021) temporarily prevented evictions but created a cliff effect upon expiration.
- **California CARE Act (2022)**: California enacted the Community Assistance, Recovery, and Empowerment Act, creating a civil court process to develop community-based treatment plans for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders who are unable to provide for their basic needs. The CARE Act represented a significant shift toward state-level compelled treatment frameworks.
- **Grants Pass v. Johnson (2024)**: The Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling reversed nearly a decade of Ninth Circuit precedent that had constrained cities from enforcing anti-camping laws when shelter was unavailable. Writing for the majority, Justice Gorsuch held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishments, not cruel and unusual conditions, and that generally applicable camping ordinances are not "punishments" for the status of being homeless. The dissent, written by Justice Sotomayor, warned that the decision authorized "criminalizing homelessness."

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Deinstitutionalization Without Reinvestment

The most consequential pattern in this history is the repeated failure to build community-based systems before closing institutional ones. State hospitals were shut down, but the savings were not redirected to community mental health centers, supportive housing, or outreach programs. This same pattern -- closing one system without adequately funding the replacement -- recurs in discussions about reforming the criminal justice system, child welfare, and other institutional responses to mental illness.

### Pattern 2: Cost-Shifting Rather Than Problem-Solving

At every stage, governments have responded to mental illness and homelessness by shifting costs rather than solving problems. States shifted costs from hospitals to federal Medicaid. The federal government shifted mental health funding from categorical programs to block grants. Cities shifted the burden from social services to law enforcement. Each shift reduced costs for the shifting entity while worsening outcomes for people with mental illness.

### Pattern 3: Evidence-Adoption Lag

The Housing First model was developed in 1992 and demonstrated effectiveness by 2000, but it did not become federal policy until 2010-2015 -- a 15-20 year lag. Assertive Community Treatment was shown effective in the 1970s but remains unavailable in most communities. This pattern suggests that even when evidence-based solutions exist, political, ideological, and institutional barriers delay adoption by one to two decades.

### Pattern 4: Crisis-Driven Policy, Not Prevention

Federal homelessness policy has been overwhelmingly reactive. The McKinney-Vento Act (1987) responded to the visible crisis of the 1980s. The HEARTH Act (2009) added prevention but still primarily funded emergency and transitional responses. Major funding increases (HOME-ARP, ESG-CV) came in response to the COVID-19 emergency. Sustained investment in prevention -- mental health treatment, affordable housing, discharge planning -- has never been politically viable outside of a crisis.
