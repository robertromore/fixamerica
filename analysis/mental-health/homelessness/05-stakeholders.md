# Mental Illness and Homelessness: Stakeholders

The intersection of mental illness and homelessness is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with its own interests, resources, and levels of power. Understanding these stakeholders is essential for designing politically viable reforms and building effective coalitions.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| People experiencing homelessness with SMI | Direct impact -- untreated illness, exposure, violence, premature death | ~163,000 (25% of 653,100 total homeless, SAMHSA 2023) | Housing, treatment, autonomy, safety, dignity |
| People experiencing homelessness with any mental health condition | Direct impact -- impaired functioning, difficulty accessing services | ~250,000-350,000 | Housing, psychiatric care, case management, income |
| Chronically homeless individuals | Longest duration, highest acuity, most service-resistant | 143,105 (HUD AHAR, 2024) | Permanent supportive housing, flexible services |
| Homeless veterans with mental illness | PTSD, TBI, substance use at elevated rates | ~35,574 homeless veterans; ~30% with SMI | HUD-VASH, VA services, peer support |
| Families of people with SMI who are homeless | Emotional distress, caregiving burden, financial strain | Estimated 500,000+ family members | Access to information, respite, involuntary treatment options |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Neighboring communities**: Residents and businesses near shelters, supportive housing, and encampments experience quality-of-life concerns including public drug use, sanitation issues, and perceived safety threats. These concerns drive NIMBY opposition and political pressure for enforcement.
- **Emergency department staff**: Hospital emergency rooms serve as the primary point of crisis contact for homeless individuals with mental illness, with frequent-user populations driving significant costs. Emergency physicians and nurses bear the burden of providing psychiatric stabilization in inappropriate settings.
- **Law enforcement officers**: Police are the most common first responders to mental health crises among homeless individuals. Officers increasingly report frustration with the revolving door of arrest-release-rearrest for low-level offenses and the lack of diversion options.
- **Shelter staff and outreach workers**: Frontline workers in homeless services earn a median salary of approximately $38,000 per year, face high rates of burnout and secondary trauma, and experience turnover rates exceeding 30% annually.
- **Incarcerated people with mental illness**: An estimated 44% of jail inmates have a diagnosed mental health condition (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023). Many cycle between jail and the streets due to inadequate discharge planning.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Appropriates funding, authorizes programs, sets policy | Legislative authority over HUD, SAMHSA, VA budgets | $2.9B CoC + $64.6M PATH + billions in related programs (FY2023) | High |
| HUD Secretary / HUD Office of Special Needs Assistance Programs | Administers CoC program, sets Housing First policy | Regulatory authority over CoC competition, funding priorities | $2.9 billion CoC (FY2023) | High |
| SAMHSA Administrator | Administers PATH, CMHBG, CCBHC programs | Regulatory authority over mental health/SUD programs | $7.5+ billion total SAMHSA budget (FY2023) | High |
| State governors and legislatures | Operate state hospitals, set Medicaid policy, enact treatment laws | Authority over involuntary treatment, hospital funding, state Medicaid plan | Varies widely by state | High |
| City mayors and city councils | Manage local response, shelter systems, encampment policies | Land use, zoning, policing, local service funding | Varies; largest cities spend $1B+ annually on homelessness | High |
| CoC lead agencies | Coordinate local planning, distribute federal funds | CoC governance charter authority | Vary by CoC ($5M-$400M+ annual federal allocation) | Medium-High |
| VA Secretary | Administers HUD-VASH, SSVF, veteran health programs | Direct service authority for veterans | ~$4 billion annually on veteran homelessness programs | High |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH)**: The federal agency that coordinates the federal response to homelessness, comprising 19 member agencies. USICH issues the federal strategic plan and promotes Housing First as policy. Budget is small (~$4 million) but coordination role is significant.
- **National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH)**: The leading national research and advocacy organization focused on homelessness policy. Produces influential research, data analysis, and policy recommendations. Strongly supports Housing First.
- **Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH)**: Provides technical assistance, financing, and policy advocacy for permanent supportive housing development. Has supported the creation of more than 400,000 units of supportive housing since 1991.
- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: The largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization in the U.S., with more than 600 local affiliates. Advocates for expanded mental health services, parity enforcement, and treatment access.
- **Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC)**: Advocates for reform of involuntary treatment laws and expansion of assisted outpatient treatment. Produces influential data on psychiatric bed shortages and criminalization of mental illness.
- **National Health Care for the Homeless Council**: Represents Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) programs, which serve approximately 1 million patients annually at federally qualified health centers. Provides clinical guidance on treating homeless patients with mental illness.
- **American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)**: Has litigated major cases on behalf of homeless individuals' rights, including challenging anti-camping ordinances and involuntary treatment expansion. Opposes policies perceived as criminalizing homelessness.

### Influencers

- **Think tanks**: The Urban Institute, Rand Corporation, and Brookings Institution produce research on housing and homelessness policy. The Manhattan Institute and American Enterprise Institute critique Housing First and advocate for enforcement-oriented approaches.
- **Academic researchers**: Key researchers include Dr. Dennis Culhane (University of Pennsylvania), Dr. Margot Kushel (UCSF), Dr. Sam Tsemberis (Pathways to Housing), and Dr. Matthew Desmond (Princeton). Their research shapes evidence-based policy.
- **Lived experience advocates**: Organizations led by people with lived experience of homelessness and mental illness, including the National Consumer Advisory Board and local peer advocacy groups, provide critical perspective on service design and policy priorities.
- **Media**: Local and national media coverage of encampments, public safety incidents, and policy responses shapes public opinion and political pressure. Coverage tends to focus on crisis and enforcement rather than systemic causes.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAEH + CSH + USICH + progressive city governments | Housing First expansion, PSH development | Strong -- aligned on evidence, institutional support |
| NAMI + Treatment Advocacy Center + family advocacy groups | Expanded treatment access, AOT reform, involuntary treatment modernization | Moderate -- agree on need but differ on approach |
| VA + HUD + veteran service organizations | Ending veteran homelessness through HUD-VASH expansion | Strong -- bipartisan, demonstrated results |
| Emergency physicians + law enforcement + fiscal conservatives | Diversion from ERs and jails to community-based care (cost savings) | Moderate -- shared frustration with status quo, different proposed solutions |
| Affordable housing advocates + mental health advocates + disability rights groups | Expanded affordable housing supply, Medicaid expansion, SSI reform | Moderate -- broad alignment but compete for attention and funding |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Housing First advocates vs. treatment-first proponents**: Housing First advocates (NAEH, CSH, USICH, HUD) insist that housing should be provided without preconditions, while treatment-first proponents (Treatment Advocacy Center, some conservative policy groups) argue that requiring treatment engagement is necessary for people with severe illness.
- **Civil liberties organizations vs. treatment expansion advocates**: The ACLU and disability rights groups oppose expansion of involuntary treatment, guardianship, and conservatorship powers, while NAMI, Treatment Advocacy Center, and family advocates push for broader authority to compel treatment when individuals cannot recognize their illness (anosognosia).
- **Local residents vs. supportive housing developers**: Communities targeted for PSH development frequently resist through NIMBY opposition, filing lawsuits, organizing political campaigns against projects, and pressuring zoning boards to deny permits.
- **Cities vs. federal government on mandate scope**: Cities want maximum flexibility to address homelessness as they see fit (including enforcement), while federal policy conditions funding on Housing First adoption and data reporting that some localities find burdensome.

### The Homelessness-Mental Health Iron Triangle

The fragmented federal structure creates an informal "iron triangle" that perpetuates the status quo:

1. **Congressional subcommittees** (HUD appropriations, SAMHSA authorization, VA appropriations) each control part of the funding but none has comprehensive oversight.
2. **Federal agencies** (HUD, SAMHSA, VA, CMS) each administer programs for the same population but lack integrated data systems or shared performance measures.
3. **Advocacy organizations** have specialized in either housing (NAEH, CSH) or mental health (NAMI, TAC), and the two advocacy communities do not always coordinate effectively.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on policy:

- **Lobbying**: The National Association of Realtors ($80+ million annual lobbying, NAR 2023) opposes affordable housing mandates. Mental health advocacy organizations spend comparatively little on lobbying (NAMI: ~$1 million annually). The NIMBY coalition operates primarily at the local level through zoning hearings and political campaigns.
- **Campaign Contributions**: Homelessness policy is not a major driver of campaign contributions at the federal level. At the local level, real estate developers and property owner associations contribute significantly to mayoral and city council candidates who support enforcement-oriented approaches.
- **Revolving Door**: Former HUD and SAMHSA officials often join supportive housing developers, consulting firms, or advocacy organizations, maintaining influence networks. Former law enforcement officials sometimes lead enforcement-oriented homeless policy initiatives.
- **Public Advocacy**: Homeless advocacy organizations rely on public education, media campaigns, and grassroots organizing. The "Housing First" message has been effective in reframing homelessness as a housing issue rather than a moral failing. Counter-campaigns by business improvement districts and public safety advocates emphasize quality-of-life concerns.
- **Expertise/Information**: Academic researchers and think tanks provide the evidence base that shapes policy. HUD-funded research (including AHAR data, point-in-time counts, and randomized controlled trials of Housing First) is the most influential data in the field. The Treatment Advocacy Center's data on psychiatric bed shortages and criminalization shapes the debate on treatment policy.
