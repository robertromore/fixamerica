# Mental Illness and Homelessness: Overview

## Overview

Mental illness and homelessness are deeply intertwined in the United States. An estimated 653,100 people experienced homelessness on a single night in January 2023, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR). Among those, roughly 30% of chronically homeless individuals live with a serious mental illness (SMI) such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, and broader estimates suggest that more than half of all people experiencing homelessness have some form of mental health condition. These rates far exceed the general population, where approximately 5.5% of adults have an SMI (SAMHSA, 2023).

The roots of the current crisis trace directly to deinstitutionalization. Between 1955 and 2000, the population of state psychiatric hospitals fell from 559,000 to fewer than 55,000 -- a 90% reduction -- without a corresponding investment in community-based mental health services. The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 promised outpatient alternatives, but federal and state funding never materialized at the necessary scale. The result was a population of severely mentally ill individuals discharged into communities lacking housing, treatment, and social support infrastructure.

Today, the federal response to homelessness among people with mental illness operates through several key programs: the Continuum of Care (CoC) competitive grant process, the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program funded through SAMHSA, and the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program for veterans. The Housing First model -- which provides immediate access to permanent housing without preconditions of sobriety or treatment compliance -- has become the dominant evidence-based approach endorsed by HUD, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Research consistently shows that Housing First programs achieve 80-90% housing retention rates after 12 months.

The policy landscape shifted significantly in 2024 when the Supreme Court ruled in *Grants Pass v. Johnson* that the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit cities from enforcing anti-camping ordinances against homeless individuals even when no shelter is available. This decision overturned the Ninth Circuit's *Martin v. City of Boise* framework and gave municipalities broader authority to clear encampments. The ruling has intensified debates about whether enforcement-first or housing-first strategies better serve people with mental illness living on the streets.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of mental illness and homelessness:

- **Prevalence and Diagnosis**: Rates of serious mental illness, co-occurring substance use disorders, and traumatic brain injury among homeless populations
- **Service System Architecture**: The CoC framework, PATH program, HUD-VASH, Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs), and crisis response systems
- **Housing Interventions**: Permanent supportive housing (PSH), Housing First methodology, rapid re-housing, and transitional housing models
- **Street Outreach and Engagement**: Mobile crisis teams, assertive community treatment (ACT), and strategies for engaging unsheltered individuals resistant to services
- **Legal and Rights Framework**: *Grants Pass v. Johnson* implications, involuntary treatment laws, encampment policies, and civil rights protections
- **Co-Occurring Disorders**: Intersection of mental illness with substance use, physical health conditions, and trauma histories

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Housing First vs. Treatment First**: Housing First provides housing without preconditions and has the strongest evidence base, but critics argue that some individuals with severe mental illness need structured treatment environments. The tension is whether unconditional housing access enables recovery or delays needed intervention.
- **Individual Autonomy vs. Public Safety**: People with mental illness have the right to refuse treatment, but untreated psychosis can lead to dangerous situations for both the individual and the community. Balancing civil liberties with protective intervention -- including involuntary commitment standards -- remains deeply contested.
- **Enforcement vs. Engagement**: After *Grants Pass*, cities face the choice of clearing encampments through policing or investing in outreach-driven engagement. Enforcement may reduce visible homelessness but often disperses people rather than connecting them to services, while voluntary outreach is slower and requires sustained investment.
- **Federal Framework vs. Local Control**: Homelessness manifests locally but is driven by national policy failures. Federal programs set standards and provide funding, but local CoCs make allocation decisions. Tensions arise over whether federal mandates (such as Housing First requirements) respect local conditions or impose one-size-fits-all approaches.
- **Scale vs. Fidelity**: Proven models like permanent supportive housing and ACT teams work when implemented with fidelity, but scaling them to meet national demand risks diluting quality. The gap between the estimated 300,000+ supportive housing units needed and the roughly 150,000 currently available illustrates the magnitude of the challenge.
- **Cost Framing**: Supportive housing costs approximately $20,000-$25,000 per person per year, but studies consistently show it reduces emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and incarceration that cost $30,000-$50,000 per person per year. Despite net savings, the upfront capital investment required to build housing creates political barriers.

## Key Questions

1. How can the United States close the gap between the supply and demand for permanent supportive housing for people with serious mental illness?
2. What policy reforms are needed to ensure that people discharged from psychiatric facilities, jails, and hospitals are not released into homelessness?
3. After *Grants Pass v. Johnson*, how should cities balance enforcement authority with evidence-based engagement strategies?
4. How can fragmented federal, state, and local systems be integrated to provide seamless mental health care, housing, and social services for people experiencing homelessness?

## Vision of Success

A successful policy framework for mental illness and homelessness would feature:

- **Adequate Supportive Housing Supply**: Enough permanent supportive housing units to serve every chronically homeless individual with SMI, eliminating the current shortfall of approximately 150,000+ units
- **Seamless Discharge Planning**: No person leaves a psychiatric hospital, jail, prison, or emergency room without a confirmed housing placement and linkage to ongoing mental health services
- **Robust Community Mental Health Infrastructure**: Fully funded CCBHCs and ACT teams in every community, providing assertive outreach, crisis stabilization, medication management, and wrap-around services
- **Functional Zero Chronic Homelessness**: Communities achieve and sustain "functional zero" for chronic homelessness among people with SMI, meaning any new episodes are rare, brief, and non-recurring
