# Mental Illness and Homelessness: Legislation

## Overview

Addressing mental illness and homelessness requires legislation at both the federal and state levels, targeting three interconnected failures: the shortage of permanent supportive housing, the inadequacy of community mental health infrastructure, and the fragmentation of service delivery across agencies and jurisdictions. The legislative approach is incremental rather than constitutional -- no amendments to the U.S. Constitution are required, and existing federal authority under the Spending Clause and Commerce Clause provides ample basis for the proposed reforms. The strategy combines new federal authorizations (a Permanent Supportive Housing Trust Fund, mandatory Medicaid ACT coverage) with state-level model legislation (discharge planning requirements, by-right supportive housing zoning).

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for this reform.* The federal government's authority to fund housing and mental health programs is well established under the Spending Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1), and Medicaid expansion falls squarely within existing federal-state cooperative federalism frameworks. State-level reforms operate under the general police power and spending authority of state governments.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish the Permanent Supportive Housing Trust Fund to expand permanent
supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals with serious mental
illness, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Permanent Supportive Housing Expansion
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development Annual
Homeless Assessment Report (2024), 653,100 people experienced homelessness
on a single night in January 2023, the highest number since systematic
counting began in 2007.

(2) According to SAMHSA (2023), approximately 163,000 people experiencing
homelessness have a serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, and major depressive disorder.

(3) The United States has approximately 150,000 permanent supportive
housing beds designated for chronically homeless individuals, but the
National Alliance to End Homelessness estimates that more than 300,000
units are needed, representing a gap of approximately 150,000 units.

(4) Research consistently demonstrates that permanent supportive housing
achieves 80-90 percent housing retention rates at 12 months and reduces
public costs by $30,000-$50,000 per person per year through avoided
emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and incarceration.

(5) The HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program,
which combines housing vouchers with clinical services, contributed to
a 55.3 percent reduction in veteran homelessness between 2010 and 2023,
demonstrating that permanent supportive housing works at scale.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL.--The term "chronically homeless
individual" means an individual who--
    (A) is homeless and lives in a place not meant for human habitation,

    continuously for at least 12 months or on at least 4 separate
    occasions in the last 3 years, as long as the combined occasions
    equal at least 12 months and each break in homelessness included
    at least 7 consecutive nights of not living as described in
    subparagraph (A); and
    (C) can be diagnosed with one or more of the following conditions:
    substance use disorder, serious mental illness, developmental
    disability, post-traumatic stress disorder, cognitive impairments
    resulting from brain injury, or chronic physical illness or
    disability.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual basis for Congressional action, citing HUD and SAMHSA data on the scale of the crisis and the evidence base for permanent supportive housing.
- **Section 4 (Trust Fund)**: Creates a dedicated funding mechanism separate from the annual CoC competition, ensuring predictable capital flow for housing development. The 70/30 capital-operating split reflects the need for both construction funding and long-term operating subsidies.
- **Section 5 (Housing First Fidelity)**: Codifies Housing First principles to ensure funded projects follow the evidence-based model. The prohibited and required practices are drawn from the Pathways to Housing fidelity framework.
- **Section 6 (Reporting)**: Requires transparency and accountability for all funded projects, including cost-offset documentation that will support continued appropriations.
- **Section 8 (Appropriations)**: Authorizes $4.5 billion annually for 5 years ($22.5 billion total), sufficient to fund approximately 75,000 units at $300,000 per unit in capital costs.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| HUD publishes proposed rules for Trust Fund | 180 days after enactment | HUD |
| Public comment period closes | 270 days after enactment | HUD/Public |
| Final rules published | 365 days after enactment | HUD |
| First round of applications accepted | 15 months after enactment | HUD |
| First grants awarded | 18 months after enactment | HUD |
| State zoning compliance deadline | 2 years after enactment | States |
| First new PSH units occupied | 30-36 months after enactment | Grantees |

**Regulatory Authority**: HUD Secretary administers the Trust Fund through the Office of Special Needs Assistance Programs. HUD will issue regulations defining application criteria, Housing First fidelity standards, reporting requirements, and state zoning compliance verification.

**Challenges**:

- **Appropriations risk**: Discretionary funding is subject to annual Congressional action and may be reduced in deficit-reduction negotiations.
- **State zoning compliance**: Some states may resist the by-right zoning requirement as an infringement on local control.
- **Construction costs**: In high-cost markets (San Francisco, New York, Boston), per-unit costs may exceed the national average of $300,000.

**Refinements**:

- **Add mandatory spending trigger**: Include a provision that converts appropriations to mandatory spending if chronic homelessness exceeds a specified threshold, providing budget certainty.
- **Include cost-containment mechanisms**: Cap per-unit capital subsidies by market tier, with waivers for highest-cost markets. Encourage acquisition and rehabilitation over new construction where feasible.
- **Strengthen matching requirement flexibility**: Allow in-kind contributions (donated land, fee waivers) to count toward the 25% state/local match.

### The Community Mental Health Infrastructure Act

**Purpose**: Establish mandatory Medicaid coverage for Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and make Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) a permanent, nationwide program.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Requires all state Medicaid programs to cover ACT as a mandatory benefit
2. Makes CCBHC certification permanent and available in all states
3. Establishes the CCBHC Prospective Payment System as the reimbursement standard
4. Requires CCBHCs to include homeless outreach and housing navigation services
5. Funds workforce development for community mental health

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish mandatory Medicaid coverage for Assertive Community Treatment,
make Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics permanent and nationwide,
and strengthen community mental health infrastructure for people experiencing
homelessness with serious mental illness.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Community Mental Health Infrastructure
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Only 40 percent of adults with serious mental illness receive any
mental health services (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023).

(2) Only 10 percent of people with serious mental illness receive
Assertive Community Treatment, the intervention with the strongest
evidence base for this population (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022).

(3) As of 2024, only 10 states had fully implemented Certified Community
Behavioral Health Clinics, which provide comprehensive community-based
mental health and substance use services.

(4) A national evaluation by Mathematica (2023) found that CCBHCs reduced
emergency department visits by 18.5 percent and inpatient psychiatric
hospitalizations by 9.2 percent.

(5) The behavioral health workforce faces a shortage of approximately
8,000 psychiatrists and 30,000 other mental health professionals
(HRSA, 2023).

SEC. 3. MANDATORY MEDICAID COVERAGE OF ASSERTIVE COMMUNITY TREATMENT.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act
(42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)) is amended to include Assertive Community
Treatment as a mandatory benefit for individuals with serious
mental illness who meet clinical criteria established by the
Secretary.

(b) DEFINITION.--For purposes of this section, "Assertive Community
Treatment" means a multidisciplinary team-based model that--
    (1) provides comprehensive psychiatric treatment, rehabilitation,
    and support services;
    (2) delivers services primarily in community settings, including
    streets, shelters, and homes;
    (3) maintains a staff-to-client ratio of not more than 1:10;
    (4) provides 24-hour crisis coverage; and
    (5) operates with a team that includes, at minimum, a psychiatrist,
    a registered nurse, a social worker, and a peer support specialist.

(c) ENHANCED FEDERAL MATCHING RATE.--For the first 3 years after the
date of enactment, the Federal medical assistance percentage for
Assertive Community Treatment services shall be increased by 10
percentage points above the applicable rate.

SEC. 4. PERMANENT NATIONWIDE CCBHC PROGRAM.

(a) IN GENERAL.--The Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic
program established under section 223 of the Protecting Access to
Medicare Act of 2014 is hereby made permanent and expanded to all
50 States, the District of Columbia, and the territories.

(b) CERTIFICATION.--Any community behavioral health organization may
apply for CCBHC certification from the state mental health authority
upon meeting criteria established by SAMHSA, including--
    (1) provision of crisis services, outpatient mental health and
    substance use treatment, primary care screening, and care for
    members of the armed forces and veterans;
    (2) a commitment to serve all individuals regardless of ability
    to pay;
    (3) inclusion of homeless outreach and housing navigation services;
    (4) employment of peer support specialists.

(c) REIMBURSEMENT.--CCBHCs shall be reimbursed under the Prospective
Payment System established by the Secretary, which shall be based on
the cost of providing the required services.

SEC. 5. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

(a) LOAN REPAYMENT.--The National Health Service Corps loan repayment
program is expanded to include mental health professionals who work
in CCBHCs, PATH programs, or permanent supportive housing programs
serving chronically homeless individuals.

(b) PEER SPECIALIST GRANTS.--The Secretary shall award grants to states
to develop or expand peer support specialist certification programs,
with priority given to programs that recruit individuals with lived
experience of homelessness.

(c) SALARY SUPPLEMENTS.--The Secretary shall establish a program of
annual salary supplements of not less than $10,000 for frontline
workers in homeless outreach, shelter, and supportive housing programs,
to be administered through PATH or CoC grantees.

SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated--
    (1) for CCBHC start-up grants, $500,000,000 for each of fiscal
    years 2027 through 2031;
    (2) for workforce development under section 5, $2,000,000,000
    for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2031;
    (3) such sums as may be necessary for the enhanced Federal
    medical assistance percentage under section 3(c).

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

(a) ACT services coverage under section 3 shall take effect beginning
with the first plan year that begins 18 months or more after the date
of enactment.

(b) CCBHC expansion under section 4 shall take effect immediately
upon enactment.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Mandatory ACT Coverage)**: Converts ACT from a state-optional service to a mandatory Medicaid benefit, ensuring coverage nationwide. The enhanced matching rate incentivizes state participation during the transition period.
- **Section 4 (Permanent CCBHCs)**: Eliminates the demonstration-phase structure that has limited CCBHC expansion to willing states. Making the program permanent provides certainty for state planning and provider investment.
- **Section 5 (Workforce)**: Addresses the root constraint on service delivery -- the shortage of qualified professionals -- through loan repayment, peer specialist expansion, and salary supplements.

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS implements Medicaid ACT mandate and CCBHC reimbursement. SAMHSA administers CCBHC certification, workforce grants, and peer specialist programs.

**Challenges**:

- **CBO scoring**: Mandatory Medicaid ACT coverage will increase federal spending, potentially triggering PAYGO offsets.
- **State resistance**: States concerned about Medicaid costs may oppose the mandate even with enhanced matching.
- **Workforce pipeline**: New funding cannot immediately produce more psychiatrists; the psychiatry training pipeline requires 4+ years.

**Refinements**:

- **Phase in the ACT mandate**: Allow states 3 years to implement, with technical assistance from SAMHSA.
- **Include telehealth**: Permit ACT teams to use telepsychiatry for psychiatric consultation when in-person psychiatrists are unavailable, particularly in rural areas.
- **Add performance incentives**: Provide bonus payments to CCBHCs that achieve superior outcomes in housing stability and reduced homelessness among their patients.

## State Model Legislation

### Model Institutional Discharge Planning Act

**Purpose**: Require all psychiatric hospitals, general hospital psychiatric units, jails, and emergency departments to develop written discharge plans that include confirmed housing placement for patients with mental illness, preventing discharge to homelessness.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize commitment definitions and timelines to align with their existing involuntary treatment statutes. Larger states may designate regional discharge planning coordinators; smaller states may centralize the function.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Institutional
Discharge Planning Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The [State] Legislature finds that:

(a) A significant percentage of people discharged from psychiatric
facilities, hospitals, and jails become homeless within 30 days of
release due to inadequate discharge planning.

(b) Discharge to homelessness leads to rapid readmission, criminal
justice involvement, and deteriorating health at significant cost
to the state.

(c) Research demonstrates that structured discharge planning reduces
readmission rates by 20-30 percent and prevents homelessness episodes.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Covered facility" means any state psychiatric hospital, general
hospital psychiatric unit, county or municipal jail, state prison,
or emergency department.

(b) "Discharge plan" means a written plan developed before an
individual's release from a covered facility that identifies
post-discharge housing, mental health services, medication access,
income support, and a responsible care coordinator.

(c) "Confirmed housing placement" means documented acceptance into
permanent housing, transitional housing, a residential treatment
program, or a family or supportive living arrangement, but does
not include emergency shelter, a park, a street, or "whereabouts
unknown."

SECTION 4. DISCHARGE PLANNING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) No covered facility shall discharge any individual with a
diagnosed serious mental illness without a completed discharge
plan that includes a confirmed housing placement.

(b) The discharge plan shall be initiated within 24 hours of
admission or booking and finalized not less than 72 hours before
the scheduled discharge date.

(c) Each covered facility shall designate a discharge planning
coordinator responsible for developing and implementing discharge
plans.

(d) The discharge planning coordinator shall collaborate with the
local Continuum of Care, community mental health providers, and
housing agencies to identify appropriate placements.

SECTION 5. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) The [State Department of Health/Mental Health Authority] shall
monitor compliance through annual facility inspections and review
of discharge records.

(b) Facilities found to be in noncompliance shall be subject to
corrective action plans and, for repeated violations, civil
penalties of not more than $10,000 per violation.

SECTION 6. REPORTING.

Each covered facility shall report quarterly to the [State Department
of Health] on the number of individuals discharged, the percentage
with completed discharge plans, and the percentage with confirmed
housing placements.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], except that the discharge
planning requirements under Section 4 shall apply beginning 180 days
after the effective date.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agencies**: HUD (Permanent Supportive Housing Trust Fund), CMS (Medicaid ACT mandate, CCBHC reimbursement), SAMHSA (CCBHC certification, PATH program, workforce grants).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **HUD Trust Fund Regulations**: Application criteria, Housing First fidelity standards, state zoning compliance verification, reporting requirements. Statutory deadline: 365 days after enactment.
2. **CMS ACT Coverage Rules**: Clinical eligibility criteria for Medicaid ACT services, provider qualifications, reimbursement methodology, enhanced matching rate implementation. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment.
3. **SAMHSA CCBHC Certification Standards**: Updated certification criteria incorporating homeless outreach and housing navigation requirements, Prospective Payment System methodology. Statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment.
4. **CMS Discharge Planning Conditions of Participation**: Updated Conditions of Participation for hospitals and psychiatric facilities requiring discharge plans with confirmed housing for patients with SMI. Existing CMS authority under 42 CFR Part 482.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: HUD may impose penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for PSH projects that fail to maintain Housing First fidelity. CMS may impose Conditions of Participation deficiencies for facilities that discharge patients without plans.
- **Administrative Actions**: HUD may terminate or recapture Trust Fund grants for noncompliant projects. CMS may decertify facilities that repeatedly violate discharge planning requirements.
- **Private Right of Action**: No express private right of action is created by the federal legislation, but individuals may challenge Medicaid coverage denials through existing Medicaid fair hearing processes.
- **State Enforcement**: Under the model Institutional Discharge Planning Act, state health departments enforce compliance through inspections and civil penalties.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: The Permanent Supportive Housing Trust Fund operates through federal grants to state and local entities, well within Congress's spending power. The condition that states adopt by-right zoning is a permissible condition on federal funds under *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), provided it is reasonably related to the federal interest in housing development and is not coercive.

**Medicaid Mandate**: The mandatory Medicaid ACT coverage provision requires careful drafting in light of *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), which held that the ACA's Medicaid expansion was impermissibly coercive. However, requiring coverage of a specific service within the existing Medicaid program (rather than expanding eligibility) is distinguishable and falls within Congress's well-established authority to define minimum benefits under Medicaid.

**Federalism Concerns**: The by-right zoning condition respects state sovereignty because it operates through conditional spending, not direct regulation. States may decline Trust Fund grants if they prefer to maintain discretionary zoning processes. The Institutional Discharge Planning Act is model legislation for voluntary state adoption.

### Preemption

Federal PSH Trust Fund requirements preempt conflicting state or local laws regarding Housing First implementation in federally funded projects. The Medicaid ACT mandate preempts state Medicaid plans that exclude ACT coverage. No broader preemption of state housing, zoning, or mental health law is intended. A savings clause should preserve state authority to impose additional requirements beyond federal minimums.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance with Housing First fidelity standards is monitored through annual HUD reporting requirements and independent evaluation. CMS monitors Medicaid ACT coverage through standard state plan review processes. SAMHSA monitors CCBHC certification through periodic audits. State-level discharge planning compliance is enforced through state health department inspection authority.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| "Housing First" label without fidelity | Providers could label programs "Housing First" while imposing de facto treatment requirements through program rules, house meetings, or informal pressure | High | Require annual fidelity assessments using validated instruments (e.g., Pathways Housing First Fidelity Scale); condition continued funding on passing scores |
| Zoning "by right" with excessive building code requirements | States could technically comply with by-right zoning while imposing parking, setback, density, or design standards that make PSH development infeasible | High | Define "by right" to include prohibition on requirements more restrictive than those applied to comparable residential developments in the same zone |
| Discharge plan to "transitional housing" as a loophole | Facilities could satisfy discharge planning requirements by placing individuals in 30-day shelters or transitional programs that end before permanent housing is secured | Medium | Define "confirmed housing placement" to require linkage to permanent housing within 90 days; require follow-up verification at 30, 60, and 90 days |
| CCBHC certification without meaningful homeless services | Clinics could meet minimum certification standards without truly serving unsheltered populations, focusing instead on easier-to-reach patients | Medium | Include homeless-specific performance metrics in CCBHC certification (e.g., minimum percentage of patients who are homeless; required outreach hours per week) |
| States opting out of ACT mandate through Medicaid waivers | States could seek Section 1115 waivers to modify or reduce the ACT mandate | Medium | Include anti-waiver provision specifying that ACT coverage may not be waived under Section 1115 for the first 10 years |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| PSH Trust Fund depends on annual appropriations | Funding uncertainty deters long-term development planning and investor confidence | Political difficulty of securing mandatory spending for housing | Advocate for conversion to mandatory spending; include "such sums as necessary" authorization as fallback; build bipartisan support through cost-offset data |
| Psychiatrist shortage cannot be resolved quickly | ACT team expansion is constrained by the 4+ year psychiatry training pipeline | Decades of underinvestment in psychiatry residency slots | Expand telepsychiatry; expand scope of practice for psychiatric nurse practitioners; increase GME slots with homeless-specific rotations |
| NIMBY opposition remains even with by-right zoning | Community opposition may shift from zoning to litigation, building code challenges, or political pressure on elected officials | Deep-seated stigma toward mental illness and homelessness | Fund public education campaigns; require community benefit agreements; document property value impacts of existing PSH |
| Cross-system savings are difficult to capture | Savings from PSH accrue to ER, jail, and Medicaid budgets, not to the housing budget that bears the cost | Fragmented government accounting; siloed budgets | Establish cross-system savings capture demonstration projects; create shared savings agreements between HUD, CMS, and DOJ |
| Enforcement after *Grants Pass* may undermine outreach | Cities may use encampment sweeps that disrupt service engagement for people with SMI | Supreme Court precedent removing constitutional constraint on camping bans | Condition federal homelessness funds on "engagement before enforcement" protocols; fund outreach-enforcement partnerships |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Housing First fidelity enforcement**: Amend Trust Fund regulations to require annual fidelity assessments using the Pathways Housing First Fidelity Scale. Projects scoring below minimum thresholds receive technical assistance; projects failing for 2 consecutive years face grant termination.
2. **Zoning definition strengthening**: Amend the by-right zoning provision to specify that supportive housing may not be subject to parking, density, setback, or design requirements more restrictive than those applied to other residential buildings in the same zone.
3. **Discharge plan verification**: Add 30/60/90-day follow-up verification requirements to the model Institutional Discharge Planning Act, with reporting to the state health department and penalties for facilities with high rates of failed placements.
4. **CCBHC homeless services minimum**: Include in CCBHC certification standards a requirement that at least 10% of patients served be individuals experiencing homelessness, and that each CCBHC maintain at least one dedicated street outreach team.
5. **ACT anti-waiver provision**: Include a 10-year moratorium on Section 1115 waivers that would reduce or modify the mandatory ACT benefit.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Permanent Supportive Housing Trust Fund authorization expires after 5 years (FY2027-FY2031) and must be reauthorized. The independent evaluation mandated in Section 7 provides the evidence base for reauthorization decisions. The CCBHC program and Medicaid ACT mandate are permanent and do not include sunset provisions, reflecting the ongoing nature of community mental health needs. A 10-year comprehensive review of the entire legislative package is mandated, with a report to Congress assessing outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and recommendations for modifications.
