# Mental Illness and Homelessness: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The implementation strategy follows a three-phase progression designed to build capacity before scaling demand. Phase 1 focuses on administrative actions, regulatory reforms, and quick-win legislation that can be implemented without major new appropriations. Phase 2 ramps up capital investment, workforce development, and systems integration. Phase 3 achieves full buildout and systemic transformation. Each phase builds on the previous one: Phase 1 creates the policy infrastructure, Phase 2 deploys resources at scale, and Phase 3 sustains outcomes and closes remaining gaps.

The strategy is informed by the successful reduction of veteran homelessness (55.3% decline since 2010), which followed a similar progression: policy alignment (Housing First adoption), targeted investment (HUD-VASH vouchers), and coordinated accountability (Built for Zero campaign). The roadmap applies this model to the broader population of people with serious mental illness experiencing homelessness.

## Phase 3: Transformation and Sustainability (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Complete the PSH buildout and close the remaining housing gap
- Achieve functional zero chronic homelessness among people with SMI in all major CoCs
- Sustain community mental health infrastructure through permanent financing
- Eliminate discharge-to-homelessness from all institutional settings
- Establish ongoing prevention systems that prevent new chronic homelessness

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Complete remaining PSH construction (100,000+ units) | HUD/State housing agencies | Years 6-10 | $4.5 billion annually (continued) | 150,000+ total new units completed |

### Expected Outcomes

By Year 10, the United States will have added 150,000+ PSH units, ensuring that every chronically homeless individual with SMI has access to permanent supportive housing. Chronic homelessness among people with SMI will have been reduced by 80%+ from 2023 levels. A fully funded community mental health infrastructure -- including CCBHCs, ACT teams, crisis response, and prevention services -- will be operational nationwide. No person will be discharged from a psychiatric hospital, jail, or emergency room without a confirmed housing plan.

| Outreach worker turnover | Annual | Annual turnover rate in homeless services | >30% | 25% | 20% | <15% |

## Governance and Oversight

### Federal Coordination

USICH serves as the lead coordinating body, with authority to convene HUD, SAMHSA, CMS, VA, and DOJ for joint planning. USICH will publish annual progress reports to Congress benchmarking each metric against targets. An independent evaluation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will assess implementation fidelity and outcomes at the end of each phase.

### State Accountability

States receiving federal PSH Trust Fund or CCBHC expansion funds will submit annual performance reports to HUD and SAMHSA. States failing to meet minimum performance thresholds for 2 consecutive years will receive targeted technical assistance; persistent underperformance will trigger funding reallocation.

### Local Implementation

CoCs remain the primary local planning entity. Each CoC will develop a 5-year strategic plan for reducing chronic homelessness among people with SMI, with annual reporting to HUD. The Built for Zero methodology provides the data-driven framework for local goal-setting and accountability.

### Independent Evaluation

A congressionally mandated evaluation (modeled on the CCBHC national evaluation by Mathematica) will assess cost-effectiveness, housing outcomes, mental health outcomes, and quality of life for program participants. The evaluation will include a randomized or quasi-experimental design component to isolate program effects.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Congressional Appropriations Shortfalls

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design legislation with mandatory spending authorization where possible (e.g., Medicaid entitlement for ACT and housing-related services) rather than relying solely on annual discretionary appropriations. Build bipartisan coalitions using cost-savings data. Phase investments to demonstrate results before requesting full-scale funding.

**Contingency Plan**: If appropriations fall short, prioritize operating funds for existing PSH and ACT teams over new construction. Leverage state and local matching funds through competitive incentives.

### Risk 2: NIMBY Opposition Blocks PSH Development

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium-High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Condition federal housing funds on by-right zoning adoption (modeled on California AB 2162). Fund community benefit agreements for PSH developments. Provide data on property value impacts (research consistently shows no negative effect from well-managed PSH). Require community engagement processes but prohibit discretionary siting approvals that enable project-by-project opposition.

**Contingency Plan**: Shift capital investment toward acquisition and rehabilitation of existing buildings (which face less siting opposition than new construction). Expand scattered-site PSH models using tenant-based vouchers with intensive services.

### Risk 3: Behavioral Health Workforce Insufficient for Scale-Up

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Aggressive NHSC loan repayment and salary supplement programs. Expanded use of peer support specialists, community health workers, and telehealth for psychiatric consultation. New GME psychiatry residency slots. Immigration reform to facilitate credentialing of foreign-trained psychiatrists.

**Contingency Plan**: Deploy telehealth-augmented ACT teams where in-person psychiatrists are unavailable. Expand scope of practice for nurse practitioners and physician assistants in psychiatric care.

### Risk 4: Political Backlash Against Housing First

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Reframe Housing First as "housing-led" or "rapid resolution" to reduce political toxicity. Emphasize that Housing First does not mean "housing only" -- services are offered, just not required as a precondition. Publicize outcomes data showing superior results to treatment-first alternatives.

**Contingency Plan**: Design legislation that funds both housing and treatment, satisfying advocates on both sides. Allow local flexibility in service models while maintaining the core principle that housing access is not conditioned on treatment compliance.

### Risk 5: *Grants Pass* Enforcement Undermines Outreach

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Promote engagement-first models (Houston, Columbus) as alternatives to enforcement-only approaches. Fund outreach-enforcement partnerships where outreach workers accompany enforcement teams to offer services before or during encampment actions. Condition federal grants on "engagement before enforcement" protocols.

**Contingency Plan**: If cities pursue aggressive enforcement, ensure that mobile crisis teams and outreach workers are deployed simultaneously to connect displaced individuals with services. Fund legal aid for individuals whose rights are violated during enforcement.
