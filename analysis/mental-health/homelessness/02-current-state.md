# Mental Illness and Homelessness: Current State

## Prevalence and Demographics

The United States experienced a record level of homelessness in 2023. The HUD Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress, released in December 2024, documented 653,100 people experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2023 -- a 12% increase from 2022 and the highest figure since systematic counting began in 2007 (HUD, 2024).

### Overall Homelessness Trends

| Metric | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total PIT count | 580,466 | 553,742 | 582,462 | 653,100 | Up 12.4% | HUD AHAR, 2024 |
| Unsheltered individuals | 226,080 | 213,534 | 233,832 | 256,610 | Up 9.7% | HUD AHAR, 2024 |
| Chronically homeless | 110,528 | 111,611 | 127,768 | 143,105 | Up 12.0% | HUD AHAR, 2024 |
| Sheltered individuals | 354,386 | 340,208 | 348,630 | 396,490 | Up 13.7% | HUD AHAR, 2024 |
| Veterans experiencing homelessness | 37,252 | 36,681 | 33,136 | 35,574 | Up 7.4% | HUD AHAR, 2024 |

### Mental Illness Among Homeless Populations

Mental illness prevalence among people experiencing homelessness significantly exceeds rates in the housed general population. Precise national figures are difficult to obtain because the PIT count does not assess mental health status for all individuals, and self-reported survey data undercount conditions among unsheltered populations who are hardest to reach.

| Population | SMI Rate | Any Mental Illness Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chronically homeless individuals | ~30% | ~50-60% | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| All homeless adults (sheltered) | ~25% | ~45% | HUD AHAR supplemental, 2023 |
| Unsheltered individuals | ~35-40% | ~60% | SAMHSA/USICH estimates, 2023 |
| General adult population | 5.5% | 22.8% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |
| Incarcerated population | ~15-20% | ~40% | Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023 |

### Co-Occurring Disorders

Co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorder (dual diagnosis) is the norm rather than the exception among homeless populations with mental health conditions. This comorbidity dramatically complicates service delivery, as mental health and substance use treatment systems have historically operated in silos.

| Condition Combination | Prevalence Among Homeless Adults with SMI | Source |
|---|---|---|
| SMI + substance use disorder | ~50% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |
| SMI + alcohol use disorder | ~35% | National Institute on Alcohol Abuse, 2022 |
| SMI + opioid use disorder | ~15-20% | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| SMI + traumatic brain injury (TBI) | ~40-50% | Hwang et al., Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation, 2022 |
| SMI + PTSD | ~30-35% | National Health Care for the Homeless Council, 2022 |
| SMI + chronic physical health condition | ~60% | HCH Clinician's Network, 2023 |

### Demographic Breakdown

| Demographic | Share of Homeless Pop. | SMI Rate Within Group | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Black/African American | 37% of total (6x overrepresented) | ~28% | HUD AHAR, 2024 |

## Legal Landscape

### *Grants Pass v. Johnson* (2024)

The Supreme Court's June 2024 decision in *City of Grants Pass v. Johnson*, 603 U.S. ___ (2024), held 6-3 that the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause does not prohibit the enforcement of generally applicable laws regulating camping on public property, even against individuals who have no access to shelter. This overturned the Ninth Circuit's *Martin v. City of Boise*, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019), which had held that cities could not criminalize sleeping outdoors when insufficient shelter beds were available.

| Pre-*Grants Pass* (Ninth Circuit) | Post-*Grants Pass* |
|---|---|
| Cities in 9 western states could not enforce camping bans when shelter was unavailable | All cities may enforce camping bans regardless of shelter availability |
| Practical immunity from encampment sweeps | Municipal discretion restored |
| Incentivized shelter expansion | Enforcement-first approaches legally authorized |
| Applied only in Ninth Circuit | Nationwide precedent |

### State Involuntary Treatment Laws

States vary dramatically in their standards for involuntary psychiatric commitment, which directly affects whether people with severe, untreated mental illness who are homeless can be brought into care.

| Standard | States Using | Examples | Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Imminent danger to self or others | ~36 states | Most states | Highest -- requires immediate threat |
| Grave disability | ~30 states (overlapping) | California, Washington | Inability to provide food/shelter/clothing |
| Need for treatment (broadest) | ~6 states | New York (Kendra's Law), California (CARE Act) | Deteriorating condition + treatment likely to help |
| Assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) | 47 states | New York, California, Florida | Court-ordered outpatient treatment |

### Key Laws and Regulations

| Law/Regulation | Year | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Community Mental Health Act** | 1963 | Funded community mental health centers (partially implemented) |
| **McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act** | 1987 | First comprehensive federal homelessness legislation |
| **HEARTH Act** | 2009 | Reauthorized McKinney-Vento, established CoC framework, prevention focus |
| **Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Act** | 2014 | Created model for comprehensive community mental health |
| **21st Century Cures Act** | 2016 | Expanded mental health parity, crisis services, CCBHC funding |
| **988 Implementation Act** | 2020 | Established 988 crisis lifeline, required crisis response infrastructure |
| **California CARE Act** | 2022 | Created court-ordered community treatment plans for certain individuals |

## Geographic Variation

Homelessness and mental illness services vary dramatically by region, driven by housing costs, climate, state mental health systems, and local policy choices.

### Top 10 CoCs by Total Homelessness (PIT 2023)

| Los Angeles City and County | 75,518 | 46,260 | 26,424 | Housing costs, encampment scale |
| New York City | 87,689 | 4,439 | 6,854 | Shelter system strain, right-to-shelter mandate |
| Seattle/King County | 13,368 | 7,992 | 5,103 | Fentanyl crisis, high housing costs |
| San Jose/Santa Clara County | 10,028 | 7,922 | 4,217 | Tech economy displacement |
| San Francisco | 8,323 | 4,397 | 3,140 | Co-occurring disorders, limited housing stock |
| San Diego City and County | 8,427 | 4,106 | 3,068 | Climate migration, veteran population |
| Phoenix/Maricopa County | 9,026 | 3,396 | 2,944 | Rapidly growing unsheltered population |
| Oakland/Alameda County | 9,747 | 5,859 | 3,885 | Encampment density, fentanyl |

|---|---|---|
| Highest bed rates (>20/100K) | 20-40 | Mississippi, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota |
| Moderate bed rates (10-20/100K) | 10-20 | Most states |
| Lowest bed rates (<10/100K) | 3-10 | Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Vermont, Minnesota |
| National average (2023) | ~11 per 100,000 | Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023 |
| 1955 peak | ~340 per 100,000 | Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023 |

## Recent Trends

### Rising Unsheltered Homelessness (2018-2023)

Unsheltered homelessness has increased 23% since 2018, driven by rising housing costs, the opioid/fentanyl crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic's economic aftermath. Among unsheltered individuals, mental illness prevalence is highest, with estimates ranging from 35-40% for SMI.

### Fentanyl and the Co-Occurring Disorder Crisis

The proliferation of illicit fentanyl since 2019 has dramatically worsened outcomes for homeless individuals with mental illness. Fentanyl's extreme potency increases overdose risk, and its widespread availability on the street has made co-occurring substance use disorder harder to treat. Overdose deaths among homeless populations rose an estimated 78% between 2019 and 2023 (National Health Care for the Homeless Council, 2023).

### Post-Pandemic Policy Shifts

The expiration of pandemic-era protections -- including the CDC eviction moratorium (ended August 2021), Emergency Rental Assistance (largely exhausted by 2023), and expanded Medicaid coverage -- contributed to rising homelessness. At the same time, Congress provided record one-time investments in homelessness services, including $5 billion through the American Rescue Plan Act HOME-ARP program (2021).

### Aging Homeless Population

The median age of people experiencing homelessness has risen steadily, from approximately 35 years in 1990 to over 50 years in 2023 (University of Pennsylvania study, 2023). Older homeless adults with mental illness face accelerated physical decline, with research showing they develop geriatric conditions 10-20 years earlier than housed peers.

## Emerging Challenges

### *Grants Pass* Implementation

Cities are adopting divergent approaches in response to the *Grants Pass* decision. Some, including Phoenix and Austin, have expanded encampment sweeps. Others, including Houston and Columbus, have maintained engagement-first strategies. The disparity is creating a patchwork legal landscape and potential migration effects as people experiencing homelessness move to more permissive jurisdictions.

### Workforce Crisis in Behavioral Health

Community mental health centers, outreach teams, and supportive housing programs face severe staffing shortages. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) estimates a shortage of approximately 8,000 psychiatrists and 30,000 other mental health professionals nationally (HRSA, 2023). Turnover rates in homeless services programs exceed 30% annually, undermining program quality and participant trust.

### Medicaid Reimbursement Gaps

While Medicaid is the primary funder of mental health services for homeless individuals, many services critical to engagement and stabilization -- street outreach, peer support, housing navigation -- are not consistently reimbursable across states. The CCBHC model provides a more comprehensive reimbursement structure, but only 10 states had fully implemented CCBHC programs as of 2024.

### Climate-Driven Vulnerability

Extreme heat, cold, and natural disasters disproportionately affect unsheltered individuals with mental illness. Heat-related deaths among homeless populations have increased significantly in cities like Phoenix (where 645 heat-associated deaths were recorded in 2023, many among unsheltered individuals; Maricopa County, 2024).
