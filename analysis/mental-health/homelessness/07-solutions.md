# Mental Illness and Homelessness: Solutions

Addressing mental illness and homelessness requires a multi-faceted approach that simultaneously expands housing supply, strengthens community mental health infrastructure, integrates fragmented service systems, and creates the workforce necessary to deliver care at scale. No single intervention can resolve a crisis driven by decades of disinvestment across multiple systems. The solutions presented here are grounded in evidence from rigorous research, successful pilot programs, and international models.

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- **Housing as a platform for recovery**: Stable housing is a prerequisite for effective mental health treatment, not a reward for achieving it. Policy must ensure that housing is available before, during, and after treatment engagement.
- **Integrated, person-centered care**: Services must be organized around the needs of the individual, not the administrative boundaries of agencies. A person with co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorder should not need to navigate separate intake processes for housing, psychiatric care, addiction treatment, and income support.
- **Scale with fidelity**: Evidence-based models -- permanent supportive housing, Housing First, assertive community treatment -- work when implemented with fidelity. Scaling these models requires investment in training, workforce development, and quality assurance, not just funding.
- **Prevention alongside intervention**: Preventing homelessness among people with mental illness (through discharge planning, early intervention, and safety net strengthening) is more cost-effective and humane than responding after the fact.
- **Cross-system savings capture**: The costs of inaction ($30,000-$50,000 per person per year in emergency room, jail, and shelter expenses) exceed the costs of permanent supportive housing ($20,000-$25,000 per person per year). Policy must create mechanisms to capture savings across systems and reinvest them in proven solutions.

### Theory of Change

The current crisis results from the failure to build community-based alternatives after deinstitutionalization. The theory of change is straightforward: if the United States invests in a sufficient supply of permanent supportive housing, funds community mental health teams to provide proactive outreach and treatment, integrates housing and health care financing, and prevents discharge into homelessness from institutions, the chronically homeless population with serious mental illness can be reduced to functional zero within a decade. This approach has been proven at scale for veteran homelessness (55.3% reduction since 2010) and in individual communities (Houston, which reduced total homelessness by 63% between 2011 and 2023).

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: National Permanent Supportive Housing Expansion

**Description**: Close the estimated 150,000+ unit gap in permanent supportive housing (PSH) through a dedicated federal capital and operating fund. PSH combines affordable housing with voluntary, on-site or linked supportive services including psychiatric care, substance use treatment, case management, and life skills support. The federal government would provide capital subsidies for construction or acquisition, paired with project-based rental assistance and Medicaid-funded services. States and localities would contribute land, zoning approval, and service coordination.

**Evidence Base**: PSH is the most rigorously studied intervention for chronically homeless individuals with serious mental illness. The original Housing First randomized controlled trial by Tsemberis et al. (2004) demonstrated 80-88% housing retention at 12 months versus 47% for treatment-first programs. Culhane et al. (2002) documented net public savings of $16,282 per person per year in New York City. Studies in Denver (Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, 2019), Charlotte (Moore et al., 2006), and Los Angeles (Economic Roundtable, 2018) confirm annual savings of $30,000-$50,000 per person through reduced emergency room, hospital, and jail utilization.

**Implementation**:
1. Congress authorizes and appropriates a 10-year Permanent Supportive Housing Trust Fund
2. HUD administers competitive grants to state housing finance agencies and local housing authorities
3. Projects must meet Housing First fidelity standards (no sobriety or treatment preconditions)
4. Medicaid and SAMHSA fund wrap-around services through CCBHCs or equivalent providers
5. States adopt by-right zoning for supportive housing (modeled on California AB 2162)

**Cost/Resources**: Closing the 150,000-unit gap at $300,000 per unit (national average) requires approximately $45 billion in capital over 10 years ($4.5 billion annually). Operating costs of $22,500 per unit per year add $3.4 billion annually at full capacity. Total 10-year cost: approximately $79 billion. However, cost-offset studies project $30,000-$50,000 per person per year in avoided emergency costs, yielding net savings of $7,500-$27,500 per person per year once housed.

**Timeline**: 5-10 years for full buildout. Early units deliverable within 2-3 years through acquisition and rehabilitation of existing buildings.

**Challenges**: NIMBY opposition to siting; construction cost inflation; workforce to staff service programs; sustaining political will across administrations.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of PSH units completed; housing retention rate at 12 months (target: 85%+); reduction in chronically homeless PIT count; emergency room utilization among PSH residents.

### Solution 2: Nationwide Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Expansion

**Description**: Make the CCBHC model permanent and universal, ensuring that every community has access to a comprehensive behavioral health provider that can serve people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. CCBHCs are required to provide crisis services, outpatient mental health and substance use treatment, primary care screening, care coordination, and services for veterans and military families -- with no one turned away regardless of ability to pay. The Prospective Payment System (PPS) reimbursement model ensures CCBHCs are funded based on the cost of care rather than fee-for-service volume.

**Evidence Base**: A 2023 national evaluation by Mathematica found that CCBHCs reduced emergency department visits by 18.5% and inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations by 9.2% in their first two years. CCBHCs served 2.1 million people in their first year of expanded operations (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023). The CCBHC model addresses the Medicaid reimbursement gaps that have historically prevented community mental health centers from funding outreach, crisis services, and wrap-around supports for homeless populations.

**Implementation**:
1. Congress passes the CCBHC Nondiscrimination and Parity Act to make CCBHC certification available in all states
2. CMS establishes the PPS reimbursement rate for all CCBHCs
3. States apply for CCBHC certification for existing community mental health centers
4. CCBHCs are required to include homeless-specific outreach and housing navigation services
5. SAMHSA provides technical assistance and quality monitoring

**Cost/Resources**: Federal cost estimated at $3-5 billion annually in additional Medicaid spending, partially offset by reduced emergency department and inpatient utilization. Start-up grants for new CCBHCs estimated at $500 million over 5 years.

**Timeline**: 2-5 years for nationwide implementation. States with existing CCBHC demonstration programs can expand within 1-2 years.

**Challenges**: State participation varies (only 10 states had fully implemented CCBHCs as of 2024); workforce shortages limit clinic capacity; PPS rate-setting is complex.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of operational CCBHCs; people served annually; reduction in unmet mental health needs; ER diversion rates; homelessness prevention outcomes.

### Solution 3: Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Team Expansion

**Description**: Fund a national expansion of ACT teams -- multidisciplinary mobile treatment teams that provide intensive, community-based psychiatric care to individuals with the most severe mental illness who are homeless or at high risk. ACT teams include psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, peer support specialists, and substance use counselors who deliver services wherever the client is (on the street, in shelters, in supportive housing), with low caseload ratios (approximately 10:1) and 24/7 availability.

**Evidence Base**: ACT is the most rigorously studied community mental health intervention, with more than 25 randomized controlled trials demonstrating its effectiveness. ACT reduces psychiatric hospitalization by 20-40%, increases housing stability, improves medication adherence, and reduces substance use among people with severe mental illness (Bond et al., *Psychiatric Services*, 2001). The Treatment Advocacy Center reports that only 10% of people with SMI currently have access to ACT.

**Implementation**:
1. SAMHSA establishes a dedicated ACT expansion grant program
2. Medicaid covers ACT as a reimbursable service in all states (currently inconsistent)
3. ACT teams are co-located with or linked to permanent supportive housing programs
4. Fidelity monitoring ensures teams maintain the evidence-based ACT model (TMACT or DACTS fidelity scales)

**Cost/Resources**: Each ACT team costs approximately $500,000-$800,000 annually to operate and serves 80-100 clients. Reaching the estimated 163,000 homeless individuals with SMI would require approximately 1,600-2,000 teams nationally, at a cost of $1-1.6 billion annually. Cost offsets from reduced hospitalization and incarceration typically exceed 50% of program costs within 2 years.

**Timeline**: 3-5 years for significant expansion; 7-10 years for near-universal access.

**Challenges**: Psychiatrist shortages limit team formation; Medicaid reimbursement for ACT varies by state; rural areas face particular staffing barriers.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of ACT teams operational; caseload per team; housing stability of ACT clients; hospitalization and incarceration rates among ACT-served population.

### Solution 4: Universal Discharge Planning Requirements

**Description**: Require all psychiatric hospitals, general hospital psychiatric units, jails, prisons, and emergency departments to develop and execute written discharge plans that include confirmed housing placement and linkage to ongoing mental health services before releasing any individual with a diagnosed mental illness. No person should be discharged to the street, a shelter, or "whereabouts unknown." Federal funding (Medicaid, Medicare, VA, Bureau of Justice Assistance) would be conditioned on compliance.

**Evidence Base**: Studies consistently show that institutional discharge is a primary pathway into homelessness for people with mental illness. A 2019 California study found that 15% of people discharged from psychiatric hospitals became homeless within 30 days (RAND Corporation, 2019). The VA's transition care management program reduced 30-day readmissions among veterans by 23% through structured discharge planning (VA, 2022). The Frequent Users Systems Engagement (FUSE) model, developed by the Corporation for Supportive Housing, targets people cycling between homelessness, hospitals, and jails, achieving 86% housing retention (CSH, 2020).

**Implementation**:
1. CMS issues a Condition of Participation requiring psychiatric and medical facilities to confirm post-discharge housing for patients with SMI
2. Bureau of Justice Assistance makes discharge planning a condition for federal jail/prison grants
3. States require 72-hour minimum discharge planning period for involuntary psychiatric holds
4. CoCs are required to maintain "discharge prevention" slots in rapid re-housing and PSH programs

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal additional federal cost -- primarily regulatory. States may need $200-500 million collectively for discharge planning coordinators and transitional housing slots. Substantial cost offsets from reduced readmissions and recidivism.

**Timeline**: Regulatory implementation within 1-2 years; full compliance within 3-5 years.

**Challenges**: Hospital resistance to discharge delays that reduce bed turnover; jail overcrowding creates pressure for rapid release; housing unavailability may make discharge planning impossible without concurrent housing expansion.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of patients discharged with confirmed housing; 30-day readmission rates; homelessness rates within 90 days of discharge; jail recidivism among people with SMI.

### Solution 5: Behavioral Health Workforce Development Initiative

**Description**: Address the nationwide shortage of approximately 8,000 psychiatrists and 30,000 mental health professionals (HRSA, 2023) through a comprehensive workforce strategy targeting homeless services specifically. Key components include loan repayment programs for mental health professionals who work in homeless services, expansion of peer support specialist certification, competitive salary supplements for outreach workers, and training pipelines for integrated care in supportive housing settings.

**Evidence Base**: The National Health Service Corps loan repayment program has demonstrated effectiveness in placing health care providers in underserved areas, with 82% retention after the service obligation ends (HRSA, 2022). Peer support specialists -- people with lived experience of mental illness and/or homelessness -- have been shown to improve engagement, reduce hospitalizations, and enhance housing retention in multiple studies (Chinman et al., *Psychiatric Services*, 2014).

**Implementation**:
1. Congress expands NHSC loan repayment to include homeless services positions (psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counselors)
2. SAMHSA funds state peer specialist certification and training programs
3. HHS establishes a Homeless Services Workforce Grant program providing salary supplements of $10,000-$15,000 annually for frontline workers
4. Graduate medical education (GME) slots are expanded for psychiatry residencies, with rotations in homeless health care settings

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $2-3 billion annually for loan repayment, salary supplements, training, and GME expansion. Partially offset by improved service delivery and reduced turnover costs (estimated at $20,000-$30,000 per frontline worker replaced).

**Timeline**: 2-3 years for loan repayment and salary supplement programs; 5-7 years for expanded GME pipeline to produce additional psychiatrists.

**Challenges**: Competition with private sector for psychiatrists; geographic maldistribution of mental health professionals; stigma associated with homeless services work.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of mental health professionals in homeless services; vacancy rates; turnover rates (target: below 20% from current 30%+); caseload sizes; client satisfaction.

### Solution 6: Medicaid "Housing-Related Services" State Plan Amendment

**Description**: Create a standardized Medicaid state plan option that allows all states to reimburse housing-related services -- including tenancy support, housing search and navigation, move-in assistance, and landlord engagement -- for Medicaid-enrolled individuals with serious mental illness who are homeless or at risk. Several states (including California, Washington, and New York) have already implemented limited versions, but a national standard would ensure consistent coverage.

**Evidence Base**: California's Medi-Cal "Community Supports" waiver (CalAIM) began covering housing navigation, tenancy support, and housing deposits in 2022, reaching approximately 40,000 individuals in its first year (DHCS, 2023). Oregon's Medicaid housing services reduced homelessness among participants by 31% over 12 months (Oregon Health Authority, 2021). CMS has signaled support for housing-related services through Section 1115 waivers and the 2023 Medicaid and CHIP final access rule.

**Implementation**:
1. CMS issues a State Plan Amendment template for housing-related services
2. States adopt the template and train Medicaid managed care organizations on billing
3. CCBHCs and Health Care for the Homeless centers serve as primary providers
4. Performance metrics tied to housing placement and retention

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $2-4 billion in additional Medicaid spending annually at full national implementation. Federal share approximately 60-70% depending on state match rates. Partially offset by reduced emergency utilization.

**Timeline**: 1-2 years for CMS guidance and state adoption; 3-5 years for nationwide implementation.

**Challenges**: State resistance to Medicaid expansion; managed care organization readiness; distinguishing housing-related health services from housing subsidies (which Medicaid cannot fund).

**Impact Metrics**: Number of states adopting housing-related services; individuals served; housing placement rates; Medicaid cost per member per month trends.

### Solution 7: Crisis Response System Redesign

**Description**: Replace the current default of law enforcement as first responder to mental health crises among homeless populations with a comprehensive crisis response system consisting of three elements: 988 crisis call centers, mobile crisis teams (not led by police), and crisis stabilization centers (as alternatives to emergency rooms and jails). This aligns with the SAMHSA Crisis Now model and builds on the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline infrastructure.

**Evidence Base**: The CAHOOTS program in Eugene, Oregon -- which dispatches mental health workers and medics instead of police to behavioral health calls -- has operated since 1989, handling approximately 24,000 calls annually with a less-than-1% rate requiring police backup (White Bird Clinic, 2023). The program saves an estimated $8.5 million annually in avoided law enforcement costs. Denver's Support Team Assisted Response (STAR) pilot showed similar results. Crisis stabilization units reduce psychiatric emergency room visits by 50-70% in communities that implement them (SAMHSA, 2023).

**Implementation**:
1. Full funding of 988 infrastructure including call centers, mobile crisis teams, and crisis stabilization centers
2. Medicaid covers mobile crisis services as a mandatory benefit (CMS proposed this in 2023)
3. States establish crisis receiving centers with psychiatric evaluation capacity and short-term stabilization beds
4. Crisis teams are trained in homeless-specific engagement, trauma-informed care, and harm reduction

**Cost/Resources**: $3-5 billion annually for full national crisis system buildout. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022) and the 988 Implementation Act provided initial funding, but sustained annual appropriations are needed.

**Timeline**: 2-4 years for initial deployment in all major metropolitan areas; 5-7 years for rural and suburban coverage.

**Challenges**: 988 staffing shortages (answer rate was approximately 70% in early implementation); integration with existing 911 systems; resistance from police unions to losing dispatch authority.

**Impact Metrics**: 988 answer rate (target: 95%+); mobile crisis response time; percentage of behavioral health calls diverted from police; psychiatric ER utilization; involuntary holds.

## International Models

### Finland: National Housing First Strategy

**Description**: Finland adopted a national Housing First policy in 2008, converting existing shelters and institutional settings into independent apartments with support services. The government committed to eliminating long-term homelessness through the "Paavo" programs (2008-2015 and 2016-2019), investing in new supportive housing construction and converting hostels to independent units.

**Results**: Finland is the only European Union country where homelessness has declined consistently over the past decade. Long-term homelessness fell by more than 40% between 2008 and 2020 (ARA, 2021). The Y-Foundation, Finland's largest Housing First provider, achieved housing retention rates above 80%. Annual cost per Housing First participant averaged approximately EUR 15,000, compared to EUR 44,000 for emergency service cycling (Y-Foundation, 2019).

**Applicability to U.S.**: Finland's success demonstrates that Housing First can work as a national strategy, not just individual programs. Key differences include Finland's universal health care system, smaller population, and greater political consensus on housing as a right. The U.S. would need to adapt the model to its fragmented federal system, larger scale, and market-based housing economy. The HUD-VASH model for veterans provides a domestic parallel.

### Australia: Doorway Program

**Description**: Australia's Doorway program (formerly "Journey to Social Inclusion") provides intensive, long-term support (3 years) to chronically homeless individuals, combining housing with employment assistance, social inclusion activities, health care coordination, and life skills development.

**Results**: A randomized controlled trial found that 85% of Doorway participants were housed at 36 months, compared to 41% of controls. Participants showed significant improvements in mental health, social connectedness, and employment (Sacred Heart Mission, 2021).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Doorway model's emphasis on long-term support (3 years) exceeds most U.S. programs. The model could be adapted for the most chronically homeless individuals with SMI who need extended engagement beyond what standard PSH provides.

### Canada: At Home/Chez Soi

**Description**: Canada's At Home/Chez Soi was the largest randomized controlled trial of Housing First ever conducted, enrolling 2,148 participants across five cities (Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, and Moncton) between 2009 and 2013. Participants with high needs received ACT, while those with moderate needs received intensive case management.

**Results**: Housing First participants spent 73% of their time stably housed over 2 years, compared to 32% for controls. The high-needs group showed the greatest cost offsets, with every $10 invested in Housing First producing $9.60 in savings from reduced shelter, health care, and justice system costs (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2014).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The At Home/Chez Soi trial provides the strongest international evidence for Housing First effectiveness at scale. Its multi-site design across cities of varying size makes the results broadly applicable. The trial's finding that cost offsets are greatest for the highest-need population reinforces the U.S. focus on chronic homelessness.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

### Houston: Reduction of Homelessness by 63% (2011-2023)

Houston reduced total homelessness from approximately 8,500 in 2011 to approximately 3,100 in 2023 -- a 63% decline -- through a coordinated system that combined Housing First principles with intensive outreach, landlord engagement, and a unified data system. The Coalition for the Homeless led a community-wide "system redesign" that emphasized permanent housing placements over shelter expansion. Houston housed more than 25,000 people during this period (Coalition for the Homeless of Houston/Harris County, 2023).

### HUD-VASH: Veteran Homelessness Reduction of 55.3%

The HUD-VASH program demonstrates that the Housing First + intensive services model can work at national scale. Since 2008, approximately 110,000 vouchers have been allocated, and veteran homelessness has declined 55.3% from its 2010 peak. More than 80 communities and 3 states have achieved "functional zero" for veteran homelessness through the Built for Zero campaign (Community Solutions, 2023).

### FUSE (Frequent Users Systems Engagement)

The Corporation for Supportive Housing's FUSE model identifies people who cycle most frequently between homelessness, emergency rooms, psychiatric hospitals, and jails, and connects them directly to permanent supportive housing. Evaluations in New York, Connecticut, and California showed 86% housing retention and reductions of 40-60% in emergency service utilization (CSH, 2020).

## Complementary Policies

Addressing mental illness and homelessness effectively requires parallel reforms in adjacent policy areas:

- **Affordable housing expansion**: Increase the supply of affordable housing for extremely low-income renters through expanded Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, Housing Trust Fund appropriations, and zoning reform to permit higher-density development
- **SSI/SSDI reform**: Increase Supplemental Security Income benefits (currently $943/month in 2024) to at least the federal poverty level, and streamline disability determination for people with SMI who are homeless
- **Criminal justice reform**: Expand pretrial diversion programs, mental health courts, and jail-based discharge planning to break the arrest-release-street cycle
- **Substance use treatment**: Ensure access to medication-assisted treatment (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone) for all homeless individuals with opioid use disorder, and expand harm reduction services including supervised consumption sites
