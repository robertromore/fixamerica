# Mental Health Policy: Stakeholders

The mental health system is shaped by the interactions of government agencies, insurance companies, providers, advocacy organizations, patients, and families, each with distinct interests, resources, and power. Understanding these dynamics is essential to designing reforms that can navigate the political landscape.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Adults with any mental illness | Face treatment gaps, insurance barriers, workforce shortages, and stigma | 57.8 million | Affordable, accessible, quality care; insurance coverage; reduced stigma |
| Adults with serious mental illness | Experience homelessness, incarceration, cycling through ERs; highest unmet need | 14.1 million | Housing, treatment access, crisis services, community support, civil rights |
| Children and adolescents with mental health conditions | Rising rates of anxiety, depression, suicidality; limited school-based services | 4.1 million+ with major depressive episode | School-based services, early intervention, social media protections, family support |
| Families and caregivers | Bear substantial emotional, financial, and logistical burden of supporting loved ones | Estimated 11 million family caregivers of adults with SMI | Caregiver support, information access, involvement in treatment decisions, respite care |
| People with mental illness in jails and prisons | Receive inadequate treatment, face longer sentences, higher recidivism | ~380,000 incarcerated with SMI | Diversion programs, in-custody treatment, reentry support |
| People experiencing homelessness with MI | Lack access to housing, treatment, and services | ~120,000 with SMI on any given night | Permanent supportive housing, Assertive Community Treatment, income support |
| Veterans with mental health conditions | PTSD, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, suicide risk | ~1.7 million veterans using VA mental health services annually | VA access, community care network, suicide prevention, disability benefits |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Employers**: Mental health conditions cost employers approximately $105 billion annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and health care costs (NAMI, 2024). They have an interest in effective employee assistance programs and accessible treatment that returns employees to productivity.
- **Schools and educators**: Teachers and school staff are increasingly serving as de facto first responders for student mental health crises, without adequate training, resources, or support staff.
- **Law enforcement and first responders**: Police officers are frequently called to mental health crises and serve as the default crisis response system in communities lacking mobile crisis teams.
- **Emergency department staff**: Psychiatric boarding -- patients waiting days in EDs for inpatient beds -- is a growing burden on emergency medicine, consuming resources and contributing to staff burnout.
- **Taxpayers**: The broader public bears the cost of system failure through taxes supporting jails, emergency rooms, homeless services, and disability programs.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Authorizes and appropriates federal mental health funding; passes parity and other legislation | Legislative authority over SAMHSA, CMS, DOL | Controls all federal appropriations | High |
| HHS / SAMHSA | Administers block grants, 988 Lifeline, evidence-based program guidelines | Regulatory authority over federal MH programs | $9.5 billion total budget (FY2024) | High |
| CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid) | Sets Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement policy; approves state Medicaid waivers | Controls payment policy for largest MH payers | Oversees ~$113 billion in MH/SUD spending | High |
| Department of Labor | Enforces MHPAEA in employer-sponsored plans | Investigative and enforcement authority | Limited staff; fewer than 50 enforcement actions (2010-2023) | Medium |
| State governors and legislatures | Control state mental health budgets, licensure laws, civil commitment statutes, Medicaid expansion | Full state authority | ~$44 billion in combined state MHA spending (FY2022) | High |
| State mental health agencies | Administer state-funded services, operate state hospitals, distribute block grants | Program administration and planning | Varies widely by state | Medium-High |
| State insurance commissioners | Regulate state-regulated health plans; enforce parity in state-regulated market | Regulatory authority over insurers | Varies by state | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: The largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization in the U.S., with affiliates in all 50 states. Advocates for parity enforcement, crisis services funding, and reduced stigma. Particularly strong voice for families.
- **Mental Health America (MHA)**: National advocacy organization focused on prevention, early intervention, and peer support. Publishes the annual State of Mental Health in America report.
- **Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC)**: Focuses on removing barriers to treatment for people with serious mental illness, including advocacy for Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) and reform of the IMD exclusion. Often at odds with civil liberties organizations.
- **National Council for Mental Wellbeing**: Represents community mental health and substance use treatment organizations. Advocates for increased funding, workforce development, and integration of behavioral health.
- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: Professional organization for psychiatrists. Advocates for increased reimbursement, GME funding expansion, parity enforcement, and scope-of-practice protections.
- **American Psychological Association**: Advocates for psychologists' roles in treatment, research funding, and scope-of-practice expansion including prescriptive authority.

### Influencers

- **Insurance industry (AHIP, BCBSA)**: Lobbies against stronger parity enforcement, higher reimbursement mandates, and network adequacy requirements. Exerts influence through campaign contributions and revolving door with regulatory agencies.
- **Pharmaceutical industry (PhRMA)**: Advocates for broad psychotropic medication access but resists price controls and formulary transparency requirements. Invests in direct-to-consumer advertising.
- **Technology companies (Meta, Google, TikTok)**: Lobby against regulation of algorithms and design features linked to youth mental health harms. Significant campaign spending and lobbying budgets.
- **National Sheriffs' Association / law enforcement groups**: Advocate for jail diversion programs and crisis intervention training, but also for involuntary commitment reform that would make it easier to remove people from the streets.
- **ACLU and disability rights organizations**: Advocate for civil liberties protections against involuntary treatment and forced medication, often opposing TAC and law enforcement perspectives.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAMI + APA + National Council | Increased mental health funding and parity enforcement | Strong |
| Families + TAC + law enforcement | Expanded AOT and crisis diversion programs | Moderate |
| Schools + pediatricians + NAMI | Youth mental health screening and school-based services | Strong |
| Rural health advocates + telehealth companies + psychiatric NPs | Telehealth expansion and scope-of-practice reform | Moderate |
| Criminal justice reformers + mental health advocates + housing groups | Jail diversion, permanent supportive housing, community treatment | Moderate |
| Employers + insurers (partially) | Effective, cost-efficient treatment that reduces disability claims | Moderate-Weak |

### Conflicting Interests

- **ACLU / disability rights vs. TAC / families**: The most intense conflict in mental health policy is over involuntary treatment. Civil liberties organizations oppose expansions of Assisted Outpatient Treatment and involuntary commitment, viewing them as violations of individual autonomy. TAC and many family organizations view untreated serious mental illness in the community as a humanitarian crisis that requires stronger intervention tools.
- **Insurers vs. providers and patients**: Insurers benefit from narrow networks and low reimbursement, which reduce costs. Providers and patients need broader networks and competitive reimbursement to ensure access.
- **State governments vs. advocates**: Advocates call for increased state spending on community mental health, while governors and legislators face pressure to limit spending and resist unfunded mandates.
- **Pharmaceutical companies vs. cost-control advocates**: Psychotropic medication costs are rising, and newer drugs (e.g., long-acting injectable antipsychotics) are expensive. Advocates for cost control clash with pharmaceutical industry interests in maintaining pricing flexibility.

### The Mental Health Iron Triangle

A less prominent but real iron triangle exists in mental health policy:

- **Congressional committees** (Appropriations, HELP, Energy and Commerce) control mental health funding and legislation.
- **Federal agencies** (SAMHSA, CMS) administer programs and seek larger budgets.
- **Provider and advocacy organizations** (NAMI, APA, National Council) lobby Congress and agencies for increased funding and favorable policy.

This triangle generally supports incremental funding increases but has not produced the transformative investment needed to close the treatment gap because it is countered by the more powerful insurance industry lobby and by general fiscal conservatism.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on mental health policy:

- **Lobbying**: The health insurance industry spent over $170 million on lobbying in 2023 (OpenSecrets, 2024). Mental health advocacy organizations collectively spent a small fraction of that amount. The pharmaceutical industry is the largest lobbying sector overall, spending over $370 million in 2023.
- **Campaign Contributions**: Health sector political contributions totaled over $300 million in the 2022 election cycle, dominated by pharmaceutical and insurance companies (OpenSecrets, 2024). Mental health-specific PACs and advocacy contributions are modest by comparison.
- **Revolving Door**: Former insurance and pharmaceutical executives frequently move into regulatory positions at CMS, DOL, and state insurance departments, and former regulators move into industry positions.
- **Public Advocacy**: NAMI and MHA conduct effective grassroots campaigns, but their reach is limited compared to industry advertising budgets. The Surgeon General's advisories on youth mental health have been unusually effective at raising public awareness and political salience.
- **Expertise/Information**: Professional organizations (APA, AMA) and research institutions (NIMH, RAND) provide the evidence base that shapes policy debates. SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP) sets standards for what treatments receive federal support.
- **Litigation**: Class-action lawsuits alleging parity violations (e.g., *Wit v. United Behavioral Health*) have produced significant rulings and settlements, but litigation is slow and case-specific.
