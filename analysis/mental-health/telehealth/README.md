# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of telehealth and digital mental health services in the United States, including telepsychiatry, digital therapeutics, mental health applications, and the regulatory frameworks governing remote behavioral healthcare delivery.

## Overview

Mental health telehealth has transformed from a niche service used primarily in rural Veterans Affairs clinics into a mainstream delivery modality serving tens of millions of Americans. The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed a dramatic expansion, with telehealth mental health visits increasing over 3,000% between 2019 and 2020. Federal and state governments responded with emergency flexibilities--waiving geographic restrictions, permitting audio-only visits, and loosening prescribing rules for controlled substances--that demonstrated both the promise and the risks of remote mental health care.

The post-pandemic challenge is threefold. First, policymakers must decide which emergency flexibilities to make permanent without compromising patient safety. Second, the rapid growth of unregulated mental health apps and digital therapeutics has created a consumer protection gap, with over 10,000 mental health apps available but fewer than 30 cleared by the FDA. Third, the digital divide threatens to make telehealth an equity-worsening rather than equity-enhancing force, as the populations most in need of mental health services--rural residents, older adults, people with disabilities, and low-income communities--are least likely to have reliable broadband access or digital literacy.

This analysis examines the regulatory landscape, clinical evidence base, equity implications, and technological infrastructure of mental health telehealth. It explores the tension between expanding access and maintaining quality, the role of interstate licensure compacts, DEA prescribing flexibilities, and the emerging market for FDA-regulated digital therapeutics. It proposes a comprehensive framework to make telehealth a permanent, equitable, and safe component of the behavioral health system.
