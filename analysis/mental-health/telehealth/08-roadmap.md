# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The implementation strategy for permanent mental health telehealth reform follows three parallel tracks that reinforce each other. The first track addresses the annual policy cliff by converting temporary Medicare and DEA flexibilities into permanent law. The second track closes structural access gaps through interstate licensure expansion and broadband infrastructure. The third track modernizes the regulatory environment for digital mental health tools. Each phase builds on the previous one: Phase 1 stabilizes the existing system and eliminates uncertainty; Phase 2 expands access and establishes new regulatory frameworks; Phase 3 achieves full integration of telehealth into the behavioral health system as a permanent, equitable delivery modality.

The sequencing reflects political reality. The actions with the strongest bipartisan support and the most immediate patient impact come first. More structurally ambitious reforms--FDA regulatory frameworks, universal broadband, and comprehensive digital health privacy--follow once the foundational legislative and regulatory changes are in place.

## Governance and Oversight

**Interagency Telehealth Mental Health Task Force**: Establish a standing interagency task force co-chaired by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the CMS Administrator, with representatives from the DEA, FDA, FCC, HRSA, SAMHSA, and VA. The task force would: coordinate policy across agencies; monitor implementation of the roadmap; publish annual progress reports to Congress; and convene stakeholder advisory committees including providers, patients, technology companies, and state regulators.

**Congressional Reporting**: Require the HHS Secretary to submit a biennial report to the Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee on the status of mental health telehealth implementation, including utilization data, access metrics, quality outcomes, and remaining barriers.

**Independent Evaluation**: Fund AHRQ to conduct an independent evaluation of the telehealth permanence legislation at years 3, 5, and 10, including impacts on access, quality, cost, equity, and workforce.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: CBO Scoring Blocks Permanent Legislation

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build the evidence base for cost offsets (reduced ED visits, hospitalizations, disability claims) and work with CBO to refine scoring methodology. Consider phased permanence (permanent for behavioral health first, then expanded) to reduce the score.

**Contingency Plan**: If full permanence fails, pursue a 5-year reauthorization with automatic renewal unless Congress acts to terminate, reversing the current default from "expires unless renewed" to "continues unless terminated."

### Risk 2: High-Profile Diversion Case Undermines Political Support

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build robust PDMP integration and monitoring requirements into the permanent framework before any incident occurs. Preemptively communicate that targeted enforcement against bad actors is the appropriate response, not blanket restrictions.

**Contingency Plan**: If a major diversion case occurs, mobilize patient advocacy organizations to testify about the access consequences of restricting telehealth prescribing. Propose enhanced monitoring measures as an alternative to in-person requirements.

### Risk 3: Broadband Deployment Delays Limit Telehealth Equity

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Maintain permanent audio-only coverage as a fallback for populations without broadband. Prioritize BEAD deployment in Mental Health HPSAs. Fund device access programs as a bridge.

**Contingency Plan**: If broadband deployment is significantly delayed, invest in satellite-based internet solutions (e.g., Starlink) for rural mental health clinics and expand the FCC Connected Care Program to subsidize these solutions.

### Risk 4: FDA Regulatory Framework Stifles Digital Therapeutics Innovation

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design the tiered regulatory framework so that truly low-risk products face minimal burden. Use pre-certification and real-world evidence pathways to reduce time-to-market. Engage industry in framework design.

**Contingency Plan**: If FDA timelines remain too long, establish a provisional coverage pathway that allows CMS to cover promising digital therapeutics on a conditional basis, contingent on post-market evidence generation.

### Risk 5: State Resistance to Interstate Compact Participation

**Likelihood**: Low-Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Federal incentive grants reduce the financial barrier. Conditioning a portion of mental health block grant funding on compact participation creates stronger motivation. PSYPACT's rapid expansion from 18 to 42 states demonstrates that momentum builds with adoption.

**Contingency Plan**: If holdout states persist, explore federal legislation establishing a telehealth-specific practice privilege that preempts state licensure for interstate telehealth, while preserving state authority for in-person practice.
