# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: Solutions

Addressing the structural barriers to mental health telehealth requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to make telehealth a permanent, equitable, and safe component of the behavioral health system. This means converting temporary emergency flexibilities into permanent law, closing the regulatory gap for digital mental health tools, building the broadband and digital literacy infrastructure that underserved populations need, and creating a reimbursement framework that sustains innovation without enabling fraud.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Evidence-based permanence: Federal telehealth policy should be grounded in clinical evidence, not annual political bargaining. Where the evidence supports telehealth equivalence to in-person care, coverage should be permanent.
- Equity-first design: Every telehealth expansion must be evaluated for its impact on the digital divide. Policies that expand access only for populations that already have broadband and digital literacy will worsen, not reduce, mental health disparities.
- Tiered regulation proportional to risk: The regulatory burden for mental health technologies should be proportional to the clinical claims being made and the risk to patients. Consumer wellness apps, clinical decision support tools, and prescription digital therapeutics each require different levels of oversight.
- Safeguards through monitoring, not barriers: Where possible, replace gatekeeping requirements (such as mandatory in-person visits before prescribing) with robust post-access monitoring systems (such as mandatory PDMP checks and outcome reporting).

### Theory of Change

The current telehealth policy environment is dominated by annual uncertainty, fragmented state regulation, and a regulatory vacuum for digital tools. The pathway to reform runs through three parallel tracks: (1) permanent federal legislation that removes Medicare restrictions and establishes payment parity; (2) accelerated interstate licensure compact adoption that eliminates geographic barriers to practice; and (3) a modernized regulatory framework from the FDA, DEA, and FTC that addresses the digital mental health marketplace. These tracks reinforce each other--providers will invest in telehealth infrastructure only when coverage is permanent, patients will benefit from interstate compacts only when broadband access is universal, and digital therapeutics will reach patients only when reimbursement pathways exist.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Permanent Medicare Telehealth Coverage for Behavioral Health

**Description**: Enact federal legislation permanently removing the geographic and originating-site restrictions on Medicare telehealth for behavioral health services. This would codify the flexibilities currently extended on an annual basis, allowing Medicare beneficiaries to receive mental health services via telehealth from their homes regardless of location. The legislation would include permanent coverage of audio-only visits for mental health, with clinical appropriateness guidelines to ensure audio-only is used for established patients, follow-up care, and crisis services, while initial diagnostic evaluations and complex medication management require video or in-person modalities.

**Evidence Base**: MedPAC data shows that Medicare telehealth utilization for behavioral health rose from 0.1% of visits pre-pandemic to over 20% post-pandemic, with no measurable decline in clinical quality (MedPAC, 2024). A 2023 Health Affairs study found that telehealth-facilitated behavioral health visits reduced no-show rates by 38% and increased treatment retention by 22% (Mehrotra et al., Health Affairs, 2023). The CONNECT for Health Act and Telehealth Modernization Act, both introduced in the 118th Congress, propose permanent telehealth expansion with bipartisan support.

**Implementation**: Amend Section 1834(m) of the Social Security Act to remove geographic restrictions and add the patient's home as a permanent originating site. Direct CMS to establish audio-only clinical appropriateness criteria within 180 days of enactment.

**Cost/Resources**: CBO has estimated the cost of permanent Medicare telehealth behavioral health extension at $2-4 billion per year over 10 years, partially offset by reduced emergency department utilization and hospitalization among newly-treated populations.

**Timeline**: Legislative passage within 12 months; CMS rulemaking within 18 months; full implementation within 24 months.

**Challenges**: CBO scoring concerns about increased Medicare spending; opposition from MedPAC regarding audio-only coverage; legislative bandwidth given competing healthcare priorities.

**Impact Metrics**: Medicare telehealth behavioral health utilization rate; no-show rate for mental health appointments; time-to-first-appointment for new patients; emergency department visits for psychiatric crises among Medicare beneficiaries.

### Solution 2: National Interstate Licensure Framework for Mental Health Professionals

**Description**: Accelerate adoption of interstate licensure compacts for all mental health professions by providing federal incentive funding to states that join PSYPACT, the Counseling Compact, and the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, and by directing HHS to develop a model Social Work Licensure Compact. For professions without a functioning compact, establish a federal "practice privilege" that allows any mental health professional licensed in good standing in one state to practice telehealth in any other state, subject to reciprocal discipline provisions and a national disciplinary database.

**Evidence Base**: PSYPACT grew from 18 states in 2020 to 42 states plus DC by 2024, demonstrating that interstate compacts can achieve rapid adoption when states see the benefit (PSYPACT Commission, 2024). The Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC) for registered nurses, which covers 41 states, has operated successfully since 2000 and provides a proven model for professional mobility across state lines.

**Implementation**: Appropriate federal grants of $5 million per state for states that join all available mental health licensure compacts within 3 years. Condition a portion of federal mental health block grant funding on compact participation by year 5.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $250 million over 5 years in federal incentive grants; minimal ongoing cost once compacts are operational.

**Timeline**: Incentive legislation within 12 months; universal compact participation target within 5 years.

**Challenges**: Opposition from holdout states that view licensure as a state sovereignty issue; resistance from some state licensing boards that derive revenue and authority from independent licensure.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of states participating in each compact; number of mental health professionals practicing across state lines; patient wait times for appointments in previously underserved states.

### Solution 3: Permanent DEA Telehealth Prescribing Framework

**Description**: Enact federal legislation establishing a permanent DEA telehealth prescribing framework that replaces the cycle of temporary Ryan Haight Act waivers. The framework should: (1) permanently authorize prescribing of Schedule III-V controlled substances via telehealth without an in-person visit requirement; (2) permit initial prescribing of Schedule II substances via telehealth with a mandatory follow-up evaluation (video or in-person) within 6 months; (3) maintain the permanent buprenorphine telehealth prescribing authority already codified in 2023; and (4) require mandatory PDMP checks for all telehealth controlled substance prescriptions.

**Evidence Base**: A 2024 JAMA Psychiatry study found no statistically significant difference in the rate of inappropriate prescribing between telehealth and in-person psychiatry visits when controlling for provider type and practice setting (Marcus et al., JAMA Psychiatry, 2024). The permanent buprenorphine telehealth prescribing framework enacted in 2023 has operated without significant reported increases in diversion (SAMHSA, 2024). States that adopted PDMP integration requirements saw a 24% reduction in inappropriate prescribing of controlled substances (Brandeis PDMP Center of Excellence, 2023).

**Implementation**: Amend 21 U.S.C. 829(e) to establish a permanent telehealth prescribing category. Direct the DEA to finalize Telemedicine Special Registration rules within 12 months. Require integration of telehealth prescribing data with state PDMPs.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal federal cost; DEA would need approximately $15 million in additional funding for PDMP integration and monitoring systems.

**Timeline**: Legislation within 12 months; DEA rulemaking within 18 months; full enforcement within 24 months.

**Challenges**: DEA institutional resistance; political risk if a high-profile diversion case occurs after framework enactment; pharmacist liability concerns for filling telehealth prescriptions.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of Schedule II prescriptions written via telehealth; PDMP check compliance rate; suspicious prescribing activity rate; patient access metrics for ADHD medication and psychiatric medications.

### Solution 4: FDA Digital Mental Health Regulatory Framework

**Description**: Direct the FDA to establish a tiered regulatory framework for digital mental health products that provides clear pathways for three categories: (1) general wellness apps (no FDA review, but mandatory registration and minimum privacy standards enforced by the FTC); (2) clinical decision support tools and low-risk digital health tools (streamlined review through the Digital Health Software Precertification Program); and (3) prescription digital therapeutics making specific therapeutic claims (full FDA De Novo or 510(k) review with expedited timelines). Establish a Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement pathway for FDA-cleared digital therapeutics through new CPT codes and CMS coverage determinations.

**Evidence Base**: The FDA's Digital Health Center of Excellence has processed over 200 submissions since its founding in 2020, but the existing regulatory pathway is too slow for the pace of software development and too unclear for investors (FDA, 2024). The Pear Therapeutics bankruptcy demonstrated that FDA clearance alone is insufficient without a reimbursement pathway (Pear Therapeutics SEC filing, 2023). The UK's NICE Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies provides a model for tiered regulation based on risk level (NICE, 2023).

**Implementation**: FDA guidance document within 12 months; new CPT codes from the AMA within 18 months; CMS coverage determination for FDA-cleared PDTs within 24 months.

**Cost/Resources**: $50 million over 5 years for FDA Digital Health Center staffing expansion; minimal additional CMS cost if coverage is limited to FDA-cleared products with demonstrated clinical outcomes.

**Timeline**: Legislation authorizing the framework within 12 months; FDA guidance within 18 months; first CMS coverage decisions for digital therapeutics within 36 months.

**Challenges**: Balancing innovation speed with regulatory rigor; defining the boundary between "wellness" and "therapeutic" claims; establishing appropriate clinical trial standards for software that iterates rapidly.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of digital therapeutics achieving FDA clearance; time from submission to clearance decision; number of FDA-cleared products with CMS coverage; patient utilization of covered digital therapeutics.

### Solution 5: Broadband and Digital Equity Investment for Telehealth

**Description**: Accelerate deployment of the $65 billion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law broadband funding with explicit prioritization for Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas. Establish a new HHS Digital Health Equity Grant Program ($500 million over 5 years) that provides direct funding to community mental health centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and tribal health organizations for: device procurement programs (tablets and smartphones for patients), digital literacy training for patients and providers, and technical assistance for telehealth platform implementation. Expand the FCC's Universal Service Fund Connected Care Pilot Program to a permanent $200 million annual program targeting mental health providers.

**Evidence Base**: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's $42.45 billion BEAD Program is deploying broadband infrastructure but will not reach full coverage until 2028-2030 (NTIA, 2024). The FCC's Connected Care Pilot Program demonstrated that subsidized broadband connections for healthcare providers increased telehealth utilization by 40% in participating rural clinics (FCC, 2023). A California pilot program that provided tablets and digital literacy training to Medicaid enrollees increased telehealth mental health visit completion by 35% (California Department of Health Care Services, 2023).

**Implementation**: Issue HHS Digital Health Equity Grant Program funding opportunity within 12 months; deploy first-year grants within 18 months; expand FCC Connected Care to permanent program within 24 months.

**Cost/Resources**: $500 million over 5 years for HHS Digital Health Equity Grants; $200 million annually for expanded FCC Connected Care; coordination with existing BEAD broadband deployment.

**Timeline**: Grant program established within 12 months; first grants distributed within 18 months; full broadband coverage target by 2030.

**Challenges**: Broadband deployment timelines extend beyond legislative cycles; device procurement must include ongoing support and replacement; digital literacy training requires sustained funding, not one-time investments.

**Impact Metrics**: Broadband coverage in Mental Health HPSAs; device access among Medicaid mental health enrollees; telehealth utilization rates in targeted communities; telehealth access disparity between urban and rural populations.

### Solution 6: Mental Health App Consumer Protection Standards

**Description**: Enact federal legislation requiring all consumer-facing digital applications that claim to address mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance use, etc.) to: (1) register with the FTC as mental health applications; (2) comply with minimum privacy standards equivalent to HIPAA for the collection, storage, and sharing of mental health data; (3) disclose whether the app has any clinical evidence supporting its effectiveness; (4) provide clear labeling distinguishing between consumer wellness tools, evidence-informed tools, and FDA-cleared medical devices. Establish an FTC enforcement office specifically for digital health consumer protection.

**Evidence Base**: The APA App Advisor review found that fewer than 5% of popular mental health apps had published peer-reviewed evidence, and 64% did not have a privacy policy meeting minimum standards (APA App Advisor, 2023). The Mozilla Foundation study rated 32 of 37 popular mental health apps as failing minimum privacy standards (Mozilla, 2023). The FTC's $7.8 million settlement with BetterHelp for sharing therapy data with advertisers demonstrated the scale of the privacy problem (FTC, 2023).

**Implementation**: Federal legislation within 18 months; FTC rulemaking on mental health app privacy within 24 months; app registration deadline within 36 months.

**Cost/Resources**: $30 million annually for FTC enforcement staffing; minimal cost to app developers for registration and disclosure.

**Timeline**: Legislation within 18 months; FTC rules within 24 months; enforcement begins within 36 months.

**Challenges**: Defining "mental health application" in a way that is broad enough to capture problematic products but narrow enough to avoid regulating general fitness or meditation apps; First Amendment considerations for apps that provide information rather than treatment.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of mental health apps registered with the FTC; percentage of apps with clinical evidence disclosures; FTC enforcement actions against non-compliant apps; consumer complaints regarding mental health app data practices.

### Solution 7: Telehealth Workforce Development Program

**Description**: Establish a federal Telehealth Workforce Development Program within HRSA that: (1) requires accredited psychiatry residency, psychology doctoral, social work, and counseling programs to include telehealth competency training as a condition of accreditation; (2) provides loan repayment incentives for mental health professionals who practice at least 50% via telehealth in underserved areas; (3) funds continuing education programs for existing practitioners on telehealth best practices, cultural competency in remote care, and technology utilization.

**Evidence Base**: Only 45% of psychiatrists reported receiving any formal training in telehealth best practices during residency or continuing education (APA, 2024). HRSA's National Health Service Corps loan repayment program has proven effective in recruiting providers to underserved areas, with a 75% retention rate after the service obligation ends (HRSA, 2024). The VA's telehealth training programs have demonstrated that structured training improves provider satisfaction and patient outcomes in telehealth delivery (VA Office of Telehealth Services, 2023).

**Implementation**: Accreditation requirement within 3 years (allowing time for curriculum development); loan repayment program launch within 18 months; continuing education grants within 12 months.

**Cost/Resources**: $100 million annually for loan repayment incentives (approximately 2,000 providers per year at $50,000 each); $25 million annually for continuing education grants; minimal cost for accreditation requirement.

**Timeline**: Program established within 12 months; first loan repayment cohort within 18 months; accreditation requirements within 36 months.

**Challenges**: Resistance from accreditation bodies to new mandated competencies; funding competition with other HRSA workforce programs; defining "telehealth competency" in a rapidly evolving field.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of training programs including telehealth competency; number of providers receiving loan repayment for telehealth practice; patient satisfaction scores for telehealth visits by trained versus untrained providers.

## International Models

### United Kingdom: NHS Talking Therapies Digital Program

**Description**: The UK's National Health Service integrates digital mental health tools into its Talking Therapies program (formerly IAPT), which treats over 1.2 million patients annually for depression and anxiety. The program uses a stepped-care model in which patients begin with low-intensity digital interventions (guided self-help via apps and online CBT programs) and step up to therapist-delivered video or in-person treatment if they do not respond. NICE evaluates and recommends specific digital tools for NHS use through its Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies.

**Results**: The NHS Talking Therapies program achieved a 50% recovery rate for depression and anxiety in 2023, with digital-first pathways showing comparable outcomes to therapist-first pathways for mild-to-moderate conditions (NHS England, 2024). Wait times for initial assessment decreased from 28 days to 14 days after digital pathway introduction.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The stepped-care model offers a framework for integrating digital therapeutics into the U.S. behavioral health system, particularly for Medicaid populations. The NICE evaluation framework could inform FDA and CMS decisions about which digital tools merit coverage.

### Australia: Better Access Telehealth Program

**Description**: Australia permanently extended Medicare-funded telehealth for mental health services in 2022 following the pandemic, covering video and telephone consultations with psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals. The program includes a digital mental health gateway that helps patients find appropriate services and includes validated screening tools.

**Results**: Telehealth accounted for 30% of all mental health Medicare services in 2023, with rural utilization rates 40% higher than urban rates, indicating successful targeting of underserved populations (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2024). Patient satisfaction exceeded 85%.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Australia's permanent telehealth legislation demonstrates that a developed country can make telehealth mental health coverage permanent without uncontrolled cost growth. The rural targeting approach is directly relevant to U.S. HPSA populations.

### Canada: Virtual Care Integration in Provincial Health Systems

**Description**: Several Canadian provinces (Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta) have integrated virtual care into their publicly-funded mental health systems, with standardized platforms, provider training requirements, and outcome measurement. Ontario's Ontario Health Teams use virtual care as a primary delivery modality for community mental health services.

**Results**: Ontario reported a 25% increase in mental health service utilization after virtual care integration, with the increase concentrated among populations that had previously underutilized services (Ontario Ministry of Health, 2023). No-show rates decreased by 30%.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Canada's provincial integration models provide lessons for state Medicaid agencies considering telehealth expansion. The standardized platform approach reduces fragmentation.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **VA Telemental Health Program**: The VA's telemental health program conducted over 5 million telehealth mental health encounters in FY2023, covering psychotherapy, psychiatry, and substance use disorder treatment. Outcome studies show equivalent effectiveness to in-person care for PTSD, depression, and substance use disorders (VA Office of Telehealth Services, 2024).
- **California Medi-Cal Digital Bridge Program**: California's Medicaid program provides tablets, broadband subsidies, and digital literacy training to Medicaid enrollees in underserved communities, resulting in a 35% increase in telehealth mental health visit completion rates (California DHCS, 2023).
- **Colorado Psychiatric Access and Consultation Line**: Colorado's statewide consultation line connects primary care providers with psychiatrists via telephone and video for real-time consultation on medication management, demonstrating the "hub-and-spoke" telehealth model for psychiatric consultation (Colorado BHA, 2024).
- **Project ECHO Behavioral Health**: The University of New Mexico's Project ECHO model uses telehealth to connect community-based mental health providers with specialist teams, providing mentoring and case consultation that extends specialist expertise to underserved areas. The model operates in 44 states (ECHO Institute, 2024).

## Complementary Policies

- **Broadband infrastructure investment**: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's $65 billion broadband program is essential infrastructure for telehealth expansion. Coordination between NTIA broadband deployment and HHS telehealth priorities is needed.
- **Mental health workforce expansion**: Telehealth extends the reach of existing providers but does not create new ones. Complementary investments in mental health workforce training, Graduate Medical Education (GME) slots for psychiatry, and scope-of-practice reforms for nurse practitioners and psychologists are necessary.
- **Health data privacy legislation**: Comprehensive federal health data privacy legislation that extends HIPAA-like protections to all entities collecting health data (not just covered entities) is needed to address the privacy gap for mental health apps and platforms.
- **Parity enforcement**: Strengthened enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act ensures that telehealth expansion occurs within a system that covers mental health services on par with physical health services.
