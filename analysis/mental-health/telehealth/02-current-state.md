# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: Current State

## Telehealth Utilization

Mental health is the dominant clinical use case for telehealth in the United States. While telehealth utilization across all medical specialties has stabilized well below pandemic peaks, behavioral health has retained the highest sustained adoption rate of any clinical category.

### Telehealth Utilization by Clinical Category (2024)

| Category | Telehealth Share of Visits | Change from Pre-Pandemic | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Behavioral health (all) | 36% of outpatient visits | +3,400% from 2019 baseline (~1%) | McKinsey, 2024 |
| Psychiatry | 50% of outpatient visits | +4,900% from 2019 baseline | APA Practice Survey, 2024 |
| Substance use disorder treatment | 30% of outpatient visits | +2,800% from 2019 baseline | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| Primary care | 10% of outpatient visits | +900% from 2019 baseline | McKinsey, 2024 |
| All specialties (weighted average) | 17% of outpatient visits | +1,600% from 2019 baseline | FAIR Health, 2024 |

### Telehealth Modality Breakdown for Behavioral Health (2024)

## Regulatory Framework

### Federal Telehealth Flexibilities (Status as of January 2025)

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a cascade of federal regulatory changes. Most remain temporary.

| Flexibility | Authority | Current Status | Expiration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Medicare geographic restriction waiver (patient can be at home) | CMS via 1135 waiver, extended by Congress | Active (temporary) | December 31, 2025 |
| Medicare originating site restriction waiver | CMS via 1135 waiver, extended by Congress | Active (temporary) | December 31, 2025 |
| Audio-only allowed for mental health (Medicare) | CMS regulation | Active (temporary) | December 31, 2025 |
| Federally Qualified Health Center / Rural Health Clinic as distant site | Congressional extension | Active (temporary) | December 31, 2025 |
| Ryan Haight Act in-person requirement waiver | DEA temporary rule | Active (temporary) | December 31, 2025 |
| HIPAA enforcement discretion for telehealth platforms | HHS OCR | Expired (returned to standard enforcement) | May 2023 |
| Prescribing buprenorphine without in-person visit | DEA + SAMHSA | Permanent (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023) | N/A (permanent) |
| Medicare payment parity for telehealth | Congressional action | Active (temporary) | December 31, 2025 |

*Source: Congressional Research Service, "Telehealth and Medicare," R46239, updated 2024; DEA Temporary Rule 88 FR 12875, 2023*

### Ryan Haight Act and DEA Prescribing Rules

The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 (21 U.S.C. 829(e)) requires a practitioner to conduct at least one in-person medical evaluation before prescribing a controlled substance via the internet. The DEA waived this requirement during the COVID-19 public health emergency and has since issued a series of temporary extensions.

**DEA Proposed Permanent Rule (2024)**:

| Element | Proposed Requirement | Stakeholder Reaction |
|---|---|---|
| Schedule III-V substances (e.g., benzodiazepines, sleep aids) | May prescribe via telehealth without in-person visit for initial 6-month supply; re-evaluation required annually | Generally supported |
| Schedule II substances (e.g., stimulants for ADHD) | Requires at least one in-person visit within 6 months of initial telehealth prescription | Opposed by telehealth providers; supported by DEA, some medical groups |
| Buprenorphine for opioid use disorder | No in-person requirement (codified permanently in 2023) | Broadly supported |
| Telemedicine Special Registration | New DEA registration category for telehealth-only prescribers | Mixed; concerns about administrative burden |

## Recent Trends

- **Telehealth-first startup scrutiny (2022-2024)**: Companies like Cerebral and Done faced DEA investigations and DOJ subpoenas over allegations of overprescribing stimulants via telehealth-only evaluations. Cerebral stopped prescribing most controlled substances in 2022 after a DOJ investigation. These cases intensified the debate over telehealth prescribing safeguards (DOJ, 2023).
- **Pear Therapeutics bankruptcy (April 2023)**: The leading prescription digital therapeutics company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, raising questions about the commercial viability of FDA-cleared digital therapeutics for mental health when payer reimbursement is inconsistent (Pear Therapeutics SEC filing, 2023).
- **Audio-only permanence debate (2023-2024)**: CMS and Congress have debated whether to permanently cover audio-only telehealth for mental health. MedPAC expressed concern that audio-only visits may not provide equivalent quality, while patient advocates argue they are essential for populations without broadband (MedPAC, March 2024 report).
- **PSYPACT rapid expansion (2021-2024)**: PSYPACT grew from 18 states in 2020 to 42 states plus DC by 2024, becoming the fastest-growing professional licensure compact in U.S. history (PSYPACT Commission, 2024).
- **AI mental health tools emergence (2023-2024)**: Generative AI chatbots marketed for mental health support proliferated, prompting FDA to issue guidance clarifying that AI-based tools making therapeutic claims would require regulatory review (FDA Draft Guidance on Clinical Decision Support, 2023).

## Emerging Challenges

- **Controlled substance diversion via telehealth**: The DEA reported a 30% increase in suspicious online prescribing activity for Schedule II stimulants between 2020 and 2023 (DEA, 2024). Establishing permanent telehealth prescribing rules that balance access and diversion prevention remains unresolved.
- **Platform consolidation**: Large telehealth companies (Teladoc, Amazon Clinic) are acquiring or outcompeting smaller mental health telehealth providers, raising concerns about market concentration and the corporatization of mental health care.
- **Data privacy for mental health apps**: Mental health apps collect highly sensitive data but are not covered by HIPAA unless they are provided by a HIPAA-covered entity. The FTC has brought enforcement actions against BetterHelp (2023, $7.8 million settlement) and others for sharing user mental health data with advertisers.
- **Workforce sustainability**: While telehealth increases access, it also increases demand on an already strained workforce. Provider burnout from "Zoom fatigue" and high-volume telehealth caseloads is a growing concern (APA, 2024).
