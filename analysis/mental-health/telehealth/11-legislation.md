# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach for mental health telehealth requires a comprehensive federal bill that permanently codifies the temporary telehealth flexibilities currently sustained through annual congressional extensions, establishes a permanent DEA prescribing framework, and creates new authorities for digital mental health tool regulation and broadband equity. The approach is primarily federal because the core barriers--Medicare statute, the Ryan Haight Act, and FDA regulatory gaps--are federal law. State model legislation complements the federal approach by accelerating interstate licensure compact adoption and establishing consumer protection standards for mental health apps at the state level.

No constitutional amendments are required for these reforms. The federal government has clear authority under the Commerce Clause and the Spending Clause to regulate interstate telehealth, controlled substance prescribing, and Medicare/Medicaid coverage conditions.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments required for this reform.* The Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) provides Congress with ample authority to regulate interstate telehealth services, and the Spending Clause provides authority to condition Medicare and Medicaid funding on telehealth coverage standards.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To permanently establish telehealth as a covered delivery modality for
behavioral health services under Medicare and Medicaid, to create a
permanent framework for telehealth prescribing of controlled substances,
to authorize regulatory oversight of digital mental health products,
and to invest in digital equity for underserved communities.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Mental Health Telehealth Permanence
and Equity Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Health Resources and Services Administration
(2024), more than 160 million Americans live in federally designated
Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas.

(2) According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (2023), 57.8 million American adults experienced
any mental illness in the past year, and 46.3 million had a
substance use disorder.

(3) According to FAIR Health (2021), telehealth mental health
claims increased by 3,060 percent between February and April 2020,
and mental health has remained the single largest clinical use case
for telehealth, accounting for 36 percent of all outpatient behavioral
health visits (McKinsey, 2024).

(4) Meta-analytic evidence demonstrates that telepsychiatry and
video-based psychotherapy produce outcomes comparable to in-person
care for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and
substance use disorders (Hubley et al., 2016; Langarizadeh et al.,
2017).

(5) The current framework of temporary annual extensions of Medicare
telehealth flexibilities creates regulatory uncertainty that undermines
provider investment, patient confidence, and sustainable delivery of
telehealth mental health services.

(6) Twenty-one percent of rural Americans lack fixed broadband
access at 25/3 Mbps (FCC, 2023), and 34 percent of adults 65 and
older lack a smartphone (Pew Research Center, 2024), creating a
digital divide that prevents the most underserved populations from
benefiting from telehealth expansion.

(7) Over 10,000 mental health applications are available to
consumers, but fewer than 30 have received FDA clearance as digital
therapeutics, leaving consumers with inadequate guidance about
effectiveness and safety (IQVIA, 2023; FDA, 2024).

after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs shall publish guidance establishing a tiered regulatory
framework for digital mental health products, including--

    (1) TIER 1 (GENERAL WELLNESS).--Digital mental health products
    that make only general wellness claims and do not claim to

(a) IN GENERAL.--The Federal Trade Commission shall establish rules
requiring any person who offers a digital mental health product
to consumers to--

    (1) register the product with the Commission;

    (2) comply with privacy standards for the collection, storage,
    use, and sharing of mental health data that are no less
    protective than the standards applicable to covered entities
    under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
    of 1996;

    (3) disclose whether the product has been evaluated in
    peer-reviewed clinical studies and, if so, provide citations

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual basis for congressional action, citing specific data on workforce shortages, telehealth utilization, clinical evidence, and the digital divide. These findings provide the legislative record supporting the Commerce Clause and Spending Clause authority for the Act.
- **Section 4 (Permanent Medicare Coverage)**: The core provision eliminating the annual expiration cycle by permanently amending Section 1834(m) of the Social Security Act. The audio-only provisions include clinical appropriateness guidelines to address MedPAC's quality concerns while preserving access for populations without broadband.
- **Section 5 (Controlled Substance Prescribing)**: Creates a tiered framework that permanently replaces the Ryan Haight Act's blanket in-person requirement. Schedule III-V substances can be prescribed via any telehealth modality; Schedule II substances require video and a follow-up within 180 days. Mandatory PDMP checks address diversion concerns.
- **Section 6 (Compact Incentives)**: Uses federal funding incentives and conditional block grant funding to accelerate state adoption of interstate licensure compacts, following the model used successfully for the Nurse Licensure Compact.
- **Section 7 (Digital Product Regulation)**: Establishes FDA authority for tiered regulation proportional to the clinical claims being made, addressing the regulatory vacuum for mental health apps while preserving innovation space for low-risk products.
- **Section 12 (Appropriations)**: Authorizes $925 million over 5 years for general implementation, in addition to $505 million in program-specific authorizations, for a total 5-year authorization of approximately $1.43 billion.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect (general provisions) | 90 days after enactment | N/A |
| Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage begins | January 1, 2026 | CMS |
| Permanent prescribing framework takes effect | 180 days after enactment | DEA |
| CMS publishes audio-only clinical appropriateness guidelines | 180 days after enactment | CMS |
| DEA establishes Telemedicine Special Registration | 12 months after enactment | DEA |
| FDA publishes digital mental health tiered guidance | 18 months after enactment | FDA |
| FTC publishes mental health app consumer protection rules | 18 months after enactment | FTC |
| CMS establishes digital therapeutics coverage pathway | 24 months after enactment | CMS |
| First Digital Health Equity Grants awarded | 12 months after enactment | HHS/HRSA |
| Accreditation bodies incorporate telehealth competency | 36 months after enactment | ACGME, APA CoA, CSWE |

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS administers Medicare telehealth coverage; the DEA administers controlled substance prescribing rules; the FDA oversees digital mental health product regulation; the FTC enforces consumer protection for mental health apps; HRSA administers workforce and equity grant programs.

**Challenges**:

- **CBO scoring**: Permanent Medicare telehealth expansion is estimated to cost $2-4 billion annually due to increased utilization. Offsetting this within budget reconciliation or identifying pay-fors will be politically challenging.
- **DEA implementation**: The DEA has a history of delayed rulemaking on telehealth. The 12-month deadline for Telemedicine Special Registration may require congressional oversight to enforce.
- **State pushback on compact conditioning**: Conditioning mental health block grant funding on compact participation may face resistance from states that view this as federal overreach into professional licensure.

**Refinements**:

- **Phased CBO scoring**: Consider phasing Medicare telehealth permanence over 3 years (first for rural areas, then nationally) to reduce the 10-year CBO score.
- **DEA accountability mechanism**: Include a provision that if the DEA fails to establish the Telemedicine Special Registration within 12 months, practitioners may prescribe under the permanent framework without special registration until the DEA acts.
- **Compact flexibility**: Allow states to satisfy the compact requirement through any two of the four eligible compacts, rather than requiring all four, to reduce resistance.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Telehealth Mental Health Access Act

**Purpose**: To ensure that state Medicaid programs and commercial insurance plans cover telehealth mental health services on a permanent basis, including audio-only visits, and to accelerate state adoption of interstate licensure compacts.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize definitions to match their existing professional licensure categories. States that have already enacted PSYPACT or other compacts should adjust the compact incentive provisions accordingly. Medicaid coverage provisions should be adapted to each state's Medicaid managed care structure.

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: HHS (overall coordination), with specific responsibilities distributed among CMS (Medicare/Medicaid coverage), DEA (controlled substance prescribing), FDA (digital product regulation), FTC (consumer protection), HRSA (workforce and equity grants), and FCC (broadband programs).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **CMS Audio-Only Clinical Appropriateness Guidelines**: Must specify which behavioral health services are appropriate for audio-only delivery, which require video, and documentation requirements. Statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment.
2. **DEA Telemedicine Special Registration**: Must establish a registration process for practitioners prescribing controlled substances via telehealth, including PDMP integration requirements. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.
3. **FDA Digital Mental Health Tiered Guidance**: Must define the boundaries between Tier 1 (wellness), Tier 2 (clinical support), and Tier 3 (prescription digital therapeutic) products. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment.
4. **FTC Mental Health App Consumer Protection Rules**: Must establish registration, privacy, evidence disclosure, and labeling requirements. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: FTC may impose civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation per day for mental health apps that fail to register, disclose evidence, or comply with privacy requirements.
- **Administrative Actions**: FDA may issue warning letters, seize non-compliant products, or seek injunctions against digital mental health products making unauthorized therapeutic claims. DEA may revoke telehealth prescribing authority for practitioners who fail to comply with PDMP or documentation requirements.
- **Private Right of Action**: Individuals may bring civil actions for damages caused by mental health apps that share their data in violation of the privacy requirements established under Section 8 of the Act.
- **Criminal Penalties**: Existing criminal penalties under the Controlled Substances Act apply to fraudulent prescribing via telehealth.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Interstate telehealth services are quintessential interstate commerce, and federal regulation under the Commerce Clause is well-established. The Supreme Court has upheld federal authority over healthcare services that affect interstate commerce, including in *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (upholding federal controlled substance regulation). The federal preemption of state licensure for telehealth purposes may face legal challenge but is supported by the same commerce power.

**Spending Clause Authority**: Conditioning mental health block grant funding on state adoption of interstate licensure compacts is permissible under the Spending Clause, provided the conditions are (1) related to the federal interest in the program, (2) clearly stated, and (3) not coercive. The 5% withholding proposed in Section 6(c) is well within the bounds established by *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), and below the level that would constitute "unconstitutionally coercive" pressure under *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012).

**First Amendment Considerations**: The FTC's authority to regulate mental health app labeling and advertising claims must be consistent with the First Amendment's protection of commercial speech. The *Central Hudson* test allows government regulation of commercial speech that is not misleading and serves a substantial government interest. Requiring disclosure of clinical evidence (or lack thereof) is compelled commercial speech that would likely survive scrutiny under *Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel*, 471 U.S. 626 (1985).

### Preemption

The Act explicitly preempts state laws that restrict Medicare telehealth coverage or impose additional requirements on Medicare telehealth services beyond those in federal law. However, the Act preserves state authority over professional licensure for in-person practice and allows states to impose additional consumer protection requirements on mental health apps that exceed the federal minimum standards. The Act includes a savings clause preserving state tort law claims against telehealth providers for malpractice.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance with controlled substance prescribing requirements is ensured through mandatory PDMP checks, DEA audit authority, and the existing framework of prescription monitoring under the Controlled Substances Act. CMS compliance is ensured through standard Medicare billing audit processes. FTC compliance is enforced through the FTC Act's unfair and deceptive practices authority, supplemented by the specific civil penalties authorized in the Act.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| 180-day follow-up window for Schedule II prescribing | Providers could issue an initial telehealth prescription and then fail to conduct the required follow-up, effectively creating an indefinite telehealth prescribing authority without the intended safeguard | High | Add automatic prescription termination if follow-up evaluation is not documented within 180 days; require pharmacy verification of follow-up before refills beyond 180 days |
| "General wellness" classification for mental health apps | App developers could design products with de facto therapeutic functionality but label them as "general wellness" to avoid FDA review and FTC registration | High | Define "general wellness" narrowly to exclude apps that use clinical screening instruments, recommend specific treatment interventions, or collect diagnostic-level mental health data |
| Audio-only clinical appropriateness exception | The exception allowing audio-only for patients "who lack broadband or video capability" could be claimed broadly without verification, allowing providers to default to audio-only for convenience | Medium | Require providers to document a specific patient-level reason for audio-only use (e.g., no broadband, disability, device limitation) and allow CMS to audit audio-only claims |
| Compact incentive gaming | States could enact compacts but implement them with restrictive administrative requirements that effectively nullify the compact's purpose | Medium | Require HHS to certify that state compact implementation is functionally operational (processing applications, issuing authorizations) before releasing incentive grants |
| PDMP check requirement limited to initial prescription | PDMP checks required "before issuing the prescription and at least annually thereafter" could allow 364 days between checks, during which diversion could occur | Medium | Require PDMP checks before each new prescription or refill authorization for Schedule II substances, and at least every 90 days for Schedules III-V |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| No federal payment parity mandate for commercial insurance | Commercial insurers in the 10 states without payment parity laws may reimburse telehealth at lower rates, reducing provider willingness to offer telehealth | Political infeasibility of federal commercial insurance mandates in current Congress | Include voluntary payment parity incentives through tax credits for insurers that adopt parity; rely on state legislation for mandatory parity |
| CBO cost concerns may force program cuts | If CBO scores the permanent Medicare telehealth extension at the high end ($4 billion/year), appropriators may demand spending offsets that reduce equity or workforce provisions | Budget scoring methodology treats increased utilization as cost even when it addresses unmet need | Commission an independent cost-effectiveness study comparing telehealth costs to downstream savings (reduced ED visits, hospitalizations, disability claims) |
| No enforcement mechanism against states that refuse to join compacts | The 5% block grant withholding may be insufficient incentive for politically resistant states | Federalism constraints on compelling state legislative action | If compact adoption stalls below 45 states, consider federal legislation establishing a telehealth-specific practice privilege that preempts state licensure for interstate telehealth |
| Digital therapeutics reimbursement pathway limited to Medicare | Medicaid coverage of digital therapeutics varies by state and is not addressed by the federal CMS pathway | Medicaid is a state-federal program; federal mandates for Medicaid coverage require additional legislative authority | Include digital therapeutics in the list of optional Medicaid benefits that states may cover, with enhanced FMAP for states that adopt coverage |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Automatic prescription termination for Schedule II non-compliance**: Amend Section 5(a)(2) to add: "If the practitioner does not document a follow-up evaluation within 180 days of the initial telehealth prescription, the prescription authority under this paragraph shall terminate and no refills shall be authorized until a qualifying evaluation is completed."
2. **Narrow general wellness definition**: Amend Section 7(a)(1) to define general wellness products as those that "do not incorporate clinically validated screening instruments, do not recommend specific treatment interventions for named mental health conditions, and do not collect data for the purpose of generating a clinical assessment or diagnosis."
3. **Enhanced PDMP frequency**: Amend Section 5(a)(1)(B) and (2)(B) to require PDMP checks "before issuing each new prescription or refill authorization for Schedule II substances, and at least every 90 days for Schedule III-V substances."
4. **Compact implementation certification**: Amend Section 6 to add a requirement that HHS certify that a state's compact implementation is functionally operational before releasing incentive grant funding.
5. **Audio-only documentation requirement**: Amend Section 4(c) to require that the audio-only clinical appropriateness guidelines include mandatory documentation of a patient-specific reason for audio-only modality, subject to CMS audit.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Act does not include a sunset clause for core coverage provisions (Sections 4 and 5), because the entire purpose of the legislation is to end the cycle of temporary authorizations. However, the Act requires:

- Annual reporting to Congress on implementation and outcomes (Section 11)
- Independent evaluation by AHRQ at years 3, 5, and 10
- Reauthorization of appropriations for grant programs (Sections 6, 8, 9, 10) every 5 years
- GAO review of the digital mental health regulatory framework at year 5

These review mechanisms provide accountability without recreating the annual expiration cycle that the Act is designed to eliminate.
