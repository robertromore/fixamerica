# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: Overview

## Overview

Mental health telehealth encompasses the delivery of psychiatric and psychological services through telecommunications technology, including live video conferencing (synchronous telehealth), telephone-based audio-only sessions, asynchronous store-and-forward communications, and FDA-regulated digital therapeutics. The United States faces a severe mental health workforce shortage--over 160 million Americans live in federally designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HRSA, 2024)--and telehealth has emerged as the most promising mechanism to bridge the gap between need and available care. Mental health is the single largest clinical use case for telehealth, accounting for more than 60% of all telehealth visits in the post-pandemic period (McKinsey, 2024).

The COVID-19 pandemic forced a natural experiment in telehealth at unprecedented scale. Between February and April 2020, telehealth mental health claims increased by 3,060% (FAIR Health, 2021). Federal agencies responded by waiving the Ryan Haight Act's in-person examination requirement for prescribing controlled substances via telehealth, lifting Medicare's geographic and originating-site restrictions, and allowing audio-only visits for mental health services. States enacted over 400 temporary telehealth regulatory changes. The clinical results were broadly positive: meta-analyses found that telepsychiatry and video-based psychotherapy achieved outcomes comparable to in-person care for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders (Langarizadeh et al., 2017; Hubley et al., 2016).

The strategic challenge is now one of permanence and equity. Most federal telehealth flexibilities have been extended on a temporary basis, creating uncertainty for providers and patients. The DEA's proposed permanent telehealth prescribing rule, published in 2024, has generated fierce debate over whether to require at least one in-person visit before prescribing Schedule II controlled substances like stimulants for ADHD. Meanwhile, the digital mental health marketplace has exploded, with over 10,000 mental health apps available for download (IQVIA, 2023), but fewer than 30 have received FDA clearance as Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), leaving consumers with little reliable guidance.

The core complexity of this domain lies at the intersection of clinical evidence, regulatory design, technological access, and workforce economics. Telehealth demonstrably expands access--but access to what quality of care, under what safeguards, and for whom? Rural and low-income populations who stand to benefit most from telehealth are also those least likely to have broadband access. Audio-only telephone visits serve these populations but raise questions about clinical adequacy. Interstate licensure compacts like the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT) facilitate cross-border practice but currently cover fewer than half of states. These tensions require a comprehensive federal response rather than the patchwork of temporary waivers and state-by-state rules that currently govern mental health telehealth.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of mental health telehealth policy:

- **Telehealth Modalities**: Live video (synchronous), audio-only telephone, asynchronous store-and-forward, and remote patient monitoring for behavioral health
- **Digital Therapeutics and Mental Health Apps**: FDA-regulated prescription digital therapeutics (PDTs), consumer wellness apps, and the regulatory gap between them
- **Prescribing and the Ryan Haight Act**: DEA flexibilities for prescribing controlled substances via telehealth, including stimulants, benzodiazepines, and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder
- **Interstate Licensure**: The Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT), Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC), and Counseling Compact
- **Reimbursement Policy**: Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payer telehealth coverage, payment parity, and facility fee structures
- **Digital Equity**: Broadband access, digital literacy, device availability, and the impact of the digital divide on telehealth utilization

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Americans in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas | 160 million+ | HRSA, 2024 |
| Telehealth share of all mental health visits (post-pandemic stabilization) | 36% of outpatient behavioral health visits | McKinsey, 2024 |
| Telehealth mental health claims increase (Feb-Apr 2020) | 3,060% | FAIR Health, 2021 |
| Mental health apps available for download | 10,000+ | IQVIA Digital Health Trends, 2023 |
| FDA-cleared mental health digital therapeutics | Fewer than 30 | FDA Digital Health Center of Excellence, 2024 |
| States participating in PSYPACT | 42 states + DC (enacted) | PSYPACT Commission, 2024 |
| Medicare telehealth spending (FY2023) | $6.2 billion (all services) | MedPAC, 2024 |
| Rural Americans without broadband access | 21% lack fixed broadband | FCC Broadband Data Collection, 2023 |
| Audio-only share of telehealth mental health visits | 30-40% of telehealth behavioral health visits | CMS Office of the Actuary, 2023 |
| Ryan Haight Act temporary waiver status | Extended through December 31, 2025 | DEA, 2024 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Access vs. Safety**: Removing the in-person examination requirement for controlled substance prescribing dramatically expands access to ADHD medication, buprenorphine, and psychiatric drugs, but also increases the risk of inappropriate prescribing, diversion, and missed diagnoses that require physical examination
- **Innovation vs. Regulation**: The consumer mental health app market innovates at a pace that vastly outstrips the FDA's capacity to evaluate products, meaning that either regulation slows innovation or consumers use unvalidated tools making health claims
- **Payment Parity vs. Cost Control**: Requiring insurers to pay the same rate for telehealth as in-person visits incentivizes providers to offer telehealth and ensures service availability, but may increase overall healthcare spending if telehealth generates new utilization rather than substituting for in-person visits
- **Audio-Only Access vs. Clinical Quality**: Audio-only telephone visits are the most accessible modality for populations without broadband, smartphones, or digital literacy, but the clinical evidence base for audio-only mental health care is thinner than for video-based care, and the modality limits clinical observation
- **State Autonomy vs. Interstate Access**: State licensure protects state-level consumer protection and professional standards, but creates a patchwork system where a patient who moves or travels loses access to their established telehealth provider
- **Workforce Expansion vs. Workforce Quality**: Telehealth platforms and digital tools can extend the reach of existing providers, but aggressive scaling risks diluting quality through inadequate supervision, shorter sessions, or algorithmic triage that replaces clinical judgment

## Key Questions

1. Which COVID-era telehealth flexibilities should be made permanent through legislation, and which should be allowed to expire on patient safety grounds?
2. How should the FDA regulate the rapidly growing market of mental health apps and digital therapeutics that fall between consumer wellness tools and traditional medical devices?
3. What is the appropriate balance between expanding controlled substance prescribing via telehealth and preventing diversion and inappropriate prescribing?
4. How can federal policy close the digital divide that prevents the most underserved populations from benefiting from telehealth expansion?

## Vision of Success

A successful mental health telehealth policy in the 21st century would feature:

- **Permanent Federal Framework**: Clear, stable legislation making telehealth a permanent component of Medicare, Medicaid, and regulated insurance, ending the cycle of temporary waivers and expiration cliffs
- **Universal Interstate Practice**: A national framework enabling licensed mental health professionals to practice across state lines, so that a patient's access to care is not limited by geography
- **Regulated Digital Marketplace**: An FDA pathway that brings evidence-based digital therapeutics to market efficiently while protecting consumers from unvalidated mental health apps making therapeutic claims
- **Equitable Access**: Broadband infrastructure, device access programs, and audio-only coverage ensuring that rural, elderly, disabled, and low-income Americans can access telehealth mental health services
- **Evidence-Based Prescribing**: A permanent DEA prescribing framework that expands access to medications for ADHD, depression, anxiety, and opioid use disorder via telehealth while maintaining safeguards against diversion and misuse
