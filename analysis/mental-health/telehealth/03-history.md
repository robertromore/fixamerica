# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: History

## Historical Development

Mental health telehealth has evolved from experimental closed-circuit television demonstrations in the 1950s to a mainstream delivery modality used by millions of Americans. This trajectory has been shaped by technological innovation, federal policy decisions, workforce shortages, and a pandemic that compressed decades of adoption into months.

### Early Experimentation (1956-1989): Television Psychiatry and Military Applications

- **First telepsychiatry demonstration (1956)**: The Nebraska Psychiatric Institute conducted the first documented use of closed-circuit television for psychiatric consultations, linking clinicians in Omaha with patients at Norfolk State Hospital 112 miles away. The system used a two-way interactive television link for group therapy, individual consultations, and training.
- **Dartmouth-New Hampshire experiment (1968)**: The Dartmouth Medical School established a microwave-linked telepsychiatry program connecting the medical school with the New Hampshire Hospital, demonstrating that remote psychiatric consultations could be clinically viable.
- **Military and VA early adoption**: The Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs were early adopters, using satellite-based telemedicine to provide psychiatric support to personnel in remote locations. The VA's telemental health program, formalized in the 1990s, would become the largest telehealth mental health system in the world.
- **Technology limitations**: Analog television systems were expensive, required dedicated infrastructure, and produced poor-quality images. Adoption remained confined to academic demonstrations and government-funded pilots.

### Infrastructure Building (1990-2007): Internet, Medicare Rules, and the Ryan Haight Act

- **Telecommunications Act of 1996**: Federal legislation promoted broadband infrastructure development, laying the groundwork for internet-based telehealth. The Universal Service Fund's Rural Health Care Program began subsidizing telecommunications for rural healthcare providers.
- **Medicare telehealth coverage (1999)**: The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized limited Medicare reimbursement for telehealth services, but imposed strict geographic restrictions (rural Health Professional Shortage Areas only) and originating-site requirements (patient must be at an approved facility, not at home). Mental health was among the first covered specialties.
- **VA telemental health expansion (2003-2007)**: The VA dramatically expanded its telemental health program, particularly for PTSD treatment of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. By 2007, the VA was conducting over 100,000 telemental health encounters per year, making it the world's largest telepsychiatry system (VA Office of Telehealth Services, 2008).
- **State licensure barriers**: As internet-based videoconferencing became feasible, the requirement that practitioners hold a license in the state where the patient is physically located emerged as a major barrier. Each state maintained independent licensure requirements with no reciprocity.
- **Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act (2008)**: Following the death of Ryan Haight, a teenager who obtained prescription drugs through an online pharmacy, Congress passed legislation requiring at least one in-person medical evaluation before a practitioner could prescribe controlled substances via the internet. While intended to combat online pharmacy fraud, the law created a major barrier to legitimate telepsychiatry prescribing of medications like stimulants, benzodiazepines, and buprenorphine. The DEA was tasked with creating a "special registration" process for telemedicine prescribers but did not finalize regulations for over 15 years.

### Slow Growth and Evidence Building (2008-2019): Research, Parity, and Compacts

- **Evidence base development (2010-2019)**: A growing body of peer-reviewed research demonstrated the clinical equivalence of telepsychiatry to in-person care. Key meta-analyses by Hilty et al. (2013), Hubley et al. (2016), and Langarizadeh et al. (2017) showed comparable outcomes for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders. The American Psychiatric Association published telepsychiatry practice guidelines in 2018.
- **State telehealth parity laws (2012-2019)**: States began passing laws requiring commercial insurers to cover telehealth services and, in some cases, pay the same rate as in-person visits. By 2019, 42 states had some form of telehealth coverage mandate, but only 10 required full payment parity (Center for Connected Health Policy, 2019).
- **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act enforcement (2008-2019)**: While not directly about telehealth, the 2008 parity law's requirement that insurers cover mental health on par with physical health created pressure for coverage of telemental health as a modality for delivering those covered services.
- **PSYPACT established (2015)**: The Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact was adopted by the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) in 2015, creating a framework for psychologists to practice telepsychology and conduct temporary in-person practice across state lines. Georgia became the first state to enact PSYPACT in 2016. By late 2019, only 14 states had joined.
- **Digital therapeutics emergence (2017-2019)**: The FDA cleared its first prescription digital therapeutic for a substance use disorder (reSET by Pear Therapeutics) in 2017, establishing a regulatory pathway for software-based mental health treatments. The Digital Therapeutics Alliance was founded in 2017 to establish industry standards.
- **Pre-pandemic telehealth mental health utilization**: Despite a decade of evidence and policy development, telehealth accounted for only approximately 1% of outpatient mental health visits as of early 2020 (FAIR Health, 2021). Medicare's geographic restrictions, the Ryan Haight Act's in-person requirement, inconsistent state policies, and provider and patient inertia all constrained growth.

### The COVID-19 Transformation (2020-2021): Emergency Expansion

- **Public Health Emergency (PHE) declaration (March 2020)**: The declaration of the COVID-19 PHE triggered a cascade of telehealth regulatory changes that transformed mental health care delivery virtually overnight.
- **CMS waivers (March 6, 2020)**: Under Section 1135 waiver authority, CMS waived Medicare's geographic and originating-site restrictions, allowing beneficiaries to receive telehealth services--including mental health--from their homes anywhere in the country. CMS also added over 135 services to the Medicare telehealth-eligible list and permitted audio-only telephone visits for behavioral health.
- **DEA waiver (March 16, 2020)**: The DEA suspended the Ryan Haight Act's in-person examination requirement, allowing practitioners to prescribe controlled substances, including stimulants and buprenorphine, via telehealth without a prior in-person visit for the first time.
- **HIPAA enforcement discretion (March 17, 2020)**: HHS Office for Civil Rights announced it would not enforce HIPAA penalties for the use of non-compliant communication platforms (FaceTime, Skype, Zoom consumer version) for telehealth during the PHE, removing a major technical barrier.
- **Utilization explosion**: Telehealth mental health claims increased by 3,060% between February and April 2020 (FAIR Health, 2021). By mid-2020, telehealth accounted for over 50% of all outpatient behavioral health visits, a rate it had never previously exceeded 1%.
- **State emergency actions (2020-2021)**: All 50 states issued executive orders or emergency regulations expanding telehealth during the pandemic. Common provisions included waiving in-state licensure requirements, mandating telehealth insurance coverage, and permitting audio-only visits. Over 400 state-level telehealth policy changes were enacted in 2020 alone (Center for Connected Health Policy, 2021).
- **Buprenorphine prescribing transformation**: The waiver of the Ryan Haight Act, combined with the elimination of the "X-waiver" requirement for buprenorphine prescribing (finalized permanently in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023), dramatically expanded access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. Telehealth buprenorphine prescribing increased by over 1,500% (SAMHSA, 2022).

### Post-Pandemic Stabilization and Debate (2022-Present): Permanence, Regulation, and Risk

- **Congressional extensions (2022-2024)**: As the COVID-19 PHE ended in May 2023, Congress repeatedly extended Medicare telehealth flexibilities through annual appropriations legislation, most recently through December 31, 2025 (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024). However, these extensions are temporary, creating annual uncertainty.
- **DEA rulemaking process (2023-2024)**: The DEA issued a proposed rule in February 2023 that would have required an in-person evaluation for controlled substance telehealth prescribing within 30 days of the initial telehealth prescription. After intense public comment (over 38,000 submissions), the DEA withdrew the proposal and issued a revised proposed rule in 2024 proposing a more flexible 6-month window for Schedule II substances and no in-person requirement for Schedules III-V.
- **Telehealth startup controversies (2022-2024)**: Companies like Cerebral and Done faced federal investigations for alleged overprescribing of stimulants via telehealth. The DOJ and DEA alleged that some telehealth platforms pressured clinicians to prescribe controlled substances quickly to meet business targets. Cerebral halted most controlled substance prescribing in 2022. These cases became central to the debate over telehealth prescribing safeguards.
- **PSYPACT rapid expansion (2021-2024)**: PSYPACT grew from 18 member states in 2020 to 42 states plus DC by 2024, driven by pandemic momentum and bipartisan state legislative support. It became the fastest-growing professional licensure compact in U.S. history.
- **Pear Therapeutics bankruptcy (April 2023)**: The leading prescription digital therapeutics company ceased operations, unable to sustain its business model despite FDA-cleared products. Low payer adoption and reimbursement challenges were cited as primary causes, casting doubt on the commercial viability of the FDA-regulated digital therapeutics model.
- **Audio-only policy debate (2023-2024)**: MedPAC recommended that Congress not permanently extend Medicare coverage of audio-only telehealth for mental health, citing concerns about clinical quality and fraud risk. Patient advocates and rural health groups strongly opposed this recommendation, arguing that audio-only is the only telehealth modality available to many underserved populations.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Crises Drive Telehealth Adoption; Inertia Follows

Every major telehealth expansion has been crisis-driven--the need to serve remote VA patients, workforce shortages in rural areas, and above all the COVID-19 pandemic. Between crises, regulatory barriers, institutional inertia, and reimbursement limitations slow adoption to a crawl. The pre-pandemic decade of positive evidence produced only 1% telehealth utilization. This pattern suggests that without permanent legislative action, post-pandemic telehealth gains will erode as temporary flexibilities expire and urgency fades.

### Pattern 2: Regulation Lags Technology by a Decade or More

The Ryan Haight Act was enacted in 2008, but the DEA did not issue its first proposed rule for the telemedicine special registration process until 2020--during a pandemic that forced emergency suspension of the law's requirements. The FDA's digital health regulatory framework has been under development since 2013, yet the vast majority of mental health apps still operate in a regulatory vacuum. This persistent regulatory lag creates a cycle of emergency action followed by extended uncertainty.

### Pattern 3: The VA as a Policy Laboratory

The VA has consistently been the earliest adopter and largest operator of telehealth mental health services. Its experience demonstrates what federal commitment can achieve: the VA now conducts millions of telemental health encounters annually. However, the VA operates outside the constraints of state licensure, private insurance, and Medicare's geographic restrictions, which limits the transferability of its model to the broader healthcare system.

### Pattern 4: Market Enthusiasm Outpaces Sustainability

The digital therapeutics market illustrates a recurring pattern in health technology: significant investor enthusiasm and FDA clearance do not guarantee commercial viability. Pear Therapeutics raised over $400 million in funding and received multiple FDA clearances, but went bankrupt because payers would not reimburse its products at a sustainable rate. This suggests that FDA regulation alone is insufficient without a parallel reimbursement pathway.
