# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: What You Can Do

The future of mental health telehealth depends on whether Congress makes temporary flexibilities permanent, the DEA establishes a workable prescribing framework, and federal agencies invest in closing the digital divide. Citizen engagement--particularly from patients who rely on telehealth, providers who deliver it, and communities that lack access--is critical to moving these reforms from policy proposals to enacted law.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Follow the Center for Connected Health Policy's telehealth policy tracker at <https://www.cchpca.org/> for state and federal telehealth regulatory updates
- Monitor the DEA's telehealth prescribing rulemaking process through the Federal Register at <https://www.federalregister.gov/> using the search term "telemedicine prescribing"
- Read NAMI's quarterly policy updates on telehealth legislation at <https://www.nami.org/Advocacy/>
- Track your state's PSYPACT, Counseling Compact, and IMLC membership status at <https://psypact.org/> and <https://counselingcompact.org/>

### Make Personal Changes

- If you use a mental health app, check whether it has published clinical evidence of effectiveness and review its privacy policy before sharing personal mental health data. The APA App Advisor at <https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/mental-health-apps> provides independent evaluations.
- If you receive mental health care via telehealth, document your experience--positive and negative--so you can share it with policymakers and advocacy organizations when asked for patient perspectives.
- If you live in a rural area or know someone who does, explore whether your community mental health center offers telehealth services, and inquire about device lending and broadband assistance programs.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call your U.S. Senator and House Representative to urge support for permanent Medicare telehealth coverage for behavioral health. The CONNECT for Health Act and the Telehealth Modernization Act are bipartisan bills that need congressional support.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When the DEA publishes its final proposed rule on telehealth prescribing of controlled substances, submit a public comment through regulations.gov sharing your experience with telehealth prescribing access.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Write to your local newspaper about the importance of telehealth for mental health access, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Local stories carry weight with state and federal legislators.
- **Share Information**: Share credible data about telehealth mental health access on social media, emphasizing that over 160 million Americans live in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas and telehealth is often the only viable path to care.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a community coalition for telehealth access by bringing together patients, mental health providers, community health centers, and local elected officials to identify telehealth barriers in your area
- Partner with your local library or community center to offer digital literacy workshops focused on using telehealth platforms, especially for seniors and non-English speakers
- Work with your school district to advocate for school-based telehealth mental health programs that connect students with providers via video when in-person clinicians are not available
- Contact your local Federally Qualified Health Center or Community Mental Health Center to ask about their telehealth capabilities and what barriers they face

### Build Coalitions

- Connect with local NAMI affiliates (over 600 nationwide) to join existing advocacy campaigns for telehealth permanence. Find your local affiliate at <https://www.nami.org/Find-Your-Local-NAMI>
- Bring together rural health advocates, broadband access advocates, and mental health advocates in your area to present a unified message to state and federal legislators about the connection between broadband infrastructure and mental health access
- Engage faith communities, veterans' organizations, and senior centers as partners in advocating for telehealth access, as these groups represent populations that benefit significantly from remote mental health care

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During the annual congressional debate over extending Medicare telehealth flexibilities (typically October-December before expiration deadlines)
- When the DEA publishes proposed or final rules on telehealth prescribing of controlled substances
- When your state legislature is considering PSYPACT, Counseling Compact, or other interstate licensure compact legislation
- When federal broadband funding decisions are being made through NTIA and FCC programs

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Permanent Medicare Telehealth Coverage for Mental Health

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State] writing to urge your support for
making Medicare telehealth coverage for mental health services permanent.
[I am a patient who relies on telehealth / I am a provider who delivers
telehealth services / I am a community member who has seen the impact
of telehealth access].

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has accounted for over 36% of
all outpatient behavioral health visits, connecting millions of Americans
to care they could not otherwise access. Over 160 million Americans live
in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas where telehealth is often the
only viable path to a psychiatrist or therapist.

I urge you to co-sponsor and advance the CONNECT for Health Act (or
equivalent permanent telehealth legislation) to end the cycle of temporary
extensions and annual uncertainty that threatens patient access and
provider investment in telehealth services.

[Optional: Personal story about how telehealth has affected you, your
family, or your community]

Thank you for your consideration and service.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling
to ask [Representative/Senator] [Last Name] to support permanent Medicare
telehealth coverage for mental health services. Over 160 million Americans
live in areas without enough mental health providers, and telehealth is
often the only way they can access care. I urge the [Representative/Senator]
to co-sponsor the CONNECT for Health Act and support making telehealth
flexibilities permanent. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **CONNECT for Health Act**: Permanently removes Medicare's geographic and originating-site restrictions for telehealth. Contact Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee members.
- **Telehealth Modernization Act**: Establishes permanent Medicare telehealth coverage and payment parity. Bipartisan bill with broad provider support.
- **State PSYPACT Legislation**: If your state has not yet enacted PSYPACT, contact your state legislators to urge its adoption. Eight states plus territories still need to join.
- **Counseling Compact**: If your state has not yet enacted the Counseling Compact (17 states remain), contact your state legislators to urge adoption.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support making Medicare telehealth coverage for mental health permanent, ending the annual cycle of temporary extensions?"
2. "What is your position on the DEA's proposed telehealth prescribing rules? Do you believe patients should be able to receive prescriptions for psychiatric medications via video visits without a prior in-person visit?"
3. "How do you plan to address the digital divide that prevents rural and low-income Americans from accessing telehealth mental health services?"
4. "Do you support federal incentives for states to join interstate licensure compacts like PSYPACT, so that patients can keep their therapist when they move across state lines?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who have co-sponsored telehealth legislation or have a record of supporting mental health funding
- Members of the Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee have the most direct influence on telehealth policy
- State legislative candidates' positions on PSYPACT and licensure compacts are particularly relevant

## Professional Actions

- **For Mental Health Clinicians**: Join your professional association's advocacy efforts for telehealth permanence. The APA, APA, NASW, and ACA all maintain advocacy portals for contacting Congress. If you deliver telehealth, share your clinical experience--outcomes, patient access stories, and challenges--with your association's government relations staff.
- **For Primary Care Providers**: Advocate for permanent coverage of collaborative care model (CoCM) telehealth codes that allow psychiatric consultation via telehealth to support primary care mental health treatment.
- **For Technology Professionals**: Contribute to open-source telehealth platform development or accessibility improvements. Volunteer technical skills with community mental health organizations to help them implement telehealth infrastructure.
- **For Educators**: Advocate for telehealth competency requirements in mental health training program accreditation. If you teach in a clinical program, incorporate telehealth skills training into your curriculum.
- **For Employers**: Evaluate your employee assistance program (EAP) and mental health benefits for telehealth access. Advocate for including telehealth mental health services in your company's health plan if not already covered. Support broadband access programs in your community.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing mental health telehealth with others, emphasize:

1. **Access gap**: Over 160 million Americans live in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HRSA, 2024). Telehealth is often the only way they can reach a psychiatrist or therapist.
2. **Proven effectiveness**: Meta-analyses show that telepsychiatry and video-based psychotherapy produce outcomes comparable to in-person care for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use disorders.
3. **Expiration threat**: Most Medicare telehealth flexibilities are temporary and must be reauthorized annually by Congress. Without permanent legislation, millions could lose access.
4. **Rural and equity imperative**: 21% of rural Americans lack broadband access. Audio-only telephone visits serve the populations most in need, and eliminating their coverage would worsen mental health disparities.
5. **Bipartisan support**: Telehealth permanence has bipartisan appeal because it addresses rural access (a Republican priority) and health equity (a Democratic priority). The CONNECT for Health Act has bipartisan co-sponsors.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Telehealth is a lower standard of care" | Meta-analyses show comparable clinical outcomes for telepsychiatry vs. in-person care for depression, anxiety, PTSD, and substance use | Hubley et al., 2016; Langarizadeh et al., 2017 |
| "Telehealth prescribing leads to more drug diversion" | No statistically significant difference in inappropriate prescribing rates between telehealth and in-person psychiatry when controlling for provider type | Marcus et al., JAMA Psychiatry, 2024 |
| "Telehealth mainly benefits people who already have access" | Rural telehealth utilization is growing faster than urban utilization, and audio-only visits serve populations without broadband | MedPAC, 2024; RUPRI, 2024 |
| "Mental health apps are all regulated by the FDA" | Fewer than 30 mental health digital therapeutics have FDA clearance; over 10,000 apps operate without regulatory review | FDA, 2024; IQVIA, 2023 |
| "Making telehealth permanent will cost too much" | Increased mental health utilization addresses massive unmet need; early evidence shows telehealth reduces downstream costs (ED visits, hospitalizations) | Huskamp et al., JAMA, 2023 |
