# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current challenges in mental health telehealth are not the result of a single failure but of several long-term, interlocking structural problems. These include a fragmented regulatory architecture designed for in-person care, an infrastructure deficit that excludes the most underserved populations, a reimbursement system that creates annual uncertainty, and a digital marketplace that has outpaced the government's capacity to evaluate and regulate it.

## Regulatory Fragmentation

### State-by-State Licensure Architecture

The fundamental structure of professional licensure in the United States--with each state maintaining independent licensing boards, scope-of-practice definitions, and supervision requirements--creates a patchwork system that is inherently hostile to telehealth. A psychologist licensed in California cannot treat a patient in Nevada via video without also holding a Nevada license, even if the patient lived in California until last month.

**Evidence**: There are over 200 independent state mental health licensing boards across the 50 states and territories (covering psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, counselors, and marriage and family therapists). Interstate compacts like PSYPACT (42 states + DC, 2024) have made progress, but no compact covers all mental health professions, and 8 states remain outside PSYPACT entirely (PSYPACT Commission, 2024).

### The Ryan Haight Act's Legacy

The Ryan Haight Act of 2008 addressed a legitimate problem--illegal online pharmacies selling controlled substances without medical evaluation--but created a structural barrier to legitimate telepsychiatry. The law's requirement of at least one in-person evaluation before telehealth prescribing of controlled substances was designed for a world of pill mills and rogue pharmacies, not for board-certified psychiatrists conducting thorough video evaluations.

**Evidence**: The DEA was mandated by the Ryan Haight Act to create a "special registration" process for telemedicine prescribers. It took over 15 years--until 2023--for the DEA to issue even a proposed rule, and no final rule has been published as of January 2025 (DEA, 2024). This regulatory vacuum forced the field to operate under emergency waivers rather than a permanent framework.

### Medicare's Statutory Restrictions

Prior to COVID-19 waivers, Medicare telehealth was governed by Section 1834(m) of the Social Security Act, which limited coverage to beneficiaries in rural Health Professional Shortage Areas who were physically present at an approved originating site (a clinic, hospital, or community mental health center). Patients could not receive telehealth services from home. These restrictions were written into statute in 1997 and required congressional action to modify.

**Evidence**: Before the PHE waivers, only 0.1% of Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth for mental health services. After the waivers, usage surged to over 20% (MedPAC, 2024). The restrictions were not based on clinical evidence; they were fiscal controls to limit Medicare telehealth spending.

## Infrastructure Deficit

### Broadband as a Social Determinant of Health

The digital divide is not merely a technology problem; it is a structural determinant of access to mental health care in a telehealth-enabled system. The same populations that face the greatest barriers to in-person mental health care--rural residents, low-income communities, older adults, tribal nations--also lack the broadband infrastructure required for video-based telehealth.

**Evidence**: 21% of rural Americans lack fixed broadband at 25/3 Mbps, compared to 3% of urban Americans (FCC Broadband Data Collection, 2023). On tribal lands, the figure rises to 35%. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 authorized $65 billion for broadband expansion, but deployment timelines extend to 2028 and beyond, meaning the gap will persist for years.

### Device and Digital Literacy Barriers

Even where broadband exists, many potential telehealth patients lack suitable devices or the digital literacy to use them for healthcare. Older adults, people with disabilities, and non-English speakers face compounding barriers.

**Evidence**: 34% of adults 65+ lack a smartphone, and 25% lack any broadband internet connection (Pew Research Center, 2024). Among adults with household income below $30,000, 27% lack home broadband and 15% rely exclusively on smartphone internet access, which is inadequate for sustained video therapy sessions (FCC, 2023).

## Reimbursement Instability

### The Annual Cliff Problem

The most corrosive structural problem facing mental health telehealth is the annual cycle of temporary extensions and expiration threats. Congress has extended Medicare telehealth flexibilities through annual appropriations bills four times since the PHE ended (2022, 2023, 2024, 2025), each time creating a period of uncertainty during which providers do not know whether their telehealth services will be reimbursed in the coming year.

**Evidence**: The American Telemedicine Association reported that 62% of telehealth providers surveyed in 2024 said regulatory uncertainty was their top business concern, and 38% said they had delayed investments in telehealth infrastructure due to the possibility that flexibilities would expire (ATA, 2024).

### Payment Parity Inconsistency

While 40 states plus DC require some form of telehealth payment parity for commercial insurance, these laws vary widely in scope, and no federal law mandates payment parity for telehealth services. Medicare payment parity is temporary. Without permanent parity, providers face the prospect of reduced reimbursement for telehealth visits, which would undermine the economic model that sustains telehealth access.

**Evidence**: A 2023 RAND study found that in states without payment parity mandates, telehealth reimbursement rates were on average 20-30% lower than in-person rates for the same behavioral health services (RAND, 2023).

## Market and Regulatory Gaps

### The Consumer App Regulatory Vacuum

Over 10,000 mental health apps are available to consumers, but the FDA's regulatory framework covers only a tiny fraction of them. The FDA's 2019 Digital Health Innovation Action Plan and the 21st Century Cures Act's exemption for clinical decision support software created a broad space in which apps can make wellness claims, offer therapy-like exercises, and collect sensitive mental health data without any regulatory review.

**Evidence**: An analysis by the American Psychiatric Association's App Advisor program found that of 150 popular mental health apps reviewed, fewer than 5% had published peer-reviewed evidence supporting their clinical claims, 64% did not have a privacy policy that met minimum standards, and 29% shared user data with third parties (APA App Advisor, 2023).

### Digital Therapeutics Reimbursement Failure

FDA clearance for digital therapeutics does not automatically translate to payer coverage or reimbursement. The current reimbursement infrastructure was designed for drugs and devices, not software. There are no established CPT codes for most digital therapeutics, and CMS has no coverage pathway for prescription digital therapeutics under Medicare Part B or Part D.

**Evidence**: Pear Therapeutics, which held FDA clearance for three digital therapeutics products (reSET, reSET-O, Somryst), filed for bankruptcy in April 2023, citing inability to achieve sustainable reimbursement from payers. Only 40% of commercial insurers covered any prescription digital therapeutic as of 2023 (Digital Therapeutics Alliance, 2023).

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| State licensing boards | Maintain regulatory authority, fee revenue, and professional control | ~$500 million annually in licensing fees across all mental health professions | Interstate compacts reduce their authority; resist national licensure |
| In-person-only providers | Reduced competition from out-of-state telehealth providers | N/A (indirect competitive protection) | Telehealth expansion increases supply, potentially reducing demand for in-person care |
| Large health systems with physical infrastructure | Facility fees for in-person visits; capital investment in physical plants | Billions in annual facility fee revenue | Telehealth shifts care outside their facilities; lose facility fee revenue |
| Pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) | Current formulary structures favor traditional drug distribution | N/A | Digital therapeutics disrupt their drug-centric business model |
| DEA | Maintains enforcement authority over controlled substance prescribing | Enforcement budget and regulatory authority | Telehealth prescribing is harder to monitor; prefer in-person requirements |

### Perverse Incentives

The current system creates several misaligned incentives:

- **Providers are incentivized to avoid controlled substances via telehealth** even when clinically appropriate, because the legal uncertainty around the Ryan Haight Act creates liability risk. This leads to undertreatment.
- **App developers are incentivized to avoid FDA regulation** by making "wellness" rather than "clinical" claims, even when their products function as de facto therapeutic interventions. This lets them reach market faster but with no quality assurance.
- **Health systems are incentivized to require facility-based originating sites** for telehealth, because this allows them to bill a facility fee. This undermines the home-based access that makes telehealth most valuable.
- **Congress is incentivized to extend telehealth flexibilities temporarily** rather than permanently, because temporary extensions avoid the long-term CBO scoring implications of permanent telehealth expansion.

## Cultural and Institutional Factors

### Provider Resistance to Practice Change

Despite strong evidence supporting telehealth for mental health, significant segments of the clinical workforce remain skeptical. Some clinicians believe that in-person therapeutic relationships are inherently superior and that telehealth is a compromise, not an alternative. Training programs have been slow to incorporate telehealth competencies.

**Evidence**: A 2024 APA survey found that while 85% of psychiatrists offered telehealth, only 45% reported receiving any formal training in telehealth best practices during residency or continuing education (APA, 2024).

### Patient Stigma and Preference

Some patients prefer the anonymity of a telehealth visit (reduced stigma of entering a mental health facility), while others distrust the technology or prefer the ritual of an in-person visit. Cultural factors affect adoption patterns, with lower telehealth uptake among older adults, Hispanic/Latino communities, and non-English speakers.

**Evidence**: A 2023 KFF survey found that 72% of adults 18-44 were comfortable receiving mental health care via video, compared to only 38% of adults 65+ (KFF, 2023).

## Why Reform Has Failed

Reform has stalled for three interlocking reasons:

1. **Congressional inaction on permanent legislation**: Multiple bills to permanently extend Medicare telehealth flexibilities (the CONNECT for Health Act, the Telehealth Modernization Act) have been introduced in every Congress since 2020 but have failed to advance past committee, largely because of CBO scoring concerns about increased Medicare spending and disagreements over audio-only coverage.

2. **DEA institutional caution**: The DEA's organizational culture prioritizes enforcement and diversion prevention. The agency has resisted creating a permanent telehealth prescribing framework because it views any relaxation of the in-person requirement as increasing diversion risk. The 38,000+ public comments on its 2023 proposed rule revealed intense stakeholder disagreement that the DEA has been unable to resolve.

3. **No single powerful champion**: Unlike other healthcare reform areas where a single agency or committee has clear jurisdiction, telehealth policy spans CMS, the DEA, the FDA, HHS, FCC, and state governments. No single entity has the authority or political incentive to drive comprehensive reform.
