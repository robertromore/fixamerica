# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes mental health telehealth policy through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

Mental health telehealth raises fundamental questions about the proper balance between federal authority and state regulatory autonomy, the role of government in ensuring healthcare access versus leaving markets to determine service delivery, and how to protect both patient safety and patient access when these goals conflict. The topic is unusual in the degree to which it cross-cuts traditional partisan lines: rural Republican legislators have strong incentives to support telehealth access expansion, while some Democratic-aligned labor and professional groups resist interstate compacts that could weaken state regulatory authority.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concerns about fiscal cost and drug diversion generally align with underlying preference for limited government spending and law enforcement authority. Some fiscal objections mask competitive protections for in-person health systems. |
| Principle consistency | Generally consistent: support for rural access aligns with constituent service, and fiscal caution aligns with limited-government principles. Tension arises when free-market principles (supporting telehealth competition) conflict with law enforcement priorities (restrictive prescribing rules). |
| Goalpost stability | Relatively stable. Once rural access benefits are demonstrated, support generally holds. Diversion-related goalposts may shift if high-profile enforcement cases occur. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low. Conservatives generally view telehealth as compatible with their broader goals; do not tend to oppose telehealth reforms solely to deny victories to opponents. |

**Justification:** Conservative engagement on telehealth is mostly consistent because the issue activates two core conservative values that largely reinforce each other: fiscal restraint and rural constituent service. The primary tension is between free-market support for telehealth competition and law-and-order support for restrictive DEA prescribing rules, but this tension is manageable through tiered frameworks.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Rural Republican senators (e.g., Wicker (MS), Moran (KS)) have consistently co-sponsored bipartisan telehealth permanence legislation across multiple Congresses
- Heritage Foundation has published analyses supporting telehealth deregulation as a market-based solution to healthcare access (2023)
- Republican opposition to permanent telehealth has centered primarily on CBO scoring concerns, not ideological objections

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree on the severity of workforce shortages and regulatory barriers; skeptical of framing the digital divide as primarily a federal responsibility rather than a state/market issue |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agree that regulatory fragmentation and government restrictions are root causes; disagree that the solution requires more federal spending rather than deregulation |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation, "Telehealth Deregulation: A Market-Based Solution to Healthcare Access," 2023
- American Enterprise Institute, "Telehealth After COVID: Balancing Access and Accountability," 2024

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage | 7/10 | Support permanence to end regulatory uncertainty; prefer it without expanded spending | CBO scoring impact on federal deficit |
| Interstate licensure compacts | 8/10 | Strongly support voluntary compacts as state-led solutions | Prefer compacts over federal preemption; protect state sovereignty |
| Permanent DEA prescribing framework | 6/10 | Support ending waiver cycle but want robust enforcement safeguards | Balance between rural access and drug diversion prevention |
| FDA digital therapeutics framework | 6/10 | Support clear regulatory pathways but oppose new FDA bureaucracy | Want streamlined regulation, not expanded regulatory state |
| Broadband/digital equity grants | 4/10 | Skeptical of new federal grant programs; prefer private market broadband deployment | Oppose new federal spending programs; prefer tax incentives |
| Mental health app consumer protection | 5/10 | Prefer industry self-regulation over FTC mandates | Oppose expanding FTC authority; prefer market-driven quality signals |
| Workforce development program | 5/10 | Support loan repayment for underserved areas; skeptical of accreditation mandates | Oppose federal interference in professional training standards |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mental Health Telehealth Permanence and Equity Act | 5/10 | Support core permanence provisions; oppose grant programs and FTC expansion | Overall spending level too high; prefer narrower bill focused on permanence and deregulation |
| Model State Telehealth Access Act | 7/10 | Support state-level action; prefer it to federal mandates | Prefer voluntary state action over federal conditions on block grants |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would prefer a narrower bill focused on: (1) permanent Medicare telehealth coverage with stricter utilization management to control costs; (2) voluntary interstate compact adoption without federal funding conditions; (3) DEA prescribing permanence with enhanced enforcement tools rather than new regulatory categories; and (4) market-based digital health quality through industry accreditation rather than FTC mandates.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (deregulation), Centrist (pragmatic permanence), Populist (rural access)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (shared interest in permanence if cost concerns addressed), Religious Right (rural community access)
- **Unlikely partners:** Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on federal spending scale), Progressive (disagreement on regulatory approach)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment between stated equity concerns and underlying commitment to access expansion. Occasional tension between supporting telehealth access and protecting provider labor interests (shorter sessions, lower overhead). |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent on access and equity. Support for regulation (FDA, FTC) aligns with broader regulatory philosophy. Some inconsistency when labor union concerns about telehealth platform working conditions conflict with access priorities. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable. Liberals have consistently supported telehealth permanence, audio-only coverage, and digital equity investment across multiple Congresses. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low. Liberals generally view telehealth reform as a shared benefit and are willing to negotiate on enforcement provisions. |

**Justification:** Liberal positions on telehealth are consistently grounded in access and equity principles. The minor consistency gap is between their support for telehealth access expansion and occasional concerns from allied labor organizations about telehealth platform working conditions and provider burnout.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Democrats have consistently co-sponsored the CONNECT for Health Act and Telehealth Modernization Act
- Center for American Progress has published analyses supporting permanent telehealth expansion with equity-focused investments (2024)
- Democratic caucus members have pushed for audio-only permanence and broadband investment as equity measures

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agree with the analysis of workforce shortages, regulatory barriers, and the digital divide as primary challenges |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree with the structural analysis of regulatory fragmentation and political economy; would emphasize private sector profit motives more strongly |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress, "Permanent Telehealth for Mental Health: An Equity Imperative," 2024
- Congressional Democrats' telehealth permanence coalition letters, 2023-2024

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage | 9/10 | Strongly support including audio-only permanence | Want to ensure equity provisions are robust, not watered down in negotiations |
| Interstate licensure compacts | 7/10 | Support compacts but want to preserve state consumer protection standards | Concerned about weakening state regulatory oversight |
| Permanent DEA prescribing framework | 7/10 | Support expanded access with reasonable safeguards | Want to ensure the framework does not disproportionately restrict prescribing for marginalized populations |
| FDA digital therapeutics framework | 8/10 | Strongly support FDA regulatory authority for digital health | Want rigorous clinical evidence requirements, not streamlined review that weakens standards |
| Broadband/digital equity grants | 10/10 | Enthusiastic support for federal equity investment | This is a priority; want larger funding levels if possible |
| Mental health app consumer protection | 9/10 | Strongly support FTC consumer protection for mental health apps | Want the strongest possible privacy protections for sensitive mental health data |
| Workforce development program | 9/10 | Strongly support loan repayment and training programs | Want to include community health worker and peer support specialist roles |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mental Health Telehealth Permanence and Equity Act | 8/10 | Support the comprehensive approach; would strengthen equity and consumer protection provisions | Funding levels for digital equity may be insufficient; want stronger privacy provisions |
| Model State Telehealth Access Act | 8/10 | Support state-level telehealth parity and compact adoption | Want to ensure state consumer protections are not weakened |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would enhance the proposed legislation with: (1) larger Digital Health Equity Grant Program ($200 million/year vs. $100 million); (2) comprehensive federal health data privacy legislation covering all entities, not just HIPAA-covered entities; (3) inclusion of community health workers and peer support specialists in the telehealth workforce program; and (4) requirements for cultural and linguistic competency in telehealth platforms.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (access and equity), Centrist (pragmatic permanence), Democratic Socialist (public investment)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (shared interest in permanence; negotiate on spending levels), Populist (rural access)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (fundamental disagreement on regulation), Constitutionalist (disagreement on federal authority)

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment between stated equity and access goals and underlying systemic reform agenda. May use telehealth reform as a vehicle for broader healthcare system change. |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent on structural analysis. Consistently frames telehealth within broader healthcare system failures. Some tension between supporting private telehealth platforms and preferring public alternatives. |
| Goalpost stability | Generally stable, though progressives may push for increasingly ambitious reforms (single-payer telehealth, public telehealth platforms) as momentum builds. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low to moderate. May oppose incremental reforms they view as insufficient, preferring to hold out for more comprehensive change. |

**Justification:** Progressives are principled advocates for access and equity, but may resist compromise proposals they view as inadequate. Their positions are internally consistent but may be strategically challenging for coalition-building if they insist on broader systemic reform as a condition of telehealth support.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus members have supported telehealth permanence while calling for broader Medicare expansion
- Sanders and Warren have introduced telehealth provisions within broader Medicare for All frameworks
- Progressive think tanks frame telehealth within the broader context of healthcare as a right

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Agree with the analysis; would emphasize corporate telehealth platform exploitation of workers and patients more strongly |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strongly agree with the structural and political economy analysis; would add insurance industry profit motives as a root cause |

**Source references:**

- Economic Policy Institute, "Telehealth Workers Deserve Fair Treatment," 2024
- Congressional Progressive Caucus healthcare platform, 2024

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage | 9/10 | Strongly support; want it as a step toward universal coverage | View as incomplete without broader Medicare/Medicaid expansion |
| Interstate licensure compacts | 6/10 | Support access goal but concerned about worker protections | Want to ensure compacts do not undermine labor standards or create race-to-the-bottom in provider compensation |
| Permanent DEA prescribing framework | 8/10 | Support expanding access to psychiatric medications | Want to ensure access benefits reach marginalized communities, not just commercially insured populations |
| FDA digital therapeutics framework | 7/10 | Support regulation; skeptical of precertification as industry-friendly | Want rigorous, independent clinical evidence standards rather than industry-influenced streamlined review |
| Broadband/digital equity grants | 10/10 | Strongly support; would increase funding | View broadband as a public utility; prefer public ownership of broadband infrastructure |
| Mental health app consumer protection | 9/10 | Strongly support; would go further with data ownership rights | Want users to own their mental health data with right to delete and port |
| Workforce development program | 8/10 | Support loan repayment and training; want fair labor standards | Want to include telehealth platform worker protections and minimum session lengths |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mental Health Telehealth Permanence and Equity Act | 7/10 | Support as a starting point; want stronger equity provisions and worker protections | Funding levels insufficient; no provisions for telehealth platform labor standards |
| Model State Telehealth Access Act | 7/10 | Support with stronger consumer protection and worker provisions | Want to include provisions against telehealth platform consolidation |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would expand the legislation to: (1) establish public telehealth infrastructure (government-provided telehealth platforms for Medicaid and uninsured populations); (2) regulate telehealth platform labor practices including minimum session lengths, caseload limits, and fair compensation; (3) treat broadband as a public utility; and (4) create a patient data ownership framework for all digital mental health tools.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (access and equity), Democratic Socialist (public investment and worker protections)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (anti-corporate platform regulation; rural access), Centrist (incremental progress on shared goals)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (fundamental disagreement on spending and regulation), Libertarian (opposing views on government role)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment. Libertarian positions on telehealth flow directly from core principles of individual liberty, minimal government, and free markets. |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent. Support for telehealth deregulation, opposition to licensure restrictions, and opposition to new federal programs all derive from the same limited-government framework. |
| Goalpost stability | Very stable. Libertarian positions on government regulation are highly predictable and do not shift with political dynamics. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low. Libertarians engage on principle rather than opposition dynamics. |

**Justification:** Libertarian positions on telehealth are the most principled and predictable of any perspective. They consistently support removing government barriers to telehealth (licensure, prescribing restrictions, Medicare rules) while opposing new government programs (grants, FTC mandates, FDA expansion). This makes them highly reliable partners on deregulation and highly predictable opponents of new programs.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute has consistently advocated for occupational licensing reform, including interstate telehealth practice (2023)
- Reason Foundation has published analyses supporting full telehealth deregulation and opposing FDA expansion into digital health (2024)
- Libertarian-leaning members of Congress have co-sponsored narrowly-focused telehealth deregulation bills

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree strongly that government regulation is the primary barrier; disagree with framing the digital divide as a government responsibility |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Strongly agree that state licensure, Ryan Haight Act, and Medicare restrictions are root causes; view the solution as deregulation, not new regulation |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute, "Occupational Licensing Reform: The Case for Interstate Telehealth," 2023
- Reason Foundation, "Let Markets Fix Telehealth," 2024

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage | 6/10 | Support removing restrictions but oppose payment parity mandates as price-fixing | Prefer market-determined reimbursement rates |
| Interstate licensure compacts | 7/10 | Support as preferable to current system; would prefer full national licensure or elimination of licensure requirements | Compacts are an improvement but still government-managed barriers to practice |
| Permanent DEA prescribing framework | 5/10 | Support ending Ryan Haight restrictions but oppose new DEA registration categories | Prefer eliminating DEA authority over prescribing decisions; view PDMP mandates as surveillance |
| FDA digital therapeutics framework | 3/10 | Oppose FDA expansion into software regulation | View FDA regulation as innovation-killing; prefer voluntary certification and market competition |
| Broadband/digital equity grants | 2/10 | Oppose new federal spending programs | Broadband should be deployed by private companies; government subsidies distort markets |
| Mental health app consumer protection | 2/10 | Oppose FTC mandates and app registration requirements | View as government overreach; consumers can choose apps based on reviews and reputation |
| Workforce development program | 3/10 | Oppose federal accreditation mandates; tolerate loan repayment as less intrusive than alternatives | Federal government should not dictate training program content |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mental Health Telehealth Permanence and Equity Act | 3/10 | Support deregulatory provisions (Sections 4-5); oppose all new programs and spending (Sections 6-10) | The bill creates more government than it removes; net increase in federal authority |
| Model State Telehealth Access Act | 5/10 | Support state-level reform over federal mandates; oppose new regulatory requirements | Prefer states to remove barriers rather than add new parity mandates |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would propose a narrow bill limited to: (1) repealing the Ryan Haight Act's in-person requirement entirely; (2) removing all Medicare geographic and site restrictions without new spending; (3) federal preemption of state licensure for all interstate telehealth; and (4) allowing the market to regulate mental health app quality through competition, reviews, and voluntary certification.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (deregulation), Constitutionalist (limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (anti-regulatory sentiment on specific issues)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (fundamental disagreement on government role), Liberal (disagreement on regulation), Democratic Socialist (opposing worldviews on public services)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Generally aligned. Federalism concerns about federal preemption of state licensure are principled, though sometimes used to protect state incumbent interests. |
| Principle consistency | Consistent on federalism and enumerated powers. Support for interstate compacts (which are explicitly authorized by the Constitution) demonstrates principled engagement. |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on constitutional questions. May shift on policy specifics when constitutional concerns are adequately addressed. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low. Constitutionalists engage on structural rather than partisan grounds. |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists bring a principled federalism analysis to telehealth that is generally consistent and predictable. Their primary concern is the proper allocation of authority between federal and state governments, which is a legitimate structural question for telehealth policy.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Federalist Society analyses have examined the constitutional basis for federal telehealth regulation (2023)
- Constitutionalist legislators have supported interstate compacts as constitutionally appropriate mechanisms for cross-border practice
- 10th Amendment arguments have been raised in state legislative debates over federal telehealth preemption

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agree on regulatory barriers but frame them as appropriate state sovereign decisions rather than problems to be federally overridden |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Disagree that state licensure is a "root cause" problem; view it as a feature of federalism. Agree that federal Medicare restrictions are problematic. |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society, "Federal Preemption and State Licensure: Constitutional Considerations for Telehealth," 2023
- Heritage Foundation legal analysis of Commerce Clause limits on telehealth regulation, 2024

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage | 6/10 | Support within Medicare's existing federal authority; oppose expanding Medicare's scope | Federal spending authority is legitimate here but should be narrowly exercised |
| Interstate licensure compacts | 9/10 | Strongly support as constitutionally appropriate (Art. I, Sec. 10 compact clause) | Interstate compacts are the constitutionally proper mechanism for cross-border professional practice |
| Permanent DEA prescribing framework | 5/10 | Accept federal authority under Commerce Clause for controlled substances; want narrowly tailored rules | Concerned about DEA regulatory overreach; prefer congressional rather than agency action |
| FDA digital therapeutics framework | 5/10 | Accept FDA authority over medical devices; question whether software should be classified as a device | Want clear statutory authorization, not agency self-expansion of jurisdiction |
| Broadband/digital equity grants | 4/10 | Question whether broadband is a federal responsibility under enumerated powers | Prefer private or state-level broadband deployment; Spending Clause authority exists but should be exercised cautiously |
| Mental health app consumer protection | 4/10 | Question FTC authority over health-related apps; prefer state consumer protection | FTC Act provides authority for deceptive practices, but preempting state standards is problematic |
| Workforce development program | 5/10 | Accept HRSA workforce programs as within federal authority; oppose accreditation mandates on states | Federal government can offer grants but should not dictate state training program requirements |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mental Health Telehealth Permanence and Equity Act | 5/10 | Support Medicare and DEA provisions on constitutional grounds; concerned about block grant conditions and federal preemption of state authority | Conditioning block grants on compact adoption may be coercive under NFIB v. Sebelius; 5% withholding is within Dole limits but still concerning |
| Model State Telehealth Access Act | 8/10 | Strongly support state-level action as the proper forum for licensure and insurance regulation | This is how federalism should work: states enacting reforms within their authority |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would prefer: (1) federal action limited to Medicare (clear federal authority) and controlled substances (Commerce Clause); (2) state-level action for licensure, insurance mandates, and consumer protection; (3) federal incentives for compacts rather than conditional block grant funding; and (4) clear statutory authorization for any FDA or FTC regulatory expansion, not agency self-assertion.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (limited government, federalism), Libertarian (limited federal authority)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (can support pragmatic reforms when constitutional concerns addressed), Religious Right (shared federalism values)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (fundamental disagreement on federal authority scope), Democratic Socialist (opposing views on government power)

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Mixed. Populist concern for rural access and working-class healthcare is genuine. Anti-corporate sentiment toward telehealth platforms may reflect broader anti-elite attitudes more than specific policy analysis. |
| Principle consistency | Some tension between supporting rural telehealth access (which requires technology platforms) and opposing corporate telehealth companies (which provide that access). |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate. Populist positions may shift depending on which elite actors are perceived to benefit from telehealth expansion. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate. Populists may oppose reforms if they perceive telehealth companies or coastal elites as primary beneficiaries. |

**Justification:** Populist engagement on telehealth is mixed because the issue activates competing populist impulses: genuine concern for rural and working-class access versus suspicion of Silicon Valley health tech companies and federal bureaucracies that manage expansion programs.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Populist-aligned legislators from rural districts have supported telehealth access while expressing concerns about corporate telehealth platforms
- Populist media coverage of the Cerebral and Done controversies emphasized corporate malfeasance
- Rural populist constituencies strongly support audio-only and broadband access provisions

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree on the severity of rural access problems and the digital divide; view the analysis as insufficiently critical of corporate telehealth platforms |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agree that government bureaucracy is a root cause; would add corporate consolidation and profit-seeking as primary causes |

**Source references:**

- American Conservative populist policy analyses on rural healthcare access, 2024
- National Rural Health Association advocacy aligned with populist rural-access priorities

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage | 8/10 | Strongly support for rural communities; want safeguards against corporate exploitation | Ensure rural communities actually benefit, not just corporate platforms |
| Interstate licensure compacts | 7/10 | Support as a way to get providers into underserved rural areas | Want to ensure rural areas are prioritized, not just interstate access for urban patients |
| Permanent DEA prescribing framework | 6/10 | Support expanding access; concerned about drug diversion in communities already affected by opioid crisis | Want strong anti-diversion safeguards; communities devastated by opioids are wary of loosening prescribing |
| FDA digital therapeutics framework | 5/10 | Skeptical; view FDA pathways as benefiting well-funded companies over small innovators | Concerned that regulatory frameworks favor big tech companies with resources to navigate FDA process |
| Broadband/digital equity grants | 9/10 | Strongly support broadband investment for rural and working-class communities | Priority issue; view broadband as critical infrastructure that government should ensure |
| Mental health app consumer protection | 7/10 | Support protecting consumers from exploitative tech companies | Populist appeal of protecting ordinary people from corporate data harvesting |
| Workforce development program | 7/10 | Support loan repayment for providers serving rural and underserved areas | Want to ensure providers actually go to and stay in rural communities, not just urban underserved areas |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mental Health Telehealth Permanence and Equity Act | 6/10 | Support access provisions; want stronger anti-corporate provisions and rural targeting | Bill does not do enough to prevent corporate telehealth consolidation or ensure rural benefit |
| Model State Telehealth Access Act | 7/10 | Support state-level action; want rural-specific provisions | Prefer locally controlled solutions over federal mandates |

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would add: (1) antitrust provisions preventing telehealth platform consolidation; (2) explicit rural targeting for all grant programs (minimum 50% of funding to rural communities); (3) enhanced anti-diversion provisions reflecting communities affected by the opioid crisis; and (4) provisions requiring telehealth companies to maintain human (non-AI) clinicians.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (rural access), Religious Right (rural community values)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (shared interest in access; negotiate on corporate regulation), Progressive (shared anti-corporate sentiment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (disagreement on regulation), Constitutionalist (less focused on rural populist priorities)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment. Centrist positions on telehealth are driven by pragmatic assessment of evidence and political feasibility, which is transparently their stated approach. |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent. Support for evidence-based, bipartisan, incremental reform applies uniformly across all dimensions of telehealth policy. |
| Goalpost stability | Very stable. Centrists have consistently supported the CONNECT for Health Act framework across multiple Congresses. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low. Centrists actively seek compromise and are willing to accept partial victories. |

**Justification:** Centrists are the most natural home for telehealth reform because the issue is inherently bipartisan, evidence-based, and amenable to incremental progress. Their positions are highly predictable and stable, making them reliable coalition partners.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center has published consistent recommendations for permanent telehealth expansion since 2021
- Centrist senators (e.g., bipartisan CONNECT for Health Act sponsors) have been the most active advocates for telehealth permanence
- Problem Solvers Caucus has endorsed telehealth permanence as a priority issue

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agree with evidence-based analysis of current conditions, utilization data, and regulatory barriers |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree with the structural analysis; would emphasize political dysfunction (failure to legislate permanently) as the most immediate cause |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center, "Charting a Path Forward for Telehealth Policy," 2024
- Brookings Institution, "The Future of Telemental Health: Policy Options for the Post-Pandemic Era," 2024

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage | 9/10 | Strongly support; this is the centrist priority for telehealth reform | Want to ensure CBO scoring is managed through appropriate offsets |
| Interstate licensure compacts | 9/10 | Strongly support compacts as pragmatic, state-led, bipartisan solutions | View compacts as the model for how federalism should work on healthcare |
| Permanent DEA prescribing framework | 8/10 | Support the tiered approach (180-day follow-up for Schedule II) as a reasonable balance | The proposed tiered framework addresses both access and safety concerns |
| FDA digital therapeutics framework | 8/10 | Support tiered regulation as proportionate and evidence-based | Want to ensure the framework is practically implementable and does not stall innovation |
| Broadband/digital equity grants | 7/10 | Support targeted investment; want to leverage existing programs (BEAD) rather than duplicate | Prefer efficient use of existing broadband funding over new stand-alone programs |
| Mental health app consumer protection | 7/10 | Support reasonable consumer protection; want to avoid overregulation | Want disclosure and transparency requirements, not heavy-handed mandates |
| Workforce development program | 8/10 | Support evidence-based workforce investments | Loan repayment programs have demonstrated effectiveness in similar contexts |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mental Health Telehealth Permanence and Equity Act | 8/10 | Support the comprehensive approach; want to ensure bipartisan feasibility and fiscal responsibility | Spending levels may need adjustment to secure bipartisan votes; block grant conditions may be politically problematic |
| Model State Telehealth Access Act | 8/10 | Support as complementary state-level action | Good model for bipartisan state legislation |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists are closest to the proposed legislation and would make targeted adjustments: (1) reduce the block grant conditioning provision from 5% to 2% to reduce state resistance; (2) phase the digital equity grant program to start smaller and scale based on demonstrated results; (3) include explicit CBO offset provisions (e.g., reduced Medicare ED payments as telehealth reduces avoidable emergency visits).

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (access), Conservative (permanence and deregulation), Populist (rural access)
- **Potential bridges:** Constitutionalist (address federalism concerns), Libertarian (emphasize deregulatory provisions), Religious Right (rural community access)
- **Unlikely partners:** None with respect to core provisions; centrists can build bridges to most perspectives on this issue

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concerns about family values and pastoral care are genuine. Telehealth is not a primary priority, so positions may reflect broader coalition dynamics rather than deep engagement. |
| Principle consistency | Mixed. Support for rural access aligns with constituency service; concerns about digital therapy replacing in-person pastoral and community-based care reflect genuine values. Privacy concerns about mental health data align with broader Religious Right skepticism of government surveillance. |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate. Positions on telehealth may shift based on how the issue is framed (access for rural congregations vs. technology replacing community bonds). |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low to moderate. Religious Right does not strongly oppose telehealth reform but may use it as a bargaining chip for other priorities. |

**Justification:** The Religious Right has limited institutional engagement with telehealth as a policy issue. Their positions are genuine when they engage but are not deeply developed, making them a potential swing constituency that could be brought into a coalition with appropriate framing.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Faith-based organizations in rural areas have supported telehealth as a way to address mental health access for congregants
- Family Research Council has not taken a strong position on telehealth specifically
- Some Religious Right figures express concern about digital therapy replacing community-based pastoral counseling

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agree on rural access problems; less engaged with technical regulatory analysis; concerned about the secularization of mental health care through technology |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agree that regulatory barriers limit access; would add cultural factors (decline of community and faith institutions) as root causes of the mental health crisis |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage | 7/10 | Support for rural congregants; want to ensure faith-based counselors can participate | Want religious counselors included in telehealth coverage where they meet clinical standards |
| Interstate licensure compacts | 6/10 | Support for expanding provider access to rural communities | Want to ensure faith-based practitioners are not excluded from compacts |
| Permanent DEA prescribing framework | 5/10 | Cautious support; concerned about over-reliance on medication over faith-based and community approaches | Prefer counseling-first approaches; concerned about psychiatric overmedication |
| FDA digital therapeutics framework | 5/10 | Neutral; low engagement with regulatory detail | Want to ensure digital therapeutic content is not hostile to religious values |
| Broadband/digital equity grants | 7/10 | Support for rural and underserved communities including faith-based organizations | Want faith-based organizations eligible for grants |
| Mental health app consumer protection | 6/10 | Support protecting families from harmful or exploitative apps | Want to ensure mental health apps for minors have parental consent requirements |
| Workforce development program | 6/10 | Support loan repayment for providers in rural areas | Want faith-friendly training and cultural competency provisions |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mental Health Telehealth Permanence and Equity Act | 6/10 | Generally supportive of access provisions; want faith-friendly amendments | Want explicit protection for faith-based counseling providers; parental consent for minors' telehealth |
| Model State Telehealth Access Act | 7/10 | Support state-level action with local community input | Prefer state-level solutions that can reflect community values |

#### Alternative Proposals

The Religious Right would add: (1) explicit eligibility of faith-based counseling providers for telehealth coverage where they hold recognized credentials; (2) parental consent requirements for minors accessing telehealth mental health services; (3) conscience protections for providers who decline to provide certain services via telehealth on religious grounds; and (4) provisions encouraging community-based mental health support alongside telehealth.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (limited government, rural access), Populist (rural community values)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (pragmatic reform with faith-friendly provisions), Liberal (shared interest in access if faith concerns respected)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (disagreement on faith-based provider role), Democratic Socialist (secular orientation)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Strong alignment. Democratic Socialist positions on telehealth flow from core beliefs about healthcare as a public good and opposition to for-profit healthcare delivery. |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent. Support for public investment, universal access, and worker protections applies uniformly. Tension between supporting telehealth access and opposing for-profit telehealth platforms is acknowledged and principled. |
| Goalpost stability | Moderately stable. May increase demands as reforms advance, pushing for public alternatives to private telehealth platforms. |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low to moderate. May oppose reforms that primarily benefit private telehealth companies, even if patients also benefit. |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists bring a consistent structural critique to telehealth, viewing it through the lens of healthcare as a public good. Their positions are principled and predictable but may create friction with market-oriented approaches that dominate the current reform landscape.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- DSA healthcare platform advocates for publicly provided telehealth services as part of Medicare for All
- Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have supported telehealth access provisions while criticizing for-profit telehealth companies
- Jacobin and Current Affairs have published analyses framing telehealth within the broader for-profit healthcare critique

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree strongly with the analysis of access barriers and the digital divide; would emphasize for-profit motives as more central to the problem |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Strongly agree with structural analysis; would add the for-profit healthcare system itself as the ultimate root cause |

**Source references:**

- Democratic Socialists of America, Healthcare Platform, 2024
- Jacobin, "The Problem with For-Profit Telehealth," 2023

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage | 8/10 | Strongly support as step toward universal coverage; want it extended to all Americans, not just Medicare beneficiaries | View as incomplete within a fragmented insurance system |
| Interstate licensure compacts | 5/10 | Support access goal but concerned about weakening state-level worker protections and enabling corporate labor arbitrage | Want strong labor standards integrated into compact frameworks |
| Permanent DEA prescribing framework | 8/10 | Support expanding access to psychiatric medications for all | Want to ensure medication access is not limited by insurance status |
| FDA digital therapeutics framework | 6/10 | Support regulation; prefer public rather than commercial digital therapeutics | Want publicly funded alternatives to for-profit digital therapeutics; concerned about pharma-like pricing |
| Broadband/digital equity grants | 10/10 | Strongly support; view broadband as a public utility that should be publicly owned | Would go further: public broadband infrastructure, not subsidies to private ISPs |
| Mental health app consumer protection | 8/10 | Strongly support; want user data ownership and prohibition on data monetization | View data harvesting by mental health apps as exploitation; want comprehensive data rights |
| Workforce development program | 9/10 | Strongly support public investment in mental health workforce | Want to include community health workers, peer support specialists, and fair compensation standards |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Mental Health Telehealth Permanence and Equity Act | 7/10 | Support access and equity provisions; want stronger labor and public-option provisions | Bill relies on private sector delivery without public alternatives; insufficient worker protections |
| Model State Telehealth Access Act | 6/10 | Support state-level parity but want public telehealth infrastructure | State model does not address the fundamental problem of for-profit healthcare delivery |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic Socialists would transform the legislation by: (1) establishing a publicly operated telehealth platform for Medicaid, Medicare, and uninsured populations; (2) extending telehealth coverage to all Americans as part of Medicare for All; (3) requiring telehealth platforms to meet minimum labor standards (fair pay, caseload limits, benefits for clinicians); (4) publicly funding digital therapeutic development rather than relying on private companies; and (5) treating broadband as a public utility with public ownership.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (structural reform, worker protections), Liberal (access and equity)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (anti-corporate provisions, rural access), Centrist (pragmatic overlap on access goals)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (fundamental disagreement on government role), Libertarian (opposing worldviews), Constitutionalist (disagreement on federal authority)

### Common Ground Synthesis

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Permanent Medicare telehealth | Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist (9/9) | | |
| Interstate licensure compacts | Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right (8/9) | Democratic Socialist (1/9) | |
| DEA prescribing framework | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist, Conservative, Populist (6/9) | Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Religious Right (3/9) | |
| Broadband/digital equity | Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist (6/9) | Conservative, Constitutionalist (2/9) | Libertarian (1/9) |
| App consumer protection | Liberal, Progressive, Populist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist (5/9) | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Religious Right (3/9) | Libertarian (1/9) |

**Key insight:** Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage has near-universal support across the political spectrum (9/9 perspectives at score 5+), making it the most viable legislative priority. Interstate licensure compacts also enjoy very broad support (8/9). The most politically contentious elements are broadband spending programs and consumer protection mandates, where Libertarian and some Conservative perspectives offer structural opposition. The legislative strategy should lead with permanence provisions (broadest coalition) and negotiate equity and regulatory provisions separately if a single comprehensive bill proves infeasible.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Clean Permanence Act

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist + Religious Right + Libertarian (partial)

**Core Agreement:** Ending the annual cycle of temporary telehealth extensions is in everyone's interest. No perspective benefits from policy uncertainty.

**Policy Description:**

A narrow bill focused exclusively on making Medicare telehealth behavioral health coverage permanent, including audio-only coverage with clinical appropriateness guidelines, and establishing a permanent DEA telehealth prescribing framework with the tiered Schedule II/III-V approach. No new spending programs, no new regulatory authorities, no block grant conditions.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | No new spending; pure deregulation and permanence; CBO score limited to Medicare coverage changes |
| Liberal | Permanent access including audio-only for underserved populations; ends annual uncertainty |
| Centrist | Bipartisan, evidence-based, achievable in current Congress |
| Populist | Secures telehealth access for rural communities permanently |
| Libertarian | Removes government barriers (partial); no new programs |
| Constitutionalist | Acts within clear federal Medicare and Commerce Clause authority |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Digital equity investment and consumer protection (deferred to separate legislation) |
| Progressive | Structural reforms, worker protections, and public telehealth platform |
| Democratic Socialist | Public option and labor standards (deferred) |
| Libertarian | Would prefer broader deregulation (full Ryan Haight repeal) |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives (all except Progressive and Democratic Socialist, who may support but view as insufficient)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 6/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High. Permanence is a shared, stable priority.
- **Implementation Path:** Attach to annual appropriations or healthcare reconciliation; bipartisan co-sponsorship already exists for similar bills

---

### Compromise 2: Permanence Plus Rural Equity Package

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Progressive + Populist + Centrist + Religious Right + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Telehealth access means nothing without broadband access. Rural America should not be left behind by the digital health transformation.

**Policy Description:**

Combines permanent Medicare telehealth coverage and DEA prescribing framework (from Compromise 1) with targeted broadband and digital equity investment for Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas. Fund the HHS Digital Health Equity Grant Program at $75 million/year (lower than the proposed $100 million to accommodate fiscal concerns) with explicit rural targeting (60% of funds to rural HPSAs). Include interstate compact incentive grants at $150 million total (reduced from $250 million).

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Targeted spending (rural HPSAs, not universal); below original cost; supports rural constituents |
| Liberal | Equity investment addresses digital divide; audio-only permanence protects underserved populations |
| Progressive | Broadband and device access for underserved communities; step toward universal digital access |
| Populist | Explicit rural targeting ensures working-class communities benefit |
| Centrist | Evidence-based investment at fiscally responsible levels |
| Religious Right | Rural community access including faith-based organizations eligible for grants |
| Democratic Socialist | Public investment in digital infrastructure, even if less than desired |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts new federal spending (targeted and moderate) |
| Libertarian | Unlikely to support any new spending program |
| Progressive | Accepts reduced funding levels and no public broadband utility provision |
| Democratic Socialist | Accepts market-based broadband with subsidies rather than public ownership |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts federal spending on broadband as within Spending Clause authority |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives (Libertarian and Constitutionalist partial or opposed)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Moderate to high. Rural access is a durable bipartisan priority. Spending levels are modest enough to avoid major fiscal opposition.
- **Implementation Path:** Stand-alone bipartisan bill or attachment to BEAD Program reauthorization; rural framing appeals to Senate rural-state caucus

---

### Compromise 3: Access and Accountability Framework

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Religious Right + Populist

**Core Agreement:** Telehealth access must be accompanied by accountability--for providers, for platforms, and for app developers. Consumers deserve transparency without heavy-handed regulation.

**Policy Description:**

Combines permanent telehealth coverage with a transparency-focused (rather than mandate-heavy) approach to digital mental health oversight. Instead of FTC registration requirements and mandatory privacy standards, establish a voluntary certification program administered by a public-private partnership (modeled on HITRUST for health IT). Apps that achieve certification receive a "Certified Mental Health App" label. Require the FDA to establish clear guidance distinguishing wellness apps from clinical tools, but do not create new FDA review pathways for low-risk products. Include parental consent requirements for minors' telehealth mental health services.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Voluntary certification rather than mandates; market-driven quality through certification |
| Liberal | Transparency for consumers; certification provides a meaningful quality signal |
| Centrist | Pragmatic middle ground between no regulation and heavy mandates |
| Constitutionalist | No new federal regulatory authority; public-private partnership model |
| Religious Right | Parental consent for minors; faith-friendly certification criteria |
| Populist | Protects consumers from exploitative apps without expanding government bureaucracy |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Mandatory privacy standards (replaced with voluntary certification) |
| Progressive | Comprehensive data ownership rights and FTC enforcement authority |
| Democratic Socialist | Government-mandated standards and enforcement |
| Libertarian | May oppose any government involvement in app quality, even voluntary |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Moderate. Voluntary certification may be less durable than mandatory standards if high-profile privacy breaches occur. Certification program must be credibly independent.
- **Implementation Path:** Can be combined with Compromise 1 as a single legislative package; voluntary approach reduces political opposition and CBO scoring impact

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable coalition for telehealth reform centers on the **Conservative-Liberal-Centrist-Populist** axis, with Religious Right as a swing vote. This coalition has the broadest overlap on the core permanence provisions and sufficient common ground on targeted rural equity investment to support a Permanence Plus Rural Equity package (Compromise 2). The coalition includes members with high engagement consistency (Conservative 4/5, Liberal 4/5, Centrist 5/5), making it a reliable negotiating partnership.

### Key Obstacles

The primary obstacles to comprehensive reform are: (1) **CBO scoring** of permanent Medicare telehealth expansion, which may require offsets that reduce political appeal; (2) **DEA institutional resistance** to finalizing permanent prescribing rules, which may require congressional oversight pressure; and (3) **Libertarian opposition** to any new federal programs, which limits the coalition on equity provisions but does not block it, as Libertarians are not a large enough bloc to prevent passage.

### Low Consistency Partners

The two perspectives with mixed consistency (Populist 3/5, Religious Right 3/5) are both potentially supportive but require careful coalition management. Populists should be engaged through explicit rural targeting and anti-corporate provisions. The Religious Right should be engaged through parental consent provisions and eligibility of faith-based organizations for digital equity grants. Neither perspective is likely to actively oppose reform, but both may disengage if their specific concerns are not addressed.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with permanence**: Introduce a narrow Clean Permanence Act (Compromise 1) as the legislative priority. This has the broadest coalition (7+/9 perspectives) and the most established bipartisan support.
2. **Pair with rural equity**: Attach targeted broadband and digital equity provisions (Compromise 2) to build rural-state support and address the digital divide without the political baggage of a comprehensive spending bill.
3. **Separate the regulatory debate**: Pursue digital mental health app regulation and FDA framework reform as separate legislation or agency guidance, where it can be developed without delaying the permanence provisions.
4. **Engage the DEA through congressional pressure**: Use the legislative process to set firm deadlines for DEA rulemaking, with a fallback provision that allows prescribing under the permanent framework if the DEA misses its deadline.
