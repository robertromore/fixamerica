# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to permanently expand mental health telehealth face resistance from those who believe that remote care, loosened prescribing rules, and unregulated digital tools compromise patient safety, enable fraud, and undermine the clinical relationship that is the foundation of mental health treatment.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) | Prevent controlled substance diversion; maintain enforcement authority over prescribing | Federal law enforcement authority; rulemaking power under Controlled Substances Act | Delayed rulemaking, proposed restrictive prescribing rules, public warnings about telehealth-facilitated diversion |
| Some state medical/licensing boards | Preserve state-level regulatory authority, licensing fee revenue, and consumer protection jurisdiction | State regulatory authority; influence over professional standards | Oppose PSYPACT expansion in holdout states, resist national licensure, require in-state supervision |
| Hospital and health system associations | Protect facility-based care revenue, facility fee billing, and physical infrastructure investments | Large lobbying budgets (AHA: ~$29 million in federal lobbying, 2023) | Advocate for originating-site requirements that keep telehealth within facilities, oppose home-based telehealth expansion |
| MedPAC (Medicare Payment Advisory Commission) | Control Medicare spending growth; ensure value for taxpayer money | Advisory influence on Congress; produces annual recommendations | Recommended against permanent audio-only coverage; raised concerns about telehealth overutilization |
| Some professional societies (selective opposition) | Protect in-person practice models; ensure clinical quality standards | Professional influence, testimony, and position statements | Advocate for in-person visit requirements, express concerns about "lower standard" of telehealth care |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Law enforcement and drug policy conservatives**: View telehealth prescribing flexibilities as creating new pathways for controlled substance diversion. Point to the Cerebral and Done investigations as evidence that telehealth platforms incentivize overprescribing. Favor strict in-person requirements for Schedule II substances.
- **Fiscal conservatives**: Worry that permanent Medicare telehealth expansion will increase utilization and spending, as telehealth makes it easier for more people to access care. CBO has scored permanent telehealth expansion as increasing Medicare spending by $2-4 billion per year (CBO, 2024).
- **Patient safety purists**: Believe that meaningful psychiatric assessment requires in-person contact, physical examination, and observation of nonverbal cues that are degraded or lost in video and especially audio-only encounters. Argue that telehealth is a compromise accepted during an emergency, not a permanent standard.
- **Privacy advocates (selective opposition)**: Support telehealth in principle but oppose the current regulatory framework because it allows mental health apps and platforms to collect and share sensitive mental health data without adequate HIPAA-equivalent protections. Advocate for stronger regulation before expansion.

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: Telehealth Facilitates Controlled Substance Diversion

**Claim**: Removing the in-person examination requirement for controlled substance prescribing creates new opportunities for drug diversion. Telehealth-only evaluations are too brief and superficial to properly diagnose conditions requiring controlled substances, and online platforms incentivize overprescribing to maximize revenue.

**Evidence Cited**: The DOJ investigation of Cerebral found that the company's clinicians prescribed controlled substances to over 100,000 patients, with some evaluations lasting as little as 10 minutes. The DEA reported a 30% increase in suspicious online prescribing activity for Schedule II stimulants between 2020 and 2023 (DEA, 2024). Done Health's founder was indicted in 2024 on fraud and drug distribution charges.

**Reality**: The Cerebral and Done cases involved specific business practices (pressuring clinicians to prescribe, inadequate clinical oversight) that are enforcement problems, not inherent telehealth problems. The same practices would be problematic in an in-person setting. The vast majority of telehealth prescribing is conducted by established psychiatric practices and health systems following standard clinical protocols. A 2024 JAMA study found no statistically significant difference in the rate of inappropriate prescribing between telehealth and in-person psychiatry visits when controlling for provider type and practice setting (Marcus et al., JAMA Psychiatry, 2024).

**Rebuttal**: The appropriate response to bad actors is targeted enforcement against fraudulent practices, not blanket restrictions that prevent millions of patients from accessing legitimate care. The DEA already has tools to identify and shut down problematic prescribers through prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) and suspicious order monitoring. A permanent telehealth prescribing framework should include robust monitoring requirements rather than in-person visit mandates.

### Argument 2: Audio-Only Visits Are Clinically Inferior

**Claim**: Audio-only telephone visits for mental health lack the visual cues necessary for proper psychiatric assessment. Clinicians cannot observe affect, psychomotor changes, hygiene, or signs of substance intoxication over the phone. Covering audio-only visits at the same rate as video or in-person visits is paying for a lower standard of care.

**Evidence Cited**: MedPAC's March 2024 report recommended that Congress not permanently extend Medicare coverage of audio-only telehealth for behavioral health, noting that "audio-only visits provide less clinical information than video or in-person encounters." Some psychiatric assessments, particularly initial evaluations and medication management for psychotic disorders, rely heavily on visual observation.

**Reality**: The evidence base for audio-only mental health care is thinner than for video, but emerging research shows positive outcomes for several conditions. A 2023 study in Psychiatric Services found that audio-only follow-up visits for depression management produced comparable PHQ-9 score improvements to video visits over 12 weeks (Connolly et al., Psychiatric Services, 2023). More importantly, for many underserved populations--the elderly, rural residents without broadband, people on tribal lands--audio-only is the only telehealth option. Eliminating audio-only coverage would disproportionately harm the populations with the greatest mental health access needs.

**Rebuttal**: The question is not whether audio-only is equivalent to video in all circumstances--it is not. The question is whether audio-only is better than no care at all, which is the realistic alternative for millions of Americans. A tiered approach that covers audio-only for established patients, follow-up visits, and crisis services while requiring video or in-person for initial evaluations and complex medication management addresses both quality and access concerns.

### Argument 3: Telehealth Will Increase Medicare Spending

**Claim**: Making telehealth flexibilities permanent will increase total Medicare spending because telehealth makes it easier to access care, generating new utilization rather than substituting for in-person visits. Payment parity means Medicare pays the same amount for a visit that may be shorter, less complex, and conducted at lower overhead.

**Evidence Cited**: CBO has scored permanent Medicare telehealth extension at an estimated additional cost of $2-4 billion per year over 10 years. A 2023 Health Affairs study found that in the first year after telehealth expansion, total behavioral health utilization (telehealth + in-person) increased by 15% among Medicare beneficiaries, suggesting that some telehealth visits were additive rather than substitutive (Mehrotra et al., Health Affairs, 2023).

**Reality**: Increased utilization in a population with massive unmet mental health needs is not waste--it is the system working as intended. The 57.8 million Americans with mental illness include millions who were not receiving any care before telehealth expanded access (SAMHSA, 2023). Whether the additional spending represents good value depends on whether these new visits improve outcomes and reduce downstream costs (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, disability, criminal justice involvement). Early evidence suggests that telehealth-facilitated buprenorphine treatment reduces opioid overdose deaths and emergency department utilization (Huskamp et al., JAMA, 2023).

**Rebuttal**: The appropriate policy response to cost concerns is not to restrict access but to implement evidence-based utilization management, require outcome measurement, and study whether telehealth-generated utilization is clinically appropriate. Medicare already employs extensive utilization review mechanisms that can be applied to telehealth services.

### Argument 4: Interstate Licensure Compacts Undermine State Consumer Protection

**Claim**: Licensure compacts like PSYPACT allow out-of-state providers to practice in a state without meeting that state's specific training, examination, or supervision requirements. State licensing boards exist to protect consumers, and bypassing them through interstate compacts weakens oversight and accountability.

**Evidence Cited**: Holdout states point to differences in training requirements, scope-of-practice boundaries, and disciplinary procedures across states. Some states require additional supervised hours, specific examinations, or cultural competency training that compact participants may not have completed.

**Reality**: PSYPACT does not eliminate licensure requirements; it creates a mutual recognition framework. Participating psychologists must hold an active license in their home state, have a doctoral degree, pass the EPPP examination, and have no disciplinary actions. The compact includes reciprocal discipline provisions, so a complaint filed in any participating state triggers investigation. The PSYPACT Commission maintains a shared disciplinary database.

**Rebuttal**: The current system, in which a psychologist must obtain and maintain separate licenses in every state where they have patients, is not a consumer protection measure--it is an administrative barrier that restricts access. Compact membership should be expanded, not restricted, and states should work to harmonize training standards rather than using state-specific requirements as barriers to interstate practice.

### Argument 5: Mental Health Apps Are Unregulated and Potentially Harmful

**Claim**: The mental health app market is a "Wild West" where thousands of apps make wellness or therapeutic claims without any evidence, clinical oversight, or regulatory review. Some apps may provide harmful advice, fail to recognize crisis situations, or collect and sell sensitive mental health data.

**Evidence Cited**: A 2023 Mozilla Foundation study rated 32 of 37 popular mental health apps as failing to meet minimum privacy standards. The APA App Advisor review found that fewer than 5% of popular mental health apps had published peer-reviewed evidence. The FTC's $7.8 million settlement with BetterHelp (2023) for sharing user therapy data with advertisers illustrated the privacy risks.

**Reality**: These concerns are legitimate. The mental health app market does have significant quality and privacy problems. However, the solution is not to restrict telehealth expansion broadly but to establish a regulatory framework specifically for digital mental health tools. The FDA, FTC, and HHS can collaborate to create tiered oversight that distinguishes between general wellness apps, clinical decision support tools, and prescription digital therapeutics.

**Rebuttal**: The current regulatory gap is real and should be addressed through FDA guidance, FTC enforcement, and potentially new legislation requiring minimum evidence and privacy standards for apps that claim to treat mental health conditions. This is a separate issue from whether telehealth visits with licensed providers should be permanently covered.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

Opposition to mental health telehealth expansion follows patterns that are common across healthcare reform:

- **Incumbency protection disguised as quality concern**: Health systems and some provider groups oppose telehealth expansion in ways that happen to protect their revenue and competitive position, framing these financial interests as patient safety concerns.
- **Enforcement orientation over access orientation**: The DEA has consistently approached telehealth prescribing through a diversion-prevention lens rather than an access-expansion lens. Every proposed rule has started from the premise of "how do we prevent misuse" rather than "how do we maximize appropriate access."
- **Perfect-as-enemy-of-good**: Opponents of audio-only coverage and permanent telehealth expansion implicitly compare telehealth to a fully-resourced in-person visit, when the realistic alternative for many patients is no visit at all.

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Build the rural bipartisan coalition**: Mental health telehealth has natural bipartisan appeal because it addresses rural access, a priority for Republican legislators representing rural districts, while also advancing equity, a priority for Democratic legislators. Every rural-state senator is a potential ally.
- **Frame telehealth permanence as pro-military**: The VA's telemental health program is the nation's largest and most successful. Framing permanent telehealth expansion as extending the VA model to all Americans leverages bipartisan support for veterans.
- **Use the opioid crisis**: Telehealth buprenorphine prescribing was already made permanent in 2023, demonstrating congressional willingness to act when the access need is urgent and visible. Frame other telehealth flexibilities as extending the same logic.

### Communication Strategies

- **Lead with patient stories**: The most effective advocacy for telehealth permanence is the testimony of patients who would lose access to care if flexibilities expire. NAMI and MHA should organize patient advocacy campaigns timed to each congressional extension deadline.
- **Reframe "new utilization" as "unmet need being met"**: Counter the CBO scoring concern by reframing increased telehealth utilization as millions of untreated Americans finally receiving care, not as wasteful spending.
- **Distinguish between platform problems and telehealth problems**: When opponents cite the Cerebral investigation, respond by distinguishing between a business model problem (pressured prescribing) and a modality problem (telehealth). The solution is better business regulation, not less telehealth.

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Tiered audio-only framework**: Design a policy that covers audio-only for established patients, follow-up visits, and crisis services, while requiring video or in-person for initial diagnostic evaluations and complex medication management. This splits the opposition by addressing quality concerns while preserving access.
- **Robust monitoring in exchange for flexibility**: Offer enhanced prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) requirements and mandatory outcome reporting in exchange for permanent telehealth prescribing authority. This gives the DEA the monitoring tools it wants while removing the in-person barrier.
- **Separate the app regulation debate from the telehealth coverage debate**: Do not allow legitimate concerns about unregulated apps to delay action on permanent coverage of telehealth visits with licensed providers. Address them through separate legislation or FDA guidance.
