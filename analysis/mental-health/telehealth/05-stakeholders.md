# Telehealth and Digital Mental Health: Stakeholders

The mental health telehealth landscape is shaped by the interactions of patients seeking care, providers delivering it, regulators controlling it, payers financing it, and technology companies building the platforms and tools that make it possible. Each group has distinct interests that frequently conflict.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Adults with mental health conditions | Telehealth is primary or sole access pathway for many; telehealth policy determines whether, how, and at what cost they receive care | 57.8 million adults with any mental illness (SAMHSA, 2023) | Reliable access, affordable care, privacy, continuity of provider relationships across moves |
| People in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas | Telehealth is often the only viable path to a psychiatrist or psychologist | 160 million+ in HPSAs (HRSA, 2024) | Broadband access, audio-only availability, interstate provider access |
| People with substance use disorders | Telehealth is critical for buprenorphine access and counseling continuity | 46.3 million with SUD (SAMHSA, 2023) | Permanent Ryan Haight waiver for buprenorphine, telehealth counseling coverage |
| Children and adolescents with mental health needs | Pediatric mental health crisis has intensified demand; school-based telehealth is a key delivery mechanism | 7.7 million children with anxiety/depression (CDC, 2023) | School-based access, parental consent frameworks, age-appropriate digital tools |
| Veterans | VA telemental health is the largest system in the country; policy changes affect millions of veterans | 1.7 million veterans using VA telemental health (VA, 2024) | Continued VA telehealth expansion, community care integration |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Family members and caregivers**: Family-based therapy, caregiver support groups, and psychoeducation are increasingly delivered via telehealth. Caregivers of people with severe mental illness depend on telehealth for their own mental health support.
- **Employers**: Employer-sponsored mental health benefits increasingly include telehealth platforms (e.g., Lyra Health, Spring Health). Employers want effective, cost-efficient mental health services to reduce absenteeism and turnover.
- **Criminal justice system**: Courts, jails, and probation departments increasingly use telehealth for mandated mental health and substance use treatment. Disruptions in telehealth policy affect diversion and reentry programs.
- **Schools and universities**: K-12 schools and higher education institutions are major delivery sites for telehealth mental health services, particularly in rural areas. School-based telehealth programs serve approximately 2 million students annually (Rural Health Information Hub, 2024).

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Congress (Senate HELP Committee, House Energy and Commerce) | Legislates Medicare telehealth coverage, broadband policy, FDA authority | Statutory authority over Medicare, Medicaid, controlled substances, FDA | Full legislative power; CBO scoring constraints | High |
| CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) | Sets Medicare telehealth coverage rules, reimbursement rates, and conditions of participation | Regulatory authority under Social Security Act | $1.5 trillion annual Medicare/Medicaid spending | High |
| DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) | Regulates controlled substance prescribing via telehealth under Ryan Haight Act | Enforcement and rulemaking authority under Controlled Substances Act | Federal law enforcement resources | High |
| FDA (Food and Drug Administration) | Regulates digital therapeutics, mental health apps that make clinical claims, and AI-based tools | Regulatory authority under Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act | Digital Health Center of Excellence (est. 2020) | Medium-High |
| FCC (Federal Communications Commission) | Regulates broadband deployment, USF programs, Connected Care Pilot | Broadband infrastructure and subsidy authority | $8.25 billion annual Universal Service Fund | Medium |
| State licensing boards | Issue and regulate professional licenses for mental health providers | State licensure authority | Independent revenue from licensing fees | Medium-High (collectively) |
| State Medicaid agencies | Determine Medicaid telehealth coverage and reimbursement in each state | State regulatory authority | State Medicaid budgets | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: Represents 38,000+ psychiatrists. Supports permanent telehealth expansion with appropriate safeguards. Develops telepsychiatry practice guidelines and the App Advisor evaluation framework. Influential in DEA and CMS rulemaking.
- **American Psychological Association (APA)**: Represents 146,000+ psychologists. Strong supporter of PSYPACT expansion. Advocates for permanent telehealth coverage including audio-only services.
- **National Council for Mental Wellbeing**: Represents 3,300+ community mental health organizations. Advocates for Medicaid telehealth coverage, broadband access, and workforce support for telehealth adoption.
- **American Telemedicine Association (ATA)**: The leading telehealth industry association. Lobbies for permanent federal telehealth legislation, payment parity, and reduced regulatory barriers. Annual lobbying expenditure approximately $1.2 million (OpenSecrets, 2024).
- **PSYPACT Commission**: Administers the Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact. Facilitates interstate telepsychology practice for psychologists in 42 states plus DC.
- **Digital Therapeutics Alliance (DTA)**: Industry association for prescription digital therapeutics companies. Advocates for FDA regulatory pathways, CPT codes, and payer reimbursement for digital therapeutics.

### Influencers

- **Telehealth platform companies (BetterHelp/Teladoc, Talkspace, Cerebral)**: Large commercial telehealth companies that deliver millions of mental health visits annually. They have strong financial incentives to expand telehealth access and reduce regulatory barriers. Teladoc reported 18.5 million total visits in 2023, with behavioral health as its largest category (Teladoc, 2024 10-K).
- **Venture capital and health tech investors**: Have invested billions in mental health technology companies. The mental health tech market attracted $5.1 billion in venture investment in 2021, declining to $2.4 billion in 2023 as the market matured (Rock Health, 2024). Investor interests favor minimal regulation and maximum market expansion.
- **Patient advocacy organizations (NAMI, MHA)**: The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and Mental Health America (MHA) represent millions of patients and families. They advocate for access expansion, including telehealth, and are key voices in the audio-only and digital divide debates.
- **Rural health advocacy groups**: The National Rural Health Association and State Offices of Rural Health advocate for telehealth as the primary solution to rural mental health access. They are the strongest advocates for audio-only coverage and broadband investment.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Patient groups + providers + telehealth companies | Permanent Medicare telehealth coverage | Strong |
| Rural health groups + patient advocates + FCC | Broadband expansion and digital equity | Strong |
| DEA + medical boards + quality advocates | Appropriate safeguards for controlled substance prescribing | Moderate |
| PSYPACT + professional associations + state legislators | Interstate licensure compact expansion | Strong |
| FDA + digital therapeutics industry + researchers | Clear regulatory pathway for digital therapeutics | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Access vs. enforcement**: Patient groups and telehealth companies want the broadest possible telehealth prescribing authority, while the DEA and some medical boards want in-person requirements to prevent diversion and ensure quality.
- **Innovation vs. consumer protection**: Technology companies and investors want minimal FDA regulation of mental health apps to preserve innovation speed, while patient advocates and the APA want stronger oversight to protect consumers from unvalidated products.
- **State autonomy vs. national access**: State licensing boards want to maintain their authority and revenue, while providers and patients want seamless interstate access through national compacts or federal preemption.
- **Cost control vs. access expansion**: CMS and CBO are concerned that permanent telehealth expansion will increase Medicare spending through new utilization, while providers and patients argue that telehealth substitutes for (and is often cheaper than) in-person care.

### The Telehealth Iron Triangle

The telehealth policy space is characterized by an iron triangle connecting three sets of actors:

1. **Congressional committees** (Senate HELP, House Energy and Commerce) that control telehealth legislation and appropriations
2. **Federal agencies** (CMS, DEA, FDA) that implement telehealth regulations
3. **Industry and professional groups** (ATA, APA, telehealth companies) that lobby for favorable rules and provide expert testimony

This triangle tends to produce incremental, temporary policy changes rather than comprehensive reform, because each actor has incentives to avoid the political risk of permanent action.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on mental health telehealth policy:

- **Lobbying**: The American Telemedicine Association and its members spent approximately $3.5 million on federal lobbying in 2023 (OpenSecrets, 2024). Telehealth companies like Teladoc, Amazon, and large health systems also lobby individually.
- **Public comment**: The DEA's 2023 proposed rule on telehealth prescribing received over 38,000 public comments, one of the largest comment volumes for a DEA rulemaking. Comments from the APA, NAMI, and other organizations were influential in the DEA's decision to revise its proposal (DEA, 2024).
- **Campaign contributions**: Health technology and telemedicine PACs contributed approximately $8 million to congressional campaigns in the 2024 election cycle, with contributions split between parties and concentrated on members of the Senate HELP and House Energy and Commerce Committees (OpenSecrets, 2024).
- **Research and expert testimony**: Professional associations (APA, APA) and think tanks (Brookings, KFF) produce research that shapes congressional hearings, CMS rulemaking, and public debate. The evidence base for telehealth mental health equivalence is a key tool for access advocates.
- **Grassroots advocacy**: NAMI's 600+ state and local affiliates mobilize patient and family advocates to contact legislators, particularly during annual debates over Medicare telehealth extensions. The #TelehealthNow campaign generated over 50,000 congressional contacts in 2024.
