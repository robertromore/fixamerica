# Mental Health Policy: What You Can Do

Mental health policy reform depends on sustained citizen engagement. Despite broad public support for mental health investment -- over 80% of Americans believe the government should do more to address mental health (KFF, 2023) -- political action has been slow because the opposition is concentrated and well-funded while the advocacy community is diffuse. Individual citizens, families, professionals, and community organizations can change this by making mental health a political priority through informed advocacy, coalition building, and direct engagement with elected officials.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to NAMI's policy newsletter at <https://www.nami.org/> for monthly updates on federal and state mental health legislation
- Follow the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline performance dashboard at <https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/988/performance-metrics> to track crisis system development in your state
- Read the annual Mental Health America "State of Mental Health in America" report at <https://www.mhanational.org/> to understand how your state ranks on access, treatment, and workforce
- Review the Kaiser Family Foundation Mental Health State Fact Sheets at <https://www.kff.org/> for state-specific data on coverage, spending, and treatment gaps
- Read Thomas Insel's *Healing: Our Path from Mental Illness to Mental Health* (2022) for a comprehensive overview of system failures and reform pathways

### Make Personal Changes

- Learn Mental Health First Aid -- an 8-hour evidence-based training that teaches how to recognize and respond to signs of mental illness and substance use disorders. Find a course at <https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/>
- If you have insurance, file a complaint with your state insurance commissioner when you experience mental health coverage barriers (denied claims, inability to find in-network providers, excessive prior authorization). These complaints generate data that regulators use to identify parity violations.
- Know your rights under the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA). If your insurer denies a mental health or substance use claim, request the specific clinical criteria used and compare them to criteria applied to medical/surgical claims. See the Kennedy Forum's parity resources at <https://www.thekennedyforum.org/>
- Save 988 in your phone contacts. Know that 988 is the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline for anyone in mental health crisis (call, text, or chat). Share this number widely.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call or write during budget season (February-September), when mental health legislation is pending in committee, and when appropriations bills are being marked up. Specific timing is available through NAMI's action alert system.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS, DOL, or HHS issues proposed rules on mental health parity, crisis services, or Medicaid coverage, submit public comments during the comment period. Federal rulemaking dockets are available at <https://www.regulations.gov/>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When your local newspaper covers mental health stories -- police shootings of people in crisis, psychiatric boarding in ERs, youth suicide, or school mental health -- write letters connecting these incidents to policy failures and specific reform proposals.
- **Share Information**: Post credible mental health policy information on social media. Share the 988 number. Amplify NAMI, MHA, and Treatment Advocacy Center policy analyses.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form or join a local NAMI affiliate. NAMI has affiliates in all 50 states and over 600 local chapters. Find yours at <https://www.nami.org/Find-Your-Local-NAMI/>
- Organize or attend town halls with your state legislators and Congressional representatives focused on mental health. Ask specific questions about parity enforcement, crisis system funding, and workforce shortages in your community.
- Partner with local law enforcement to advocate for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training for officers. CIT programs train police to recognize and de-escalate mental health crises. Contact the CIT International Center at <https://www.citinternational.org/> for resources.
- Work with your school board to advocate for meeting the 1:250 student-to-counselor ratio recommended by the American School Counselor Association. Request data on your district's current ratio and compare it to the national average of 1:385.
- Connect with your local community mental health center to understand their needs and capacity. Many centers need volunteers, board members, and community advocates.

### Build Coalitions

- Build interfaith mental health coalitions. Religious organizations reach communities that traditional mental health services often miss. The Interfaith Network on Mental Illness (<https://www.nami.org/Get-Involved/NAMI-FaithNet>) provides resources.
- Partner with employer groups and chambers of commerce to advocate for mental health investment. Mental health conditions cost employers approximately $105 billion annually in lost productivity (NAMI, 2024). Business leaders are natural allies for parity enforcement and workforce expansion.
- Connect mental health advocacy with criminal justice reform organizations. Groups working on jail overcrowding, reentry, and police reform share common goals with mental health advocates.
- Engage parent-teacher organizations in youth mental health advocacy. The school mental health workforce gap directly affects their children and is a galvanizing issue for parent engagement.

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```text
Subject: Support Mental Health Parity Enforcement and Crisis System Funding

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State] writing to urge you to prioritize
mental health reform. One in five American adults lives with a mental
illness, yet more than half do not receive treatment. In our community,
[personalize: "the wait for a new psychiatric appointment exceeds X
weeks" or "our county has no practicing psychiatrist" or "our school
district has a student-to-counselor ratio of X"].

I respectfully ask you to:

1. Support legislation to strengthen enforcement of the Mental Health
Parity and Addiction Equity Act, including civil monetary penalties
for insurers that violate parity and a private right of action for
patients.

2. Fully fund the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and support
dedicated funding for mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization
units in every state.

3. Support the expansion of the mental health workforce through
increased Graduate Medical Education funding for psychiatry
residencies, a National Mental Health Service Corps, and Medicaid
reimbursement rate increases for behavioral health providers.

[Optional personal paragraph: Share a brief personal experience with
the mental health system -- difficulty finding a provider, insurance
denial, family member's struggle, or community impact.]

Thank you for your service and consideration. I look forward to hearing
about your position on these critical issues.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
[Your Phone Number]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```text
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm
calling about mental health policy. I'd like [Representative/Senator]
[Last Name] to support three priorities: first, stronger enforcement
of the Mental Health Parity Act with real penalties for insurers that
deny mental health claims; second, full funding for the 988 crisis
system including mobile crisis teams; and third, expanding the mental
health workforce through a National Mental Health Service Corps. Over
half of Americans with mental illness don't receive treatment, and
160 million people live in areas without enough mental health
providers. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current and proposed legislation to support:

- **MHPAEA enforcement strengthening** (various bills): Adds civil monetary penalties for parity violations, requires annual insurer comparative analyses, and creates a private right of action. Contact your Senators on the HELP Committee and Representatives on the Energy and Commerce Committee.
- **988 and crisis system funding** (various bills): Appropriates dedicated funding for 988 operations, mobile crisis teams, and crisis stabilization units. Support dedicated telecom surcharge funding to provide sustainable, non-appropriations revenue.
- **CCBHC permanent authorization**: Makes Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics a permanent Medicaid benefit with prospective payment. Contact members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee.
- **IMD exclusion reform**: Allows Medicaid to reimburse inpatient psychiatric care in facilities of all sizes for adults ages 21-64 with quality safeguards. Contact members of both Finance and HELP committees.
- **GME expansion**: Increases Graduate Medical Education funding to create new psychiatry residency slots. Contact Appropriations Committee members.
- **Youth mental health legislation**: Supports school-based mental health services, universal screening, and social media platform regulation. Contact Education Committee and Commerce Committee members.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What specific steps will you take to enforce the Mental Health Parity Act so that insurers stop denying mental health claims at higher rates than medical claims?"
2. "Do you support dedicated, sustainable funding for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and mobile crisis teams in every community? If so, what funding mechanism do you support?"
3. "What is your plan to address the mental health workforce shortage? 160 million Americans live in areas without enough mental health providers, and over 60% of counties have no psychiatrist."
4. "Do you support reforming the Medicaid IMD exclusion to increase access to inpatient psychiatric care?"
5. "What will you do to address the youth mental health crisis, including school-based services and social media regulation?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who commit to specific dollar amounts for mental health investment, not just rhetorical support
- Ask whether candidates support mandatory appropriations for mental health programs (insulated from annual budget fights) or only discretionary spending
- Check whether candidates have accepted significant campaign contributions from health insurance industry PACs that oppose parity enforcement
- The NAMI Congressional Record Voter Guide (available at nami.org during election years) tracks voting records on mental health legislation

## Professional Actions

- **For Healthcare Providers**: Advocate within your professional organization (APA, AMA, NASW, AANP) for reimbursement rate increases and scope-of-practice reform. Report parity violations to DOL and your state insurance commissioner. Participate in the Collaborative Care Model and telehealth expansion. If you are a physician or NP in a state that restricts scope of practice, contact your state legislator about reform.
- **For Educators**: Advocate with your school board for meeting the 1:250 student-to-counselor ratio. Request Mental Health First Aid training for all school staff. Push for universal mental health screening at key developmental transitions. Partner with community mental health organizations to bring services into schools.
- **For Law Enforcement**: Support and participate in Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training. Advocate with your department for co-responder models that pair officers with mental health clinicians for crisis calls. Track and share data on mental health-related calls to demonstrate the need for non-law-enforcement crisis response.
- **For Employers**: Implement Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) with adequate session limits. Review your company health plan for parity compliance -- request denial rate comparisons between behavioral health and medical/surgical claims. Support workplace mental health training programs. Advocate through your chamber of commerce or trade association for mental health investment.
- **For Journalists**: Report on mental health system failures -- psychiatric boarding, crisis system gaps, parity violations, workforce shortages -- with data and systemic analysis rather than only individual stories. Use SAMHSA data, the 988 dashboard, and state mental health report cards as source material. Follow the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma's guidelines for responsible reporting on mental health and suicide (<https://dartcenter.org/>).
- **For Lawyers**: Represent clients in parity enforcement cases using the private right of action. File complaints with DOL and state insurance commissioners on behalf of clients denied mental health coverage. Support class-action litigation challenging systematic insurer parity violations. The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law (<https://www.bazelon.org/>) provides legal resources.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing mental health policy with others, emphasize:

1. **The treatment gap is a policy failure, not a personal one**: 52.8% of adults with mental illness do not receive treatment -- not because they refuse help, but because the system lacks providers, insurance coverage is inadequate, and crisis services do not exist in most communities (SAMHSA, 2023).
2. **Untreated mental illness costs more than treatment**: The U.S. spends an estimated $600 billion annually on the consequences of untreated mental illness -- emergency rooms, jails, homelessness, lost productivity -- while spending $280.5 billion on mental health treatment. Prevention and treatment are investments that pay for themselves.
3. **Parity is the law, but insurers violate it**: The Mental Health Parity Act has been law since 2008, but insurers deny behavioral health claims at double the rate of medical claims and construct provider networks so thin that patients are 5.4 times more likely to go out-of-network for mental health care (Milliman, 2023). Enforcement, not new law, is the primary need.
4. **The youth mental health crisis demands action**: 42% of high school students report persistent sadness or hopelessness, up from 26% in 2009. Youth suicide is the second leading cause of death for ages 10-34. Schools lack adequate counselors (1:385 ratio vs. the recommended 1:250), and social media platforms remain unregulated.
5. **160 million Americans live in mental health deserts**: More than 160 million people are in federally designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, and over 60% of U.S. counties have no practicing psychiatrist (HRSA, 2024). Without workforce expansion, no other reform succeeds.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "We already spend enough on mental health" | Mental health accounts for 6.7% of health spending but 18-20% of the disability burden. The treatment gap is a funding gap. | SAMHSA, 2023; WHO GBD, 2023 |
| "People with mental illness are dangerous" | People with mental illness are 10 times more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Only 3-5% of violent acts are attributable to serious mental illness. | APA, 2023; MacArthur Violence Risk Study |
| "Mental health parity already works" | Out-of-network behavioral health use is 5.4x higher than for medical/surgical care, and DOL has issued fewer than 50 enforcement actions in 15 years | Milliman, 2023; DOL |
| "Social media is not the problem" | Internal Facebook research showed Instagram worsened body image for 32% of teenage girls. Surgeon General issued formal advisory in 2023. | WSJ, 2021; Surgeon General, 2023 |
| "We can't afford to expand mental health services" | Untreated mental illness costs $600 billion/year. Every $1 invested in evidence-based mental health treatment returns $2-10 in reduced emergency, justice, and disability costs. | NAMI, 2024; WHO, 2022 |
| "People choose not to get help" | 28.3 million adults with mental illness who don't receive treatment report unmet need -- they want help but can't access it due to cost, provider shortages, or insurance barriers | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |
