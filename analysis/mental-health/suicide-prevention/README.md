# Suicide Prevention

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of suicide prevention policy in the United States, encompassing the national strategy, means restriction, crisis services, at-risk population interventions, and postvention support.

## Overview

Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the United States, claiming 49,449 lives in 2022 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Beyond fatalities, an estimated 1.6 million adults attempted suicide and 13.2 million seriously considered it that same year. The economic toll exceeds $500 billion annually when accounting for medical costs, lost productivity, and quality-of-life impacts. Despite decades of advocacy and incremental policy advances, the age-adjusted suicide rate rose 36% between 2000 and 2022, revealing deep structural failures in prevention infrastructure.

The United States has made notable progress in specific areas: the launch of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline in July 2022 created the first nationwide three-digit crisis number; the Zero Suicide framework has demonstrated that systematic healthcare-based prevention can reduce deaths; and federal funding through the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act has supported campus and youth prevention programs since 2004. Yet these advances remain unevenly distributed, chronically underfunded, and disconnected from the upstream social determinants that drive suicidal despair.

This analysis examines the full spectrum of suicide prevention, including lethal means restriction (firearm safety, bridge barriers, medication packaging), crisis services infrastructure, screening and intervention in healthcare settings, at-risk population strategies for veterans, LGBTQ+ youth, Native Americans, and middle-aged men, postvention services for survivors, and media reporting guidelines. It explores the tensions between individual liberty and public health intervention, evaluates evidence-based approaches, and proposes a comprehensive legislative and policy framework to reduce suicide deaths by 25% within a decade.
