# Suicide Prevention: Current State

## National Suicide Rates and Trends

The United States experienced 49,449 suicide deaths in 2022, an age-adjusted rate of 14.3 per 100,000 population (CDC WISQARS, 2023). This represents a 36% increase in the age-adjusted rate since 2000, when it stood at 10.5 per 100,000. After a brief decline in 2019-2020 (partly attributable to pandemic-era social factors and measurement challenges), rates rebounded sharply in 2021 and 2022.

### Overall Trends

## Means of Suicide

Firearms are the most lethal and most common means of suicide in the United States. Understanding means distribution is essential because means restriction is among the most evidence-based prevention strategies.

### Means Distribution (2022)

| Method | Deaths | % of Total | Case Fatality Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Firearm | 27,032 | 54.7% | ~85% |
| Suffocation/Hanging | 12,506 | 25.3% | ~69% |
| Poisoning/Overdose | 5,169 | 10.5% | ~2% |
| Fall | 1,519 | 3.1% | ~31% |
| Sharp instrument | 673 | 1.4% | ~1-2% |
| Drowning | 505 | 1.0% | ~66% |
| Other | 2,045 | 4.1% | Varies |

## Emerging Challenges

### Social Media and Digital Environment

Algorithmic amplification of self-harm content, cyberbullying, and the spread of detailed method information online represent growing concerns, particularly for youth. Research published in *BMJ* (2019) found associations between social media use exceeding three hours daily and increased suicide risk among adolescents.

### Post-Pandemic Mental Health Crisis

The COVID-19 pandemic intensified social isolation, economic disruption, and substance use, all upstream drivers of suicide. Emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts among adolescent girls rose 51% in early 2021 compared to the same period in 2019 (CDC MMWR, 2021).

### Workforce Shortages

The crisis counselor workforce faces burnout, low pay, and high turnover. A 2023 survey by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing found that 67% of crisis centers reported staffing vacancies above 20%, threatening 988 Lifeline answer rates and quality.

### Firearm Proliferation

An estimated 20 million firearms were sold in the United States in 2022 (NSSF-adjusted NICS data), adding to the approximately 400 million firearms in civilian circulation. First-time gun buyers -- estimated at 5.4 million in 2021 (NSSF, 2022) -- may be at elevated risk due to unfamiliarity with safe storage practices.
