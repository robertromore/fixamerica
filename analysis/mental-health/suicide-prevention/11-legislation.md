# Suicide Prevention: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to suicide prevention is necessarily multi-layered, reflecting the complexity of the crisis and the distribution of authority across federal, state, and local governments. The federal government plays the primary role in funding crisis infrastructure (988 Lifeline), setting healthcare standards (CMS conditions of participation, VA programs), and establishing minimum frameworks for means safety (ERPOs, waiting periods). States are responsible for implementing crisis services, enacting and enforcing means restriction laws, and funding community-based programs. The strategy combines one major omnibus federal bill, one federal means safety bill, one model state bill, and a regulatory framework, together with targeted amendments to existing law.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for the reforms proposed in this analysis.* The legislation operates within established Congressional authority under the Commerce Clause (regulation of firearm sales), the Spending Clause (conditions on federal healthcare funding), and the Taxing Clause (telecom fee for 988). Means restriction laws (ERPOs, waiting periods) have been upheld by multiple federal courts under existing constitutional frameworks, including the Second Amendment as interpreted in *Heller* (2008) and *Bruen* (2022).

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (988 Funding)**: Models the successful 911 fee structure. The $0.50/line/month fee on approximately 350 million subscriber lines generates approximately $2.1 billion annually, closing the identified funding gap. The 25% state match ensures state investment and accountability.
- **Section 5 (Zero Suicide)**: Uses CMS conditions of participation -- the most powerful healthcare regulatory tool -- to mandate evidence-based suicide prevention practices. The safe harbor provision addresses provider liability concerns that currently deter screening.
- **Section 6 (Workforce)**: Addresses the 160 million Americans in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas through multiple pipeline strategies. The Crisis Counselor Corps provides immediate capacity; NHSC and residency expansion build long-term supply.
- **Section 7 (Office of Suicide Prevention)**: Resolves the fragmented governance problem identified in the root causes analysis by creating a single coordinating entity with cross-agency authority.
- **Section 8 (Veterans)**: Addresses the critical finding that 62.1% of veteran suicides occur among veterans not connected to VA healthcare.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| FCC publishes proposed telecom fee rule | 90 days after enactment | FCC |
| FCC final rule on telecom fee | 180 days after enactment | FCC |
| CMS publishes new billing codes | 1 year after enactment | CMS |
| Crisis Counselor Corps begins recruitment | 6 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| Office of Suicide Prevention operational | 1 year after enactment | HHS |
| VA publishes expanded eligibility regulation | 1 year after enactment | VA |
| CMS publishes Zero Suicide conditions of participation | 2 years after enactment | CMS |
| Full Zero Suicide compliance required | 3 years after enactment | Healthcare systems |

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS (conditions of participation, billing codes); FCC (telecom fee); SAMHSA (grant administration, 988 standards); VA (eligibility rules, peer support); HHS (Office of Suicide Prevention).

**Challenges**:

- **Telecom industry opposition**: Telecommunications carriers may resist a new fee; mitigate by pointing to the established 911 fee precedent and the modest per-line cost
- **CMS implementation burden**: Zero Suicide mandate adds requirements to already-burdened healthcare systems; mitigate through phased implementation, technical assistance, and the safe harbor provision
- **VA capacity**: Expanded eligibility may overwhelm existing VA infrastructure; mitigate through phased expansion and community partnerships

**Refinements**:

- **Add sunset and reauthorization**: Include a 5-year reauthorization requirement with mandatory program evaluation
- **Expand telehealth provisions**: Explicitly authorize interstate telehealth for 988 follow-up care to address rural access gaps
- **Include Tribal consultation**: Require formal tribal consultation for all programs affecting American Indian and Alaska Native communities

### The Suicide Prevention Means Safety Act

**Purpose**: To establish federal minimum standards for extreme risk protection orders, enact a universal waiting period for firearm purchases, and create incentives for secure firearm storage.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Federal ERPO minimum standards with strong due process protections
2. Universal 72-hour waiting period for all licensed dealer firearm sales
3. Tax credit (up to $500) for purchase of gun safes and trigger locks
4. Federal grant program for bridge barriers at high-lethality sites

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To reduce suicide deaths through evidence-based lethal means safety
measures, including extreme risk protection orders, firearm purchase
waiting periods, and safe storage incentives.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Suicide Prevention Means Safety Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) In 2022, 27,032 Americans died by firearm suicide, representing
    54.7 percent of all suicide deaths (CDC WISQARS, 2023).

(2) The case fatality rate for firearm suicide attempts is
    approximately 85 percent, compared to 2 percent for the most
    common non-firearm method (CDC; Harvard Means Matter).

(3) Nine out of ten people who survive a suicide attempt do not go
    on to die by suicide (Owens et al., British Journal of
    Psychiatry, 2002).

(4) Extreme risk protection orders are associated with 5-14 percent
    reductions in firearm suicide in states with established
    programs (Kivisto & Phalen, Psychiatric Services, 2018).

(5) Waiting periods for firearm purchases are associated with 7-11
    percent reductions in firearm suicide (Luca et al., PNAS, 2017).

(6) Secure storage laws are associated with 13-32 percent reductions
    in youth firearm suicide (RAND, 2023).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) EXTREME RISK PROTECTION ORDER.—The term "extreme risk protection
    order" means a court order temporarily prohibiting a person

        hearing.

    (5) DURATION.—An order following a full hearing shall not
        exceed 1 year, with the option for renewal upon a new
        hearing with the same standard of proof.

    (6) RETURN OF FIREARMS.—Upon expiration or dissolution of an
        order, all firearms and ammunition shall be returned to the

order laws, training for law enforcement and judges, and public
education, in an amount not less than $200,000,000 over 5 years.

SEC. 5. UNIVERSAL WAITING PERIOD.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is
amended to provide that no licensed dealer may transfer a firearm
to any person until 72 hours have elapsed since the prospective
transferee began the transaction and submitted to a background check
under section 922(t).

(b) EXCEPTIONS.—This section shall not apply to—
    (1) transfers to law enforcement officers acting in their
        official capacity;

    (3) such sums as may be necessary for the safe storage tax
        credit; and
    (4) $500,000,000 over 10 years for the bridge barrier program.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after
the date of enactment, except that the waiting period under
section 5 shall take effect 1 year after enactment.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (ERPO Standards)**: Rather than creating a federal ERPO law (which raises federalism concerns), this approach conditions existing federal funding on state adoption of ERPOs meeting minimum due process standards. This respects state sovereignty while establishing a floor.
- **Section 5 (Waiting Period)**: The 72-hour waiting period extends the time between impulse and action, directly addressing the temporal impulsivity documented in the root causes analysis. The concealed carry permit exemption reduces opposition from responsible gun owners who have already passed background checks.
- **Section 6 (Tax Credit)**: Uses a positive incentive rather than a mandate, reducing political opposition while promoting secure storage.
- **Section 7 (Bridge Barriers)**: Creates a systematic federal program for the most cost-effective structural means restriction intervention.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| DOJ publishes ERPO implementation guidance | 6 months after enactment | DOJ |
| DOJ begins awarding ERPO implementation grants | 1 year after enactment | DOJ |
| Waiting period takes effect | 1 year after enactment | ATF |
| Tax credit available | Next tax filing season | IRS |
| First bridge barrier grants awarded | 1 year after enactment | DOT |
| State ERPO compliance deadline | 3 years after enactment | States |

**Challenges**:

- **Second Amendment litigation**: ERPOs and waiting periods will face legal challenges. Mitigate through strong due process protections and reliance on historical analogues recognized in *Bruen*.
- **State resistance**: Some states may forgo federal funding rather than enact ERPOs. Address by making the funding at stake substantial and by providing generous implementation grants.
- **NRA opposition**: The gun lobby will oppose all provisions. Counter through the firearm safety (not gun control) framing, veteran suicide coalition, and concealed carry exemption.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Crisis Services Sustainability Act

**Purpose**: To establish a dedicated state funding mechanism for 988 crisis services and require comprehensive crisis continuum infrastructure.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize the telecom fee amount based on population, existing infrastructure, and cost of living. States with existing crisis systems (e.g., Colorado, Washington) may focus on expansion rather than initial build-out.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Crisis
Services Sustainability Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(1) [State]-specific suicide rate and death count, most recent year.
(2) The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline requires sustainable state
    funding to achieve adequate answer rates and mobile crisis
    response times.
(3) [State]'s current in-state 988 answer rate is [X]%, below the
    national target of 95%.

SECTION 3. TELECOM FEE.

(a) There is imposed a fee of $[0.25-0.75] per subscriber line per
month on all wireline and wireless telecommunications service
provided within this State.

(b) The fee shall be collected by the telecommunications carrier
and remitted monthly to the [State] Crisis Services Fund.

SECTION 4. CRISIS SERVICES FUND.

(a) There is established in the State Treasury a [State] Crisis
Services Fund.

(b) Moneys in the Fund shall be used exclusively for:
    (1) Operation and staffing of 988 call centers serving this State;
    (2) Deployment and operation of mobile crisis teams;
    (3) Operation of crisis stabilization units; and
    (4) Follow-up care coordination for crisis contacts.

SECTION 5. MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS.

Not later than 3 years after the effective date of this Act, the
[State mental health authority] shall ensure that mobile crisis teams
are available to respond within 60 minutes to any location in an
urban area and within 90 minutes to any location in a rural area.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Health and Human Services (Office of Suicide Prevention, SAMHSA, CMS)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **FCC Telecom Fee Rule**: Establish the $0.50/line/month fee, collection mechanisms, and Fund disbursement procedures (statutory deadline: 180 days)
2. **CMS Zero Suicide Conditions of Participation**: Define screening, safety planning, lethal means counseling, and follow-up requirements for participating providers (statutory deadline: 2 years)
3. **CMS Billing Code Rule**: Establish reimbursement codes and rates for safety planning, lethal means counseling, and caring contacts (statutory deadline: 1 year)
4. **DOJ ERPO Implementation Guidance**: Define minimum standards, grant application procedures, and reporting requirements (statutory deadline: 6 months)

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **CMS Conditions of Participation**: Non-compliant healthcare systems risk loss of Medicare/Medicaid participation -- the strongest healthcare enforcement tool available
- **State ERPO Compliance**: Non-compliant states risk loss of Community Mental Health Services Block Grant and SAPT Block Grant funding
- **Telecom Fee**: Carriers that fail to collect and remit face FCC enforcement actions including fines
- **False ERPO Petitions**: State misdemeanor prosecution with fine and imprisonment
- **Private Right of Action**: Not included (to avoid excessive litigation); enforcement through agency action

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Federal regulation of firearm sales through licensed dealers (waiting period) is well-established under the Commerce Clause. The Brady Act's background check requirement (18 U.S.C. 922(t)) provides direct precedent for conditions on interstate firearms commerce.

**Spending Clause Authority**: Conditioning federal healthcare and mental health block grant funds on state ERPO adoption is permissible under *South Dakota v. Dole* (1987), provided the conditions are related to the federal interest (suicide prevention), clearly stated, and do not coerce states. The financial stakes must be calibrated to avoid unconstitutional coercion under *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012).

**Second Amendment**: The waiting period and ERPO provisions will face Second Amendment challenges. Under *Bruen* (2022), the government must demonstrate that the regulation is "consistent with this Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation." Historical analogues include colonial-era surety laws (requiring bonds from individuals deemed dangerous), historical waiting periods (pre-NICS era), and longstanding prohibitions on firearms possession by individuals deemed dangerous. Multiple federal circuits have upheld ERPOs and waiting periods post-*Bruen*.

### Preemption

The federal ERPO minimum standards do not preempt more protective state laws. States may enact broader petitioner categories, longer durations, or additional protections beyond the federal floor. The waiting period provision preempts shorter state waiting periods but does not preempt longer ones.

### Enforcement and Compliance

CMS conditions of participation are enforced through the survey and certification process, with escalating penalties from corrective action plans through termination of Medicare/Medicaid participation. The ERPO compliance mechanism uses existing block grant conditions, enforced through annual state applications and DOJ certification.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Private sale exemption from waiting period | The 72-hour waiting period applies only to licensed dealer sales; private sales (legal in many states) would be unaffected | High | Pair with universal background check legislation requiring all sales through licensed dealers |
| Concealed carry permit exemption | Individuals with concealed carry permits are exempt from the waiting period, allowing rapid purchases during crisis if permit is current | Medium | Require permits to be issued within the preceding 12 months (not 5 years) for exemption |
| State opt-out of ERPO through fund forfeiture | States may choose to forgo federal mental health block grant funds rather than enact ERPOs | Medium | Increase the financial stakes by conditioning additional funding streams (Medicaid crisis services reimbursement) on compliance |
| Healthcare system minimal compliance | Systems may implement screening and safety planning as checkbox exercises without clinical quality | Medium | Require outcome-based quality metrics (follow-up completion rates, readmission rates) as part of CMS conditions |
| Crisis Counselor Corps retention | Low pay and burnout may cause rapid turnover, undermining the workforce investment | Medium | Index salary to local cost of living; include mental health support and supervision requirements |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Does not address social media regulation | Youth suicide driven partly by algorithmic amplification of self-harm content remains unaddressed | Separate legislative track (Kids Online Safety Act) addresses this, but is not included here | Cross-reference with pending social media legislation; include social media provisions in future amendments |
| Limited reach in Tribal communities | IHS funding levels remain inadequate; legislation does not directly increase IHS per capita spending | Political difficulty of IHS appropriations; tribal sovereignty considerations | Add a dedicated title for IHS suicide prevention funding in future reauthorization |
| Does not address substance use comorbidity | 25-50% of suicides involve substance use disorders, but this legislation focuses on crisis services and means safety | Substance use policy addressed in separate FixAmerica domain | Cross-reference with substance use legislation; ensure co-occurring disorder treatment in Zero Suicide requirements |
| Voluntary safe storage only | Tax credit incentivizes but does not require secure firearm storage | Political infeasibility of mandatory storage legislation at this time | Monitor secure storage rates; consider mandatory requirements after cultural norm change |
| Rural access gaps | Mobile crisis team response times in remote rural areas may exceed 90 minutes despite best efforts | Geographic reality of low-density areas | Emphasize telehealth crisis follow-up; fund satellite crisis stabilization in rural hubs |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Close the private sale loophole**: Introduce companion legislation requiring universal background checks for all firearm transfers, which would subject private sales to the 72-hour waiting period
2. **Strengthen ERPO compliance incentives**: In future reauthorization, condition Medicaid crisis services reimbursement (in addition to block grants) on state ERPO adoption, significantly increasing the financial stakes for non-compliance
3. **Add outcome-based quality metrics**: Within 2 years of CMS conditions of participation taking effect, require CMS to publish quality metrics including suicide attempt rates, follow-up completion rates, and safety planning quality scores
4. **Index workforce compensation**: Include annual cost-of-living adjustments for Crisis Counselor Corps salaries and expand mental health support services for crisis workers
5. **IHS dedicated funding**: Introduce a separate bill or amendment increasing IHS mental health per capita spending from $94 to $350 (national average) with specific suicide prevention earmarks

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Act should include a 5-year reauthorization requirement (FY2032) with mandatory evaluation by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The evaluation should assess: (a) suicide rate trends; (b) 988 Lifeline performance; (c) Zero Suicide implementation outcomes; (d) workforce expansion effectiveness; (e) ERPO utilization and outcomes; (f) cost-effectiveness of all programs. Findings should inform reauthorization decisions and program refinements.
