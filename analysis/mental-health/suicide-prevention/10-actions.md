# Suicide Prevention: What You Can Do

Suicide prevention is one of the few policy areas where individual action can literally save lives. Unlike many systemic problems, suicide often comes down to specific moments of crisis where a single intervention -- a phone call, a safely stored firearm, a question asked by a friend or healthcare provider -- can mean the difference between death and survival. Nine out of ten people who survive a suicide attempt do not go on to die by suicide (Owens et al., *British Journal of Psychiatry*, 2002). This means every life saved during a crisis is likely a life saved permanently.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- **Learn the warning signs**: Familiarize yourself with the warning signs of suicide, including talking about wanting to die, feeling hopeless or having no purpose, increased substance use, social withdrawal, giving away possessions, and dramatic mood changes (AFSP Warning Signs Guide: <https://afsp.org/risk-factors-protective-factors-and-warning-signs>)
- **Complete QPR training**: Take the free or low-cost Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) gatekeeper training, which teaches civilians to recognize warning signs and connect people to help (<https://qprinstitute.com>). Training takes approximately 90 minutes.
- **Follow the 988 Lifeline updates**: Monitor SAMHSA's 988 Performance Dashboard to track your state's crisis services capacity (<https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/988/performance-metrics>)
- **Read the evidence**: Thomas Joiner's *Why People Die by Suicide* (Harvard University Press, 2005) and Anne Case and Angus Deaton's *Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism* (Princeton University Press, 2020) provide accessible, evidence-based understanding of the crisis

### Make Personal Changes

- **Practice lethal means safety**: If you own firearms, store them securely (locked, unloaded, ammunition separate). Free gun locks are available through the VA, Project ChildSafe, and many local police departments. Consider a trusted friend or family member as a temporary custodian during personal crises.
- **Secure medications**: Store prescription medications (especially opioids, benzodiazepines, and other potentially lethal drugs) in locked containers. Dispose of unused medications through DEA Take Back events or pharmacy disposal kiosks.
- **Ask the question directly**: If you are concerned about someone, ask them directly: "Are you thinking about suicide?" Research shows that asking does not increase risk and may reduce it by opening a path to help (Dazzi et al., *Psychological Medicine*, 2014).
- **Stay connected**: Maintain relationships and reach out to isolated friends, family members, and neighbors. Social connection is a protective factor against suicide. A simple check-in call or visit can be lifesaving.
- **Know your resources**: Save 988 in your phone contacts. Know the crisis resources available in your community, including the nearest crisis stabilization center and mobile crisis team availability.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge your members of Congress to support sustainable 988 funding, federal ERPO legislation, and mental health workforce expansion. Calls and letters from constituents are the most effective form of advocacy.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When SAMHSA, CMS, or the FTC open public comment periods on crisis services, healthcare screening, or social media safety rules, submit comments supporting evidence-based suicide prevention policy.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When your local newspaper covers suicide, write to commend responsible coverage or correct irresponsible reporting. Reference the Reporting on Suicide guidelines (<https://reportingonsuicide.org>).
- **Share Information Responsibly**: When sharing information about suicide prevention on social media, always include crisis resources (988 Lifeline, Crisis Text Line: text HOME to 741741). Follow safe messaging guidelines: avoid sharing methods, graphic details, or sensationalized narratives.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- **Form a suicide prevention coalition**: Bring together local mental health providers, faith leaders, educators, first responders, and bereaved family members to coordinate community prevention efforts. AFSP provides toolkits for starting local coalitions (<https://afsp.org/community-programs>).
- **Host a community conversation**: Partner with your local library, faith organization, or community center to host a screening and discussion event. AFSP's "Talk Away the Dark" campaign provides facilitation materials (<https://talkaway thedark.org>).
- **Promote safe storage**: Work with local gun shops, shooting ranges, and hunting clubs to distribute free gun locks and safe storage materials. The Gun Shop Project provides turnkey materials for retailer engagement (<https://afsp.org/firearms-and-suicide-prevention>).
- **Support crisis services**: Volunteer at your local 988 crisis center. Many centers rely on trained volunteers for call, text, and chat response. Contact your nearest center through the SAMHSA treatment locator (<https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov>).

### Build Coalitions

- **Bridge the gun safety divide**: Engage firearm-owning community members as partners in suicide prevention. The most effective means safety messages come from fellow gun owners. Support programs like Walk the Talk (AFSP) that train gun-owning veterans and community members as means safety ambassadors.
- **Engage faith communities**: Many faith traditions emphasize the sanctity of life and community care. Partner with congregations to integrate suicide prevention awareness into existing care ministries. The National Action Alliance provides faith-community-specific resources (<https://theactionalliance.org/faith-hope-life>).
- **Connect with schools**: Work with school boards to adopt evidence-based prevention curricula (Sources of Strength, Signs of Suicide). Advocate for school counselors trained in suicide risk assessment.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When 988 funding legislation is before Congress or your state legislature
- During state legislative sessions considering ERPO bills, waiting periods, or secure storage requirements
- When federal or state budgets are being debated (SAMHSA, VA, and mental health appropriations)
- After high-profile suicide events, when political attention creates windows for policy change

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Sustainable 988 Funding and Suicide Prevention Investment

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State] and I am writing to urge your support
for sustainable funding for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and
comprehensive suicide prevention policy.

Nearly 50,000 Americans die by suicide each year, making it the 11th leading
cause of death. The 988 Lifeline, launched in 2022, has already received
5.5 million contacts in its first year, but operates with a $2.1 billion
annual funding gap. Our state's in-state answer rate is [check SAMHSA
dashboard for your state's rate], meaning too many people in crisis are not
reaching help.

I urge you to:
1. Support a federal telecom fee to sustainably fund 988 operations, mobile
   crisis teams, and crisis stabilization services
2. Support federal ERPO legislation with strong due process protections
3. Fund mental health workforce expansion through NHSC and HRSA programs

Suicide is preventable. Nine out of ten attempt survivors do not go on to die
by suicide. Every investment in crisis services and means safety saves lives.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling
to urge [Representative/Senator] [Last Name] to support sustainable funding
for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and federal suicide prevention
legislation. Nearly 50,000 Americans die by suicide each year, and our
crisis services remain underfunded. I'd like the [Representative/Senator]
to co-sponsor the [specific bill if applicable] and support full 988 funding
in the next appropriations bill. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **988 Sustainability Act**: Establishes a federal telecom fee to provide sustainable funding for the 988 Lifeline and associated crisis services -- Contact your Senators and urge co-sponsorship
- **Federal ERPO legislation**: Minimum standards for state extreme risk protection orders with due process protections -- Contact members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees
- **National Suicide Prevention Improvement Act**: Expands Zero Suicide implementation and requires 7-day post-discharge follow-up in federally funded healthcare systems -- Contact members of the Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee
- **VA mental health eligibility expansion**: Extends VA mental health services to all veterans regardless of service-connected disability -- Contact members of the Senate and House Veterans Affairs Committees

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support sustainable federal funding for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline through a dedicated telecom fee? If not, how would you fund crisis services?"
2. "Do you support extreme risk protection order legislation with due process protections to temporarily remove firearms from individuals in crisis?"
3. "What specific policies would you implement to reduce the 50,000 annual suicide deaths in the United States?"
4. "Do you support expanding VA mental health services to all veterans, including those not currently enrolled in VA healthcare?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Check candidates' positions on mental health funding, crisis services, and means safety
- Review candidates' records on mental health parity enforcement
- Evaluate candidates' willingness to address firearm suicide as distinct from the broader gun debate
- Key committees: Senate HELP Committee, House Energy and Commerce Committee, Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittees on Labor-HHS, Senate and House Veterans Affairs Committees

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing suicide prevention with others, emphasize:

1. **Suicide is preventable**: Nine out of ten people who survive a suicide attempt do not go on to die by suicide. The crisis is temporary; death is permanent.
2. **Means matter**: 54.7% of suicide deaths involve firearms, which have an 85% case fatality rate. Simply putting time and distance between a person in crisis and a lethal weapon saves lives.
3. **988 is underfunded**: The 988 Lifeline received 5.5 million contacts in its first year but operates with a $2.1 billion annual funding gap. In-state answer rates average only 70%.
4. **It affects everyone**: Nearly 50,000 Americans die by suicide annually, and 13.2 million adults experience serious suicidal ideation. Every suicide leaves 135 people significantly affected.
5. **The investment pays off**: The total economic cost of suicide is $510 billion annually (CDC, 2022). Every dollar invested in prevention yields a return exceeding 25:1.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Asking about suicide puts the idea in someone's head" | Research consistently shows that asking about suicide does not increase risk and may reduce it by opening a path to help | Dazzi et al., *Psychological Medicine*, 2014 |
| "People who talk about suicide are just seeking attention" | Most people who die by suicide have communicated their intent; talking about suicide is a warning sign that should always be taken seriously | AFSP Risk Factors Guide, 2023 |
| "If someone is determined to die, nothing can stop them" | 90% of attempt survivors do not go on to die by suicide; most crises are temporary and responsive to intervention | Owens et al., *British Journal of Psychiatry*, 2002 |
| "Suicide only affects people with mental illness" | Approximately 54% of people who die by suicide do not have a diagnosed mental health condition at the time of death | CDC Psychological Autopsy studies |
| "Suicide is a selfish or cowardly act" | Suicide results from unbearable psychological pain, not character flaws; stigmatizing language deters help-seeking | Joiner, *Why People Die by Suicide*, 2005 |
| "Only professionals can help someone who is suicidal" | Gatekeeper training programs (QPR, safeTALK) enable anyone to recognize warning signs and connect people to help | QPR Institute evaluation data |
