# Suicide Prevention: History

## Historical Development

Suicide prevention in the United States has evolved from moral condemnation and criminal penalty through medicalization and institutionalization to the modern public health approach. This transformation has been shaped by advances in psychiatric understanding, grassroots advocacy by survivors, federal policy development, and -- most recently -- the integration of means restriction into a comprehensive prevention framework.

### Moral and Criminal Era (Colonial Period - 1900s): Suicide as Sin and Crime

- **Religious Prohibition**: Colonial and early American law treated suicide as both sin and crime, reflecting English common law. Penalties included denial of Christian burial, forfeiture of the deceased's estate, and public desecration of the body. Massachusetts and other colonies adopted anti-suicide statutes derived from English ecclesiastical law.
- **Gradual Decriminalization**: As Enlightenment thinking spread, states began repealing criminal penalties. No state prosecuted attempted suicide after the mid-19th century, though the last formal decriminalization (Maryland) did not occur until 1993. The shift reflected growing recognition that punishment deterred neither the act nor help-seeking.
- **Institutional Confinement**: The 19th-century asylum movement led to the confinement of suicidal individuals alongside those with severe mental illness. While some asylums provided therapeutic environments, many were custodial warehouses with no meaningful treatment for suicidal despair.
- **Early Psychological Understanding**: Emile Durkheim's *Suicide* (1897) established the sociological framework linking suicide to social integration and regulation. Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory later reframed suicide as aggression turned inward. These intellectual developments laid groundwork for treating suicide as a medical and social phenomenon rather than a moral failing.

### Emergence of Prevention (1900s-1960s): From Isolation to Outreach

- **Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (1910)**: The first recorded professional meeting on suicide, organized by Freud's circle, established suicide as a legitimate subject for scientific inquiry.
- **Save-a-Life League (1906)**: One of the first American suicide prevention organizations, founded by Reverend Harry Marsh Warren in New York City, offering telephone counseling to distressed callers. It operated for over a century.
- **Samaritans Movement (1953)**: Founded in London by Reverend Chad Varah, the Samaritans established the model of volunteer-staffed crisis telephone lines that would become the template for American crisis centers.
- **Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center (1958)**: Edwin Shneidman and Norman Farberow established the first comprehensive suicide prevention center in the United States at the Los Angeles County Hospital. Shneidman coined the term "suicidology" and developed the concept of "psychological autopsy" to understand suicide deaths.
- **Community Mental Health Centers Act (1963)**: President Kennedy's legislation shifted mental healthcare from state hospitals to community settings, creating infrastructure that would eventually incorporate crisis services.
- **American Association of Suicidology (1968)**: Founded by Shneidman, AAS became the first national professional organization dedicated to suicide research and prevention, establishing standards for crisis centers and training programs.

### Federal Engagement and the Crisis Center Movement (1960s-1990s): Building Infrastructure

- **Crisis Center Proliferation**: The 1960s and 1970s saw rapid growth in volunteer-staffed crisis hotlines, growing from fewer than a dozen in 1960 to over 200 by 1980. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded crisis center development as part of the community mental health movement.
- **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline Precursors**: Multiple regional hotline numbers existed but there was no national coordination or universal number. This fragmentation meant inconsistent quality, training, and availability.
- **Veterans Administration**: The VA began developing internal suicide prevention programs in the 1980s, driven by recognition of elevated veteran suicide risk, particularly among Vietnam-era veterans. However, systematic tracking of veteran suicide did not begin until much later.
- **Youth Suicide Prevention**: A cluster of highly publicized youth suicides in the 1980s (including in Plano, Texas, and Bergenfield, New Jersey) catalyzed public awareness and early school-based prevention programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services convened a Task Force on Youth Suicide in 1987.
- **Surgeon General's Call to Action (1999)**: Surgeon General David Satcher issued the first national Call to Action to Prevent Suicide, establishing suicide prevention as a national priority and calling for a coordinated strategy. This document laid the conceptual foundation for the first National Strategy.

### National Strategy Era (2001-2015): Policy Framework Development

- **National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (2001)**: The first comprehensive federal strategy identified 11 goals and 68 objectives, organized around awareness, intervention, and methodology. While influential as a framework, it lacked dedicated funding and accountability mechanisms.
- **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (2005)**: SAMHSA established the 1-800-273-TALK (8255) number as the first nationally coordinated crisis line, contracting with the Mental Health Association of New York City (later Vibrant Emotional Health) to manage a network of local crisis centers.
- **Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act (2004)**: Named after the son of U.S. Senator Gordon Smith (R-OR), this legislation authorized $82 million in grants for campus and youth suicide prevention programs. It was the first significant federal suicide prevention funding. Studies showed 5-10% reductions in youth suicide rates in communities receiving grants (Walrath et al., *American Journal of Public Health*, 2015).
- **Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act (2007)**: Named after an Iraq War veteran who died by suicide, this law required the VA to develop a comprehensive suicide prevention program, including the Veterans Crisis Line. The VCL launched in 2007 and has since fielded millions of calls.
- **Revised National Strategy (2012)**: An updated strategy expanded to 13 goals, added emphasis on social determinants, means restriction, and healthcare integration, and called for a "Zero Suicide" approach within health systems.
- **Henry Ford Health Demonstration (2000-2010)**: Henry Ford Health System in Detroit implemented a "Perfect Depression Care" model that reduced suicide among its patient population by 75% over a decade. This became the foundational evidence for the Zero Suicide framework.
- **Zero Suicide Initiative Launch (2012)**: The National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, a public-private partnership created in 2010, championed the Zero Suicide framework as a healthcare systems approach. SAMHSA began funding adoption grants.

### Modern Transformation (2015-Present): 988, Means Restriction, and Systems Change

- **Firearm-Suicide Connection Gains Attention**: The New Hampshire Gun Shop Project (launched 2009) demonstrated that firearm retailers could serve as suicide prevention partners. The project distributed safe storage materials and trained retailers to recognize warning signs, becoming a national model replicated in over 25 states by 2024.
- **Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs)**: Connecticut (1999) and Indiana (2005) enacted the first ERPO laws, but the movement accelerated after the Parkland shooting in 2018. By 2024, 21 states and D.C. had adopted ERPOs. Studies by Kivisto and Phalen (2018) found ERPOs associated with 5-14% reductions in firearm suicide in states with established programs.
- **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (2020-2022)**: The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 designated 988 as the new crisis number. After a two-year transition period, 988 launched on July 16, 2022. First-year contacts reached 5.5 million, a 50% increase over the prior 10-digit line.
- **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022)**: Following the Uvalde school shooting, Congress passed the most significant gun safety legislation in decades. It included $750 million for community mental health services, $150 million for school-based mental health, and federal support for state ERPO implementation.
- **Bridge Barrier Completions**: The Golden Gate Bridge suicide deterrent net, approved in 2014 after decades of debate, was completed in 2023 at a cost of $224 million. International evidence from the Bloor Street Viaduct (Toronto) and Clifton Suspension Bridge (Bristol, UK) demonstrated that barriers reduce site-specific suicides by 77-90% without significant displacement to nearby sites.
- **2024 National Strategy Update**: The Biden administration released an updated National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, emphasizing equity, upstream prevention, lethal means safety, and crisis continuum development.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Incremental Gains Without Structural Investment

The history of suicide prevention in the United States reveals a recurring pattern: landmark laws and programs are created with bipartisan support but never funded at levels sufficient to achieve their goals. The National Strategy for Suicide Prevention (2001) had no dedicated funding mechanism. The Garrett Lee Smith Act authorized $82 million but was appropriated at lower levels. The 988 Lifeline was mandated by Congress but launched with a $2.1 billion annual funding gap. This pattern produces symbolic progress without systemic transformation.

### Pattern 2: Tragedy as Catalyst

Nearly every major advance in suicide prevention has followed a high-profile death or cluster: Senator Smith's son prompted the GLS Act; the Omvig family's advocacy produced the VA law; the Parkland shooting accelerated ERPOs; the Uvalde shooting enabled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. While tragedy drives political will, it produces reactive rather than proactive policy and leaves prevention dependent on the news cycle.

### Pattern 3: Means Restriction Overcomes Ideological Resistance Over Time

The history of bridge barriers illustrates how evidence eventually overcomes opposition. The Golden Gate Bridge debate spanned four decades, with opponents claiming barriers would be ineffective, expensive, and aesthetically damaging. When the net was finally completed in 2023, the evidence base was overwhelming: barriers at other sites had reduced deaths by 77-90% without significant displacement. The lesson applies to firearm means restriction, where evidence is equally strong but political opposition remains more entrenched.

### Pattern 4: The Gap Between Research and Practice

Suicidology has produced robust evidence for effective interventions -- safety planning, means restriction, care transitions, cognitive behavioral therapy for suicide prevention (CBT-SP), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Yet implementation consistently lags behind knowledge. The median time from research demonstration to standard clinical practice exceeds 17 years (Balas & Boren, 2000). Closing this gap requires not just more research but better implementation science, workforce training, and system redesign.
