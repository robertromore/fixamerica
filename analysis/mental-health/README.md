# Mental Health Policy

This directory contains a comprehensive analysis of United States mental health policy, covering the systems, laws, workforce, and funding structures that shape how Americans access and receive mental health care.

## Overview

The United States faces a mental health crisis of historic proportions. More than one in five American adults -- over 57 million people -- lives with a mental illness, yet fewer than half receive treatment in any given year. The system intended to serve them is fragmented across federal, state, and local jurisdictions, chronically underfunded, and plagued by severe workforce shortages that leave entire regions of the country without a single psychiatrist. The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, launched in 2022, represented a landmark expansion of crisis services, but the broader infrastructure to support people in mental health emergencies remains dangerously thin.

This analysis examines the structural failures driving America's mental health treatment gap, from insurance parity laws that are widely violated to a community mental health system that never recovered from deinstitutionalization. It traces the history from the asylum era through managed care to the present, identifies the root causes of persistent access barriers, and proposes evidence-based reforms spanning federal legislation, state model laws, workforce development, crisis system buildout, and integration of behavioral health into primary care and schools. The analysis gives particular attention to populations bearing the greatest burden: children and adolescents experiencing unprecedented rates of anxiety and depression, people with serious mental illness cycling through jails and emergency rooms, and veterans and older adults facing isolation and inadequate care.
