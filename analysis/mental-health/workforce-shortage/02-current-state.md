# Mental Health Workforce Shortage: Current State

## Provider Supply by Discipline

The behavioral health workforce encompasses multiple professions, each governed by distinct training pathways, licensing requirements, and scopes of practice. The total active workforce is estimated at approximately 700,000 licensed professionals, but this figure obscures critical variation across disciplines, geography, and practice settings.

### Psychiatrists

Psychiatrists are the only mental health professionals routinely authorized to prescribe medication and manage complex pharmacological regimens across all 50 states. Their supply is particularly constrained.

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Active psychiatrists | ~37,000 | Stable | AAMC, 2023 |

## Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs)

The federal HPSA designation system identifies areas, populations, and facilities with insufficient mental health provider supply. Designation carries significant consequences, including eligibility for National Health Service Corps placements, enhanced Medicare payment, and J-1 visa waivers.

## Emerging Challenges

### Post-Pandemic Demand Surge

Demand for mental health services surged during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and has not abated. National surveys show persistent elevation in anxiety, depression, and substance use, particularly among youth. The supply pipeline has not kept pace, and wait times for new patient appointments have lengthened in most markets.

### Telehealth Expansion and Limits

The pandemic-era relaxation of telehealth regulations dramatically expanded geographic reach for behavioral health providers. However, as temporary flexibilities expire, interstate practice remains constrained by state-by-state licensure. The Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT, 41 states enacted as of 2024) and the Counseling Compact (36 states enacted) are expanding, but telehealth alone cannot solve the undersupply of trained providers.

### Workforce Aging

Psychiatry has one of the oldest average physician ages of any specialty (53.4 years), and a large share of the psychiatrist workforce will retire within the next decade. The pipeline of new psychiatrists (~1,900 PGY-1 positions per year) is insufficient to offset projected retirements while also meeting growing demand.

### Integration with Primary Care

The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM), endorsed by CMS and supported by billing codes (99492-99494), integrates behavioral health into primary care settings. Scaling this model requires a workforce trained in measurement-based care, consultation, and brief intervention -- skills that many training programs do not yet emphasize.
