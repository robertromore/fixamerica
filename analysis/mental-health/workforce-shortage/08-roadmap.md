# Mental Health Workforce Shortage: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The mental health workforce shortage requires simultaneous action across five dimensions: training pipeline expansion, reimbursement reform, scope-of-practice modernization, workforce diversity investment, and burnout reduction. These dimensions are interdependent -- expanding training without raising reimbursement will not attract providers to underserved settings, and raising reimbursement without expanding supply will increase costs without improving access.

The roadmap is organized into three phases that build sequentially. Phase 1 focuses on high-impact actions that can be implemented through executive authority, existing program expansion, and legislation with bipartisan precedent. Phase 2 tackles structural reforms that require new legislation and sustained appropriations. Phase 3 consolidates gains and builds toward the long-term vision of a workforce adequate in size, diversity, and sustainability to meet population needs.

The theory of change is that early wins -- particularly scope-of-practice reform for Medicare and NHSC expansion -- will demonstrate political viability and generate measurable access improvements that build momentum for the larger investments in Phase 2 and Phase 3.

## Governance and Oversight

### Interagency Coordination

The implementation roadmap spans multiple federal agencies (HRSA, SAMHSA, CMS, DoE) and requires an interagency coordination mechanism. The roadmap proposes:

- **Behavioral Health Workforce Interagency Council**: Chaired by the HHS Assistant Secretary for Health, with representatives from HRSA, SAMHSA, CMS, the Department of Education, the VA, and the DoD. The Council would meet quarterly, coordinate program implementation, and report annually to Congress.
- **Annual Workforce Progress Report**: Published by HRSA using the national workforce data system, measuring progress against all milestones. The report would be submitted to the Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee.
- **Independent Five-Year Evaluation**: Contracted by SAMHSA at Year 5, covering program effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and equity outcomes. Results inform Phase 3 adjustments.

### Congressional Oversight

- Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee hold annual hearings on workforce progress
- CBO provides updated scoring of workforce programs at 3-year intervals
- GAO conducts program audits at Years 3 and 7

### State-Level Accountability

- States receiving enhanced CCBHC matching funds must report annually on staffing levels, compensation, turnover, and patient access metrics
- HRSA conditions NHSC expansion funding on state participation in interstate licensing compacts
- SAMHSA conditions block grant funding on state adoption of peer specialist certification and Medicaid reimbursement

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Congressional Failure to Appropriate Adequate Funding

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build bipartisan support by framing workforce investment as rural health infrastructure. Secure authorization in bipartisan legislation (Mental Health Access Improvement Act has 300+ cosponsors historically). Engage rural Republican and suburban Democratic members whose districts face the most acute shortages.

**Contingency Plan**: If full appropriations are not achieved, prioritize NHSC expansion and scope-of-practice reform (both lower-cost) while continuing to advocate for GME cap lift and CCBHC scale-up. Use executive authority to maximize existing program flexibility.

### Risk 2: State Resistance to Scope-of-Practice Reform and Compact Adoption

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Provide federal financial incentives for compact adoption ($100 million incentive fund). Focus federal scope changes on Medicare (federal program, no state preemption needed) while supporting state-by-state advocacy through coalitions of NPs, rural hospitals, and patient groups.

**Contingency Plan**: If state adoption stalls, maximize the reach of federal scope changes (Medicare, VA, DoD, IHS) and expand telehealth to allow providers in permissive states to serve patients in restrictive states through interstate compacts.

### Risk 3: GME Expansion Captured by Academic Medical Centers in Urban Areas

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Legislatively require that 50% of new GME slots be based in community health centers, CCBHCs, or rural training sites. Give allocation preference to teaching hospitals that partner with community-based organizations in HPSAs. Tie GME funding to post-training HPSA service obligations.

**Contingency Plan**: If community-based requirements are weakened in legislative compromise, use HRSA administrative authority to weight NHSC placements toward newly trained psychiatrists, creating a parallel incentive for underserved-area practice.

### Risk 4: Burnout Reduction Efforts Insufficient to Reverse Workforce Exit

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Pair burnout reduction with reimbursement increases (CCBHC model), so that the root cause of overwork -- underfunding -- is addressed alongside symptoms. Fund rigorous evaluation of burnout interventions and scale only what works.

**Contingency Plan**: If traditional clinician burnout remains high, accelerate expansion of the peer specialist and community health worker workforce, which has lower burnout rates and can absorb some functions currently performed by burned-out clinicians.

### Risk 5: Workforce Diversity Pipeline Produces Slow Results

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Begin pipeline investments at the undergraduate level to shorten time to impact. Fund bridge programs that accelerate entry into graduate training for underrepresented students. Invest simultaneously in faculty diversity, since diverse faculty are the most effective recruiters and mentors for diverse students.

**Contingency Plan**: Supplement pipeline programs with aggressive recruitment of internationally trained behavioral health professionals, particularly from countries with training programs compatible with U.S. licensing. Expand the J-1 visa waiver program for behavioral health professionals committing to HPSA service.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Annual Cost | Funding Source | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Yrs 1-2) | $3-4 billion | Congressional appropriation; CMS authority | Primarily NHSC expansion ($3B) + planning costs |
| Phase 2 (Yrs 3-5) | $8-10 billion | Congressional appropriation; Medicaid matching | GME ($0.9B) + CCBHC ($5B) + Diversity ($0.5B) + Burnout ($0.3B) + other |
| Phase 3 (Yrs 6-10) | $8-10 billion (sustained) | Same sources, sustained | Maintenance of Phase 2 investments + evaluation |
| **Total (10 years)** | **$80-100 billion** | | Compared to $280 billion annual cost of untreated mental illness (Lancet Commission, 2024) |

### Personnel

- **Phase 1**: Minimal additional federal staff; HRSA and SAMHSA can administer expanded programs with existing infrastructure and modest staff increases (~200 FTEs)
- **Phase 2**: HRSA requires ~500 additional FTEs to administer expanded NHSC, BHWET, Diversity Pipeline, and workforce data system. SAMHSA requires ~300 additional FTEs for expanded CCBHC oversight and burnout reduction program. CMS requires ~100 additional FTEs for GME expansion administration.
- **Phase 3**: Staffing levels stabilize at Phase 2 levels; some reduction as programs mature

### Infrastructure

- **National Behavioral Health Workforce Data System**: Development cost $25 million (Years 3-5); annual maintenance $10 million. Provides real-time data on provider supply, demand, geographic distribution, and demographic composition.
- **CCBHC Certification Infrastructure**: SAMHSA must expand certification capacity to process 2,000+ CCBHC applications. Estimated cost $15 million over 3 years.
- **GME Training Site Development**: Community health centers and CCBHCs serving as new GME training sites require infrastructure investment (space, equipment, supervision capacity). Estimated $500 million over 5 years through HRSA capital grants.
