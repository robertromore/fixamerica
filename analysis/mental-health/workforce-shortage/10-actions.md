# Mental Health Workforce Shortage: What You Can Do

The mental health workforce shortage affects every community in America. More than 160 million Americans live in federally designated Mental Health Health Professional Shortage Areas, 55% of U.S. counties lack even a single psychiatrist, and the average wait for a new psychiatric appointment exceeds 48 days. Citizen engagement -- at the individual, community, and political levels -- is essential to building the political will for the investments and reforms needed to close this gap.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Follow HRSA's Health Professional Shortage Area data at <https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/shortage-areas> to understand your community's designation status
- Read the National Council for Mental Wellbeing's annual CCBHC reports at <https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/> to track progress on the most promising workforce model
- Subscribe to NAMI's policy updates at <https://www.nami.org/advocacy> for legislative action alerts on workforce bills
- Review your state's mental health workforce data through the Kaiser Family Foundation's state fact sheets at <https://www.kff.org/statedata/mental-health-and-substance-use-state-fact-sheets/>

### Make Personal Choices That Support the Workforce

- If you have insurance, use in-network behavioral health providers when possible; in-network utilization signals to insurers that demand exists and networks must be adequate
- If you encounter ghost networks (listed providers who are not actually accepting patients), report them to your state insurance commissioner and to the insurer -- complaints create enforcement pressure
- If you are considering a career in behavioral health, explore the NHSC loan repayment program at <https://nhsc.hrsa.gov/> -- commitments to underserved areas earn up to $50,000 in loan repayment
- If you are a parent, advocate for school-based mental health services in your district -- school-based providers reach children who would otherwise go unserved

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge support for the Mental Health Access Improvement Act (grants Medicare billing to LPCs and LMFTs), GME cap expansion for behavioral health specialties, and increased NHSC funding
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS proposes changes to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (typically published each summer), submit comments supporting higher reimbursement for behavioral health services and expanded provider categories
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When your local newspaper covers mental health issues, write to highlight the workforce shortage as a root cause and advocate for specific legislative solutions
- **Share Information**: Use the key facts from this analysis -- 160+ million in HPSAs, 55% of counties without a psychiatrist, 48-day average wait -- in social media posts, community discussions, and conversations with elected officials

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a community mental health access coalition that includes local providers, patients, families, faith leaders, and educators to advocate for workforce investment at the state and local level
- Host community forums inviting local behavioral health providers to discuss the shortage and its impact on your area; invite local legislators or their staff
- Partner with local community health centers to advocate for CCBHC designation, which brings cost-based reimbursement, higher staff salaries, and reduced turnover
- Work with school boards to fund school-based mental health positions -- social workers, counselors, and psychologists embedded in schools reach underserved youth

### Build Coalitions

- Connect mental health advocacy with rural health advocacy; the workforce shortage is most acute in rural areas, and rural health organizations are powerful allies
- Engage local chambers of commerce; employers lose an estimated $47.6 billion annually to untreated mental illness in lost productivity (NAMI, 2023), making workforce investment a business issue
- Partner with law enforcement reform advocates; 44% of jail inmates have a mental health condition (DOJ, 2023), and police departments increasingly support mental health workforce expansion to reduce crisis calls
- Build alliances with faith communities; churches, mosques, and synagogues are often the first point of contact for people experiencing mental health distress and can be powerful advocates for professional workforce investment

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During Congressional budget and appropriations season (February-September), when NHSC, BHWET, and SAMHSA funding levels are set
- When the Mental Health Access Improvement Act or GME expansion legislation is introduced or moves through committee
- When your state legislature considers scope-of-practice bills (NP full practice authority, psychologist prescribing, interstate compact adoption)
- When CMS proposes the annual Medicare Physician Fee Schedule update (typically July, with comments due in September)

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Mental Health Workforce Investment -- [Your State] Needs More Providers

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

As your constituent in [City], I am writing to urge your support for
federal investments to address the mental health workforce shortage.
More than 160 million Americans live in federally designated Mental
Health Professional Shortage Areas, and [your state-specific data --
e.g., "55% of counties in our state lack any psychiatrist" or "our
state ranks in the bottom 10 for behavioral health provider supply"].

I specifically ask that you support:

1. The Mental Health Access Improvement Act, which would allow
licensed professional counselors and marriage and family therapists
to bill Medicare directly -- expanding the effective provider supply
at minimal federal cost.

2. Increased funding for the National Health Service Corps behavioral
health program, which places providers in underserved communities
like ours.

3. Lifting the Graduate Medical Education cap for psychiatry and
behavioral health specialties, which has been frozen since 1997.

Without enough providers, insurance coverage mandates are hollow
promises. Our community needs a workforce adequate to meet the
demand for mental health care.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City].
I'm calling about the mental health workforce shortage.
[Your state] has [state-specific data], and I'd like the
[Representative/Senator] to co-sponsor the Mental Health
Access Improvement Act and support increased funding for the
National Health Service Corps behavioral health program.
Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current and proposed legislation to support:

- **Mental Health Access Improvement Act (H.R. 828 / S. 828)**: Grants direct Medicare billing authority to LPCs and LMFTs -- the single highest-impact, lowest-cost workforce reform available. Contact your Senators and Representative to co-sponsor.
- **Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act**: Expands Medicare GME slots, including for psychiatry. Urge inclusion of behavioral health-specific set-asides.
- **CCBHC Reauthorization and Expansion**: Support legislation making the CCBHC model permanent with enhanced federal Medicaid matching. Contact Senate Finance and House Energy and Commerce Committee members.
- **State-level scope-of-practice bills**: Track and support bills in your state legislature granting full practice authority to NPs, authorizing psychologist prescribing, or adopting the PSYPACT and Counseling Compact.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support lifting the Medicare GME cap for behavioral health specialties, which has been frozen since 1997 while the psychiatrist shortage has deepened?"
2. "Will you co-sponsor the Mental Health Access Improvement Act to allow licensed counselors and therapists to bill Medicare directly?"
3. "What is your plan to address the mental health provider shortage in [rural/underserved areas of your district]?"
4. "Do you support expanding the National Health Service Corps behavioral health program and increasing loan repayment awards to attract providers to underserved communities?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who specifically address workforce supply, not just insurance coverage -- coverage without providers is an empty promise
- Pay attention to candidates' positions on scope-of-practice reform; candidates aligned with physician lobbies may oppose expanding NP and psychologist roles
- Check whether candidates support sustained appropriations for NHSC and BHWET, not just one-time authorizations
- The Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee are the key committees for mental health workforce legislation; members of these committees have outsized influence

## Professional Actions

- **For Behavioral Health Providers**: Join your professional association's advocacy arm (APA, NASW, AANP, ACA) and participate in lobby days, public comment campaigns, and candidate forums. Your expertise lends credibility to advocacy.
- **For Primary Care Physicians**: Advocate within your practice and health system for Collaborative Care Model implementation. Train to use psychiatric consultation codes (99492-99494) and advocate for embedded behavioral health in your practice.
- **For Educators**: Partner with behavioral health graduate programs to offer clinical training placements. If you lead an HBCU, HSI, or Tribal College, explore HRSA pipeline partnerships for behavioral health diversity.
- **For Employers and HR Leaders**: Expand Employee Assistance Program (EAP) coverage and advocate for adequate behavioral health networks in your company's insurance plans. Report ghost networks to your insurer and state regulator.
- **For Students**: Explore careers in behavioral health, particularly psychiatry, psychiatric nursing, and clinical social work. Investigate NHSC scholarships and loan repayment programs before taking on debt. Consider practicing in an underserved area -- the need is greatest and the federal support is strongest.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing the mental health workforce shortage with others, emphasize:

1. **The shortage is massive and measurable**: More than 160 million Americans live in federally designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, and HRSA estimates the nation needs 8,220 additional practitioners just to remove existing shortage designations (HRSA, 2024).
2. **The shortage has real consequences**: 55% of U.S. counties have zero psychiatrists (NAMI, 2023). The average wait for a new psychiatric appointment is 48 days. Only 35.7% of psychiatrists accept new Medicaid patients (MACPAC, 2023).
3. **The training pipeline has been frozen for decades**: The Medicare GME cap has been virtually unchanged since 1997. Psychiatry residency programs fill at 99.7%, meaning demand for training far exceeds available slots (NRMP, 2024).
4. **Solutions exist and are proven**: The CCBHC model has demonstrated that cost-based reimbursement raises salaries 15-25%, reduces turnover to 18-22%, and expands access (NCCBH, 2023). The NHSC places providers in shortage areas with 80% one-year retention (HRSA, 2022). Scope-of-practice reform can add tens of thousands of providers to Medicare at minimal cost.
5. **Investment pays for itself**: Untreated mental illness costs the U.S. economy $280 billion annually in lost productivity, disability, and premature mortality (Lancet Commission, 2024). Workforce investment is infrastructure, not charity.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "There are enough therapists -- people just don't want help" | 160+ million Americans live in areas with officially designated provider shortages; the problem is supply, not demand | HRSA, 2024 |
| "Telehealth has solved the access problem" | Telehealth extends reach but does not increase the total number of trained providers; only ~700,000 licensed behavioral health professionals serve 330+ million Americans | BLS/HRSA, 2023-2024 |
| "Expanding who can prescribe medications is dangerous" | States that allow psychologist prescribing and NP full practice authority show no increase in adverse events; the DoD has used prescribing psychologists safely since 1991 | Idaho Board of Psychologists, 2023; Cochrane Review, 2023 |
| "The market will fix the shortage if government gets out of the way" | The populations with the greatest need (rural, Medicaid, uninsured) have the least ability to pay; no market signal can make it profitable to practice in a rural county at 72% of already-low Medicare rates | MACPAC, 2023 |
| "We just need to train more psychiatrists" | The psychiatrist pipeline is important but takes 12+ years (college through residency). Expanding the full behavioral health workforce -- NPs, social workers, counselors, peer specialists -- can produce results in 2-5 years | AAMC/HRSA, 2023-2024 |
