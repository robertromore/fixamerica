# Mental Health Workforce Shortage: Legislation

## Overview

The mental health workforce shortage requires a comprehensive legislative response across four domains: training pipeline expansion, reimbursement reform, scope-of-practice modernization, and workforce sustainability. Because workforce policy is distributed across federal and state authority -- with the federal government controlling GME funding, Medicare reimbursement, and grant programs, while states control licensing and scope of practice -- the legislative strategy must operate at both levels. The approach taken here is to pursue the most impactful federal reforms first (GME expansion, Medicare scope reform, NHSC tripling) while providing incentives and model legislation for state-level action on licensing and scope.

No constitutional amendments are required for workforce reform. The federal government has clear authority under the Spending Clause to condition Medicare and Medicaid payments, fund training programs, and set provider eligibility for federal programs. State authority over licensing and scope of practice is well-established but can be influenced through federal funding conditions and interstate compacts.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments required for this reform. All proposed legislation operates within established federal spending, commerce, and conditional-funding powers.*

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To expand the behavioral health workforce by increasing Graduate
Medical Education positions, tripling the National Health Service
Corps behavioral health program, modernizing Medicare provider
eligibility, investing in workforce diversity, and reducing
clinician burnout.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Behavioral Health Workforce
Expansion Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Health Resources and Services Administration
(2024), more than 160 million Americans live in federally
designated Mental Health Health Professional Shortage Areas
(HPSAs), and the nation requires 8,220 additional practitioners
to remove existing HPSA designations.

(2) Fifty-five percent of U.S. counties lack any psychiatrist,
and the average wait for a new psychiatric appointment exceeds
48 days (NAMI, 2023).

(3) The Medicare Graduate Medical Education cap, imposed by the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, has constrained physician training
for over 25 years. The psychiatry residency match fill rate of
99.7 percent (NRMP, 2024) demonstrates that demand for training
far exceeds available positions.

(4) Only 35.7 percent of psychiatrists accept new Medicaid
patients, compared to 74.3 percent of physicians overall
(MACPAC, 2023), reflecting systematically low reimbursement for
behavioral health services.

(5) An estimated 180,000 licensed professional counselors and
60,000 licensed marriage and family therapists are excluded from
direct Medicare billing, reducing the effective provider supply
for Medicare beneficiaries.

(6) Burnout affects 40 to 60 percent of behavioral health
professionals, and annual turnover in community mental health
centers reaches 30 to 40 percent (Annapolis Coalition, 2023),
further reducing the effective workforce.

(7) The behavioral health workforce is substantially less
racially and ethnically diverse than the U.S. population.
Eighty-three percent of psychologists are White, and only 4
percent are Black (APA, 2023), creating barriers to culturally
responsive care.

(8) Untreated mental illness costs the U.S. economy an estimated
$280 billion annually in lost productivity, disability, and
premature mortality (Lancet Commission, 2024).

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual basis for Congressional action using current data from HRSA, NRMP, MACPAC, and other authoritative sources. Findings establish both the scale of the shortage and its economic cost to justify the appropriations requested.
- **Section 4 (GME Expansion)**: Addresses the structural constraint imposed by the 1997 GME cap. The 5,000-slot expansion is targeted exclusively at behavioral health specialties, with community-based training requirements and post-training service obligations to ensure new physicians practice where they are needed most.
- **Section 5 (NHSC Expansion)**: Triples the most effective existing federal program for placing providers in shortage areas. The $100,000 loan repayment and Career NHSC track address the 55% five-year retention problem by creating ongoing incentives for long-term practice in HPSAs.
- **Section 6 (LPC/LMFT Medicare)**: Adds an estimated 240,000 providers to the Medicare-eligible workforce at minimal cost. CBO has scored similar provisions as approximately budget-neutral because these providers serve patients who currently go unserved.
- **Section 7 (PMHNP Full Practice Authority)**: Eliminates Medicare supervision requirements for psychiatric NPs, aligning federal policy with evidence showing equivalent outcomes. The 85% payment rate follows existing Medicare NP payment precedent.
- **Section 8 (Diversity Pipeline)**: Addresses the demographic gap (psychology is 83% White) through sustained investment in pipeline partnerships with minority-serving institutions.
- **Section 9 (Burnout Reduction)**: Targets the root causes of workforce attrition -- administrative burden, inadequate supervision, and unsustainable caseloads -- through grants and evidence-based standards.
- **Section 10 (Peer Specialists)**: Professionalizes and scales the peer specialist workforce through national certification and mandatory Medicaid coverage with a wage floor.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| CMS publishes proposed rules for LPC/LMFT Medicare billing | 180 days after enactment | CMS |
| HRSA publishes GME slot allocation methodology | 12 months after enactment | HRSA |
| NHSC expanded program operational | 12 months after enactment | HRSA |
| SAMHSA publishes national peer specialist certification standards | 18 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| First new GME residents begin training | 24 months after enactment | Teaching hospitals |
| Diversity Pipeline first cohort enrolled | 18 months after enactment | HRSA / educational institutions |
| Burnout Reduction Initiative grants awarded | 12 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| All states covering peer specialist services under Medicaid | 24 months after enactment | CMS / State Medicaid agencies |

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS administers Medicare provider enrollment and GME payments. HRSA administers the NHSC, BHWET, and Diversity Pipeline. SAMHSA administers CCBHC standards, peer specialist certification, and burnout reduction grants.

**Challenges**:

- **Cost**: Total new authorizations exceed $4.5 billion annually. Fiscal conservatives will oppose the spending even with evidence of long-term cost offsets.
- **Physician opposition**: The AMA and American Psychiatric Association may oppose Sections 6 and 7 (LPC/LMFT Medicare billing and PMHNP full practice authority) as scope-of-practice expansion.
- **State resistance to peer specialist Medicaid mandate**: Some states may resist the mandatory Medicaid coverage requirement as an unfunded mandate.
- **GME slot capture**: Established academic medical centers may lobby to weaken the community-based training requirements in Section 4.

**Refinements**:

- **Phase the cost**: If full funding is not achievable, prioritize Sections 5 (NHSC) and 6 (LPC/LMFT Medicare) as the highest-impact, lowest-cost provisions.
- **Compromise on NP payment**: If the 85% rate is politically contentious, begin at 80% with a scheduled increase to 85% over three years.
- **Strengthen community-based GME requirements**: Add enforcement mechanisms -- such as clawback provisions for hospitals that fail to maintain community-based training partnerships -- to prevent slot capture.

## State Model Legislation

### Model Behavioral Health Scope-of-Practice Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Modernize state licensing and scope-of-practice laws to allow all behavioral health professionals to practice to the full extent of their training, adopt interstate licensing compacts, and establish career ladder pathways for peer specialists.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize based on existing licensing frameworks, provider supply, and legislative history. States that already grant NP full practice authority or psychologist prescribing can omit those provisions. All states should adopt the interstate compact provisions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State]
Behavioral Health Scope-of-Practice Modernization Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(a) [State] has [number] designated Mental Health Health
Professional Shortage Areas, and [percentage] of counties lack
any psychiatrist.

(b) Scope-of-practice restrictions prevent qualified behavioral
health professionals from serving patients to the full extent
of their training.

(c) Interstate licensing barriers prevent qualified providers
from other states from serving [State] residents via telehealth
or upon relocation.

SECTION 3. FULL PRACTICE AUTHORITY FOR ADVANCED PRACTICE
REGISTERED NURSES.

(a) A psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner licensed in
this State may diagnose, treat, and prescribe medications for
mental health and substance use conditions without physician
supervision or collaborative practice agreement.

(b) This section applies to all practice settings, including
independent practice, group practice, and employment by health
care facilities.

SECTION 4. PSYCHOLOGIST PRESCRIPTIVE AUTHORITY.

(a) A licensed psychologist who completes a postdoctoral
psychopharmacology training program approved by the Board of
Psychology may apply for a prescriptive authority certificate.

(b) A psychologist with a prescriptive authority certificate may
prescribe psychotropic medications for conditions within the
scope of their practice.

(c) The Board of Psychology shall establish requirements for
prescriptive authority training, including not fewer than
[number consistent with other states, typically 400] hours of
didactic education in psychopharmacology and [number, typically
500] hours of supervised prescribing experience.

SECTION 5. INTERSTATE LICENSING COMPACTS.

(a) [State] hereby adopts and enacts the Psychology
Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT) as set forth in the
model compact language.

(b) [State] hereby adopts and enacts the Counseling Compact
as set forth in the model compact language.

(c) [State] hereby adopts and enacts the Social Work Licensure
Compact as set forth in the model compact language.

SECTION 6. PEER SPECIALIST CAREER LADDER.

(a) The Department of Health shall establish a tiered peer
specialist certification system with progression from entry
level to supervisory and training roles.

(b) Medicaid reimbursement rates for peer specialist services
shall be set at levels sufficient to support compensation of
not less than $20 per hour for entry-level certified peer
specialists and $28 per hour for advanced certified peer
specialists.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through CMS, HRSA, and SAMHSA.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Medicare Provider Enrollment for LPCs/LMFTs**: CMS must issue regulations defining eligibility, billing codes, and payment rates within 180 days of enactment.
2. **GME Slot Allocation**: HRSA and CMS must publish an allocation methodology defining how 5,000 new slots will be distributed, with criteria for community-based training site requirements. Deadline: 12 months after enactment.
3. **Peer Specialist National Certification Standards**: SAMHSA must publish proposed standards within 12 months and final standards within 18 months, including training hour requirements, competency domains, and reciprocity provisions.
4. **Burnout Reduction Grant Program**: SAMHSA must publish a Notice of Funding Opportunity for the Burnout Reduction Initiative within 9 months of enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Hospitals receiving new GME slots that fail to maintain community-based training partnerships are subject to clawback of GME payments. Penalty: 150% of the per-slot cost for each year of non-compliance.
- **Administrative Actions**: States that fail to implement mandatory Medicaid peer specialist coverage within 24 months are subject to reduction in federal Medicaid matching funds for behavioral health services.
- **Private Right of Action**: Medicare beneficiaries denied access to LPC, LMFT, or PMHNP services covered under this Act may file complaints with CMS and with the HHS Office of Inspector General.
- **Reporting and Transparency**: All federal grantees must report annual data on workforce supply, demographic composition, burnout rates, and patient access metrics. Data are publicly available through the HRSA workforce data system.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: The federal government has broad authority under the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8) to condition Medicare and Medicaid payments on provider eligibility, training requirements, and reimbursement standards. All provisions in this Act operate within established spending authority. Medicare billing eligibility for LPCs and LMFTs follows the same constitutional framework as existing coverage of clinical social workers and psychologists.

**Commerce Clause**: Federal incentives for interstate licensing compact adoption operate under the Commerce Clause, which supports federal action to reduce barriers to interstate commerce -- including the interstate practice of licensed professions via telehealth.

**Tenth Amendment / Federalism**: Section 7 (PMHNP full practice authority under Medicare) does not preempt state licensing laws for non-Medicare practice. It establishes that, for purposes of furnishing and billing Medicare services, federal standards apply. States retain full authority over licensing, discipline, and scope of practice for all non-Medicare patients. This follows the precedent of the VA and DoD, which apply federal practice standards regardless of state law.

### Preemption

This Act does not broadly preempt state licensing or scope-of-practice laws. Federal provisions apply only to Medicare billing and federally funded programs. States retain authority to regulate all other practice. The interstate compact provisions in the model state legislation are voluntary state adoptions, not federal preemptions.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is enforced through three mechanisms: (1) CMS conditions of participation for Medicare providers, (2) HRSA grant conditions for NHSC, BHWET, and Diversity Pipeline recipients, and (3) SAMHSA certification standards for CCBHCs and peer specialist programs. The HHS Office of Inspector General conducts audits. Whistleblower protections apply to employees of federally funded programs who report non-compliance.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| GME slot capture by academic medical centers | Established AMCs could satisfy "partnership" requirements through nominal agreements with community sites while training residents primarily in academic settings | High | Require that residents spend at least 50% of training time physically present at community-based sites; annual HRSA audits of training site utilization |
| Ghost networks persist despite expanded provider types | Insurers add newly Medicare-eligible LPCs and LMFTs to directories without confirming they are accepting patients, maintaining phantom networks | High | Pair this Act with network adequacy enforcement legislation requiring annual directory audits with penalties for inaccurate listings |
| NHSC service obligation circumvention | Providers could complete the minimum 2-year NHSC obligation then immediately relocate to higher-paying markets | Medium | The Career NHSC track addresses this, but providers who leave after 2 years face no penalty; consider extending the minimum obligation to 3 years |
| Peer specialist wage floor applies only to federally funded programs | Employers not receiving federal funds could continue paying peer specialists below $20/hour | Medium | Encourage states to adopt the $20/hour floor in state legislation; include the wage floor in CCBHC certification standards, which cover the largest peer specialist employers |
| Diversity Pipeline participants do not enter behavioral health careers | Students could accept scholarships and stipends but pursue careers outside behavioral health | Low | Require service obligations (3 years in behavioral health practice in an HPSA) for recipients of graduate-level funding; clawback provisions for non-completion |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| GME pipeline is inherently slow (12+ years from medical school to independent practice) | Psychiatrist supply will not increase meaningfully for 8-10 years | Medical training length cannot be compressed | Pair GME expansion with faster-impact strategies (scope reform, NHSC, peer specialists) that expand effective capacity in 1-3 years |
| Diversity Pipeline effects are long-term (5-10 years) | Workforce demographic parity will not be achieved within a single authorization cycle | Educational pipeline length and systemic barriers | Begin at the undergraduate level; invest simultaneously in faculty diversity; supplement with recruitment of internationally trained providers |
| Act does not directly set Medicaid reimbursement rates | States with very low Medicaid rates will continue to have difficulty attracting providers even with expanded supply | Medicaid rates are set by states, not the federal government | Use enhanced federal matching (90/10 for CCBHCs) to incentivize adequate state payment; MACPAC recommendations for Medicaid behavioral health rate floors |
| Burnout reduction is difficult to mandate and measure | Grant-funded interventions may not be sustained when funding ends | Burnout is driven by structural conditions (underfunding, caseloads) not amenable to time-limited grants | Tie burnout metrics to CCBHC recertification and ongoing Medicaid reimbursement; build sustainability requirements into grants |
| Federal scope changes apply only to Medicare | Patients with commercial insurance or Medicaid still face state-level scope restrictions | Federalism; state authority over licensing | Provide federal incentives for state scope reform; model state legislation included above |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen GME community-based training enforcement**: Add a provision requiring HRSA to publish annual audits of training site utilization. Hospitals where residents spend less than 50% of training time at community sites forfeit new slots, which are reallocated to compliant institutions.
2. **Extend NHSC minimum service obligation**: Amend Section 5(c) to require a 3-year (rather than 2-year) initial service commitment for the enhanced $100,000 loan repayment. The Career NHSC track remains available for longer commitments.
3. **Add network adequacy enforcement**: Include a provision requiring CMS and state regulators to audit behavioral health provider directories annually. Insurers with ghost network rates exceeding 15% face civil penalties of $100 per inaccurate listing per month.
4. **Create Medicaid behavioral health rate floor**: Add a provision requiring states receiving enhanced CCBHC matching funds to set Medicaid behavioral health reimbursement at not less than 80% of Medicare rates within 3 years.
5. **Build sustainability into burnout reduction grants**: Require grantees to submit sustainability plans within 18 months and demonstrate institutional commitment to sustaining interventions beyond the grant period.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The GME expansion and NHSC expansion provisions are permanent authorizations. The Diversity Pipeline and Burnout Reduction Initiative are authorized for 5 years with mandatory reauthorization. All provisions are subject to:

- **Five-year independent evaluation**: Contracted by SAMHSA at Year 5, covering program effectiveness, equity outcomes, and cost-effectiveness.
- **Biennial GAO audit**: The Government Accountability Office shall audit the GME slot allocation, NHSC retention rates, and Diversity Pipeline outcomes at 2-year intervals.
- **Annual Congressional report**: The Secretary submits annual progress reports as required by Section 11.
