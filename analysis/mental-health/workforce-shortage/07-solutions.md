# Mental Health Workforce Shortage: Solutions

Addressing the mental health workforce shortage requires a multi-faceted approach that expands the training pipeline, reforms reimbursement, modernizes scope-of-practice laws, invests in workforce diversity, and builds sustainable career pathways across all levels of the behavioral health system.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Workforce expansion must be paired with reimbursement reform; training more providers without making public-sector practice financially sustainable will not solve the shortage
- Scope-of-practice laws should reflect evidence, not professional turf; every provider should practice to the full extent of their training
- The workforce must reflect the communities it serves; diversity is not an add-on but a core quality indicator
- Retention is as important as recruitment; reducing burnout and turnover is the fastest way to expand effective capacity
- The peer specialist and community health worker workforce is a critical component of the system, not a substitute for clinical care

### Theory of Change

The workforce shortage is driven by a set of interconnected structural problems: insufficient training capacity, inadequate reimbursement, restrictive scope-of-practice laws, high educational debt, and unsustainable working conditions. Addressing any one factor in isolation will produce modest gains at best. The theory of change is that simultaneous action across all five dimensions -- pipeline, payment, scope, diversity, and retention -- will create a virtuous cycle in which more providers enter the field, more are willing to serve underserved populations, better working conditions reduce turnover, and the system reaches a new equilibrium of adequate supply.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Lift the Graduate Medical Education Cap for Behavioral Health Specialties

**Description**: Enact legislation to create 5,000 new Medicare-funded GME residency slots specifically designated for psychiatry, addiction psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, and consultation-liaison psychiatry. Require that at least 50% of new slots be based in community health centers, CCBHCs, or rural training sites rather than academic medical centers.

**Evidence Base**: The GME cap imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has constrained the physician pipeline for over 25 years. The psychiatry match fill rate of 99.7% (NRMP, 2024) confirms that demand for training far exceeds available positions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 authorized only 1,000 new slots across all specialties over five years -- a marginal response to a structural problem.

**Implementation**: Amend the Social Security Act to increase the GME cap. HRSA and CMS would administer the allocation, with preference for teaching hospitals that partner with community-based training sites in HPSAs. New slots would phase in over five years.

**Cost/Resources**: Approximately $750 million-$900 million per year at full enrollment ($150,000-$180,000 per slot per year). Total 10-year cost: $7.5-9 billion.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; first new residents begin in Year 3; full pipeline impact by Year 10.

**Challenges**: Cost; opposition from fiscal conservatives; existing teaching hospitals may capture new slots unless community-based requirements are enforced.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of new psychiatry residents trained per year; percentage training in community/rural sites; residents entering practice in HPSAs within 3 years of completion.

### Solution 2: Triple the National Health Service Corps Behavioral Health Program

**Description**: Increase annual NHSC funding from $966 million (FY2024, total program) to $3 billion, with at least $1.5 billion dedicated to behavioral health placements. Increase the loan repayment award from $50,000 to $100,000 for a two-year commitment, and create a new "career NHSC" track offering ongoing salary supplementation for providers who remain in HPSAs beyond their initial obligation.

**Evidence Base**: The NHSC is the most effective federal program for placing providers in underserved areas. Current behavioral health participants (~6,800) represent only a fraction of the 8,220 providers HRSA estimates are needed to eliminate HPSA designations. The program's 80% one-year retention rate is strong, but the drop to 55% at five years suggests that ongoing incentives -- not just initial loan repayment -- are needed to sustain placement.

**Implementation**: Congressional appropriation increase; HRSA administers expanded program. "Career NHSC" participants would receive $25,000 annual salary supplements for each additional year in an HPSA beyond the initial obligation, up to 10 years.

**Cost/Resources**: $3 billion annually (up from ~$966 million). Net cost offset by reduced emergency department utilization and improved population health in HPSAs.

**Timeline**: Appropriation in Year 1; expanded placements begin in Year 2; full scale by Year 4.

**Challenges**: Requires annual appropriation; fiscal environment may limit growth; rural practice amenities (housing, schools) also affect retention.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of behavioral health NHSC participants; five-year retention rate; HPSA designations removed.

### Solution 3: Enact Federal Scope-of-Practice Modernization for Medicare

**Description**: Amend the Social Security Act to (a) grant direct Medicare billing authority to licensed professional counselors (LPCs) and licensed marriage and family therapists (LMFTs), (b) establish a federal standard for full practice authority for psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioners under Medicare, and (c) create a Medicare benefit for psychologist prescribing services in states that authorize prescriptive authority.

**Evidence Base**: LPCs and LMFTs are currently excluded from direct Medicare reimbursement, reducing the effective supply of providers for Medicare beneficiaries by tens of thousands. The Mental Health Access Improvement Act (H.R. 828 / S. 828, introduced in multiple Congresses) would address this for counselors and therapists. Research consistently shows that NP care outcomes are comparable to physician care for conditions within NP scope (Cochrane Review, 2023). States with psychologist prescriptive authority report no increase in adverse events (Idaho Board of Psychologists, 2023).

**Implementation**: Congressional legislation amending Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. CMS would issue implementing regulations within 12 months. States retain authority over their own licensing and scope laws; the federal action applies only to Medicare billing.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct federal cost; CBO has scored the Mental Health Access Improvement Act as approximately budget-neutral because it adds providers who would serve Medicare patients currently going unserved, not displacing existing providers.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; CMS implementation within 12 months; provider enrollment begins in Year 2.

**Challenges**: AMA and physician organization opposition; state medical society lobbying; concerns about fragmenting the care team.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of LPCs/LMFTs billing Medicare; wait times for Medicare behavioral health appointments; out-of-network utilization rates.

### Solution 4: Scale the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Model Nationwide

**Description**: Make the CCBHC model permanent and universal by requiring all states to participate and providing federal matching funds for the cost-based Prospective Payment System (PPS) that defines the model. Currently, CCBHCs in 46 states demonstrate that adequate reimbursement increases staff salaries by 15-25%, reduces turnover to 18-22% (vs. 30-40% in traditional CMHCs), and expands access to crisis, substance use, and integrated care services.

**Evidence Base**: The CCBHC demonstration has produced strong results since its launch in 2017. The National Council for Mental Wellbeing reports that CCBHCs serve 10 million people annually, have increased staff compensation by 15-25% above traditional CMHC levels, and reduced turnover rates to 18-22% (NCCBH, 2023). CCBHCs also reduce emergency department psychiatric visits by 18-25% in their service areas (SAMHSA, 2024).

**Implementation**: Congress would enact legislation making CCBHC certification and PPS reimbursement a permanent Medicaid option, with enhanced federal matching funds (90/10 for the first three years, stepping down to 75/25). SAMHSA would set certification standards; CMS would administer payment.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $4-6 billion annually in additional federal Medicaid spending, partially offset by reductions in emergency department utilization and incarceration costs.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; all states participating by Year 3; full network by Year 5.

**Challenges**: State opt-in resistance; cost; capacity of existing organizations to meet CCBHC standards.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of operational CCBHCs; staff compensation levels; turnover rates; access metrics (wait times, patients served).

### Solution 5: Establish a National Behavioral Health Workforce Diversity Pipeline

**Description**: Create a $500 million annual federal program to recruit, train, and retain Black, Latino, Native American, and other underrepresented individuals in behavioral health careers. The program would fund undergraduate scholarships, graduate stipends, mentorship programs, and pipeline partnerships between HBCUs, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges, and behavioral health graduate programs.

**Evidence Base**: The behavioral health workforce is substantially less diverse than the U.S. population (psychology is 83% White; only 4% of psychologists are Black; APA 2023). Research consistently shows that racial and linguistic concordance between providers and patients improves treatment engagement, therapeutic alliance, and outcomes (Cabral & Smith, 2011; Alegria et al., 2013). The current diversity gap is a quality problem, not just an equity problem.

**Implementation**: HRSA would administer the program through competitive grants to educational institutions, with priority for partnerships that include community-based training sites. Funding would cover tuition, stipends, and post-graduation supervision support.

**Cost/Resources**: $500 million annually. Ten-year total: $5 billion.

**Timeline**: Program design in Year 1; first cohort enters training in Year 2; initial graduates in workforce by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Requires sustained appropriations; pipeline effects are long-term (5-10 years); faculty diversity is also limited.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of underrepresented students entering and completing behavioral health training; demographic composition of the workforce over time; patient satisfaction among minority populations.

### Solution 6: Create a National Behavioral Health Burnout Reduction Initiative

**Description**: Invest $300 million annually in evidence-based interventions to reduce burnout and improve retention in behavioral health settings. Components include: (a) federal grants for electronic health record (EHR) simplification and administrative burden reduction, (b) funding for peer consultation and clinical supervision for early-career providers, (c) mandated staff-to-patient ratios in federally funded behavioral health programs, and (d) expansion of Employee Assistance Programs for behavioral health workers.

**Evidence Base**: Burnout affects 40-60% of behavioral health professionals (SAMHSA/APA, 2023), and annual turnover in community mental health settings reaches 30-40% (Annapolis Coalition, 2023). Evidence from the VA and from high-performing health systems shows that structured clinical supervision, reduced documentation burden, and manageable caseloads can reduce burnout rates by 30-50% (Shanafelt et al., 2015; West et al., 2016).

**Implementation**: SAMHSA would administer grants for EHR reform and supervision funding. CMS would tie staffing standards to CCBHC certification and Medicaid participation.

**Cost/Resources**: $300 million annually. Offset by reduced turnover-related costs (estimated $50,000-$100,000 per provider replacement).

**Timeline**: Grant program launches in Year 1; measurable burnout reduction by Year 3.

**Challenges**: Provider resistance to staffing mandates; EHR vendor resistance to simplification; defining and measuring burnout consistently.

**Impact Metrics**: Clinician burnout rates; annual turnover rates; average caseload size; provider satisfaction surveys.

### Solution 7: Professionalize and Scale the Peer Specialist Workforce

**Description**: Establish national certification standards for peer specialists through SAMHSA, require Medicaid reimbursement for peer services in all states, set a minimum hourly wage for peer specialists at $20/hour in federally funded programs, and create a career ladder that allows peer specialists to advance into supervisory and training roles.

**Evidence Base**: Peer support services reduce psychiatric hospitalization by 18-25% and improve treatment engagement (Davidson et al., 2012; Chinman et al., 2014). Currently, 46 states reimburse peer services through Medicaid, but rates and standards vary widely. The average peer specialist hourly wage of $17.50 (BLS, 2023) is below a living wage in most markets, contributing to high turnover.

**Implementation**: SAMHSA sets national certification standards; CMS requires Medicaid coverage; Congress mandates minimum wage in federally funded programs. Career ladder defined in partnership with the peer workforce community.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal additional federal cost (Medicaid already covers most peer services; wage floor applies only to federally funded programs).

**Timeline**: Standards and mandate in Year 1; implementation by Year 2.

**Challenges**: Resistance from some clinical professionals who view peers as unqualified; balancing standardization with lived-experience authenticity.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of certified peer specialists; average wage; retention rate; hospitalization rates among clients receiving peer services.

## International Models

### United Kingdom: NHS Increasing Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)

**Description**: The UK's IAPT program, launched in 2008, trained tens of thousands of new psychological therapists through a standardized curriculum focused on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety. The program created an entirely new workforce tier of "psychological wellbeing practitioners" who provide evidence-based brief interventions.

**Results**: By 2023, IAPT was treating over 1.2 million people annually with a 50% recovery rate for depression and anxiety (NHS England, 2023). The program demonstrated that large-scale, rapid workforce expansion is possible when backed by national investment and standardized training.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The U.S. could adapt the IAPT model through a federally funded brief-intervention training program for master's-level clinicians. The key lesson is that standardized, evidence-based training can produce a large, effective workforce tier relatively quickly (2-3 years).

### Australia: Better Access Program

**Description**: Australia's Better Access program (2006) expanded Medicare rebates for psychological services provided by clinical psychologists, registered psychologists, social workers, and occupational therapists. Patients can receive up to 10 Medicare-subsidized sessions per year with a GP referral.

**Results**: Mental health service utilization increased by 46% in the first three years (AIHW, 2023). Rural access improved through telehealth integration. The program demonstrated that reimbursement expansion -- not just training expansion -- is essential to increasing access.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Better Access model supports the case for Medicare reimbursement of LPCs and LMFTs, and for integrating behavioral health into primary care referral networks.

### Canada: Collaborative Care in Ontario

**Description**: Ontario's Inter-professional Mental Health and Addictions Teams embed behavioral health professionals in primary care practices, funded through capitated team-based payments rather than fee-for-service.

**Results**: Wait times for behavioral health services in participating practices decreased by 60%, and emergency department visits for mental health decreased by 25% (Health Quality Ontario, 2022).

**Applicability to U.S.**: Supports the Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) already endorsed by CMS. The Canadian experience shows that integration works best with team-based payment models, not bolt-on fee-for-service.

## Complementary Policies

- **Insurance parity enforcement**: Strengthening enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act ensures that expanded supply is matched by functional insurance coverage. See [Insurance Parity](../insurance-parity/01-overview.md).
- **Crisis services infrastructure**: The 988 system requires a robust crisis workforce; workforce expansion and 988 staffing must be coordinated. See [Crisis Services](../crisis-services/01-overview.md).
- **Primary care integration**: The Collaborative Care Model requires behavioral health providers embedded in primary care; workforce development must include integrated care training.
- **Telehealth policy**: Permanent telehealth flexibilities and interstate licensing compacts maximize the reach of existing providers while the pipeline expands. See [Telehealth](../telehealth/01-overview.md).
