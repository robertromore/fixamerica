# Mental Health Workforce Shortage

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of the mental health workforce crisis in the United States, examining provider shortages, geographic maldistribution, training pipeline constraints, and strategies for expanding access to care.

## Overview

The United States faces a severe and worsening shortage of mental health professionals at every level of the care continuum. Over 160 million Americans live in federally designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas, and the gap between the demand for mental health services and the available supply of providers continues to widen. The shortage is most acute in rural areas, communities of color, and among specialists who serve children and adolescents or treat serious mental illness.

This analysis examines the structural factors driving provider shortages, including constrained training pipelines, inadequate reimbursement rates, high rates of clinician burnout, restrictive scope-of-practice laws, and the failure to build a diverse workforce that reflects the communities it serves. It explores federal programs such as the National Health Service Corps, Graduate Medical Education funding, and the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic model, and proposes a comprehensive set of reforms to expand, diversify, and sustain the behavioral health workforce.
