# Mental Health Workforce Shortage: Stakeholders

The mental health workforce shortage is shaped by the interactions of providers, patients, professional organizations, insurers, government agencies, educational institutions, and advocacy groups, each with distinct interests, resources, and levels of power.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| People seeking mental health care | Cannot access timely treatment; long wait times (avg. 48 days for new psychiatric appointment); delayed care worsens outcomes | 57.8 million adults with mental illness (SAMHSA, 2023) | Timely access to affordable, culturally responsive care |
| Behavioral health providers | Overwork, burnout, inadequate pay, administrative burden | ~700,000 licensed professionals | Fair compensation, manageable caseloads, reduced paperwork |
| Children and adolescents | Youth mental health crisis with insufficient child/adolescent specialists; school-based services lacking | 7.7 million youth with treatable mental health conditions (NAMI, 2023) | Access to age-appropriate care, school-based services |
| Rural communities | Geographic isolation from providers; 55% of counties lack any psychiatrist | ~60 million rural Americans | Any local provider access; telehealth; traveling clinicians |
| People with serious mental illness (SMI) | Most severe shortage of specialized providers; difficulty accessing medication management | ~14.1 million adults with SMI (SAMHSA, 2023) | Consistent access to psychiatrists and intensive services |
| Communities of color | Workforce lacks diversity; cultural and linguistic barriers; historical mistrust | Disproportionately affected populations | Culturally responsive care, providers who share backgrounds |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Primary care physicians**: Absorb unmet behavioral health demand; prescribe 79% of antidepressants despite limited psychiatric training (AMA, 2023)
- **Emergency departments**: Serve as default crisis care when community providers are unavailable; psychiatric boarding is a nationwide problem
- **Employers**: Workforce mental health affects productivity; employee assistance programs face same provider shortages; estimated $47.6 billion annual cost of untreated mental illness in lost productivity (NAMI, 2023)
- **Criminal justice system**: Jails and prisons house people with mental illness due to community treatment gaps; estimated 44% of jail inmates have a mental health condition (DOJ, 2023)
- **Family caregivers**: Approximately 8.4 million Americans serve as unpaid caregivers for adults with mental illness, absorbing costs the system fails to provide (NAMI, 2023)

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Congress | Funds NHSC, GME, SAMHSA; sets Medicare policy | Legislative authority over federal spending, GME cap | Controls ~$280 billion annual HHS budget | High |
| Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) | Sets Medicare reimbursement; approves Medicaid waivers | Rate-setting, coverage determinations, GME payment | Administers $1.5 trillion in annual spending | High |
| Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) | Administers NHSC, BHWET, HPSA designations | HPSA designation, workforce grant programs | ~$966 million NHSC budget (FY2024) | High |
| SAMHSA | Administers block grants, CCBHC program, 988 | Grant-making, program standards, workforce training | ~$9.4 billion budget (FY2024) | High |
| State legislatures | Set scope-of-practice laws, Medicaid rates, licensing | Licensing authority, Medicaid administration | Varies by state | High (state level) |
| State licensing boards | Control entry to practice, discipline, reciprocity | Licensing, examination, continuing education | Varies | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **American Medical Association (AMA)**: The largest physician organization; opposes scope-of-practice expansion for non-physicians; influential in GME policy through lobbying and political contributions (~$25 million annual lobbying, OpenSecrets 2023)
- **American Psychiatric Association (APA - physician)**: Represents ~37,000 psychiatrists; advocates for GME expansion and higher reimbursement; opposes prescriptive authority for psychologists
- **American Psychological Association (APA - psychology)**: Represents ~122,000 psychologists; advocates for prescriptive authority, training funding, and Medicare reimbursement for psychologists
- **National Association of Social Workers (NASW)**: Represents ~120,000 social workers; advocates for higher pay, reduced administrative burden, and licensure portability
- **American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP)**: Represents ~355,000 NPs; advocates aggressively for full practice authority in all states
- **National Council for Mental Wellbeing (formerly National Council for Behavioral Health)**: Represents ~3,400 community behavioral health organizations; leads CCBHC advocacy
- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: Largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization; ~600 state and local affiliates; focuses on consumer/family perspectives

### Influencers

- **Insurance industry (AHIP, BlueCross BlueShield Association)**: Resist reimbursement rate increases; lobby against network adequacy mandates; ~$170 million annual federal lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2023)
- **Private equity firms in behavioral health**: Own growing share of therapy practices and psychiatric facilities; influence through market consolidation and pricing
- **Academic medical centers and teaching hospitals**: Control GME training slots; lobby to protect existing GME funding allocation formulas
- **Accreditation bodies (ACGME, APA-CoA, CSWE, CACREP)**: Set training standards that determine pipeline capacity and quality
- **Telehealth companies (Talkspace, BetterHelp, Cerebral)**: Growing influence on workforce practice patterns and public expectations; spend significantly on advertising

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAMI + NASW + AANP + patient advocates | Expand access through scope-of-practice reform and workforce expansion | Strong |
| Rural health organizations + NHSC + HRSA | Direct more providers to underserved areas through loan repayment and incentives | Strong |
| CCBHC operators + SAMHSA + National Council | Scale the CCBHC model with cost-based reimbursement | Strong |
| Primary care organizations + behavioral health groups | Integrate behavioral health into primary care through Collaborative Care Model | Moderate |
| Medical schools + residency programs + AAMC | Lift GME cap to expand all physician training | Moderate (but self-interested in funding formula) |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Physician organizations vs. NP/PA organizations**: The AMA and state medical societies oppose full NP practice authority, while AANP and AAPA advocate for it. This is the most intense and politically consequential conflict in mental health workforce policy.
- **Insurers vs. providers**: Insurers benefit from low reimbursement rates and narrow networks; providers want higher pay and reduced administrative burden. The two sides have fundamentally opposed financial interests.
- **Academic institutions vs. training sites**: Graduate schools benefit from high enrollment and tuition revenue; community agencies bear the cost of clinical training supervision without compensation.
- **Existing providers vs. expanded workforce**: Some established providers benefit from scarcity through higher fees and may be ambivalent about measures that would increase supply and reduce their market power.

### The Iron Triangle of Behavioral Health Underfunding

The shortage is maintained by an interlocking relationship among three powerful actors:

1. **Congress** sets low funding levels for NHSC, BHWET, and GME, constrained by budget pressures and the absence of a powerful behavioral health lobby
2. **CMS** sets low Medicare reimbursement rates that serve as benchmarks for commercial and Medicaid rates
3. **Insurers** use the resulting narrow networks and long wait times as a de facto rationing mechanism that holds down behavioral health spending

This triangle is sustained by the political weakness of mental health consumers relative to the organized power of the insurance and medical lobbies.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on policy:

- **Lobbying**: The AMA spent $25.3 million on federal lobbying in 2023; AHIP and major insurers spent a combined $170+ million; mental health advocacy organizations spent a combined ~$15 million -- a fraction of their opposition (OpenSecrets, 2023)
- **Campaign Contributions**: Health sector PACs contributed $321 million in the 2022 election cycle, with insurance and physician groups as the largest contributors. Mental health-specific contributions were minimal (OpenSecrets, 2023)
- **Revolving Door**: Former CMS and SAMHSA officials frequently move to insurance companies, pharmaceutical firms, or lobbying firms, creating alignment between regulators and the industries they oversee
- **Public Advocacy**: NAMI's grassroots network (~600 affiliates) generates constituent pressure on legislators; the 988 campaign demonstrated the power of public awareness to drive policy change
- **Expertise/Information**: Professional associations (APA, AMA, NASW) provide testimony, white papers, and data that shape legislative understanding of the workforce; their framing of the problem often reflects their institutional interests
