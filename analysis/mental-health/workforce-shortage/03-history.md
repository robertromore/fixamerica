# Mental Health Workforce Shortage: History

## Historical Development

The mental health workforce in the United States has been shaped by cycles of institutional expansion and contraction, shifting federal priorities, changing models of care, and the evolving relationship between medicine, psychology, social work, and other professions. Understanding this history is essential to grasping why the current shortage exists and why past reform attempts have fallen short.

### The Institutional Era (Pre-1960): Asylum-Based Workforce

- **State Hospital System**: From the mid-19th century through the 1950s, the primary locus of mental health care was the state psychiatric hospital. At their peak in 1955, state hospitals held approximately 560,000 patients. The workforce consisted primarily of psychiatrists (often in superintendent roles), nurses, and attendants, with minimal involvement of psychologists or social workers in direct care.
- **Psychiatrist Supply**: The number of psychiatrists was small -- fewer than 5,000 nationally in 1940 -- and heavily concentrated in institutional settings and a small number of urban private practices.
- **Clinical Psychology Emerges**: World War II was a turning point. The Veterans Administration (VA) needed thousands of professionals to treat returning servicemembers with "combat fatigue" (now PTSD) and other conditions. The VA funded graduate training programs in clinical psychology, creating the Boulder Model (scientist-practitioner) in 1949 and launching psychology as a clinical profession.
- **Psychiatric Social Work**: The profession of psychiatric social work grew out of settlement houses and child guidance clinics in the early 20th century, but remained small and low-paid. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) was founded in 1955.

### Deinstitutionalization and the Community Mental Health Era (1960-1980): Building a New Workforce

- **Community Mental Health Centers Act (1963)**: President Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) Construction Act, envisioning a national network of 2,000 community centers to replace state hospitals. The Act created enormous new demand for outpatient-trained mental health professionals -- demand the existing workforce could not meet.
- **Medicare and Medicaid (1965)**: The establishment of Medicare and Medicaid created new financing for mental health care but also introduced the payment structures that would come to shape workforce supply. Notably, the IMD exclusion (Institutions for Mental Diseases) barred federal Medicaid payment to psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds, accelerating deinstitutionalization without building corresponding community capacity.
- **Graduate Medical Education Funding**: The Medicare program began financing residency training through GME payments, establishing the mechanism that still funds the majority of physician training. Psychiatry residency positions grew modestly during this period.
- **National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Training Grants**: NIMH funded training in psychiatry, psychology, social work, and psychiatric nursing through direct grants to universities. At their peak in the 1970s, these grants supported thousands of trainees annually and were the primary federal investment in the behavioral health workforce pipeline.
- **Workforce Gap Emerges**: Deinstitutionalization moved hundreds of thousands of patients out of state hospitals between 1955 and 1980 (the census fell from 560,000 to approximately 130,000), but the community mental health workforce was never built to scale. Only about 750 of the planned 2,000 CMHCs were ever constructed. The gap between need and supply that defines the current crisis began here.

### Retrenchment and Managed Care (1980-2000): The Pipeline Contracts

- **Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (1981)**: The Reagan administration replaced categorical CMHC funding with the Mental Health Block Grant, cutting federal mental health funding by 25% and giving states broad discretion. Many states used the flexibility to shift funds away from workforce development.
- **NIMH Training Cuts**: Federal training grants through NIMH were dramatically reduced in the 1980s. By 1990, federal support for behavioral health training was a fraction of its 1970s level, and the pipeline stagnated.
- **Rise of Managed Care**: The expansion of managed behavioral health carve-outs in the 1990s compressed reimbursement rates, shortened inpatient stays, and imposed utilization review requirements. For providers, this meant lower pay, more paperwork, and less clinical autonomy -- factors that reduced the attractiveness of behavioral health careers.
- **Balanced Budget Act of 1997**: Congress capped the number of Medicare-funded GME residency slots at roughly 1997 levels (~100,000 total across all specialties). This cap, which remains in effect, froze the primary federal mechanism for expanding physician training, including psychiatry. It is widely regarded as the single most consequential structural barrier to expanding the psychiatrist supply.
- **Workforce Diversity Stalls**: Efforts to diversify the behavioral health workforce during this period were limited. The pipeline of Black, Latino, and Native American psychologists and psychiatrists remained far below population proportions.

### Mental Health Parity and the Access Crisis (2000-2019): Demand Rises, Supply Lags

- **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA, 2008)**: This landmark law required commercial insurers to cover behavioral health services on par with medical/surgical services. However, parity increased demand without correspondingly increasing supply, widening the gap between insured access and provider availability.
- **Affordable Care Act (2010)**: The ACA expanded Medicaid to millions of new enrollees and required behavioral health coverage in Essential Health Benefits. This further increased the number of people with insurance coverage for mental health care, but the provider workforce was already strained. Medicaid expansion states saw particularly acute shortages as new patients entered a system without enough providers to serve them.
- **National Health Service Corps Expansion**: The ACA significantly expanded NHSC funding, growing the behavioral health corps from approximately 2,000 participants in 2009 to over 5,000 by 2016. Behavioral health became the largest single category of NHSC placements.
- **988 Planning Begins**: The Federal Communications Commission recommended designating 988 as the national suicide and crisis hotline number in 2019, setting the stage for a massive expansion of crisis services that would require thousands of additional counselors and crisis workers.
- **Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner Growth**: The number of Psychiatric-Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) programs expanded rapidly in the 2010s, driven by demand and the growing acceptance of NP practice. PMHNPs became the fastest-growing segment of the prescribing mental health workforce.
- **Scope-of-Practice Battles**: Multiple states debated and sometimes enacted expanded scope of practice for psychologists (prescriptive authority), nurse practitioners (full practice authority), and counselors (Medicare reimbursement eligibility). These debates intensified as the shortage worsened but remained politically contentious.

### The Pandemic Era and Beyond (2020-Present): Crisis Meets Demand Surge

- **COVID-19 Impact on Demand**: The pandemic triggered a surge in anxiety, depression, substance use, and suicidality that persists to this day. Youth mental health reached crisis levels. Demand for behavioral health services increased 30-40% between 2019 and 2023 (APA, 2023), far outstripping supply growth.
- **Telehealth Revolution**: Emergency telehealth waivers during COVID-19 allowed providers to practice across state lines and prescribe controlled substances via telehealth. These flexibilities dramatically expanded access but remained temporary and dependent on annual extensions.
- **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline Launch (2022)**: The 988 system went live in July 2022, immediately increasing demand for trained crisis counselors. SAMHSA provided over $1 billion in initial funding, but staffing crisis call centers remains an ongoing challenge.
- **Burnout Crisis**: The pandemic worsened already-high burnout rates among behavioral health professionals. Surveys in 2022-2023 showed 40-60% of clinicians reporting burnout and 30% considering leaving the field (APA, SAMHSA). The workforce was simultaneously being asked to do more and losing members at an accelerated rate.
- **Consolidated Appropriations Act (2021)**: Congress authorized 1,000 new Medicare GME residency slots over five years (200 per year), the first increase in the GME cap since the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Psychiatry was among the targeted specialties, but 200 slots per year across all specialties is widely considered insufficient.
- **CCBHC Expansion**: The Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic model, which uses cost-based reimbursement rather than fee-for-service, expanded from 10 states in 2017 to 46 states by 2024. CCBHCs demonstrate that adequate reimbursement improves staff salaries, reduces turnover, and expands access.
- **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022)**: Included $1 billion for school-based mental health professionals and community mental health services, the largest single federal investment in behavioral health workforce in decades.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Demand Expansion Without Supply Investment

Every major expansion of mental health coverage or access -- community mental health centers, Medicaid, parity, the ACA, 988 -- has increased demand for providers without a corresponding investment in workforce supply. The pattern is consistent: legislation creates a right to care without creating the workforce to deliver it.

### Pattern 2: The Training Cap Trap

The 1997 GME cap demonstrates how a single fiscal constraint, imposed for short-term budget reasons, can create a structural shortage that persists for decades. The cap was never intended as a permanent workforce policy, but it has functioned as one.

### Pattern 3: Burnout Undermines Expansion

Efforts to expand access without addressing working conditions are self-defeating. The history of community mental health shows that underfunded, overworked settings generate high turnover, which erodes the very capacity the system is trying to build.

### Pattern 4: Incrementalism Versus the Scope of the Problem

The history of federal mental health workforce policy is a history of incremental measures -- modest NHSC expansions, small GME increases, pilot programs -- applied to a problem that is structural and systemic. Each intervention helps at the margin but does not alter the fundamental trajectory.
