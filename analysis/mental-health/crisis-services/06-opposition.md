# Mental Health Crisis Services: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to expand mental health crisis services -- including fully funding the 988 Lifeline, building mobile crisis teams, constructing crisis stabilization facilities, and reducing law enforcement involvement in mental health calls -- face resistance from those who question the cost, effectiveness, governance, or underlying philosophy of these reforms.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Fiscal conservative legislators | Oppose new federal and state spending on crisis services | Control of budget committees and appropriations processes | Block funding bills, demand offsets, sunset provisions |
| Hospital associations (selective) | Protect ED revenue from psychiatric patients | $29 million in federal lobbying (AHA, 2023) | Support reform rhetoric while opposing policies that divert patients from EDs |
| Law enforcement unions | Protect officer roles, staffing, and budgets | Political influence with local and state elected officials | Frame alternative response as dangerous; resist civilian oversight |
| Private insurance industry | Avoid expanded crisis coverage mandates | $150+ million annual federal lobbying (AHIP, OpenSecrets, 2023) | Argue mental health parity is sufficient; resist new mandated benefits |
| Involuntary treatment opponents (some civil liberties groups) | Protect civil liberties from expansion of coercive psychiatric intervention | Legal advocacy, litigation capacity | Challenge involuntary hold procedures; oppose expanded commitment authority |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Small-government conservatives**: View expanded crisis services as another federal program that grows government, increases taxes, and creates dependency. Prefer private-sector and faith-based alternatives to public behavioral health infrastructure
- **Libertarians**: Object to involuntary crisis holds and government surveillance of crisis contacts. Concerned that 988 data could be used for gun confiscation or forced treatment. Oppose telecom fees as hidden taxes
- **Law-and-order proponents**: Believe that mental health crisis calls are inherently dangerous and that removing police from these encounters jeopardizes public safety. Skeptical that civilian crisis teams can safely handle situations involving potential violence
- **Anti-government populists**: Distrust federal agencies (SAMHSA, CMS) setting standards for local services. View 988 as a potential surveillance tool. Oppose the idea that mental health crises should be medicalized rather than handled by families and communities

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: Crisis Services Expansion Is Too Expensive

**Claim**: Building a complete crisis continuum -- 988 call centers, mobile teams, crisis stabilization units -- across the country would cost tens of billions of dollars the government cannot afford, especially during periods of high federal deficits.

**Evidence Cited**: SAMHSA's own estimates suggest full crisis system build-out would require $3-5 billion annually in new federal and state spending. The 988 Lifeline alone received $502 million in FY2024.

**Reality**: The current system already costs billions -- it simply spends the money inefficiently. Psychiatric ED visits cost $2,264 per day (Milliman, 2022); crisis stabilization costs $600-$900 per day (Georgia DBHDD, 2022). Incarcerating people with mental illness costs approximately $35,000-$60,000 per year (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). Georgia's crisis system saves an estimated $2,264 per episode compared to hospitalization. A RAND Corporation study found that every $1 invested in mobile crisis services saves $2.16 in avoided ED visits, hospitalizations, and incarceration (RAND, 2022).

**Rebuttal**: The question is not whether to spend money on mental health crises -- the nation already spends over $15 billion annually through EDs, jails, and emergency services. The question is whether to spend it effectively through purpose-built crisis services or wastefully through systems designed for other purposes.

### Argument 2: Unarmed Crisis Teams Put Workers and the Public at Risk

**Claim**: Mental health crises are inherently unpredictable and potentially violent. Sending unarmed clinicians and peer specialists to respond without police backup endangers both workers and bystanders. People in psychotic states or under the influence of substances may be armed or combative.

**Evidence Cited**: FBI data shows that 14% of officers killed in the line of duty were responding to behavioral health calls (FBI LEOKA, 2022). Incidents of violence against mental health workers are documented, though systematic data is limited.

**Reality**: The largest and longest-running civilian crisis response programs demonstrate remarkably low rates of adverse incidents. CAHOOTS in Eugene, Oregon has operated since 1989, handles approximately 24,000 calls annually, and requests police backup for fewer than 1% of contacts (CAHOOTS Annual Report, 2023). Denver's STAR program recorded zero arrests and zero use-of-force incidents in its first three years (Denver Department of Public Health, 2024). These programs use trained dispatchers to screen calls and route only appropriate situations to civilian teams, with police remaining available for calls involving weapons, active violence, or imminent danger.

**Rebuttal**: No credible reform proposal advocates removing police from all crisis situations. Rather, the goal is a tiered response where trained dispatchers assess each call and route it to the appropriate resource -- civilian crisis team, co-response team, or law enforcement -- based on the nature of the situation. This actually improves safety by matching resources to risks.

### Argument 3: 988 Is a Federal Surveillance and Gun Confiscation Tool

**Claim**: Calling 988 creates a government record that could be used to flag individuals for gun confiscation, involuntary commitment, or other adverse actions. The federal government should not operate a behavioral health surveillance system.

**Evidence Cited**: Several states have "red flag" laws (Extreme Risk Protection Orders) that can use mental health crisis contacts as evidence for temporary firearms seizure. Some jurisdictions have shared 988 caller data with law enforcement.

**Reality**: 988 Lifeline policy explicitly prohibits sharing caller information with law enforcement absent imminent danger (Vibrant Emotional Health, 2023). SAMHSA's privacy regulations (42 CFR Part 2) provide strong protections for substance use and mental health records. Federal law (HIPAA) restricts health information sharing. While concerns about data misuse are legitimate, the existing legal framework provides robust protections, and proposed legislation would strengthen them further.

**Rebuttal**: Privacy protections must be maintained and strengthened, but fear of help-seeking is itself a public health risk. People who avoid calling 988 due to surveillance fears may escalate to suicide or violence. The solution is stronger privacy guarantees, not dismantling the crisis system.

### Argument 4: This Is a State and Local Issue, Not a Federal One

**Claim**: Mental health services are traditionally the responsibility of states and local communities. Federal mandates, funding conditions, and performance standards for crisis services represent federal overreach that undermines state flexibility and local control.

**Evidence Cited**: The 10th Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states. Mental health care has historically been a state function, from state hospitals to community mental health funding.

**Reality**: States have had decades to build crisis systems and most have failed to do so. As of 2024, fewer than 50% of communities have access to the full crisis continuum (NASMHPD, 2024). The states with the most comprehensive crisis systems -- Georgia, Arizona, Colorado -- built them with significant federal support. Federal leadership through 988, Medicaid, and grant programs provides the backbone that states cannot individually replicate.

**Rebuttal**: The 988 Lifeline is inherently national -- calls route across state lines, and crisis standards benefit from consistency. Federal funding with state flexibility (as in the ARP Section 9813 model) provides the best of both approaches: national investment with local implementation.

### Argument 5: Mental Health Crises Should Be Handled by Families and Faith Communities, Not Government

**Claim**: Government-run crisis services replace the natural support systems of family, church, and community. Expanding government crisis response medicalizes normal human suffering and creates dependency on public services.

**Evidence Cited**: Religious organizations provide significant informal mental health support. Family involvement is critical to recovery. Government programs can crowd out private and community-based support.

**Reality**: Many people in mental health crisis have no family support, have been estranged from communities, or need clinical intervention beyond what informal networks can provide. Suicidal ideation, psychotic episodes, and acute substance intoxication require trained professional response. Faith communities can be valuable partners in recovery, but few have the clinical expertise or round-the-clock availability needed for acute crisis intervention. The crisis system should complement, not replace, community support.

**Rebuttal**: No reform proposal seeks to eliminate the role of families or faith communities. Rather, crisis services fill the gap when informal supports are unavailable, overwhelmed, or insufficient for the severity of the situation. A person in acute psychosis or suicidal crisis needs a trained responder, not a prayer group -- though faith-based support may play a valuable role in subsequent recovery.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

Opposition to mental health crisis services has followed a consistent pattern since deinstitutionalization:

1. **1960s-1970s**: Fiscal conservatives opposed community mental health center construction costs, contributing to fewer than half being built
2. **1980s**: The Reagan administration cut federal mental health funding by 25%, framing it as state responsibility
3. **1990s-2000s**: Insurance industry opposed mental health parity requirements, delaying passage until 2008
4. **2010s**: Opponents of the Affordable Care Act targeted Medicaid expansion, limiting crisis services funding in non-expansion states
5. **2020s**: Opposition to 988 funding has come from fiscal hawks, privacy advocates, and law enforcement unions, though bipartisan support remains relatively strong

The consistent thread is that opposition to crisis services expansion is primarily fiscal and ideological rather than based on evidence that existing systems work well.

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Bipartisan framing**: 988 passed with bipartisan support (unanimous Senate, near-unanimous House). Frame crisis services as public safety, not partisan politics. Emphasize support from law enforcement leaders (IACP endorsements) and Republican governors who have invested in crisis systems (e.g., Georgia Governor Brian Kemp)
- **Veteran and first responder focus**: Advocate for crisis services through the politically popular lens of veteran mental health and first responder support. The Veterans Crisis Line is among the most successful 988 components
- **Cost-savings messaging**: Lead with fiscal arguments showing that crisis services save money versus ED visits and incarceration. The Georgia model's $2,264-per-episode savings provides a concrete number
- **Local champions**: Identify sheriffs, police chiefs, emergency physicians, and hospital administrators who can speak to the operational need for crisis alternatives from positions of credibility with conservative audiences

### Communication Strategies

- **Personal stories**: Families who have lost loved ones to suicide or police encounters during mental health crises are the most powerful advocates. Feature these stories in legislative testimony and media campaigns
- **"Someone to Call" framing**: 988 is intuitive and popular -- most Americans support having a mental health crisis line. Build outward from 988 to mobile teams and crisis stabilization as natural extensions
- **Safety for everyone**: Frame crisis services as protecting communities, police officers, and people in crisis -- not as choosing one group over another
- **Data-driven messaging**: Use specific local data (ED boarding times, jail mental health populations, 988 call volumes) to make the case in each community

### Policy Design Strategies

- **State flexibility with federal floors**: Design federal legislation that sets minimum standards while allowing states to customize implementation, addressing federalism concerns
- **Sunset and evaluation**: Include sunset provisions with required evaluation, addressing fiscal conservative concerns about permanent programs
- **Privacy safeguards**: Build strong, explicit privacy protections into 988 legislation to address surveillance fears
- **Gradual transition**: Phase in civilian crisis response alongside (not replacing) police, allowing communities to build capacity before reducing law enforcement involvement
- **Public-private partnerships**: Incorporate faith-based organizations, private providers, and employers into crisis service delivery to address concerns about government-only solutions
