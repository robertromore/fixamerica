# Mental Health Crisis Services: Solutions

Completing the mental health crisis continuum requires a multi-faceted approach that builds the three pillars of effective crisis response -- Someone to Call (988), Someone to Respond (mobile crisis teams), A Safe Place to Be (crisis stabilization) -- while reforming the financing, workforce, and governance structures that have kept the system fragmented and underfunded.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Every person in mental health crisis deserves a health-first response, with clinical expertise as the default and law enforcement involvement limited to situations involving imminent physical danger
- Crisis services must be universally available regardless of geography, insurance status, race, or ability to pay
- The crisis system must be sustainably funded through permanent financing mechanisms rather than time-limited grants
- Peer support -- from individuals with lived experience of mental health conditions -- should be integrated into every level of crisis response
- Crisis intervention is the front door to the mental health system; it must connect seamlessly to ongoing treatment, housing, and recovery supports

### Theory of Change

Building a complete crisis continuum reduces reliance on emergency departments and law enforcement by creating purpose-built alternatives at every stage of crisis response. When people can reach a trained counselor immediately (988), receive an in-person clinical response quickly (mobile crisis teams), and stabilize in a therapeutic environment (crisis stabilization units), the cascade of negative outcomes -- ED boarding, arrest, incarceration, preventable deaths -- is interrupted. Evidence from Georgia, Arizona, and international models demonstrates that this continuum, when fully implemented, reduces ED utilization by 30-60%, jail bookings by 20-40%, and inpatient admissions by 25-45%, while improving clinical outcomes and costing less per episode than the current default system.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Permanently Fund and Strengthen the 988 Lifeline

**Description**: Establish permanent, dedicated federal funding for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at $1 billion annually (up from $502 million in FY2024), combined with a national 988 telecom fee generating $500 million-$700 million in state revenue. This would fund all 200+ local crisis centers to achieve 95% in-network answer rates, expand text and chat capacity, build specialized sub-networks (youth, LGBTQI+, deaf/hard-of-hearing, tribal), and develop real-time integration between 988 and mobile crisis dispatch systems.

**Evidence Base**: The 988 Lifeline fielded 5.4 million contacts in 2023, a 125% increase from 2021, demonstrating surging demand (SAMHSA, 2024). The nine states that have enacted 988 telecom fees (Washington, Virginia, Nevada, Colorado, Connecticut, California, New York, Maryland, and Oregon) provide a proven revenue model. International comparisons show that countries with robust crisis lines -- particularly the UK's Samaritans network -- achieve answer rates above 95% through sustained public investment.

**Implementation**: Requires reauthorization of the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act with permanent funding authorization; FCC rulemaking to enable national 988 telecom fee; SAMHSA contract expansion with Vibrant Emotional Health and local centers; technology investments for 988-to-mobile-crisis dispatch integration.

**Cost/Resources**: $1 billion annual federal appropriation + $500-$700 million from national telecom fee = $1.5-$1.7 billion annually for the 988 system.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; telecom fee implementation in Year 2; 95% answer rate target by Year 3.

**Challenges**: Political resistance to new telecom fees; rural call center staffing; coordination with 911 systems that use different technology platforms.

**Impact Metrics**: In-network answer rate (target: 95%); average speed of answer (target: <30 seconds); text/chat response time (target: <2 minutes); contacts resulting in active rescue (target: <2%); follow-up completion rate (target: 80%).

### Solution 2: Universal Mobile Crisis Team Coverage

**Description**: Require and fund mobile crisis teams in every community in the United States, ensuring that a multidisciplinary crisis team (licensed clinician + peer specialist, with optional law enforcement co-response) can respond to any person in mental health crisis within 60 minutes in urban areas and 90 minutes in rural areas. Mandate that Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance cover mobile crisis services at parity with emergency medical services.

**Evidence Base**: Mobile crisis teams reduce ED visits by 23-55%, hospitalizations by 20-27%, and arrest rates from 15-20% to 5-10% (Balfour et al., 2022; SAMHSA, 2020). The ARP Section 9813 enhanced Medicaid FMAP (85%) has already catalyzed mobile crisis expansion in 28 states, demonstrating that financial incentives work. CAHOOTS (Eugene, OR) has operated for over 35 years with <1% of contacts requiring police backup.

**Implementation**: Make the 85% Medicaid FMAP for mobile crisis permanent (currently time-limited); require Medicaid coverage of mobile crisis in all states; establish federal grants for startup costs in underserved areas; create national standards for team composition, training, and response times; develop telehealth-assisted mobile crisis for rural areas.

**Cost/Resources**: An estimated $2.5-$3.5 billion annually for full national coverage (federal + state + insurance). Approximately 105,000 additional crisis workers needed over 10 years.

**Timeline**: Permanent Medicaid authority in Year 1; 60% coverage by Year 3; 85% coverage by Year 5; universal coverage by Year 8.

**Challenges**: Workforce shortages (the binding constraint); rural access in frontier areas; liability and scope-of-practice issues for peer specialists; Medicaid rate adequacy.

**Impact Metrics**: Population coverage (target: 100%); average response time (target: 60 min urban, 90 min rural); ED diversion rate (target: 50%); arrest diversion rate (target: 70%); client satisfaction (target: >85%).

### Solution 3: Triple Crisis Stabilization Bed Capacity

**Description**: Increase the national supply of short-term crisis stabilization beds -- including crisis stabilization units (CSUs), 23-hour observation beds, and crisis receiving centers -- from approximately 12,500 to 36,000 (from 3.7 per 100,000 to approximately 10 per 100,000 population). This requires reforming the Medicaid IMD exclusion to allow federal payment for crisis facilities of any size, and providing capital grants for construction and renovation.

**Evidence Base**: SAMHSA recommends 8-12 crisis stabilization beds per 100,000 population; the current supply is 3.7 per 100,000. Georgia's crisis stabilization units achieve 70% diversion from hospitalization and save $2,264 per episode compared to hospital care (Georgia DBHDD, 2022). Arizona's crisis receiving centers resolve 60% of contacts without inpatient admission (RI International, 2023). A Milliman actuarial analysis found that adequate crisis stabilization capacity reduces overall behavioral health spending by 8-12% in the communities where it is available.

**Implementation**: Reform the Medicaid IMD exclusion for crisis stabilization (facilities <24-hour stays, not long-term psychiatric hospitals); federal capital grants of $5 billion over 5 years for construction; state licensing and certification standards; Medicaid reimbursement rates sufficient to sustain operations; workforce development specifically for crisis stabilization settings.

**Cost/Resources**: $5 billion in capital grants over 5 years; $1.5-$2 billion annually in operating costs (offset by ED and inpatient savings). Net cost after savings estimated at $500 million-$1 billion annually.

**Timeline**: IMD exclusion reform and capital grants in Year 1-2; first new facilities operational by Year 3; target capacity by Year 7.

**Challenges**: IMD exclusion reform requires legislation; capital construction timelines; workforce recruitment for new facilities; community siting opposition ("NIMBY"); ongoing operating funding.

**Impact Metrics**: Beds per 100,000 population (target: 10); average ED psychiatric boarding time (target: <2 hours); hospital diversion rate (target: 60%); 30-day readmission rate (target: <15%).

### Solution 4: Civilian Alternative Response Programs in Every City Over 100,000

**Description**: Fund and support the creation of civilian-led alternative response programs (modeled on CAHOOTS, STAR, and B-HEARD) in every U.S. city with a population over 100,000 (approximately 280 cities). These programs dispatch unarmed mental health professionals and peer specialists to behavioral health crisis calls that do not involve weapons or imminent violence, operating alongside (not replacing) police and EMS.

**Evidence Base**: CAHOOTS handles 24,000 calls annually with <1% requiring police backup. Denver's STAR program recorded zero arrests in its first three years. New York's B-HEARD program reduced ED transports by 50%. A 2023 National Bureau of Economic Research study found that alternative response programs reduce officer injuries by 14% and reduce use of force by 28% on co-routed calls (Dee & Pyne, *American Economic Review*, 2024).

**Implementation**: Federal grants ($2 billion over 5 years) for program startup; 911 dispatch protocol changes to enable call triage; standardized training curricula; data collection and evaluation requirements; liability frameworks for civilian responders.

**Cost/Resources**: Average cost per program: $2-5 million annually for a city of 200,000. Total national cost: $800 million-$1.4 billion annually once all programs are operational.

**Timeline**: Pilot grants in Year 1; 100 cities by Year 3; 280+ cities by Year 5.

**Challenges**: 911 dispatch system modifications; resistance from police unions; liability and worker safety frameworks; coordination with existing EMS and crisis services.

**Impact Metrics**: Mental health calls diverted from police (target: 30-50% of eligible calls); police backup rate (target: <3%); arrest rate for diverted calls (target: <2%); client satisfaction (target: >85%); worker injury rate (target: below EMS baseline).

### Solution 5: National Crisis Workforce Development Program

**Description**: Create a dedicated federal crisis workforce development program investing $500 million annually in scholarships, loan forgiveness, training programs, and compensation incentives for crisis services workers. Establish a Crisis Corps modeled on the National Health Service Corps that places clinicians and peer specialists in underserved crisis settings in exchange for educational debt relief.

**Evidence Base**: The National Health Service Corps has placed over 15,000 providers in underserved areas (HRSA, 2023). Loan forgiveness programs increase retention in public mental health settings by 25-35% (HRSA evaluation, 2022). Crisis worker turnover (currently >30% annually) is primarily driven by low compensation ($37,000-$45,000 average) relative to other clinical roles.

**Implementation**: Congressional authorization of Crisis Corps within HRSA; $500 million annual appropriation; partnership with schools of social work, counseling, and psychology; peer specialist training expansion through community colleges; competitive salaries (minimum $55,000 for entry-level crisis counselors, $75,000 for licensed clinicians).

**Cost/Resources**: $500 million annually in federal investment; projected to produce 15,000-20,000 additional crisis workers within 5 years.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; first Crisis Corps placements in Year 2; target workforce expansion by Year 5-7.

**Challenges**: Training pipeline takes 3-7 years for licensed clinicians; competition with private-sector employers; rural placement challenges; scope-of-practice variation across states.

**Impact Metrics**: Crisis worker vacancy rate (target: <10%); annual workforce growth (target: 15,000/year); turnover rate (target: <15%); rural placement rate (target: 30% of new placements).

### Solution 6: 988-to-911 Integration and Coordinated Dispatch

**Description**: Build technical and operational integration between the 988 Lifeline and 911 emergency dispatch systems so that crisis calls can be triaged and routed to the most appropriate resource -- 988 counselor, mobile crisis team, co-response team, EMS, or police -- based on the nature of the situation. Require standardized crisis dispatch protocols (modeled on Medical Priority Dispatch systems) in all 911 centers.

**Evidence Base**: Only 12 states have formal 988-to-911 coordination protocols as of 2024. Communities with integrated dispatch systems report 30-50% reductions in police-only mental health responses (APCO International, 2023). The International Academies of Emergency Dispatch has developed validated behavioral health dispatch protocols that enable call-takers to assess risk and route appropriately.

**Implementation**: FCC and SAMHSA joint rulemaking for 988-911 interoperability standards; $500 million federal grant program for 911 center technology upgrades; standardized behavioral health dispatch training for all 911 operators; data-sharing agreements between 988 and 911 systems with privacy protections.

**Cost/Resources**: $500 million in one-time technology upgrades; $100 million annually for training and maintenance.

**Timeline**: Standards published in Year 1; 50% of 911 centers integrated by Year 3; 90% by Year 5.

**Challenges**: 6,000+ 911 call centers with different technology platforms; jurisdictional fragmentation; privacy concerns about data sharing; cultural resistance in some 911 centers.

**Impact Metrics**: Share of 911 centers with behavioral health dispatch protocols (target: 90%); share of mental health 911 calls routed to clinical resources (target: 50%); response time for triaged mental health calls (target: within standard).

### Solution 7: Medicaid and Insurance Coverage Reform for Crisis Services

**Description**: Require all health insurance plans (Medicaid, Medicare, commercial, ACA marketplace) to cover the full crisis continuum -- crisis line contacts, mobile crisis team responses, crisis stabilization stays, and post-crisis follow-up -- at parity with emergency medical services, with no prior authorization, copays, or deductibles. Make the Medicaid enhanced FMAP for mobile crisis permanent and extend it to crisis stabilization.

**Evidence Base**: The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (2008) requires coverage parity but does not specifically mandate crisis services coverage. Many commercial plans do not reimburse mobile crisis teams or crisis stabilization units. Medicaid coverage of crisis services varies by state, with only 28 states implementing the ARP Section 9813 mobile crisis benefit. CMS actuarial analysis suggests that comprehensive crisis coverage reduces total behavioral health spending by 8-12% through avoided ED and inpatient utilization (CMS, 2023).

**Implementation**: Federal legislation amending the Parity Act to explicitly include crisis services; CMS regulation requiring Medicaid crisis coverage in all states; DOL and HHS enforcement guidance for commercial insurers; rate adequacy standards to ensure crisis providers are fairly compensated.

**Cost/Resources**: Federal cost of permanent 85% FMAP for mobile crisis: $1.2 billion/year. Additional coverage mandate costs offset by reduced ED and inpatient spending. Net budget impact estimated as neutral to modestly positive over 5 years.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1-2; CMS rulemaking in Year 2; full implementation by Year 3.

**Challenges**: Insurance industry opposition; complexity of adding new mandated benefits; rate-setting for novel service categories; enforcement across diverse state Medicaid programs.

**Impact Metrics**: Share of insured population with crisis coverage (target: 100%); crisis provider Medicaid acceptance rate (target: >80%); payer mix for crisis services (target: <30% uncompensated care).

## International Models

### Australia: National Mental Health Crisis Infrastructure

**Description**: Australia has invested heavily in a national crisis infrastructure including a network of regional crisis assessment and treatment teams, Safe Haven Cafes (walk-in crisis support centers), and the Beyond Blue crisis line. Mobile crisis assessment teams are available in all major metropolitan and regional areas.

**Results**: Crisis assessment teams reduce involuntary admissions by 35-45% in areas where they operate. Safe Haven Cafes, introduced in 2019, have diverted thousands from emergency departments with 92% satisfaction ratings (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Safe Haven Cafe model -- low-barrier, peer-staffed walk-in centers open during peak crisis hours (evenings/nights) -- could be adapted for U.S. communities as a complement to mobile teams and stabilization units. Australia's population is much smaller (26 million), so scaling would require significant investment.

### Netherlands: Ambulance-Based Psychiatric Emergency Service

**Description**: The Netherlands operates a dedicated psychiatric ambulance service (Psycholance) in several cities, with specially trained paramedics and crisis nurses responding to mental health calls in modified ambulance vehicles equipped for psychiatric assessment and transport.

**Results**: The Amsterdam Psycholance program diverts 70% of contacts from police and standard ambulance transport, with 85% of patients transported to crisis facilities rather than EDs. Patient satisfaction is significantly higher than with police-mediated transport (Mulder et al., *BMC Psychiatry*, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Psycholance model could be integrated with EMS systems in major U.S. cities, leveraging existing ambulance infrastructure and adding psychiatric-trained personnel. Paramedic scope-of-practice expansion and union negotiation would be required.

### United Kingdom: National Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Teams

**Description**: The UK's National Health Service mandates Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment (CRHT) teams in every NHS Trust area. These teams provide 24/7 mobile crisis assessment, home-based acute treatment as an alternative to hospitalization, and gatekeeping of inpatient admissions (all voluntary psychiatric admissions must go through the CRHT team first).

**Results**: CRHT teams reduced inpatient psychiatric admissions by 20-30% in areas where they operate effectively. The UK achieved a 22% reduction in psychiatric bed use between 2000 and 2015, attributed in part to CRHT implementation (NHS England, 2023). The Samaritans crisis line achieves a 96% answer rate.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The CRHT gatekeeping model -- requiring community crisis team assessment before any voluntary psychiatric admission -- could significantly reduce unnecessary hospitalizations. However, the U.S. lacks the unified health system governance that makes UK implementation possible. Adaptation would require Medicaid and insurance policy changes to incentivize CRHT-style gatekeeping.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

Several U.S. programs provide proof-of-concept for scaled crisis services:

- **Georgia Crisis System**: Statewide network of mobile crisis teams and 11 crisis stabilization units. Diverts 70% of contacts from hospitalization. Saves $2,264 per episode. The most comprehensive state crisis system in the country (Georgia DBHDD, 2022)
- **Arizona Crisis Now Implementation**: Based on the Crisis Now model, Arizona operates crisis receiving centers (walk-in, no appointment), mobile crisis teams, and a crisis line integrated with 911 dispatch. Averages 26-minute response times in Maricopa County (RI International, 2023)
- **CAHOOTS (Eugene, OR)**: 35+ years of operation; 24,000 annual contacts; <1% police backup rate; estimated $14 million/year savings to the city (White Bird Clinic, 2023)
- **988 + Mobile Crisis Integration Pilots (Colorado, Oregon)**: Testing real-time dispatch of mobile crisis teams directly from 988 call centers, with early results showing 30-40% reduction in ED referrals compared to phone-only intervention (SAMHSA, 2024)

## Sequencing and Prioritization

- Publish 988-to-911 interoperability standards

### Medium-term Reforms (2-5 years)

- Achieve 95% 988 in-network answer rate
- Expand mobile crisis team coverage to 70% of population
- Reform IMD exclusion for crisis stabilization facilities
- Establish Crisis Corps workforce pipeline with first placements
- Integrate 988 and 911 dispatch in 50% of jurisdictions

### Long-term Transformation (5-10 years)

- Universal mobile crisis team access (60-minute urban, 90-minute rural response)
- Triple crisis stabilization bed capacity (10 per 100,000)
- Civilian alternative response in all cities over 100,000
- Crisis workforce fully staffed (<10% vacancy rate)
- 988-911 integration in 90% of jurisdictions

## Complementary Policies

Crisis services expansion requires parallel investments in:

- **Outpatient mental health capacity**: Crisis services are the front door; without adequate outpatient treatment, stabilized individuals have nowhere to go, creating revolving-door utilization
- **Affordable housing and supportive housing**: Housing instability precipitates crisis; crisis stabilization without housing to discharge to produces poor outcomes
- **Substance use treatment**: Co-occurring substance use disorders affect 40-60% of crisis contacts; integrated treatment capacity is essential
- **Insurance parity enforcement**: Stronger DOL/HHS enforcement of the Mental Health Parity Act ensures commercial insurers cover crisis services
- **Suicide prevention strategy**: Crisis services are part of a broader prevention continuum that includes means restriction, lethal means counseling, and upstream intervention
