# Crisis Services

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of mental health crisis response systems in the United States, including the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, mobile crisis teams, crisis stabilization units, crisis receiving centers, law enforcement co-response models, and emergency department diversion programs.

## Overview

Mental health crises affect millions of Americans each year, yet the nation's crisis response infrastructure remains fragmented, underfunded, and overly reliant on law enforcement and emergency departments ill-equipped for psychiatric emergencies. The 2022 launch of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline represented the most significant federal investment in crisis services in decades, but the system behind the three-digit number remains incomplete. Fewer than half of U.S. communities have access to mobile crisis teams, and crisis stabilization beds remain scarce in most states.

This analysis examines the full continuum of mental health crisis services -- from initial contact through stabilization and follow-up -- including the 988 Lifeline infrastructure, mobile crisis team deployment, crisis stabilization units and receiving centers, law enforcement Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and co-response models, psychiatric emergency services, and EMTALA obligations for emergency departments. It explores root causes of systemic gaps, identifies stakeholders and opposition, and proposes evidence-based solutions grounded in both domestic pilot programs and international models.
