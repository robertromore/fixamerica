# Mental Health Crisis Services: Stakeholders

The mental health crisis services landscape is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with distinct interests, resources, and levels of power. The fragmented nature of crisis response means that no single stakeholder controls the system, but many have the ability to block or enable reform.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| People experiencing mental health crises | Directly affected by response quality, wait times, and use of force | ~12.3 million adults with serious suicidal thoughts; millions more with acute psychiatric episodes (SAMHSA, 2023) | Timely, compassionate, clinically appropriate crisis intervention; avoidance of unnecessary arrest, ED boarding, or hospitalization |
| Family members and caregivers | Often the first to call for help; bear emotional and financial burden of inadequate crisis response | Estimated 53 million informal caregivers for adults with mental illness (NAMI, 2023) | Access to immediate help during emergencies; guidance on how to support loved ones; follow-up care coordination |
| People who die by suicide | Ultimate consequence of system failure | 49,449 deaths (2022; CDC, 2023) | Prevention through timely intervention at point of crisis |
| People with co-occurring substance use disorders | Frequently experience overlapping crises requiring integrated response | ~9.2 million adults with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (SAMHSA, 2023) | Dual-competent crisis response that addresses both conditions simultaneously |
| Youth and adolescents | Fastest-growing crisis population | Suicide is 2nd leading cause of death ages 10-14 and 3rd leading cause ages 15-24 (CDC, 2023) | Age-appropriate crisis services, school-based response, family involvement |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **People experiencing homelessness**: Approximately 35-40% of people experiencing homelessness have a serious mental illness (HUD, 2023). Homelessness both precipitates and complicates crisis response
- **People involved in the criminal justice system**: An estimated 2 million jail bookings per year involve people with serious mental illness (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). Better crisis services would divert many from incarceration
- **Racial and ethnic minorities**: Black Americans are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police during mental health encounters (Saleh et al., *JAMA Network Open*, 2021). Language barriers, cultural differences, and systemic racism affect crisis service access and quality for Hispanic, Asian, Indigenous, and Black communities
- **Rural populations**: 65% of non-metropolitan counties have no psychiatrist (HRSA, 2023), leaving rural residents with limited or no crisis services beyond law enforcement and distant emergency departments
- **Veterans**: Over 700,000 contacts annually to Veterans Crisis Line (VA, 2024), with veteran suicide rates 72% higher than non-veteran adults (VA National Suicide Prevention Report, 2023)

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) | Federal lead for 988 and crisis services policy | Administers 988 grants, sets guidelines, manages network contract | $502 million 988/crisis appropriation (FY2024) | High |
| CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) | Medicaid coverage and reimbursement policy | Approves state Medicaid plans; administers IMD exclusion and ARP Section 9813 | Medicaid covers 27% of adults with serious mental illness | High |
| State mental health authorities (SMHAs) | Plan and fund state crisis systems | License crisis facilities, allocate state funds, administer Medicaid benefits | $44 billion combined state mental health spending (FY2022) | High |
| Congress | Authorizes and appropriates federal crisis funding | Legislative authority over 988 reauthorization, IMD exclusion, Medicaid policy | Controls federal purse strings | High |
| State legislatures | Enact state crisis service mandates and appropriations | 988 telecom fees, crisis system standards, commitment laws | Control state budgets | High |
| County/local governments | Often operate or contract for crisis services | Local crisis teams, jail diversion programs, 911 dispatch protocols | Vary widely; largest counties spend $50M+ on crisis services | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Vibrant Emotional Health**: The non-profit organization under contract with SAMHSA to administer the 988 Lifeline network. Manages call routing, quality standards, training, and network expansion. The single most operationally important organization in the 988 system
- **National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD)**: Represents state mental health authority directors. Publishes crisis system standards and facilitates peer learning. Strong influence on state policy decisions
- **National Council for Mental Wellbeing**: The largest membership organization for community behavioral health providers. Advocates for crisis services funding and provides Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) technical assistance
- **Crisis Now Model / RI International**: Developed by Dr. Margie Balfour and colleagues, the Crisis Now model provides the operational framework adopted by SAMHSA. RI International operates crisis facilities in multiple states and serves as a key technical assistance provider
- **CIT International**: Governs the Crisis Intervention Training program and certifies CIT programs nationally. Connects law enforcement, mental health providers, and advocacy organizations

### Influencers

- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: The largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization (600,000+ members). Leads public campaigns for 988 funding, crisis system expansion, and mental health parity enforcement. Significant influence on state and federal legislators
- **American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP)**: Represents 40,000 emergency physicians. Advocates strongly against ED psychiatric boarding and for crisis alternatives, providing clinical legitimacy to reform proposals
- **Mental Health America (MHA)**: National advocacy organization providing screening tools, policy analysis, and public education on crisis services
- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: Professional organization for psychiatrists. Influences clinical standards, training requirements, and insurance coverage policies for psychiatric crisis care
- **International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP)**: Represents 31,000 police leaders. Has endorsed alternative response models and CIT expansion, providing law enforcement credibility to reform efforts
- **Treatment Advocacy Center**: Focuses on policies affecting people with serious mental illness, including crisis intervention and involuntary treatment laws. Publishes influential reports on psychiatric bed supply and criminalization

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAMI, MHA, APA, ACEP, National Council | Expanded crisis services funding, 988 sustainability, ED boarding reduction | Strong -- broad consensus on need for more resources |
| ACEP, hospital associations, EMS | Reducing ED psychiatric boarding, creating crisis alternatives | Strong -- direct operational impact on members |
| Police chiefs, NAMI, reform advocates | Reducing law enforcement role in mental health crisis response | Moderate -- agreement on direction but disagreement on pace |
| CMS, state Medicaid agencies, providers | Medicaid mobile crisis benefit implementation, IMD exclusion reform | Moderate -- aligned on coverage expansion but diverge on cost controls |
| Peer support organizations, recovery community | Expanding peer specialist roles in crisis teams | Moderate -- growing evidence base, but professional licensing tensions |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Hospitals vs. community providers**: Hospitals benefit financially from ED psychiatric visits ($2,264/day average); shifting patients to crisis stabilization ($600-$900/day) reduces hospital revenue even as it improves care
- **Law enforcement vs. civilian response advocates**: Police departments risk losing budget justification if mental health calls are diverted to civilian teams; reform advocates seek rapid transition away from armed response
- **Fiscal conservatives vs. service expansion advocates**: Expanding crisis services requires significant public investment ($3-5 billion annually at full build-out); fiscal conservatives prefer tax-neutral or private-sector solutions
- **Involuntary treatment advocates vs. civil liberties organizations**: Treatment Advocacy Center and some family groups seek expanded involuntary commitment authority; disability rights organizations (e.g., Bazelon Center) oppose coercive interventions
- **State autonomy vs. federal standards**: States resist federal mandates on crisis system design; advocates seek national minimum standards for response times and service availability

### The Mental Health Industrial Complex

A relatively small but influential set of institutional relationships shapes crisis policy:

- **Insurance companies** set reimbursement rates that determine financial viability of crisis services
- **Hospital systems** control ED capacity and compete for psychiatric patients who generate revenue
- **State mental health authorities** control the majority of public behavioral health funding and set licensing standards
- **SAMHSA** controls federal grant dollars and sets the policy framework through guidelines
- **Vibrant Emotional Health** holds the sole-source federal contract for 988 network administration

These five actor types form a policy network where decisions by any one entity ripple through the system.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on policy:

- **Lobbying**: The American Hospital Association spent $29 million on federal lobbying in 2023 (OpenSecrets, 2024). Mental health advocacy groups collectively spent approximately $8 million. The disparity reflects the broader imbalance between institutional and advocacy interests in crisis policy
- **Campaign Contributions**: Health sector PACs contributed $182 million to federal candidates in the 2022 cycle (OpenSecrets, 2023). Mental health-specific contributions are a small fraction, though bipartisan support for 988 has reduced the role of campaign spending in crisis policy specifically
- **Revolving Door**: Former SAMHSA officials frequently join consulting firms or provider organizations; former congressional health staff move to hospital associations and insurance companies. This creates information advantages for institutional actors
- **Public Advocacy**: NAMI's annual "CureStigma" campaign reaches millions. The #988 social media campaign generated significant public awareness during the 2022 launch. Family members testifying before state legislatures have been among the most effective advocates for crisis funding
- **Expertise and Information**: Organizations like NASMHPD, RI International, and the Crisis Now team control the technical knowledge base for crisis system design. Their recommendations shape both federal guidelines and state implementation plans
- **Data and Research**: SAMHSA's 988 Dashboard, CDC's suicide statistics, and state-level crisis data provide the evidence base that shapes legislative arguments. Control of data collection methodologies and reporting standards gives federal agencies and research organizations outsized influence on how the crisis system is evaluated
