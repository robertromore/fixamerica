# Mental Health Crisis Services: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Building a complete mental health crisis continuum across the United States requires a phased strategy that sequences investments to build on early successes, addresses the workforce constraint as a prerequisite for service expansion, and locks in sustainable financing before temporary federal incentives expire. The roadmap is organized around three phases that move from foundation-setting (permanent funding, workforce pipeline, standards) through scaled expansion (mobile crisis coverage, crisis stabilization construction, 988-911 integration) to system maturation (universal access, quality improvement, continuous evaluation).

The critical insight guiding this strategy is that workforce is the binding constraint. New crisis facilities and expanded mobile teams cannot operate without workers to staff them. Accordingly, Phase 1 invests heavily in workforce pipeline development alongside funding authorization, so that workers are entering the field by the time Phase 2 infrastructure comes online. Similarly, sustainable financing must be established before time-limited federal incentives expire, or states will face a fiscal cliff that reverses progress.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation and Authorization (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Establish permanent federal funding for the 988 Lifeline at $1 billion annually
- Make the enhanced 85% Medicaid FMAP for mobile crisis services permanent
- Launch the Crisis Corps workforce development program with first cohort of placements
- Publish national 988-to-911 interoperability standards
- Enact national 988 telecom fee framework enabling state-level fee collection
- Fund 100 civilian alternative response program startups in cities over 100,000

### Key Actions

### Legislative Requirements

- Reauthorization and expansion of the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act (P.L. 116-172) with permanent funding authorization at $1 billion/year
- Amendment to Social Security Act Section 1905 making the enhanced 85% FMAP for mobile crisis permanent
- FCC authorization for national 988 telecom fee (modeled on E-911 fee structure)
- HRSA authorization for Crisis Corps (modeled on National Health Service Corps)
- Appropriations for civilian alternative response grants ($400 million)

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, the structural foundations for a national crisis system will be in place: permanent federal funding authorized, sustainable state revenue mechanisms enabled, workforce pipeline launched, interoperability standards published, and the first wave of civilian alternative response programs operational. The 988 in-network answer rate should improve from 85% to 90%, and the number of states with Medicaid mobile crisis benefits should increase from 28 to 40.

---

## Phase 2: Scaled Expansion (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Achieve 95% 988 in-network answer rate with average speed of answer under 30 seconds
- Expand mobile crisis team coverage from 42% to 70% of the U.S. population

- Appropriations for crisis stabilization capital grants ($1 billion/year for 5 years)
- Mental Health Parity Act amendment explicitly including crisis services
- Authorization for national crisis data infrastructure

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, the crisis continuum will be operational for a majority of the U.S. population. Mobile crisis teams will cover 70% of the population with average response times under 60 minutes in urban areas. The first wave of new crisis stabilization facilities will be operational, beginning to reduce ED psychiatric boarding. The 988 system will be sustainably funded and achieving near-universal answer rates. The crisis workforce will have grown by 67%, though still below full staffing targets.

---

## Phase 3: System Maturation and Universal Access (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Achieve universal mobile crisis team access with 60-minute urban and 90-minute rural response times
- Reach crisis stabilization capacity of 10 beds per 100,000 population (approximately 36,000 beds nationally)
- Integrate 988 and 911 dispatch in 90% of jurisdictions
- Operate civilian alternative response programs in all cities over 100,000 (280+ cities)
- Achieve full crisis workforce staffing with vacancy rates below 10%
- Reduce ED psychiatric boarding by 60% from 2024 baseline

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Complete crisis stabilization construction program | SAMHSA / States | Years 6-8 | $2 billion additional capital | 36,000 total beds (10 per 100K) |
| Achieve universal mobile crisis coverage | States / Medicaid | Years 6-8 | Permanent Medicaid funding; state investment | 100% population coverage |
| Complete 988-911 integration nationwide | FCC / 911 authorities | Years 6-8 | $200 million remaining technology upgrades | 90% of 911 centers integrated |

| Conduct comprehensive 10-year program evaluation | GAO / SAMHSA | Year 10 | $25 million evaluation contract | Published evaluation with reauthorization recommendations |

### Expected Outcomes

By Year 10, the United States will have a functioning mental health crisis continuum in every community -- someone to call (988), someone to respond (mobile crisis teams), and a safe place to be (crisis stabilization). ED psychiatric boarding will have declined by 60% or more. Law enforcement will no longer be the default first responder to mental health crises. The crisis system will be sustainably funded through a combination of permanent federal appropriations, state telecom fees, and Medicaid/insurance reimbursement.

## Governance and Oversight

Implementation requires clear accountability at every level:

- **Federal level**: SAMHSA serves as lead coordinating agency for the crisis system, with CMS managing Medicaid policy, HRSA managing workforce programs, and FCC overseeing telecommunications standards. A White House-level Crisis Services Implementation Coordinator should oversee interagency coordination during the first 5 years
- **State level**: Each state mental health authority should designate a crisis services director responsible for mobile crisis deployment, crisis stabilization capacity, and 988 coordination within the state. Annual state plans submitted to SAMHSA for review
- **Local level**: Regional crisis authorities (or existing community behavioral health organizations) manage day-to-day operations, dispatch coordination, and quality assurance
- **Reporting**: SAMHSA publishes an annual National Crisis System Report Card with state-by-state data on all success metrics. GAO conducts a mid-program review at Year 5 and a comprehensive evaluation at Year 10
- **Advisory body**: A Federal Crisis Services Advisory Committee with representation from consumers, family members, crisis workers, peer specialists, state officials, and law enforcement provides ongoing guidance

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Workforce Shortages Prevent Service Expansion

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Front-load workforce investments in Phase 1 before service expansion in Phase 2. Crisis Corps placements begin in Year 2 so workers are entering the field before new facilities open. Expand scope of practice for peer specialists and paraprofessionals. Deploy telehealth-assisted mobile crisis models in underserved areas where clinician recruitment is difficult.

**Contingency Plan**: If workforce targets are not met by Year 3, delay facility construction timelines by 12-18 months and increase investment in telehealth-based crisis services as a bridge solution.

### Risk 2: Congress Fails to Appropriate Permanent 988 Funding

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build bipartisan coalition early. Frame 988 funding as public safety spending, not social services. Enact 988 telecom fee as backup revenue source that does not depend on annual appropriations. Secure endorsements from law enforcement, emergency medicine, and veteran organizations.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal appropriations stall, accelerate state telecom fee adoption (target: 30+ states) and pursue Medicaid-based financing for crisis services as an alternative federal funding channel.

### Risk 3: States Decline to Implement Medicaid Crisis Benefits

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Maintain the 85% enhanced FMAP to minimize state cost-sharing. Provide robust technical assistance through SAMHSA. Highlight cost savings from early-adopter states. If non-adoption persists in states that have not expanded Medicaid, consider direct federal crisis service delivery as a fallback.

**Contingency Plan**: In states that decline participation, fund community health center-based crisis services through Section 330 grants and federal qualifying health center authorities that do not require state Medicaid participation.

### Risk 4: 911 Centers Resist Integration with 988

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Provide federal technology grants covering 100% of upgrade costs for 911 centers. Develop standardized, vendor-neutral integration protocols. Engage APCO International and NENA (National Emergency Number Association) as partners. Phase implementation, starting with willing jurisdictions to demonstrate success.

**Contingency Plan**: If direct technology integration proves too difficult, implement call transfer protocols that allow 911 operators to warm-transfer mental health calls to 988 centers without requiring full system integration.

### Risk 5: Community Opposition to Crisis Facility Siting (NIMBY)

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Low-Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Engage communities early in the facility planning process. Present data from existing crisis stabilization units showing no increase in crime or property value decline. Offer community benefit agreements. Site facilities in commercial or medical districts rather than residential neighborhoods.

**Contingency Plan**: If siting opposition delays construction in specific communities, expand mobile crisis teams and telehealth capacity in those areas as an alternative to brick-and-mortar facilities.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Federal Cost | Estimated State/Local Cost | Funding Source | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Yrs 1-2) | $3.4 billion | $1.0 billion | Federal appropriations; 988 telecom fees | Includes $1B/yr 988, $500M workforce, $400M alt response grants |
| Phase 2 (Yrs 3-5) | $12.5 billion | $4.0 billion | Appropriations; Medicaid; telecom fees | Includes $3B/yr 988+mobile, $3B capital, $1.5B workforce |
