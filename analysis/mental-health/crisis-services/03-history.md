# Mental Health Crisis Services: History

## Historical Development

The history of mental health crisis services in America is inseparable from the broader arc of deinstitutionalization, the community mental health movement, and the gradual recognition that people in psychiatric distress need something other than a jail cell or an emergency room. The crisis system as it exists today -- fragmented, underfunded, and incomplete -- is the product of decades of policy decisions, many well-intentioned but poorly executed, that dismantled one system of care without fully building its replacement.

### The Institutional Era (Pre-1955): Asylum and Confinement

- **State hospital system**: By 1955, state psychiatric hospitals housed approximately 559,000 patients -- the peak of institutional census. These facilities ranged from humane to horrifying, but they constituted the de facto crisis response system: families and police brought people in acute distress to the state hospital
- **No community crisis services**: Outside of hospitals, virtually no organized mental health crisis response existed. Police served as informal gatekeepers, transporting people to hospitals or jails
- **Conditions and reform pressure**: Investigative journalism (Albert Deutsch's *The Shame of the States*, 1948) and conscientious objectors who served as attendants during World War II exposed deplorable conditions, building political will for reform
- **Early pharmaceutical breakthroughs**: The introduction of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) in 1954 provided the first effective antipsychotic medication, making it conceivable that seriously mentally ill individuals could be treated outside institutions

### Deinstitutionalization and Community Mental Health (1955-1980): The Promise and the Gap

- **Community Mental Health Act (1963)**: President Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act, envisioning a network of 2,000 community mental health centers (CMHCs) that would replace state hospitals. The act authorized federal funding for construction and initial staffing
- **Rapid hospital closures**: State hospital populations plummeted from 559,000 (1955) to 215,000 (1974) to 72,000 (1994). Discharges outpaced community service development by a wide margin
- **Centers never built**: Fewer than 800 of the planned 2,000 CMHCs were ever constructed. Federal funding was cut during the Nixon administration, and many centers that were built focused on outpatient therapy rather than crisis services
- **Medicaid and the IMD exclusion**: The 1965 creation of Medicaid included the Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, barring federal Medicaid payment for most care in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds. This created a perverse incentive for states to close large hospitals without investing in alternatives, as they could shift costs to the federal government through smaller settings
- **Homelessness and criminalization**: By the late 1970s, the consequences of deinstitutionalization without adequate community services were visible in rising homelessness and the criminalization of mental illness

### The Reagan Era and Federal Retreat (1980-1990): Block Grants and Neglect

- **Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (1981)**: The Reagan administration replaced categorical federal mental health funding with the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health (ADAMH) Block Grant, reducing federal funding by 25% and eliminating the requirement to build community mental health centers
- **State responsibility without resources**: States assumed primary responsibility for mental health services but lacked adequate funding, leading to further erosion of community crisis capacity
- **Continued hospital closures**: Between 1980 and 1990, an additional 40,000 state hospital beds were eliminated without commensurate community investment
- **EMTALA (1986)**: Congress passed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, requiring hospitals to screen and stabilize all emergency patients regardless of ability to pay. While not specifically about mental health, EMTALA established the legal obligation for EDs to address psychiatric emergencies -- inadvertently reinforcing the emergency department as the default crisis intervention setting
- **Rise of jails as psychiatric facilities**: Los Angeles County Jail, Cook County Jail (Chicago), and Rikers Island (New York) became the three largest psychiatric facilities in the country -- a status they retain today

### Early Crisis Models and the Memphis Model (1988-2000): Seeds of Innovation

- **Memphis CIT program (1988)**: Following the police shooting of Joseph Dewayne Robinson, a man with mental illness wielding a knife, the Memphis Police Department partnered with the University of Memphis and the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) to develop the first Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training program. The 40-hour training model, emphasizing de-escalation and diversion, became the national standard
- **Mobile crisis team pilots**: Several states (New York, Georgia, Arizona) began experimenting with mobile crisis teams in the 1990s, dispatching mental health professionals to crisis scenes rather than relying solely on police transport
- **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1998-2005)**: The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act (2004) and related federal investments established the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255), creating the first national crisis hotline infrastructure, administered by the non-profit Link2Health (later Vibrant Emotional Health)
- **Georgia crisis system development**: Georgia began building what would become the most comprehensive state crisis system in the country, establishing crisis stabilization units and a statewide mobile crisis network in the 1990s

### The 2000s: Parity, Integration, and Incremental Progress (2000-2015)

- **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (2008)**: Required health insurers to cover mental health and substance use disorders at parity with medical/surgical benefits. While not directly a crisis services law, parity expanded the theoretical coverage base for crisis interventions
- **Affordable Care Act (2010)**: Expanded Medicaid eligibility, bringing millions of previously uninsured adults with mental illness into coverage. Several states used Medicaid expansion to fund crisis services
- **Jail diversion programs**: The Sequential Intercept Model, developed by Mark Munetz and Patricia Griffin (2006), provided a framework for identifying diversion opportunities at five points in the criminal justice process, including pre-arrest crisis response
- **CAHOOTS model emergence**: Eugene, Oregon's Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets (CAHOOTS) program, operating since 1989, gained national recognition as proof that unarmed civilian crisis response could work safely at scale, handling over 20,000 calls annually by 2015
- **Veterans Crisis Line**: The VA launched the Veterans Crisis Line in 2007, providing specialized crisis support for military service members, veterans, and their families

### The 988 Era (2016-Present): A New Vision

- **FCC investigation (2016-2019)**: The Federal Communications Commission studied the feasibility of a three-digit number for mental health crises. The 2019 FCC report recommended 988
- **National Suicide Hotline Designation Act (2020)**: Signed into law by President Trump in October 2020, this bipartisan legislation designated 988 as the universal number for suicide prevention and mental health crisis, requiring all phone carriers to route 988 calls to the existing Lifeline network by July 16, 2022
- **SAMHSA Crisis Care Guidelines (2020)**: SAMHSA published *National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care*, articulating the three-pillar crisis continuum: Someone to Call, Someone to Respond, A Safe Place to Be
- **American Rescue Plan Act (2021)**: Section 9813 provided an enhanced 85% federal Medicaid matching rate for qualifying community-based mobile crisis intervention services, the single largest financial incentive for mobile crisis expansion in U.S. history
- **988 launch (July 16, 2022)**: The three-digit number went live nationwide. First-month contacts increased 45% over the prior July
- **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022)**: Included $500 million for pediatric mental health services and additional crisis infrastructure funding
- **Post-launch scaling (2023-2024)**: 988 contacts reached 5.4 million in 2023 (SAMHSA, 2024). Federal funding for 988 and crisis services exceeded $1 billion across FY2023-FY2024. States began implementing the Medicaid mobile crisis benefit. Over 100 communities launched civilian alternative response programs
- **George Floyd and police reform (2020-2024)**: The national reckoning over policing following the murder of George Floyd accelerated interest in alternative crisis response models, with dozens of cities piloting or expanding non-police mental health response teams

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Deinstitutionalization Without Reinvestment

The most consequential lesson is that closing institutional capacity without simultaneously building community alternatives produces catastrophic outcomes. Between 1955 and 2000, the United States eliminated over 480,000 state hospital beds while building fewer than 800 community mental health centers. The result was predictable: homelessness, incarceration, and emergency departments filled the gap left by hospitals. Every subsequent crisis services reform effort has been an attempt to repair this original failure.

### Pattern 2: Unfunded Mandates and Incomplete Implementation

Repeatedly, federal legislation has created a vision for mental health crisis services without providing the resources to realize it. The Community Mental Health Act promised 2,000 centers; fewer than half were built. EMTALA required hospitals to treat psychiatric emergencies but did not fund the capacity to do so. The 988 designation created a phone number but did not guarantee the mobile teams or crisis beds behind it. Each iteration follows the same pattern: bold policy design, inadequate appropriations, and systems that exist on paper but not in practice.

### Pattern 3: Innovation from Tragedy

Many of the most important crisis services innovations were born from preventable deaths. The Memphis CIT program was created after a police shooting. The Garrett Lee Smith Act was named for a senator's son who died by suicide. The national conversation about alternative crisis response accelerated after high-profile police killings of people in mental health crisis. This pattern suggests that political will for crisis reform is typically reactive rather than proactive, and that sustained advocacy is needed to maintain momentum between crises.

### Pattern 4: States as Laboratories

The most effective crisis systems have been built by individual states -- Georgia, Arizona, Colorado, Oregon -- that invested in comprehensive models ahead of federal action. These states now serve as proof-of-concept models for national scaling. Federal policy has historically followed rather than led state innovation in crisis services.
