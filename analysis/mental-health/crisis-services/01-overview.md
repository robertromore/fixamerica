# Mental Health Crisis Services: Overview

## Overview

Every year, tens of millions of Americans experience a mental health or substance use crisis -- a moment when symptoms overwhelm a person's ability to cope and immediate intervention is needed to prevent harm, hospitalization, or death. In 2022, the United States recorded 49,449 deaths by suicide (CDC, 2023), and an estimated 12.3 million adults reported serious thoughts of suicide (SAMHSA, 2023). Emergency departments treated approximately 7.8 million visits involving a primary mental health diagnosis in 2021 (HCUP, 2023), while law enforcement responded to an estimated 10 million mental health-related calls annually (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). These encounters frequently result in tragic outcomes: people in mental health crisis account for at least 25% of fatal police shootings (Washington Post Fatal Force database, 2023).

The crisis response system that is supposed to serve these individuals is deeply fragmented. The July 2022 launch of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline -- replacing the old 10-digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number -- marked a watershed moment, creating a mental health equivalent of 911. In its first full calendar year (2023), the 988 Lifeline fielded 5.4 million contacts via calls, texts, and chats, a 40% increase from the prior year (SAMHSA, 2024). Yet the infrastructure behind 988 remains incomplete. The crisis continuum model endorsed by SAMHSA calls for three core components: a regional crisis call center (Someone to Call), mobile crisis teams that dispatch to the person in crisis (Someone to Respond), and short-term crisis stabilization facilities (A Safe Place to Be). As of 2024, fewer than half of U.S. communities have access to all three components (NASMHPD, 2024).

The gap between 988 as a phone number and 988 as a functioning crisis system has enormous human and fiscal consequences. Without adequate mobile teams and stabilization capacity, people in crisis continue to cycle through emergency departments -- where the median wait for a psychiatric bed exceeds 6 hours and can stretch past 24 hours (ACEP, 2023) -- or encounter armed police officers as first responders. The result is preventable deaths, unnecessary incarceration, costly ED boarding, and deepening distrust of public systems among people who most need help.

Building a complete crisis continuum is both a moral imperative and a fiscal opportunity. Research consistently shows that investing in crisis services reduces ED utilization, jail bookings, and inpatient admissions while improving clinical outcomes and saving money. Georgia's crisis system, one of the most developed in the nation, saves an estimated $2,264 per crisis episode compared to hospitalization (Georgia DBHDD, 2022). The challenge is scaling proven models to a nation where mental health workforce shortages, inconsistent Medicaid coverage, and fragmented governance have left most communities without the services they need.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of mental health crisis services:

- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline**: Call center infrastructure, answer rates, workforce, technology, and integration with dispatch systems
- **Mobile Crisis Teams**: Deployment models, staffing, response times, clinical protocols, and geographic coverage gaps
- **Crisis Stabilization and Receiving Centers**: Short-term (under 24-hour) crisis stabilization units, 23-hour observation beds, and crisis receiving centers as alternatives to emergency departments and inpatient hospitalization
- **Law Enforcement Interactions**: Crisis Intervention Training (CIT), co-response models pairing officers with clinicians, and efforts to divert crisis calls from 911 to 988
- **Emergency Department Psychiatric Care**: EMTALA obligations, ED boarding, psychiatric consultation models, and strategies to reduce unnecessary ED utilization
- **Follow-Up and Care Transitions**: Post-crisis stabilization follow-up, warm handoffs to outpatient care, and peer support services

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 988 Lifeline contacts (2023) | 5.4 million calls, texts, and chats | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| 988 call answer rate (2023) | 85% of calls answered in-network | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| Annual suicide deaths (2022) | 49,449 | CDC WISQARS, 2023 |
| ED visits for mental health (2021) | 7.8 million | HCUP/AHRQ, 2023 |
| Median ED wait for psychiatric bed | 6.5 hours (often exceeding 24 hours) | ACEP, 2023 |
| Law enforcement mental health calls annually | ~10 million | Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022 |
| Fatal police encounters involving mental illness | 25% of fatal shootings | Washington Post, 2023 |
| Federal 988 appropriation (FY2024) | $502 million | HHS Budget, FY2024 |
| Communities with full crisis continuum access | Fewer than 50% | NASMHPD, 2024 |
| Cost savings per crisis episode (Georgia model) | $2,264 vs. hospitalization | Georgia DBHDD, 2022 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Health System vs. Public Safety System**: Crisis response currently straddles two systems -- behavioral health and law enforcement -- with different missions, training, funding streams, and legal authorities. Shifting responses toward health-first models requires building clinical capacity that does not yet exist in most communities, while abruptly withdrawing police from crisis calls raises safety concerns.
- **Federal Standards vs. State Flexibility**: The 988 Lifeline is federally funded, but crisis services are primarily state and locally operated. Imposing national standards (answer rates, response times, staffing ratios) could improve quality but may conflict with local conditions and governance traditions.
- **Voluntary vs. Involuntary Treatment**: Crisis services must balance respect for personal autonomy with the obligation to protect people who may be unable to recognize their need for help. Involuntary commitment laws vary widely by state, and overuse of coercive intervention drives people away from seeking help.
- **Medicaid Funding vs. IMD Exclusion**: The Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion prohibits federal Medicaid payment for most inpatient psychiatric care in facilities with more than 16 beds, creating a financing barrier for crisis stabilization units and larger psychiatric facilities that could otherwise provide needed capacity.
- **Workforce Investment vs. Immediate Demand**: Building the crisis workforce -- licensed clinicians, peer specialists, crisis counselors -- requires years of training pipeline development, but the demand for crisis response is urgent today. Interim solutions (telehealth, cross-training, volunteer models) may sacrifice quality for speed.

## Key Questions

1. How can the United States build a complete crisis continuum -- someone to call, someone to respond, a safe place to be -- in every community within the next decade?
2. What governance, funding, and accountability structures are needed to sustain 988 as a system rather than merely a phone number?
3. How should crisis services balance clinical best practices with the realities of workforce shortages, particularly in rural and underserved areas?
4. What role should law enforcement play in mental health crisis response as civilian alternatives are built, and how can the transition be managed safely?

## Vision of Success

A successful mental health crisis services system in the 21st century would feature:

- **Universal Access**: Every person in the United States can reach a trained crisis counselor within minutes by calling, texting, or chatting 988, and a mobile crisis team can respond in person within 60 minutes in urban areas and 90 minutes in rural areas
- **No Wrong Door**: People in crisis are connected to appropriate care regardless of how they enter the system -- through 988, 911, walk-in, or law enforcement encounter -- with seamless warm handoffs between services
- **Health-First Response**: The default first responder to a mental health crisis is a behavioral health professional, not an armed police officer, with law enforcement involvement limited to situations with imminent physical danger
- **Crisis Stabilization Capacity**: Every region has sufficient crisis stabilization beds and 23-hour observation units to prevent unnecessary ED boarding and avoidable psychiatric hospitalizations, with no one waiting more than 2 hours for placement
