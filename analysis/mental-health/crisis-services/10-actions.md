# Mental Health Crisis Services: What You Can Do

Mental health crisis services affect every community in America. Whether you have a personal connection to mental illness, work in healthcare or public safety, or simply want your community to respond more effectively when someone is in crisis, there are concrete steps you can take. The 988 Lifeline, mobile crisis teams, and crisis stabilization facilities need public support to grow from a promising idea into a system that works everywhere.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read SAMHSA's "National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care" (2020) to understand the three pillars of the crisis continuum: Someone to Call, Someone to Respond, A Safe Place to Be. Available free at <https://www.samhsa.gov>
- Follow the 988 Lifeline performance dashboard at SAMHSA's website to track call volume, answer rates, and capacity trends in your state
- Subscribe to NAMI's policy newsletter for updates on federal and state crisis services legislation at <https://www.nami.org/advocacy>
- Read your state mental health authority's annual report to understand what crisis services exist (and do not exist) in your community
- Learn the difference between 988 (mental health crisis) and 911 (medical or safety emergency) and when to call each

### Know Your Local Resources

- Save 988 in your phone contacts. Know that you can call, text, or chat 988 for yourself or on behalf of someone else
- Find out whether your community has a mobile crisis team and how to access it (often through 988 or a local crisis hotline)
- Locate the nearest crisis stabilization unit or psychiatric emergency service and learn their intake process
- Identify whether your city has a civilian alternative response program (like CAHOOTS, STAR, or a local equivalent) and how to request it through 911 dispatch
- If you are a veteran, know that pressing 1 after dialing 988 connects you to the Veterans Crisis Line

### Make Personal Changes

- Learn Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) -- an 8-hour training that teaches how to recognize and respond to mental health crises. Over 3 million Americans have been certified. Find a class at <https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org>
- Practice speaking openly about mental health to reduce stigma in your family, workplace, and community
- If you have a family member with a mental health condition, develop a crisis plan together that includes preferred crisis contacts, medications, triggers, and de-escalation strategies
- Learn lethal means safety counseling: how to reduce access to firearms and other lethal means for people at risk of suicide. The Means Matter campaign at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health provides guidance at <https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/>

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call or write your U.S. senators and representative to support permanent 988 funding, the enhanced Medicaid FMAP for mobile crisis, and IMD exclusion reform for crisis stabilization. These three policy actions are the highest-impact federal levers for expanding crisis services
- **Submit Public Comments**: When SAMHSA, CMS, or the FCC publish proposed rules related to 988, crisis services, or behavioral health coverage, submit public comments supporting strong standards and adequate funding. Federal rulemaking notices are published at <https://www.regulations.gov>
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When your local newspaper covers a mental health crisis incident -- a suicide, a police shooting of someone in crisis, an ED boarding story -- write a letter connecting the incident to the need for crisis system investment
- **Share Information**: When sharing on social media about mental health, include 988 as a resource. Normalize the idea that calling 988 is as appropriate as calling 911 for a medical emergency

---

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Attend your city council or county board meetings when crisis services, police budgets, or mental health funding are on the agenda. Public comment during these meetings shapes local priorities
- Form or join a local mental health crisis services advocacy group. NAMI affiliates exist in most states and many counties, and welcome new members
- Partner with your local emergency department to understand the psychiatric boarding problem in your community. Ask for data on average psychiatric wait times and advocate for crisis alternatives
- If your community does not have a civilian alternative response program, organize a citizen task force to research models like CAHOOTS, STAR, and B-HEARD and present recommendations to city leaders
- Host a community screening of documentaries about crisis response reform (such as "Ernie & Joe: Crisis Cops" or "The Definition of Insanity") followed by discussion

### Build Coalitions

- Connect mental health advocacy groups with law enforcement leaders who support crisis reform. The International Association of Chiefs of Police and many local sheriffs have endorsed civilian crisis response models
- Build bridges between NAMI chapters, hospital systems, community behavioral health providers, and local government to create a unified voice for crisis services investment
- Engage faith communities in mental health crisis awareness. Many congregations serve as informal crisis supports but lack training and connection to professional resources. Offer to coordinate Mental Health First Aid training through houses of worship
- Work with local chambers of commerce to frame crisis services as an economic issue -- employers lose productivity when employees or their family members cannot access timely crisis care, and businesses near unsheltered populations benefit from effective crisis response

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During the federal budget and appropriations process (typically February-September), when 988 and SAMHSA funding levels are being set
- When crisis services legislation is pending in your state legislature (often January-May in most states)
- When your state is considering whether to implement the Medicaid mobile crisis benefit under ARP Section 9813
- When a high-profile mental health crisis incident in your community creates a window for policy action

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Permanent Funding for 988 and Crisis Services

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge your support for
permanent funding of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and the mental
health crisis services continuum.

In 2023, the 988 Lifeline fielded 5.4 million contacts -- a 125% increase
from 2021. Yet fewer than half of American communities have access to the
full crisis continuum of crisis call centers, mobile crisis teams, and
crisis stabilization facilities. In our state, [insert local fact: e.g.,
"only X counties have mobile crisis teams" or "the average ED wait for a
psychiatric bed is X hours"].

I ask that you support:
1. Permanent federal funding for 988 at $1 billion annually
2. Making the enhanced 85% Medicaid FMAP for mobile crisis permanent
3. IMD exclusion reform to allow federal funding for crisis stabilization
   facilities

Investing in crisis services saves money (Georgia's crisis system saves
$2,264 per episode compared to hospitalization) and saves lives. Every
person in crisis deserves someone to call, someone to respond, and a safe
place to be.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling
to ask [Representative/Senator] [Name] to support permanent funding for
the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline and Medicaid coverage for mobile crisis
teams. In 2023, 988 received 5.4 million contacts, but most communities
still lack mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization beds. I'd like
[his/her/their] support for making 988 funding permanent at $1 billion
per year. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current and proposed legislation to support:

- **National Suicide Hotline Designation Act Reauthorization**: Would establish permanent funding authorization for 988. Contact your senators and representative to co-sponsor
- **Crisis Stabilization and Community Reentry Act**: Would reform the Medicaid IMD exclusion for crisis stabilization facilities. Support through Senate Finance and House Energy and Commerce committee members
- **State 988 Telecom Fee Legislation**: Many states are considering bills to establish a per-line telecom fee (typically $0.08-$0.50/month) to fund crisis services. Contact your state legislators
- **Medicaid Mobile Crisis Permanent Authorization**: Legislation to make ARP Section 9813's enhanced FMAP permanent. Critical priority before the current authorization expires

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support permanent federal funding for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at $1 billion per year?"
2. "What is your plan for ensuring every community has access to mobile crisis teams so that a mental health professional -- not just a police officer -- can respond to people in crisis?"
3. "Will you support reforming the Medicaid IMD exclusion so that crisis stabilization facilities can receive federal funding?"
4. "How would you address the mental health workforce shortage, particularly the 105,000-person gap in crisis services staffing?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who have co-sponsored 988 or crisis services legislation
- Check whether your state legislators voted for or against 988 telecom fee bills
- Evaluate candidates' mental health platforms for specificity -- vague support for "mental health" is common, but support for concrete crisis system investments (988, mobile teams, crisis stabilization) is more meaningful
- Key committees: Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP); Senate Finance; House Energy and Commerce; House Appropriations Labor-HHS Subcommittee

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing mental health crisis services with others, emphasize:

1. **988 is a lifeline, not just a phone number**: In 2023, the 988 Lifeline handled 5.4 million contacts -- a 125% increase from 2021. But the system behind the number is incomplete. Fewer than 50% of communities have mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization facilities
2. **The current system wastes money**: We already spend over $15 billion annually on mental health crises through emergency departments ($2,264/day), jails ($35,000-$60,000/year), and police response. Dedicated crisis services cost less and produce better outcomes -- Georgia saves $2,264 per episode
3. **Health-first response saves lives**: 25% of people killed by police are experiencing a mental health crisis. Civilian crisis teams like CAHOOTS handle 24,000 calls per year with less than 1% requiring police backup. No one should die because a mental health crisis was treated as a crime
4. **This is a workforce problem, not just a funding problem**: The crisis system needs 105,000 additional workers -- licensed clinicians, peer specialists, crisis counselors. The average crisis counselor earns $37,000-$45,000 annually. We cannot build this system without paying people to staff it

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "People in mental health crisis are dangerous" | People with mental illness commit only 3-5% of violent acts and are 2.5-11 times more likely to be victims of violence | NIMH, 2023 |
| "988 is a surveillance tool" | 988 privacy policies prohibit sharing caller information with law enforcement absent imminent danger; federal HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 protections apply | SAMHSA; Vibrant Emotional Health, 2023 |
| "Sending unarmed crisis teams is reckless" | CAHOOTS has operated since 1989 with <1% police backup rate; Denver STAR had zero arrests in 3 years | CAHOOTS, 2023; Denver DPH, 2024 |
| "We can't afford to build crisis services" | Every $1 invested in mobile crisis saves $2.16 in avoided ED, hospital, and jail costs | RAND, 2022 |
| "Mental health crises are a personal/family matter, not a public responsibility" | 49,449 Americans died by suicide in 2022; many had no family support or needed clinical intervention beyond what informal networks provide | CDC WISQARS, 2023 |
