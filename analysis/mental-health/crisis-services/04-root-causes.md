# Mental Health Crisis Services: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current challenges in mental health crisis services are not the result of a single failure but of several long-term, interlocking trends. These include the incomplete legacy of deinstitutionalization, a fragmented funding and governance structure that no single entity controls, a behavioral health workforce unable to meet demand, the persistent default to law enforcement as crisis responders, and financial incentives that reward institutional care over community-based crisis intervention.

## Structural and Historical Causes

### The Unfinished Business of Deinstitutionalization

The United States dismantled its state hospital system without building the community infrastructure to replace it. Between 1955 and 2000, state psychiatric hospital capacity declined from 559,000 beds to approximately 50,000. The community mental health centers that were supposed to absorb this population were never fully funded or built. The result was a permanent structural gap: the old system was destroyed, but the new system was never completed.

**Evidence**: As of 2023, the total supply of state psychiatric hospital beds stands at approximately 37,000 -- roughly 11 beds per 100,000 population, compared to 340 per 100,000 in 1955 (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2023). Community crisis capacity (crisis stabilization units, receiving centers, 23-hour observation beds) totals approximately 12,500 beds nationally -- far below the 8-12 per 100,000 standard recommended by SAMHSA.

### Fragmented Governance

No single entity is responsible for crisis services. The crisis system spans federal agencies (SAMHSA, CMS, VA), state mental health authorities, county behavioral health departments, hospital systems, law enforcement agencies, and non-profit organizations. This fragmentation produces coordination failures at every level.

**Evidence**: A person in crisis in a typical American community may encounter systems governed by at least five separate funding streams (Medicaid, state general funds, county funds, federal grants, private insurance) and overseen by different agencies with different eligibility criteria, data systems, and performance standards. SAMHSA identified fragmented governance as the top barrier to crisis system development in its 2020 National Guidelines (SAMHSA, 2020).

### The Medicaid IMD Exclusion

The Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, embedded in Medicaid since 1965, prohibits federal Medicaid payment for care provided to most adults ages 21-64 in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds. This 60-year-old policy creates a direct financial barrier to building crisis stabilization facilities of adequate scale.

**Evidence**: States that want to build crisis stabilization units with more than 16 beds face the loss of all federal Medicaid matching funds for those facilities. This incentivizes small, fragmented facilities rather than efficient, well-staffed crisis centers. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that fully repealing the IMD exclusion would cost $5-7 billion over 10 years but would enable substantial expansion of crisis and inpatient capacity (CBO, 2023).

## Workforce and Capacity Causes

### Severe Behavioral Health Workforce Shortages

The crisis services workforce cannot be built overnight. The pipeline for licensed clinicians requires 6-10 years of education and training. Peer specialist certification takes months to years. Meanwhile, existing crisis workers face burnout, low pay, and vicarious trauma that drive annual turnover above 30%.

**Evidence**: HRSA designates more than 160 million Americans as living in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) (HRSA, 2024). The average salary for a crisis counselor is $37,000-$45,000 annually, compared to $75,000-$120,000 for comparable clinical roles in private practice or hospital settings (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023). The resulting 70% vacancy rate across crisis roles is the single largest barrier to expanding services.

### Inadequate Training Pipelines

Graduate programs in psychology, social work, and counseling produce insufficient numbers of clinicians trained in crisis intervention. Most programs focus on outpatient therapy rather than acute crisis response. Peer specialist certification programs are growing but remain small relative to need.

**Evidence**: The United States produces approximately 25,000 new licensed clinical social workers, 15,000 new licensed professional counselors, and 1,500 new psychiatrists annually (HRSA, 2023). Of these, fewer than 10% enter crisis-focused roles. At current training rates, it would take over 15 years to fill the estimated 105,000-person gap in crisis workforce positions.

## Funding and Financial Causes

### Chronic Underfunding of Community Mental Health

Mental health spending as a share of total health spending has declined from approximately 7% in 1986 to 5.5% in 2020 (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022). Within mental health budgets, crisis services receive a small fraction -- an estimated 3-5% of behavioral health spending in most states (NASMHPD, 2023). State mental health agencies devote the majority of their budgets to operating remaining state hospitals and funding community outpatient services, with crisis services often treated as a residual category.

**Evidence**: Total state mental health authority expenditures were approximately $44 billion in FY2022 (NASMHPD, 2023). Of this, an estimated $1.5-2.2 billion was directed specifically to crisis services -- representing 3-5% of the total, despite crisis services serving as the front door to the entire system.

### Misaligned Financial Incentives

The current payment system rewards expensive institutional interventions (ED visits, inpatient hospitalizations) over less costly community-based crisis care. Hospitals receive Medicaid and commercial insurance reimbursement for ED visits and inpatient stays. Crisis stabilization units, mobile crisis teams, and crisis call centers receive inconsistent and often inadequate reimbursement.

**Evidence**: A psychiatric ED visit costs $2,264 per day on average (Milliman, 2022), and an inpatient psychiatric admission averages $1,800-$2,500 per day (AHRQ, 2023). A crisis stabilization unit stay costs $600-$900 per day, and a mobile crisis team response costs $350-$500 per encounter (Georgia DBHDD, 2022). Despite the lower cost, crisis stabilization and mobile response are less reliably reimbursed, particularly for uninsured and underinsured individuals.

### Short-Term Funding Cycles

Federal crisis funding has been episodic and time-limited. The enhanced 85% FMAP for mobile crisis services under ARP Section 9813 was authorized for only three years. 988 Lifeline funding depends on annual appropriations that have varied significantly from year to year. States are reluctant to build permanent crisis infrastructure on temporary federal dollars.

**Evidence**: Federal 988 funding increased from $282 million (FY2022) to $502 million (FY2024), but the Congressional Budget Office projects this level may not be sustained in future fiscal years without new authorizing legislation. Only 9 states have enacted dedicated 988 telecom fees to provide a stable state revenue source (NAMI, 2024).

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Hospital systems | ED psychiatric visits generate revenue, even if suboptimal care | $5.4 billion/year in psychiatric ED billing (AHA, 2023) | Community crisis alternatives divert patients and revenue from EDs |
| Private prison/jail operators | People with mental illness constitute ~40% of jail populations | $3.6 billion/year in mental health-related incarceration costs (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022) | Crisis diversion reduces jail census |
| Law enforcement agencies | Mental health calls justify staffing and overtime budgets | 10-20% of patrol time on mental health calls | Alternative response programs reduce police role and potentially budgets |
| Insurance companies | Low reimbursement rates for crisis services reduce payouts | Billions saved by denying or limiting crisis coverage | Expanded crisis mandates increase costs |
| Pharmaceutical companies | Acute psychiatric medications prescribed in crisis settings | Major revenue from emergency psychiatric medications | Preference for medication-first approaches over crisis de-escalation |

### Perverse Incentives

The current system creates multiple misaligned incentives:

- **Hospitals gain revenue from ED boarding**: While hospitals advocate against boarding, the reimbursement structure means psychiatric ED visits generate more per-patient revenue than crisis stabilization alternatives
- **States save money by not building crisis capacity**: When people in crisis go to EDs (paid by Medicaid/insurance) or jail (paid by counties), state mental health agencies avoid the cost of building crisis infrastructure
- **Police departments justify budgets through crisis calls**: Mental health calls, while burdensome, constitute a significant share of call volume that supports staffing levels and budget requests
- **IMD exclusion discourages scale**: The 16-bed cap discourages efficient, larger crisis facilities in favor of small, fragmented operations

## Cultural and Institutional Factors

### Stigma and Public Attitudes

Public perception of mental illness as dangerous continues to shape policy. Media coverage disproportionately links mental illness to violence (despite people with mental illness being far more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence), creating political pressure for custodial rather than therapeutic responses to crisis.

**Evidence**: A 2023 AP-NORC poll found that 46% of Americans believe people with serious mental illness are more dangerous than others, a misperception that supports law enforcement-led crisis response. Research consistently shows that individuals with mental illness commit only 3-5% of violent acts, while experiencing victimization at rates 2.5-11 times higher than the general population (NIMH, 2023).

### Law Enforcement Culture and Training Gaps

Despite the spread of CIT training, policing culture remains oriented toward control, authority, and officer safety in ways that can conflict with therapeutic crisis response. Only 15% of officers have completed 40-hour CIT training (CIT International, 2024), and even trained officers may default to enforcement-oriented responses under stress.

**Evidence**: Studies of CIT-trained officers show improved attitudes and knowledge but mixed results on behavioral outcomes. A 2022 meta-analysis found that CIT reduces arrest rates by 5-10% but does not significantly reduce use of force in crisis encounters (Rogers et al., *Psychiatric Services*, 2022).

## Causal Chain

```text
Deinstitutionalization (1955-2000) → Community infrastructure never built
    ↓
Fragmented governance → No single entity accountable for crisis system
    ↓
Chronic underfunding → Workforce cannot be recruited or retained
    ↓
No mobile teams / No crisis beds → Police and EDs become default responders
    ↓
Poor outcomes (arrests, boarding, deaths) → Demand for reform
    ↓
Episodic federal investment → Temporary gains, unsustainable programs
    ↓
Cycle repeats without structural funding reform
```

## Why Reform Has Failed

Past reform efforts have been hampered by several recurring obstacles:

1. **Lack of a single accountable authority**: No federal agency has the authority to mandate that states build crisis systems. SAMHSA issues guidelines and distributes grants but cannot compel compliance. This means reform depends on voluntary state action, which varies enormously based on political will, fiscal capacity, and existing infrastructure.

2. **Time-limited funding**: Federal crisis investments -- from the original CMHC Act to ARP Section 9813 -- have typically been authorized for limited periods. States and communities are reluctant to build permanent programs on temporary money, creating a pattern of pilot programs that launch, demonstrate results, and then collapse when funding expires.

3. **Opposition from status quo beneficiaries**: Hospitals, law enforcement agencies, and insurers all have financial interests in the current system, even when they publicly advocate for reform. Policy changes that would shift resources from EDs and jails to community crisis services face quiet resistance from institutions that would lose revenue or influence.

4. **Workforce as a binding constraint**: Even when funding is available, the workers needed to staff crisis services do not exist in sufficient numbers. Building the pipeline takes years and requires sustained investment in education, training, and compensation -- areas where short-term political cycles work against long-term planning.

5. **Stigma and political dynamics**: Mental health crisis services lack the broad political constituency that other health services enjoy. Many people affected by the current system's failures -- people experiencing homelessness, incarceration, or acute psychiatric distress -- have limited political voice and voting power.
