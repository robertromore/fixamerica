# Mental Health Crisis Services: Legislation

## Overview

Building a complete mental health crisis continuum in the United States requires legislative action at the federal and state levels to establish permanent funding, reform Medicaid rules that constrain crisis facility capacity, mandate insurance coverage for crisis services, and create the workforce pipeline needed to staff the system. This document presents a comprehensive legislative approach centered on two major federal bills -- one addressing 988 and crisis system infrastructure, the other reforming Medicaid financing -- supplemented by state model legislation for 988 telecom fees. The approach is primarily incremental, building on existing authorities (the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, ARP Section 9813, the Mental Health Parity Act) rather than creating entirely new federal programs.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for mental health crisis services reform. The federal government has clear authority under the Commerce Clause and Spending Clause to fund crisis services, set Medicaid conditions, and regulate telecommunications. State legislation operates under traditional state police powers governing public health and safety.*

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To permanently fund the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, establish a
national crisis services workforce program, authorize a national
telecommunications fee for crisis services, and set performance
standards for the mental health crisis continuum.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "988 Lifeline Sustainability and Crisis
Continuum Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline fielded 5.4 million contacts
    in 2023, an increase of 125 percent from 2021 (SAMHSA, 2024).
(2) In 2022, 49,449 Americans died by suicide, making it the 11th
    leading cause of death in the United States (CDC WISQARS, 2023).
(3) As of 2024, fewer than 50 percent of United States communities
    have access to the full crisis continuum of crisis call centers,
    mobile crisis teams, and crisis stabilization facilities
    (NASMHPD, 2024).
(4) Emergency departments treated approximately 7.8 million visits
    involving a primary mental health diagnosis in 2021, with median
    psychiatric boarding times of 6.5 hours (HCUP/AHRQ, 2023;
    ACEP, 2023).
(5) People experiencing mental health crises account for at least
    25 percent of fatal police shootings (Washington Post, 2023).
(6) Civilian crisis response programs such as CAHOOTS demonstrate
    that fewer than 1 percent of mental health crisis contacts
    require law enforcement backup when trained crisis workers
    respond (CAHOOTS Annual Report, 2023).
(7) Every dollar invested in mobile crisis services saves an
    estimated $2.16 in avoided emergency department visits,
    hospitalizations, and incarceration (RAND, 2022).
(8) The crisis services workforce faces a shortage of approximately
    105,000 workers, with annual turnover exceeding 30 percent and
    average compensation of $37,000 to $45,000 (SAMHSA, 2024;
    HRSA, 2023).

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Permanent 988 Funding)**: Replaces time-limited authorization with permanent $1 billion annual authorization through FY2036, with mandatory allocation ensuring local centers receive the majority of funds. This addresses the core vulnerability of the current system -- dependence on annual appropriations
- **Section 5 (Telecom Fee)**: Establishes a framework for state 988 fees modeled on the successful E-911 fee structure. Includes anti-diversion provisions to prevent states from redirecting crisis funds to general revenue, a problem that plagued E-911 fees
- **Section 6 (Crisis Corps)**: Creates a dedicated workforce pipeline with loan repayment, scholarships, and salary supplements. The minimum salary provisions ($55,000 entry-level, $75,000 licensed) address the primary driver of crisis workforce turnover -- compensation below market rates
- **Section 8 (Performance Standards)**: Sets measurable, enforceable national standards for the first time. The Report Card creates accountability through transparency rather than punitive sanctions

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| FCC publishes proposed 988 telecom fee rules | 12 months after enactment | FCC |
| HRSA publishes Crisis Corps program regulations | 12 months after enactment | HRSA |
| First civilian alternative response grants awarded | 12 months after enactment | SAMHSA / DOJ |
| FCC publishes 988-911 interoperability standards | 18 months after enactment | FCC / SAMHSA |
| National performance standards published | 24 months after enactment | HHS |
| First Crisis Corps placements | 24 months after enactment | HRSA |
| First annual Report Card published | 24 months after enactment | HHS |

**Regulatory Authority**: SAMHSA administers 988 grants and crisis services grants. HRSA administers the Crisis Corps. FCC implements telecom fee framework and interoperability standards. CMS implements Medicaid-related provisions in companion legislation (see below).

**Challenges**:

- **Telecom fee resistance**: Telecommunications industry may oppose new fee collection obligations
- **State participation**: Some states may decline to enact 988 telecom fees even with federal framework
- **Appropriations risk**: Authorization does not guarantee appropriation; annual funding remains subject to Congressional appropriations process

**Refinements**:

- **Mandatory appropriation**: Consider mandatory (rather than discretionary) appropriation for core 988 operations to insulate from annual budget politics
- **Incentive structure**: Offer increased federal matching for states that enact 988 telecom fees, creating a financial incentive for adoption
- **Phased standards**: Allow states that have not yet built crisis capacity a grace period before performance standards take full effect

### The Crisis Stabilization and Medicaid Reform Act

**Purpose**: Reform the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion for crisis stabilization facilities, make the enhanced 85% FMAP for mobile crisis services permanent, and require all Medicaid programs to cover the full crisis continuum.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Exempt crisis stabilization facilities (stays under 72 hours) from the IMD exclusion regardless of facility size
2. Make permanent the enhanced 85% FMAP for Medicaid-covered mobile crisis services (currently time-limited under ARP Section 9813)
3. Require state Medicaid programs to cover crisis call center contacts, mobile crisis team responses, crisis stabilization stays, and post-crisis follow-up as mandatory benefits
4. Authorize $5 billion in capital grants over 5 years for crisis stabilization facility construction and renovation

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To reform the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Diseases exclusion
for crisis stabilization facilities, permanently enhance the
federal medical assistance percentage for mobile crisis services,
and require Medicaid coverage of the mental health crisis
continuum.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Crisis Stabilization and Medicaid
Reform Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. IMD EXCLUSION REFORM FOR CRISIS STABILIZATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act
(42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)) is amended by adding at the end the
following:

"Notwithstanding subparagraph (B), medical assistance shall be
available for services provided to individuals ages 21 through 64
in a crisis stabilization facility, as defined in section 3,
regardless of the number of beds in such facility, for stays not
to exceed 72 hours.".

(b) DEFINITION.--For purposes of the amendment made by
subsection (a), the term "crisis stabilization facility" means a
facility licensed or certified by the State to provide short-term
crisis stabilization services to individuals experiencing a
behavioral health crisis, including crisis stabilization units,
crisis receiving centers, and 23-hour observation facilities.

SEC. 3. PERMANENT ENHANCED FMAP FOR MOBILE CRISIS.

Section 9813 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law
117-2) is amended--
    (1) by striking "during the first 3 years" and inserting "on
        a permanent basis"; and
    (2) by striking the sunset date.

SEC. 4. MANDATORY MEDICAID CRISIS SERVICES COVERAGE.

Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a))
is amended by adding at the end the following:

"(XX) provide that the State plan covers the following crisis
services for all eligible individuals without prior authorization:
    (A) crisis call center contacts through the 988 Lifeline or
        equivalent State crisis line;
    (B) mobile crisis team responses;
    (C) crisis stabilization facility stays of up to 72 hours; and
    (D) post-crisis follow-up services for not less than 30 days
        following a crisis contact.".

SEC. 5. CRISIS STABILIZATION CAPITAL GRANTS.

(a) IN GENERAL.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
award grants to States and qualified entities for the
construction, renovation, or expansion of crisis stabilization
facilities.

(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.--There are authorized to be
appropriated to carry out this section--
    (1) $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

(c) MATCHING REQUIREMENT.--A State or entity receiving a grant
under this section shall provide non-Federal matching funds of
not less than 25 percent of the grant amount.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

(a) Sections 2 and 3 shall take effect on the date that is
180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.

(b) Section 4 shall take effect on the date that is 2 years
after the date of enactment of this Act, to provide States
time to submit State plan amendments.

(c) Section 5 shall take effect on the date of enactment of
this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (IMD Reform)**: Carves out crisis stabilization (stays under 72 hours) from the IMD exclusion without repealing the exclusion entirely. This targeted approach minimizes budget impact while removing the specific barrier to crisis facility construction
- **Section 3 (Permanent FMAP)**: Makes the 85% enhanced FMAP permanent, providing long-term certainty for states that have built or are building mobile crisis programs
- **Section 4 (Mandatory Coverage)**: Requires Medicaid coverage of the full crisis continuum as a mandatory benefit, eliminating state-by-state variation. The 2-year effective date gives states time to submit state plan amendments
- **Section 5 (Capital Grants)**: Provides $5 billion over 5 years for construction with a 25% state match, ensuring federal investment leverages state commitment

**Challenges**:

- **CBO score**: IMD exclusion reform and permanent FMAP will have a significant budget cost (estimated $8-12 billion over 10 years)
- **State resistance**: Mandatory Medicaid coverage requirement may face opposition from states that view it as a federal mandate
- **Construction timelines**: Crisis facility construction takes 2-4 years from planning to occupancy

**Refinements**:

- **Phased mandate**: Allow states 3 years (instead of 2) to implement mandatory coverage, with SAMHSA technical assistance
- **IMD bed cap**: Consider a modified cap (e.g., 50 beds rather than 16) instead of complete exemption for crisis facilities, to address concerns about recreating large institutions
- **Pay-for provisions**: Include CBO-scorable offsets such as Medicaid integrity savings or reduced ED utilization projections

## State Model Legislation

### Model State 988 Telecommunications Fee Act

**Purpose**: Establish a dedicated per-line telecommunications fee to sustainably fund 988 Lifeline operations and crisis services at the state level.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize fee amounts based on their crisis system needs and existing funding levels. States with already-developed crisis systems (e.g., Georgia, Colorado) may set lower fees; states building from the ground up may need higher fees. The model uses $0.25/line/month as a baseline, generating approximately $60-$100 million annually in a mid-sized state.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] 988 Crisis
Services Funding Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(a) The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline requires sustainable state
    funding to ensure adequate staffing and capacity.
(b) Nine states have enacted 988 telecommunications fees as of
    2024, providing a proven revenue model.
(c) A dedicated fee ensures that crisis services funding cannot
    be diverted to unrelated purposes.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "988 SERVICES" means services associated with the 988 Suicide
    & Crisis Lifeline, including crisis call center operations,
    mobile crisis team dispatch, crisis stabilization, and crisis
    services workforce development.
(b) "TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE" means any wireline, wireless,
    or voice-over-internet-protocol service that enables a user
    to originate a call to 988.

SECTION 4. 988 CRISIS SERVICES FEE.

(a) FEE IMPOSED.--There is hereby imposed a fee of $0.25 per month
    on each active telecommunications line in the State.
(b) COLLECTION.--Telecommunications providers shall collect the fee
    and remit to the [State Treasurer/Revenue Department] on a
    quarterly basis.
(c) DEDICATED FUND.--All proceeds shall be deposited into the
    [State] 988 Crisis Services Fund, which is hereby established
    as a dedicated, non-lapsing fund.
(d) NON-DIVERSION.--Funds in the 988 Crisis Services Fund shall
    be used exclusively for 988 services and shall not be
    transferred to the general fund or any other purpose.

SECTION 5. USE OF FUNDS.

Monies in the 988 Crisis Services Fund shall be allocated as
follows:

(a) Not less than 40 percent for 988 Lifeline center operations
    in the State, including staffing, training, and technology.
(b) Not more than 30 percent for mobile crisis team operations.
(c) Not more than 20 percent for crisis stabilization facility
    operations.
(d) Not more than 10 percent for crisis services workforce
    development and training.

SECTION 6. OVERSIGHT AND REPORTING.

The [State Mental Health Authority] shall submit an annual report
to the Legislature on the use of 988 Crisis Services Fund monies,
including service volumes, performance metrics, and expenditures.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], with fee collection beginning
on the first day of the second quarter following the effective date.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agencies**:

- **SAMHSA**: Lead agency for 988 Lifeline operations, crisis services grants, and national performance standards
- **CMS**: Medicaid coverage policy, IMD exclusion implementation, FMAP administration
- **HRSA**: Crisis Corps workforce development program
- **FCC**: 988 telecom fee framework and 988-911 interoperability standards

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **988 Telecom Fee Framework (FCC)**: Rules establishing fee collection procedures, remittance schedules, and anti-diversion enforcement. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment
2. **Crisis Corps Program Regulations (HRSA)**: Eligibility criteria, loan repayment terms, placement site designation, and salary supplement administration. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment
3. **National Performance Standards (HHS)**: Detailed specifications for answer rate targets, response time measurement methodology, bed capacity calculations, and reporting requirements. Statutory deadline: 24 months after enactment
4. **Medicaid Crisis Coverage Requirements (CMS)**: State plan amendment template, benefit definitions, reimbursement rate guidance, and provider certification standards. Statutory deadline: 18 months after Section 4 enactment

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Federal funding conditions**: States that fail to meet performance standards after a 3-year grace period may have crisis services grant funding reduced
- **Medicaid compliance**: CMS can withhold Medicaid matching funds for states that do not submit required state plan amendments
- **Telecom fee anti-diversion**: FCC can impose civil penalties on states that divert 988 fee revenue to non-crisis purposes, modeled on existing E-911 fee anti-diversion authorities
- **Public transparency**: The annual Report Card creates reputational accountability by publicly comparing state performance
- **No private right of action**: The legislation does not create a private right of action for individuals to sue states for failure to provide crisis services, though existing ADA (Olmstead) obligations remain

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Federal regulation of the 988 telecommunications system rests on well-established Commerce Clause authority over interstate telecommunications. The 988 Lifeline routes calls across state lines, and telecommunications providers operate in interstate commerce. No serious constitutional challenge is anticipated on this basis.

**Spending Clause and Medicaid Conditions**: Mandatory Medicaid crisis coverage requirements must satisfy the *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012) standard -- they must not be coercive by threatening to withdraw all Medicaid funding for non-compliance. The legislation addresses this by tying new requirements to new funding (enhanced FMAP) rather than conditioning existing Medicaid funds on adoption. This "new funds for new conditions" approach is constitutionally sound under existing precedent.

**Tenth Amendment**: The legislation does not commandeer state legislatures or executive officials. Federal performance standards apply only to federally funded programs and services. State 988 telecom fees are authorized but not mandated -- states may choose whether to adopt them.

### Preemption

The 988 telecom fee framework expressly preempts state laws that prohibit or restrict telecommunications providers from collecting 988 fees. However, states retain authority to set fee amounts within the federal maximum ($0.50/line/month) and to determine fund allocation priorities. The legislation includes a savings clause preserving state crisis services laws that provide protections greater than federal minimums.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance with Medicaid crisis coverage requirements is enforced through the standard CMS state plan review process. States must submit state plan amendments within 2 years of enactment. CMS has authority to disapprove non-compliant state plans and to withhold the enhanced FMAP for states that do not meet coverage requirements.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Telecom fee diversion | States collect 988 fees but redirect revenue to general fund or unrelated programs, as occurred with E-911 fees in multiple states | High | Add federal clawback authority: if GAO audit finds diversion, state loses eligibility for federal crisis grants for 2 years. Require annual state auditor certification of fund use |
| IMD exclusion workaround | States classify crisis stabilization stays as exceeding 72 hours to avoid cost of providing the benefit, or facilities game length-of-stay documentation | Medium | Require CMS to publish standardized length-of-stay measurement protocols. Impose penalties for facilities with pattern of documented stays of exactly 73+ hours |
| Performance standard evasion | States report inflated answer rates or response times by cherry-picking data or excluding hard-to-serve calls from metrics | Medium | Require standardized, automated data reporting directly from 988 and dispatch systems rather than state self-reported data. SAMHSA audits of data integrity |
| Civilian alternative response scope limitation | Cities establish minimal programs that technically meet grant requirements but serve only a fraction of eligible calls | Medium | Require grantees to demonstrate that civilian teams respond to at least 25% of eligible mental health 911 calls within 3 years, with progressive targets |
| Workforce salary supplement capture | Employing organizations receive salary supplements but do not pass full amounts to workers, using funds to subsidize other operations | Medium | Require salary supplements to be paid directly to workers as identified line items on pay stubs. Annual HRSA audits of participating sites |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| No mandatory federal appropriation | Authorization does not guarantee funding; 988 remains vulnerable to annual appropriations politics | Budget scoring rules make mandatory spending harder to enact; political resistance to entitlement spending | Pair discretionary authorization with telecom fee revenue as a backup funding stream that does not depend on appropriations |
| Rural coverage gap | Performance standards (60-min urban, 90-min rural response) may be unachievable in frontier areas with <7 people per square mile | Geographic reality of low population density | Authorize telehealth-assisted crisis response as an acceptable alternative to in-person response in designated frontier areas |
| No enforcement teeth for performance standards | Report Card creates transparency but does not impose consequences for states that fail to meet targets | Political difficulty of penalizing states for failing to provide services | Consider adding financial incentive bonuses for states that meet or exceed targets, rather than penalties for failure |
| Medicaid-only coverage mandate | Legislation mandates Medicaid coverage but does not extend the same mandate to commercial insurance or Medicare | Different regulatory authorities and legislative vehicles | Companion legislation amending the Mental Health Parity Act to explicitly include crisis services as a covered category |
| Workforce pipeline lag | Crisis Corps will take 3-5 years to produce significant numbers of workers; near-term workforce gaps remain | Training timelines for licensed clinicians (6-10 years) | Expand scope of practice for peer specialists and crisis paraprofessionals to fill near-term gaps while licensed workforce pipeline develops |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-Diversion Enforcement**: Amend Section 5(e) of the 988 Lifeline Sustainability Act to add: "The Comptroller General shall conduct biennial audits of State 988 fund expenditures. If the Comptroller General finds that a State has diverted 988 fee revenue to non-crisis purposes, the State shall be ineligible for federal crisis services grants under Section 4(h)(4) for a period of 2 fiscal years following the finding."
2. **Frontier Area Exemption**: Add a subsection to Section 8 providing: "In areas designated by the Secretary as frontier areas (population density of fewer than 7 persons per square mile), the Secretary may authorize telehealth-assisted crisis response as satisfying the mobile crisis response time standard."
3. **Commercial Insurance Parity**: Introduce companion legislation amending 29 U.S.C. Section 1185a (Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act) to add: "The term 'mental health benefits' includes crisis services, defined as crisis line contacts, mobile crisis team responses, crisis stabilization facility stays, and post-crisis follow-up services."
4. **Performance Incentive Bonuses**: Add Section 8(c): "The Secretary shall award performance bonus grants of up to $5,000,000 annually to each State that meets or exceeds all performance standards established under subsection (a) for 2 consecutive years."
5. **Salary Supplement Transparency**: Add to Section 6(b)(4): "Any salary supplement provided under this section shall be identified as a separate line item on the employee's pay statement and shall not be used by the employing organization for any purpose other than direct compensation to the crisis worker."

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The legislation authorizes appropriations through FY2036 (10 years). The following review provisions ensure ongoing evaluation:

- **Year 3 Mid-Program Review**: GAO conducts a comprehensive assessment of 988 Lifeline performance, Crisis Corps placements, and civilian alternative response program outcomes. Report to Congress with recommendations
- **Year 5 Performance Standard Review**: HHS reviews and updates national performance standards based on the first 3 years of data
- **Year 8 Reauthorization Preparation**: GAO conducts a full program evaluation to inform reauthorization debate, including cost-benefit analysis and comparison with international crisis system models
- **Year 10 Sunset**: Authorization of appropriations expires, requiring Congressional reauthorization. All programs continue operating during a 2-year extension period while reauthorization is debated
