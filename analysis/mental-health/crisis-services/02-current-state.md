# Mental Health Crisis Services: Current State

## 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline

The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline launched on July 16, 2022, replacing the previous 10-digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number (1-800-273-8255). The transition represented a fundamental rebranding and expansion effort, positioning 988 as the mental health equivalent of 911.

### Call Volume and Performance

| Metric | 2021 (Pre-988) | 2022 (Transition Year) | 2023 (First Full Year) | Trend |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total contacts (calls, texts, chats) | 2.4 million | 3.6 million | 5.4 million | Up 125% from 2021 |
| Calls answered in-network | 72% | 79% | 85% | Up |
| Average speed of answer | 2 min 35 sec | 1 min 48 sec | 42 seconds | Down |
| Texts/chats as share of contacts | 18% | 24% | 31% | Up |
| Contacts routed to backup centers | 28% | 21% | 15% | Down |

### Network Infrastructure

The 988 network operates through approximately 200 local and regional crisis centers across all 50 states and U.S. territories. These centers are coordinated by Vibrant Emotional Health (the network administrator under contract with SAMHSA) and follow a routing structure that directs calls to the geographically nearest center first, with overflow to backup centers.

| Infrastructure Component | Status (2024) | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Local/regional crisis centers | ~200 centers | Many centers understaffed; rural areas underserved |
| Specialized sub-networks | Veterans Crisis Line, Spanish-language, LGBTQI+ | Deaf/hard-of-hearing access limited |
| Text/chat capacity | Available nationwide | Response times longer than phone |
| 988-to-911 coordination protocols | 12 states with formal protocols | 38 states lack formal interoperability |
| Real-time dashboard | SAMHSA dashboard launched 2023 | Limited granularity at local level |

### Funding

| Funding Source | Amount (FY2024) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Federal appropriation (SAMHSA) | $502 million | Includes 988 operations + crisis services grants |
| State telecom fees for 988 | 9 states enacted fees (as of 2024) | Ranges from $0.08 to $0.50/line/month |
| State general fund appropriations | Varies widely | Some states allocate $0; others $20M+ |
| Medicaid reimbursement for crisis services | Available in 28 states | Mobile crisis benefit under ARP Section 9813 |

## Mobile Crisis Teams

Mobile crisis teams -- multidisciplinary teams that respond in person to individuals experiencing a mental health crisis -- are the critical link between a call to 988 and in-person care. SAMHSA's crisis continuum framework designates mobile crisis as the "Someone to Respond" component.

### Coverage and Deployment Models

| Deployment Model | Description | Prevalence |
|---|---|---|
| Clinician-led teams | Licensed mental health professional + peer specialist | ~35% of existing teams |
| Co-response teams | Clinician paired with law enforcement officer | ~40% of existing teams |
| Peer-led teams | Certified peer specialists as primary responders | ~10% of existing teams |
| Telehealth-assisted | Remote clinician guiding on-site responder | ~15% of existing teams |

### Geographic Coverage

| Region | Population with Mobile Crisis Access | Average Response Time |
|---|---|---|
| Urban areas (>250K population) | 62% | 45 minutes |
| Suburban areas | 38% | 70 minutes |
| Rural areas (<50K population) | 17% | 120+ minutes |
| Frontier areas (<7 people/sq mi) | <5% | Often unavailable |
| **National average** | **42%** | **~65 minutes** |

*Source: NASMHPD State Survey, 2024; SAMHSA Crisis Services Mapping Project, 2023*

### Staffing

The mobile crisis workforce faces severe shortages. A fully staffed crisis system would require an estimated 150,000 crisis workers nationally; current staffing levels are approximately 45,000 (SAMHSA, 2024). Average turnover in crisis services roles exceeds 30% annually (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023).

| Role | Estimated Need | Current Supply | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Licensed crisis clinicians | 60,000 | 18,000 | 42,000 (70% shortage) |
| Certified peer specialists | 40,000 | 12,000 | 28,000 (70% shortage) |
| Crisis line counselors | 25,000 | 8,500 | 16,500 (66% shortage) |
| Psychiatrists available for crisis consultation | 15,000 | 4,500 | 10,500 (70% shortage) |
| Dispatchers/coordinators | 10,000 | 2,000 | 8,000 (80% shortage) |

*Source: SAMHSA Workforce Report, 2024; HRSA Behavioral Health Workforce Projections, 2023*

### Medicaid Mobile Crisis Benefit

Section 9813 of the American Rescue Plan Act (2021) offered states an enhanced 85% federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for qualifying community-based mobile crisis intervention services for three years. As of 2024, 28 states have implemented or are actively implementing this benefit.

| Implementation Status | Number of States | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Fully operational | 14 | Oregon, California, Massachusetts, Colorado |
| Approved, in launch phase | 8 | Michigan, New York, Illinois |
| Application submitted | 6 | Florida, Texas, Georgia |
| No application | 22 + DC | Many rural and conservative states |

## Crisis Stabilization Capacity

Crisis stabilization units (CSUs), crisis receiving centers, and 23-hour observation beds provide short-term safe spaces for individuals to stabilize without requiring a full inpatient psychiatric admission or prolonged ED stay.

### Bed Capacity

| Facility Type | Estimated National Total | Beds per 100K Population | Recommended Standard |
|---|---|---|---|
| Crisis stabilization units (CSU) | ~5,200 beds | 1.6 | 3-5 per 100K (SAMHSA) |
| Crisis receiving/living rooms | ~1,100 slots | 0.3 | 1-2 per 100K |
| 23-hour observation beds | ~3,400 beds | 1.0 | 2-3 per 100K |
| Psychiatric emergency services (PES) | ~2,800 beds | 0.8 | Variable |
| **Total short-term crisis capacity** | **~12,500** | **3.7** | **8-12 per 100K** |

*Sources: NASMHPD Research Institute, 2023; SAMHSA National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care, 2020*

### State Variation

Crisis stabilization capacity varies enormously across states:

| Category | States | Crisis Beds per 100K |
|---|---|---|
| Well-developed systems | Georgia, Arizona, Colorado | 6-9 per 100K |
| Moderate capacity | Massachusetts, Oregon, Texas | 3-5 per 100K |
| Minimal capacity | Wyoming, West Virginia, Mississippi | <1.5 per 100K |
| Severely deficient | Multiple rural states | <0.5 per 100K |

## Emergency Department Boarding

When crisis stabilization and inpatient psychiatric beds are unavailable, people in mental health crisis are held in emergency departments -- often for extended periods in environments unsuited for psychiatric care. This phenomenon, known as "ED boarding," has reached crisis levels.

### ED Boarding Data

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Annual ED visits for mental health/substance use | 7.8 million (2021) | HCUP/AHRQ, 2023 |
| Patients boarded >24 hours for psychiatric bed | 1 in 4 psychiatric ED patients | ACEP, 2023 |
| Average ED wait for psychiatric admission | 6.5 hours | ACEP Survey, 2023 |
| Longest reported average state ED wait (psychiatric) | 34 hours (North Carolina, 2022) | NC DHHS, 2023 |
| Cost of psychiatric ED boarding per patient/day | $2,264 | Milliman Actuarial Report, 2022 |
| ED visits resulting from 988 referral (2023) | ~8% of 988 contacts | SAMHSA, 2024 |

### Impact on Emergency Departments

- **Capacity strain**: Psychiatric patients occupy ED beds an average of 3 times longer than medical patients, reducing overall ED capacity (ACEP, 2023)
- **Staff safety**: 70% of ED nurses report being physically assaulted by a patient, with psychiatric patients representing a disproportionate share (Emergency Nurses Association, 2023)
- **Patient harm**: ED environments -- bright lights, noise, physical restraints -- can worsen psychiatric symptoms and increase agitation
- **Cost**: Psychiatric ED boarding costs hospitals an estimated $5.4 billion annually in unreimbursed care and lost revenue (AHA, 2023)

## Law Enforcement and Mental Health

### Crisis Calls to 911

An estimated 10 million law enforcement encounters per year involve individuals with mental illness or substance use disorders (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). Most communities have no alternative to dispatching police officers when a crisis occurs.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 911 calls involving mental health | ~10 million/year | Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022 |
| Share of patrol time on mental health calls | 10-20% | Police Executive Research Forum, 2022 |
| Officers killed responding to behavioral health calls | 14% of line-of-duty deaths | FBI LEOKA, 2022 |
| Fatal police encounters involving mental illness | 25% of fatal shootings | Washington Post, 2023 |
| Arrest rate for mental health crisis calls | 15-20% (vs. 5-10% with crisis teams) | Balfour et al., 2022 |

### Crisis Intervention Training (CIT)

The Memphis Model of Crisis Intervention Training, developed in 1988, is the most widely adopted law enforcement training model for mental health crisis response.

| CIT Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Officers who have completed 40-hour CIT | ~750,000 (estimated) |
| Share of all sworn officers | ~15% |
| Departments with any CIT-trained officers | ~2,800 of ~18,000 departments |
| States mandating CIT or equivalent training | 11 states |
| Average CIT training hours | 40 hours |
| Recidivism reduction with CIT | 5-10% fewer re-arrests |

*Sources: CIT International, 2024; Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023*

### Alternative Response Programs

A growing number of communities have launched civilian-led alternatives to police response for mental health calls. The most prominent models include:

| Program | Location | Model | Annual Contacts | Key Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CAHOOTS | Eugene, OR | Unarmed medic + crisis worker | ~24,000 | <1% require police backup |
| STAR | Denver, CO | Mental health clinician + paramedic | ~8,500 | 0 arrests in first 3 years |
| B-HEARD | New York, NY | EMT + social worker | ~16,000 | 50% reduction in ED transport |
| Holistic Alternative to Policing (HAP) | Olympia, WA | Peer specialists + social workers | ~3,000 | 75% resolved without police |
| Right Care | Dallas, TX | Clinician + paramedic | ~11,000 | 96% resolved without arrest |

## Regulatory and Legal Framework

### Key Laws and Regulations

| Law/Regulation | Year | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Community Mental Health Act** | 1963 | Established community mental health centers |
| **EMTALA** | 1986 | Requires hospitals to screen and stabilize all ED patients regardless of ability to pay |
| **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act** | 2008 | Requires insurance coverage parity for mental health |
| **National Suicide Hotline Designation Act** | 2020 | Established 988 as national crisis number |
| **American Rescue Plan Act, Section 9813** | 2021 | Enhanced Medicaid FMAP for mobile crisis services |
| **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act** | 2022 | $500 million for pediatric mental health, some crisis funding |
| **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline launch** | 2022 | Activated 3-digit dialing |

### EMTALA and Psychiatric Emergencies

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (42 U.S.C. Section 1395dd) requires Medicare-participating hospitals with emergency departments to provide a medical screening examination and stabilizing treatment to anyone presenting with an emergency medical condition, including psychiatric emergencies. EMTALA applies to suicidal ideation, psychotic episodes, and acute substance intoxication.

| EMTALA Requirement | Application to Psychiatric Emergencies |
|---|---|
| Medical screening examination | Must assess psychiatric symptoms; cannot turn away behavioral health patients |
| Stabilizing treatment | Must provide psychiatric stabilization or appropriate transfer |
| Transfer requirements | Can transfer for higher level of care with patient consent and accepting facility |
| Anti-dumping provision | Cannot discharge or transfer unstable psychiatric patients due to inability to pay |
| Enforcement | CMS surveys, civil monetary penalties up to $119,942 per violation (2024) |

*Source: NASMHPD State Assessment, 2024; NAMI State Mental Health Legislation Tracker, 2024*

### Rural vs. Urban Disparities

- **Rural areas**: 65% of non-metropolitan counties have no psychiatrist; 47% have no psychologist (HRSA, 2023)
- **Response times**: Mobile crisis teams in rural areas take 2-3 times longer to respond than urban teams
- **Telehealth**: Growing use of telepsychiatry for crisis consultation, but broadband gaps limit reach
- **Transport**: Rural areas face significant challenges transporting patients to crisis facilities, with average distances of 60+ miles to the nearest crisis stabilization unit in frontier areas

## Recent Trends

### Positive Developments (2020-2024)

- **988 launch and growth**: 125% increase in contacts from 2021 to 2023
- **State investment**: At least 18 states increased crisis services funding between 2022 and 2024
- **Medicaid expansion**: 28 states implementing enhanced mobile crisis Medicaid benefit
- **Alternative response programs**: More than 100 communities launched civilian crisis response programs since 2020
- **Federal funding**: Combined federal investment in 988 and crisis services exceeding $1 billion in FY2023-FY2024

### Persistent Challenges

- **Workforce shortages**: Crisis worker vacancy rates remain above 25% nationally
- **Answer rates**: 15% of 988 calls still go to backup centers (2023), indicating local capacity gaps
- **Boarding crisis**: ED psychiatric boarding has worsened, not improved, since 2020
- **Coverage gaps**: 58% of U.S. population lacks access to mobile crisis response
- **Funding sustainability**: Enhanced Medicaid FMAP (85%) under ARP Section 9813 is time-limited; permanent funding unclear

---

## Emerging Challenges

- **Demand surge**: Post-pandemic mental health needs continue to accelerate, particularly among youth (ages 10-24 suicide rates increased 62% from 2010 to 2022; CDC, 2023)
- **Technology integration**: Need for real-time data systems connecting 988 call centers, mobile teams, and crisis facilities to enable coordinated dispatch and bed tracking
- **Fentanyl and polysubstance crises**: Overlapping mental health and substance use crises require dual-trained crisis workers
- **Children and adolescents**: Pediatric mental health crisis volume has surged, but few crisis services are designed for youth populations
- **Veteran-specific needs**: Veterans Crisis Line (dial 988, press 1) handles over 700,000 contacts annually (VA, 2024), but coordination between VA and community crisis services remains inconsistent
