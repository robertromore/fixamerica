# Mental Health Crisis Services: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

Mental health crisis services raise fundamental questions about the proper boundaries between public health and public safety, the role of government in providing emergency behavioral health care, how to balance individual liberty with community protection, and whether crisis response should be a federal responsibility or a local function. The 988 Lifeline, mobile crisis teams, crisis stabilization facilities, and civilian alternative response programs each sit at the intersection of health policy, criminal justice, workforce policy, and fiscal policy -- making them a uniquely cross-cutting issue that engages every major political tradition.

Different political traditions offer distinct visions for how to approach mental health crisis services. This analysis examines the issue through nine distinct political perspectives, exploring how each tradition approaches the core questions and proposed solutions.

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | States concern about costs and government overreach, but many conservative governors have invested in crisis services when presented as public safety and law enforcement support |
| Principle consistency | Fiscal conservatism is selectively applied -- opposes new mental health spending but rarely proposes offsetting cuts to existing inefficient spending on ED boarding and incarceration |
| Goalpost stability | Targets shift: initially opposed 988 creation, then accepted it, now raises cost concerns about expansion |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate -- willing to support targeted investments but frames expansion as competing with other priorities |

**Justification:** Conservatives demonstrate genuine fiscal concern but inconsistently apply cost-effectiveness reasoning. The willingness of conservative governors in Georgia, Texas, and Arizona to invest in crisis systems suggests that principled fiscal objections can be overcome with cost-savings evidence. However, at the federal level, opposition to new spending programs is more reflexive and less responsive to evidence.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- The National Suicide Hotline Designation Act passed the Senate unanimously in 2020, with strong Republican support (S. 2661, 116th Congress)
- Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (R) expanded the state's crisis system, citing law enforcement burden reduction and cost savings
- House Republican Study Committee has expressed concern about 988 funding levels without proposing alternative funding mechanisms

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees that ED boarding is wasteful and law enforcement burden is excessive, but questions the scope of the crisis and attributes some demand to cultural factors rather than system failure |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Accepts workforce shortages and fragmented governance as problems but rejects characterization of underfunding as a root cause; prefers to emphasize regulatory barriers (IMD exclusion) over spending levels |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation. "Mental Health Policy: Principles for Conservative Reform." 2023. Emphasizes deregulation and state flexibility over federal spending
- American Enterprise Institute. "Crisis Services: A Market-Based Approach." 2022. Supports private-sector crisis models with limited government role

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent 988 funding ($1B/year) | 4/10 | Supports 988 concept but opposes permanent mandatory funding at this level | Concern about creating another federal entitlement; prefers time-limited, performance-based authorization |
| Universal mobile crisis teams | 3/10 | Opposes federal mandate for universal coverage | Views as unfunded mandate on states; prefers state-led expansion with block grants |
| Triple crisis stabilization beds | 5/10 | Supports IMD exclusion reform; skeptical of capital grants | IMD reform aligns with deregulation principles; federal construction grants conflict with limited-government values |
| Civilian alternative response | 4/10 | Cautious support for local programs; opposes federal mandate | Concerned about weakening law enforcement; supports local choice rather than federal program |
| Crisis Corps workforce program | 3/10 | Opposes new federal workforce program | Views as government competition with private sector; prefers market-based solutions (higher Medicaid rates) |
| 988-911 integration | 6/10 | Supports improved coordination | Aligns with public safety orientation; fewer concerns about interoperability |
| Medicaid crisis coverage reform | 5/10 | Supports IMD reform; opposes mandatory Medicaid coverage expansion | Selective -- likes deregulation, dislikes mandates |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 988 Lifeline Sustainability Act | 4/10 | Supports 988 but opposes $1B permanent authorization, telecom fee, and Crisis Corps | Cumulative cost; expansion of federal role in health workforce |
| Crisis Stabilization and Medicaid Reform Act | 5/10 | Supports IMD exclusion reform; opposes mandatory Medicaid coverage | Selective engagement -- IMD reform is deregulation; coverage mandate is regulation |
| Model State 988 Telecom Fee Act | 5/10 | Mixed -- supports dedicated funding principle but opposes new fees | Anti-tax instinct conflicts with recognition that crisis services need funding |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would prefer: block grants to states with maximum flexibility and minimal federal conditions; IMD exclusion reform as standalone legislation (without accompanying spending); expansion of faith-based crisis response; liability protections for volunteer crisis responders; Medicaid rate increases for crisis providers rather than new federal programs; and private insurance market incentives for crisis coverage.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Centrist, Constitutionalist (on IMD reform and state flexibility)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal, Populist (on law enforcement burden reduction and cost savings)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on federal spending levels and universal mandates)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to expanding access aligns with stated positions; occasional tension between equity goals and incremental political strategy |
| Principle consistency | Consistently supports government investment in crisis services; applies equity lens across populations |
| Goalpost stability | Stable -- has supported crisis services expansion since pre-988 era through current proposals |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low -- generally willing to accept partial wins and build incrementally |

**Justification:** Liberals demonstrate strong alignment between stated principles (government as problem-solver, equity, access) and positions on crisis services. The main inconsistency is occasional willingness to accept weaker legislation for political pragmatism, which may frustrate progressive allies but reflects genuine strategic calculation rather than bad faith.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Senate Democrats unanimously supported 988 creation and have consistently voted for increased crisis services appropriations
- Biden administration's FY2024 budget requested $502 million for 988, the largest appropriation to date
- Democratic governors in Colorado, Oregon, and California have led state crisis system investments

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with characterization of crisis system deficiencies, workforce shortages, and racial/geographic disparities |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees with structural analysis of underfunding, fragmented governance, and perverse incentives; would add greater emphasis on systemic racism as a root cause |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress. "Building the Mental Health Crisis System America Needs." 2023. Aligns closely with project analysis
- Kennedy Forum. "Parity at 15: Mental Health Parity Implementation Report." 2023. Documents insurance coverage gaps in crisis services

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent 988 funding ($1B/year) | 9/10 | Strong support | May prefer even higher funding levels |
| Universal mobile crisis teams | 8/10 | Strong support for universal coverage and Medicaid mandate | Concerned about adequacy of reimbursement rates |
| Triple crisis stabilization beds | 8/10 | Supports IMD reform and capital grants | Wants equity provisions ensuring facilities in underserved communities |
| Civilian alternative response | 9/10 | Enthusiastic support | Priority on racial equity in program design |
| Crisis Corps workforce program | 9/10 | Strong support | Wants higher salary floors and diversity recruitment provisions |
| 988-911 integration | 8/10 | Supports integration with strong privacy protections | Wants safeguards against data sharing with law enforcement for non-crisis purposes |
| Medicaid crisis coverage reform | 9/10 | Strong support for mandatory coverage | Wants commercial insurance parity as well |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 988 Lifeline Sustainability Act | 8/10 | Strong support | Would prefer mandatory appropriations and stronger equity provisions |
| Crisis Stabilization and Medicaid Reform Act | 9/10 | Strong support | Wants companion commercial insurance mandate |
| Model State 988 Telecom Fee Act | 8/10 | Supports | Concerned about regressivity of flat per-line fees |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would add: stronger racial and ethnic equity provisions in grant formulas; mandatory commercial insurance coverage of crisis services; higher minimum salary requirements for crisis workers; requirements for language access and culturally responsive crisis services; integration of social determinants (housing, employment) into post-crisis follow-up.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Centrist
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on cost-savings framing), Populist (on worker compensation)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on federal mandates)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely committed to structural reform and defunding of punitive approaches; positions align with principles |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies systemic justice lens; links crisis services to broader social determinants |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on principles; willing to accept incremental legislation while continuing to advocate for larger transformation |
| Zero-sum behavior | Some -- may oppose compromises that retain significant law enforcement role in crisis response |

**Justification:** Progressives are consistent in linking crisis services to broader structural issues (housing, poverty, racism, incarceration). Their engagement is principled and predictable. The main risk is that insistence on comprehensive solutions may lead to opposing incremental improvements that do not go far enough.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus has consistently included crisis services in mental health platform, with emphasis on replacing policing with civilian alternatives
- Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) introduced legislation for expanded 988 funding with equity provisions
- Progressive organizations (Center for Popular Democracy, Working Families Party) have supported crisis services as part of broader "reimagine public safety" agenda

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with characterization of system failures; would emphasize racial disparities more prominently |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agrees with structural analysis and would extend it to include capitalism, systemic racism, and mass incarceration as deeper root causes |

**Source references:**

- Center for Popular Democracy. "Freedom to Thrive: Reimagining Safety and Security in Our Communities." 2021. Frames crisis services as alternative to policing
- Roosevelt Institute. "Public Investment in Mental Health Infrastructure." 2023. Argues for large-scale federal investment

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent 988 funding ($1B/year) | 8/10 | Supports but views as insufficient | Would prefer $2-3B annually with mandatory appropriations |
| Universal mobile crisis teams | 9/10 | Strong support with preference for clinician-led (not co-response) models | Opposes co-response models that pair clinicians with police |
| Triple crisis stabilization beds | 7/10 | Supports expansion | Concerned about replicating institutional models; prefers community-based alternatives |
| Civilian alternative response | 10/10 | Core progressive priority | Views as transformative step toward reimagining public safety |
| Crisis Corps workforce program | 9/10 | Strong support | Wants higher salaries, union protections, and community hiring requirements |
| 988-911 integration | 6/10 | Cautious | Concerned about 911 system capturing mental health data for law enforcement use |
| Medicaid crisis coverage reform | 8/10 | Supports | Would prefer single-payer approach that eliminates insurance gatekeeping entirely |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 988 Lifeline Sustainability Act | 7/10 | Supports but views as insufficient | Would prefer larger funding authorization and stronger requirements for civilian-led response |
| Crisis Stabilization and Medicaid Reform Act | 7/10 | Supports IMD reform and Medicaid expansion | Prefers broader Medicaid reform; concerned about institutional model of crisis stabilization |
| Model State 988 Telecom Fee Act | 7/10 | Supports dedicated funding | Would add progressive fee structure based on income rather than flat per-line fee |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would add: mandatory transition timelines for replacing police as primary mental health responders; dedicated funding for communities most affected by police violence; housing-first post-crisis discharge requirements; community ownership models for crisis facilities; single-payer mental health coverage eliminating insurance barriers entirely; decriminalization of substance use to reduce crisis volume.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-corporate framing of insurance barriers), Centrist (on evidence-based civilian response)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Libertarian, Religious Right (on spending levels and government role)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine concern about individual liberty, privacy, and government overreach; positions are principled |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies limited-government principles; same skepticism toward police power and government programs |
| Goalpost stability | Stable -- opposition to government programs is consistent, though support for reducing police encounters creates unusual alignment with progressives |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low -- willing to support reforms that reduce government coercion even if they involve some government spending |

**Justification:** Libertarians are the most philosophically consistent perspective on crisis services, applying their principles uniformly. They oppose both police overreach in mental health encounters and government expansion of behavioral health programs. This creates a distinctive position that overlaps with progressives on reducing police role but diverges sharply on federal spending.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute has published papers supporting alternatives to police response for mental health calls while opposing federal crisis services mandates
- Reason Foundation has covered CAHOOTS positively as an example of reducing government coercion
- Libertarian Party platform consistently opposes new government programs and hidden taxes (telecom fees)

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees that police-centric response is harmful and EDs are inadequate; disagrees with framing that the solution is more government programs |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agrees that government failures (IMD exclusion, regulatory barriers) cause problems; disagrees that underfunding (rather than misregulation) is the core issue |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute. "Ending the Criminalization of Mental Illness." Policy Analysis. 2022. Supports reducing police role while opposing new federal programs
- Reason Foundation. "Alternative Crisis Response: Market Solutions for Mental Health." 2023. Frames civilian response as reducing government coercion

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent 988 funding ($1B/year) | 2/10 | Opposes permanent federal program at this scale | Opposes new entitlements; prefers private-sector alternatives |
| Universal mobile crisis teams | 3/10 | Opposes federal mandate; supports voluntary local programs | Anti-mandate; supports private and nonprofit crisis teams |
| Triple crisis stabilization beds | 5/10 | Supports IMD exclusion repeal as deregulation; opposes capital grants | Strong support for removing regulatory barriers; opposes government construction |
| Civilian alternative response | 7/10 | Supports as alternative to armed government response | Reducing police coercion aligns with liberty principles |
| Crisis Corps workforce program | 2/10 | Opposes new federal workforce program | Views as government competition with private sector and misallocation of labor |
| 988-911 integration | 3/10 | Concerned about data sharing and surveillance | Privacy concerns about government crisis databases |
| Medicaid crisis coverage reform | 3/10 | Opposes expanding Medicaid mandates | Prefers market-based insurance reform; opposes government role in healthcare |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 988 Lifeline Sustainability Act | 2/10 | Opposes most provisions | New spending, new fees, new federal programs all conflict with limited-government principles |
| Crisis Stabilization and Medicaid Reform Act | 4/10 | Supports IMD reform only | Deregulation of IMD exclusion is appealing; Medicaid expansion is not |
| Model State 988 Telecom Fee Act | 2/10 | Opposes | Views as hidden tax; anti-tax principles |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would prefer: full repeal of IMD exclusion (deregulation without new spending); elimination of licensing barriers for peer specialists and crisis workers; tax credits for private crisis services providers; voluntary private/nonprofit crisis response (similar to private fire services); ending qualified immunity for police in crisis encounters; strong data privacy protections prohibiting government access to 988 records.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Constitutionalist (on federalism and limited government), Conservative (on fiscal restraint)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on reducing police role and ending criminalization of mental illness)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist (on federal spending and mandates)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine concern about federal overreach and enumerated powers; positions are principled |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies federalism principles; supports state-level crisis solutions while opposing federal mandates |
| Goalpost stability | Stable -- federalism concerns are persistent and predictable |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low -- willing to support federal action that respects state sovereignty |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists apply federalism principles consistently to crisis services. They support the concept of crisis system improvement but insist on state-led implementation. Their engagement is predictable and principled, making them reliable partners for legislation designed with state flexibility.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Federalist Society has published analyses supporting state-level crisis services innovation while opposing federal mandates
- Constitutional concerns about Spending Clause coercion inform objections to mandatory Medicaid crisis coverage
- Support for IMD exclusion reform as removing an unconstitutional federal constraint on state health policy

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees with factual descriptions of system problems; attributes them primarily to federal overregulation rather than underfunding |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agrees that IMD exclusion and regulatory fragmentation are problems; attributes root causes to federal meddling in state health policy rather than inadequate federal investment |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society. "Mental Health Policy and the 10th Amendment." 2023. Argues for state-led crisis system development
- Goldwater Institute. "Removing Federal Barriers to State Mental Health Innovation." 2022. Supports IMD exclusion repeal as state empowerment

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent 988 funding ($1B/year) | 4/10 | Supports national phone number but not permanent federal program | Telecommunications is federal jurisdiction, but service delivery should be state |
| Universal mobile crisis teams | 3/10 | Opposes federal mandate; supports state programs | Federal mandate violates state sovereignty |
| Triple crisis stabilization beds | 5/10 | Strongly supports IMD exclusion reform; neutral on federal grants | IMD repeal removes unconstitutional federal interference; grants are acceptable if not conditioned |
| Civilian alternative response | 5/10 | Supports as local decision; opposes federal mandate | Local government has police power authority for public safety |
| Crisis Corps workforce program | 3/10 | Opposes federal workforce program | Health workforce is state jurisdiction under 10th Amendment |
| 988-911 integration | 4/10 | Supports voluntary standards; opposes federal mandate | 911 is state/local system; federal interoperability standards raise preemption concerns |
| Medicaid crisis coverage reform | 4/10 | Supports IMD reform; opposes mandatory coverage as potentially coercive | *NFIB v. Sebelius* limits on Spending Clause conditions |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 988 Lifeline Sustainability Act | 3/10 | Supports limited federal role (telecom standards); opposes performance mandates and workforce program | Federal overreach into state health policy |
| Crisis Stabilization and Medicaid Reform Act | 4/10 | Supports IMD reform; opposes mandatory Medicaid coverage | Mandatory coverage may be coercive under NFIB v. Sebelius |
| Model State 988 Telecom Fee Act | 7/10 | Supports state-level legislation | State legislation is the appropriate vehicle for crisis services funding |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would prefer: IMD exclusion repeal as standalone legislation; federal block grants with maximum state flexibility and minimal conditions; state-level crisis service mandates rather than federal requirements; interstate compacts for crisis services coordination rather than federal standards; elimination of federal regulatory barriers to state innovation.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Libertarian (on federalism and limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on state flexibility provisions), Populist (on anti-federal-mandate sentiment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on federal role and mandatory programs)

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | States concern for working families struggling with mental health crises, but positions shift based on partisan framing |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent -- supports government spending when framed as protecting working people, opposes it when framed as expanding bureaucracy |
| Goalpost stability | Unstable -- positions depend heavily on which political coalition is proposing the reform |
| Zero-sum behavior | High -- tends to frame crisis services in us-vs-them terms (e.g., "money for illegal immigrants' mental health instead of our veterans") |

**Justification:** Populists lack a coherent framework for crisis services. They are responsive to emotional appeals about suicide prevention and veteran mental health but resist systematic policy solutions. Their support is contingent on political framing rather than policy substance, making them an unpredictable coalition partner.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Populist politicians have supported 988 funding when framed as veteran suicide prevention while opposing the same funding when framed as social services expansion
- Town hall anecdotes about family members who died by suicide or were shot by police during crisis generate populist support for reform
- Populist media (e.g., Tucker Carlson) has alternately highlighted mental health crisis failures and attacked crisis services as "woke" alternatives to policing

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that the system is failing ordinary people; distrusts expert-driven analysis and data-heavy framing |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Blames institutional elites (insurance companies, hospital corporations, government bureaucrats) but also attributes mental health crises to cultural decline rather than systemic underfunding |

**Source references:**

- American Compass. "The Mental Health Crisis and Working-Class Families." 2023. Populist-conservative framing emphasizing family breakdown
- Populist campaign rhetoric from both parties framing mental health as a "forgotten issue" for working Americans

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent 988 funding ($1B/year) | 5/10 | Supports when framed as suicide prevention; skeptical of "big government program" | Anti-bureaucracy sentiment vs. sympathy for suicide victims |
| Universal mobile crisis teams | 4/10 | Mixed -- supports in principle but suspicious of implementation | Distrust of credentialed professionals; prefers community-based response |
| Triple crisis stabilization beds | 5/10 | Supports concept | Less interested in policy mechanism than in visible, concrete results |
| Civilian alternative response | 4/10 | Depends entirely on framing | Supports if framed as helping police; opposes if framed as "defunding the police" |
| Crisis Corps workforce program | 5/10 | Supports higher pay for crisis workers (pro-worker) | Opposes new federal bureaucracy; supports higher wages |
| 988-911 integration | 4/10 | Suspicious of government data systems | Privacy concerns and distrust of federal coordination |
| Medicaid crisis coverage reform | 5/10 | Supports for "deserving" populations (veterans, children) | Opposes if perceived as benefiting undocumented immigrants or "undeserving" groups |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 988 Lifeline Sustainability Act | 4/10 | Mixed depending on framing | Supports suicide prevention; opposes new taxes and federal programs |
| Crisis Stabilization and Medicaid Reform Act | 4/10 | Mixed | Supports helping working families; opposes Medicaid expansion if seen as benefiting non-citizens |
| Model State 988 Telecom Fee Act | 3/10 | Opposes new fees on phone bills | Anti-tax; sees as burden on working families |

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would prefer: veteran-specific crisis services funded through existing VA authority; anti-corporate measures requiring insurance companies to fully cover crisis services without government expansion; community-based peer support programs run by local volunteers; public shaming of insurance company executives who deny mental health coverage; punitive measures against pharmaceutical companies profiting from psychiatric medications.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Religious Right (on cultural framing), Conservative (on government skepticism)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on anti-insurance-company framing), Progressive (on worker pay)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on government intervention), Constitutionalist (too abstract)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely motivated by evidence and pragmatic outcomes; positions reflect analysis rather than ideology |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies evidence-based, cost-effective criteria across all proposals |
| Goalpost stability | Highly stable -- support is calibrated to evidence and adjusts only when evidence changes |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low -- actively seeks compromise and mutual gains |

**Justification:** Centrists are the most reliable partners on crisis services because their support is evidence-based and non-ideological. They respond to cost-effectiveness data, pilot program results, and outcome metrics. Their positions are predictable and stable. The main limitation is that centrist support may not generate the political energy needed to overcome entrenched opposition.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center published crisis services recommendations endorsed by both Republican and Democratic members
- No Labels and Problem Solvers Caucus members have co-sponsored 988 funding legislation
- Centrist think tanks (Brookings, New America) have published evidence-based analyses supporting crisis services expansion

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with evidence-based assessment of system deficiencies |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees with structural analysis; would emphasize governance and incentive reform over spending levels as the primary lever |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center. "Behavioral Health Integration Task Force Report." 2023. Endorses crisis continuum expansion with bipartisan approach
- Brookings Institution. "Reimagining Public Safety." 2023. Evidence-based analysis supporting civilian crisis response

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent 988 funding ($1B/year) | 8/10 | Supports with performance accountability | Wants robust evaluation and outcome measurement tied to funding |
| Universal mobile crisis teams | 7/10 | Supports phased expansion with evidence checkpoints | Wants pilot program evaluation before full national mandate |
| Triple crisis stabilization beds | 8/10 | Supports IMD reform and capital investment | Wants cost-benefit analysis demonstrating net savings |
| Civilian alternative response | 8/10 | Supports based on CAHOOTS/STAR evidence | Insists on rigorous evaluation and safety data |
| Crisis Corps workforce program | 7/10 | Supports with performance metrics | Wants measurable retention and outcome targets |
| 988-911 integration | 8/10 | Strongly supports as common-sense coordination | Practical technology challenge concerns but strongly supports the goal |
| Medicaid crisis coverage reform | 8/10 | Supports | Wants actuarial analysis demonstrating cost neutrality or savings |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 988 Lifeline Sustainability Act | 8/10 | Strong support | Would strengthen evaluation and sunset provisions |
| Crisis Stabilization and Medicaid Reform Act | 8/10 | Strong support | Wants CBO score confirming cost projections |
| Model State 988 Telecom Fee Act | 8/10 | Supports dedicated funding principle | Wants anti-diversion provisions and auditing |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would refine rather than replace the proposed legislation: stronger evaluation requirements; performance-based funding that rewards states meeting targets; bipartisan commission to oversee implementation; phased mandates with evidence checkpoints; public-private partnership models for crisis facility operation.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Conservative (moderate wing)
- **Potential bridges:** All perspectives -- centrists are the natural bridge-builders
- **Unlikely partners:** None absolutely; even Libertarian and Constitutionalist perspectives can find some common ground

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely concerned about suicide prevention and family support; also motivated by desire to maintain faith community role in crisis response |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent -- supports crisis services when framed as pro-life (suicide prevention) but opposes them when framed as secularizing mental health care |
| Goalpost stability | Shifts based on cultural framing -- support for suicide prevention is strong, but support wavers if programs include LGBTQI+-specific services |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate -- willing to support crisis services if faith-based providers are included and secular-only framing is avoided |

**Justification:** The Religious Right has genuine compassion for people in mental health crisis, rooted in theological commitments to protecting life and supporting families. However, their engagement is complicated by cultural concerns about secular counseling replacing pastoral care, LGBTQI+-affirming crisis services, and the medicalization of spiritual problems. Addressing these concerns through faith-community partnerships and provider diversity provisions can increase their support.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- National Association of Evangelicals endorsed 988 and suicide prevention efforts, emphasizing the sanctity of life
- Focus on the Family published resources on faith-based suicide prevention while expressing concern about secular crisis services replacing church-based counseling
- Religious legislators supported the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022) including mental health provisions

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that suicide is a crisis and people need help; attributes some mental health crises to spiritual causes rather than systemic failures |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Attributes crisis demand primarily to cultural and moral decline (family breakdown, secularization, loss of community) rather than structural underfunding or policy failures |

| Model State 988 Telecom Fee Act | 4/10 | Mixed | Supports dedicated funding; opposes fee burden on families |

#### Alternative Proposals

The Religious Right would add: explicit inclusion of faith-based crisis responders and chaplains in mobile teams; funding for church-based crisis response training; religious liberty protections for faith-based crisis facility operators; family-centered crisis intervention models that engage entire family systems; emphasis on pastoral counseling as a complement to clinical crisis care; suicide prevention programs through religious congregations.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Populist (on cultural framing)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on suicide prevention as sanctity-of-life issue), Centrist (on pragmatic inclusion of faith-based providers)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on secular vs. faith framing and LGBTQI+ issues)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuinely committed to universal public mental health services; positions reflect structural critique of market-based health care |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies public goods framework; treats crisis services as a right rather than a benefit |
| Goalpost stability | Stable principles; willing to support incremental legislation while maintaining long-term vision of universal public system |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate -- views market-based solutions and private insurance involvement as inherently inadequate, which limits compromise range |

**Justification:** Democratic socialists bring a coherent framework to crisis services -- mental health care as a public good, funded through progressive taxation, delivered through public institutions, with workers earning dignified wages. This framework is internally consistent and produces predictable positions. The main limitation is that their ideal solution (single-payer mental health coverage) is politically distant, which can create tension with pragmatic coalition partners.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All legislation includes comprehensive mental health and crisis services coverage
- DSA chapters have organized around crisis services as part of "defund the police" and community safety platforms
- Jacobin and Current Affairs have published extensive analyses of crisis services from a socialist perspective

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with characterization of system failures; would emphasize class dimensions (poor and working-class people most affected) more prominently |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agrees with structural analysis; would extend it to identify for-profit health care, commodification of mental health, and capitalist labor conditions as deeper causes |

**Source references:**

- People's Policy Project. "Public Mental Health Services: A Universal Approach." 2023. Argues for fully public crisis services
- DSA Health Justice Commission. "Community Crisis Response: Beyond Reform." 2023. Frames crisis services as part of broader health justice platform

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Permanent 988 funding ($1B/year) | 7/10 | Supports but views as insufficient | Would prefer fully public, non-contracted system rather than grants to nonprofits |
| Universal mobile crisis teams | 9/10 | Strong support for universal coverage | Wants public employment (not contracting) and union representation for workers |
| Triple crisis stabilization beds | 8/10 | Supports public facility expansion | Wants publicly owned and operated facilities, not private or nonprofit contractors |
| Civilian alternative response | 9/10 | Strong support as step toward eliminating police role in crisis | Views as part of broader defund-and-reinvest strategy |
| Crisis Corps workforce program | 8/10 | Supports worker investment | Wants higher pay floors ($65,000 minimum), union rights, and elimination of student debt for all crisis workers |
| 988-911 integration | 7/10 | Supports with strong privacy protections | Cautious about any integration with law enforcement systems |
| Medicaid crisis coverage reform | 7/10 | Supports as interim step | Views Medicaid reform as insufficient; prefers single-payer |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 988 Lifeline Sustainability Act | 7/10 | Supports as incremental step | Would prefer publicly operated crisis system rather than grant-funded nonprofit model |
| Crisis Stabilization and Medicaid Reform Act | 7/10 | Supports Medicaid expansion | Views as inadequate without single-payer; wants public ownership of facilities |
| Model State 988 Telecom Fee Act | 6/10 | Supports dedicated funding | Prefers progressive income tax funding over regressive flat fees |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic socialists would prefer: single-payer mental health coverage eliminating all insurance barriers; publicly employed crisis workers with union representation and minimum $65,000 salary; publicly owned crisis facilities operated by local government; complete elimination of police from mental health crisis response (not co-response); funding through progressive taxation rather than regressive telecom fees; free mental health care at point of service for all residents regardless of immigration status.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Liberal
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on worker pay and anti-corporate framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist (on public ownership and federal role)

### Common Ground Synthesis

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 988 funding sustainability | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, DemSoc, Populist | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Religious Right | Libertarian |
| IMD exclusion reform | Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Centrist, Religious Right, DemSoc | Populist | None |
| Civilian alternative response | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, DemSoc | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right | None |
| Medicaid crisis coverage mandate | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, DemSoc | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right | Libertarian |
| Crisis workforce investment | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, DemSoc, Populist | Conservative, Religious Right | Libertarian, Constitutionalist |

**Key insight:** IMD exclusion reform commands the broadest support across ideological lines because it is framed as deregulation (appealing to the right) and capacity expansion (appealing to the left). Civilian alternative response also has surprisingly broad support, including from Libertarians who view it as reducing state coercion. The most divisive reforms are mandatory federal spending programs (988 permanent funding, Crisis Corps) and Medicaid mandates, which split along traditional government-size fault lines.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: IMD Reform + Crisis Stabilization Investment

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian + Constitutionalist + Progressive

**Core Agreement:** All perspectives agree that the Medicaid IMD exclusion is a counterproductive 60-year-old regulation that prevents communities from building crisis stabilization capacity. Removing this barrier requires no new taxes or mandates.

**Policy Description:**

Standalone legislation repealing the IMD exclusion for crisis stabilization facilities (stays under 72 hours) with $3 billion in voluntary capital grants for states that choose to build crisis stabilization facilities. No federal performance mandates or coverage requirements.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Deregulation; voluntary state participation; no mandates |
| Liberal | Expands crisis capacity; creates framework for further reform |
| Libertarian | Pure deregulation; removes government barrier to private and nonprofit crisis facilities |
| Constitutionalist | Removes federal constraint on state health policy; voluntary grants respect federalism |
| Centrist | Evidence-based reform with demonstrable cost savings ($2,264/episode saved) |
| Progressive | Increases bed capacity; foundation for broader reform |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepting $3B in federal capital grants (new spending) |
| Liberal | No mandatory coverage; no performance standards; incremental rather than comprehensive |
| Progressive | No mandates on police reform or universal coverage; deregulation framing |
| Libertarian | Accepting federal grants (though voluntary) |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives (all except Populist and Religious Right, who are neutral rather than opposed)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Strong -- deregulation + investment is a stable political formula
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone bill through Senate Finance and House Energy and Commerce; bipartisan co-sponsors from both parties

---

### Compromise 2: 988 Sustainability Through State Telecom Fees with Federal Technical Assistance

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Constitutionalist

**Core Agreement:** All perspectives agree that 988 needs sustainable funding, but disagree on whether the source should be federal appropriations or state revenue. A state-led telecom fee approach with federal technical assistance and optional matching satisfies both limited-government and adequate-funding concerns.

**Policy Description:**

Federal legislation authorizing (not mandating) state 988 telecom fees, providing model legislation and technical assistance, and offering 50% federal matching for states that enact fees. No federal mandate; no new federal tax. States choose whether and how much to charge.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | No federal mandate or tax; state-led; performance-based matching rewards responsible states |
| Liberal | Creates sustainable funding mechanism; federal matching incentivizes adoption |
| Constitutionalist | State sovereignty respected; federal role limited to enabling and matching |
| Centrist | Evidence-based approach; anti-diversion provisions; state accountability |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepting federal matching funds (new federal spending, though contingent) |
| Liberal | No mandatory national funding level; uneven state adoption will create coverage gaps |
| Constitutionalist | Federal matching creates incentive structure that may indirectly pressure states |
| Progressive | Insufficient funding; regressive fee structure; no guarantee of universal coverage |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (Conservative, Liberal, Centrist, Constitutionalist, Religious Right as soft support)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Moderate -- dependent on enough states adopting fees; coverage gaps will persist in non-adopting states
- **Implementation Path:** Bipartisan bill with state flexibility emphasis; model after E-911 fee framework

---

### Compromise 3: Evidence-Based Civilian Crisis Response Expansion

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Libertarian + Centrist + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** An unusual coalition agrees that sending armed police officers as the default response to mental health crises produces bad outcomes. Civilian crisis response programs like CAHOOTS have over 35 years of evidence demonstrating safety and effectiveness. Federal funding for voluntary local adoption with rigorous evaluation can expand these programs without mandating police reform.

**Policy Description:**

Federal grants for 200 cities to establish civilian alternative response programs over 5 years, with standardized data collection and evaluation. Programs are voluntary and locally designed. No mandate to remove police from crisis calls; rather, creates an additional option for 911 dispatchers. Requires independent evaluation at Year 3 and Year 5.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Expands health-first response; addresses racial disparities in police crisis encounters |
| Progressive | Moves toward civilian-led crisis response; federal investment in alternatives to policing |
| Libertarian | Reduces armed government coercion; voluntary local programs respect individual liberty |
| Centrist | Evidence-based program design; rigorous evaluation; phased expansion |
| Democratic Socialist | Federal investment in community safety; public employment for crisis workers |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Progressive | No mandate to remove police; voluntary adoption allows holdout cities |
| Libertarian | Accepting federal grant program (new government spending) |
| Liberal | No requirement for racial equity metrics in program design (though encouraged) |
| Democratic Socialist | Programs may be operated by nonprofits rather than public agencies |
| Conservative | Concern about weakening law enforcement mitigated by voluntary, additive design |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives actively supporting; 2/9 neutral (Conservative, Religious Right)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 active coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Strong -- evidence base is robust and growing; local implementation reduces ideological resistance
- **Implementation Path:** Grants through SAMHSA and DOJ; bipartisan support leveraging CAHOOTS model's 35-year track record

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable legislative coalition centers on **Liberal + Centrist + Conservative (moderate wing)** support, with **Progressive** and **Democratic Socialist** votes providing additional margin. This coalition can pass all three compromise proposals if legislation is designed with state flexibility (satisfying Conservatives and Constitutionalists), evidence-based evaluation (satisfying Centrists), and adequate funding (satisfying Liberals and Progressives). The 988 Lifeline's bipartisan origin (unanimous Senate passage in 2020) demonstrates that this coalition is achievable.

### Key Obstacles

The primary obstacles to legislative action are: (1) fiscal hawks who oppose any new spending, regardless of cost-effectiveness evidence; (2) law enforcement unions that frame civilian alternatives as threats to officer safety and jobs; (3) insurance industry resistance to new coverage mandates; and (4) the fragmented committee jurisdiction in Congress (crisis services touch Health, Finance, Commerce, Judiciary, and Appropriations committees). These obstacles are manageable but require strategic sequencing -- starting with IMD reform (broadest support, deregulation framing) and civilian response grants (strong evidence base) before advancing the more contested mandatory funding and coverage provisions.

### Low Consistency Partners

The **Populist** perspective (2/5 consistency) requires careful framing management rather than policy concessions. Populist support is activated by personal stories (families who lost loved ones to suicide or police encounters), veteran-focused messaging, and anti-corporate framing (insurance companies profiting while people die). Populist support evaporates when reform is framed as government expansion, "defunding police," or cultural progressivism. Managing the public narrative is more important than legislative design for maintaining populist engagement.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with IMD exclusion reform** as standalone legislation with the broadest possible coalition (Compromise 1). This establishes momentum, creates bipartisan trust, and begins expanding crisis stabilization capacity
2. **Simultaneously advance state telecom fee adoption** through model legislation and federal technical assistance (Compromise 2), building a sustainable state-level funding base
3. **Expand civilian alternative response** through evidence-based federal grants (Compromise 3), leveraging the growing evidence base and unusual libertarian-progressive alignment
4. **Build toward comprehensive legislation** (988 Sustainability Act and Medicaid Reform Act) once the foundation is established and cost-savings data from early reforms strengthens the fiscal case
5. **Maintain bipartisan framing** throughout: crisis services as public safety, suicide prevention, and cost-effective investment -- not as partisan social policy
