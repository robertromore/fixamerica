# Serious Mental Illness: History

## Historical Development

The treatment of serious mental illness in the United States has undergone dramatic transformations, shaped by scientific discovery, moral reform movements, economic pressures, civil rights advocacy, and political ideology. Understanding this history is essential for grasping why the current system is so deeply fragmented and why millions of Americans with SMI remain untreated, incarcerated, or homeless.

### The Institutional Era (1773-1945): Asylums, Reform, and Decline

- **Colonial Period**: People with serious mental illness were confined in almshouses, jails, or kept at home by families. The first public psychiatric hospital in America opened in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1773.
- **Dorothea Dix's Campaign (1840s-1880s)**: Dorothea Dix documented appalling conditions in jails and poorhouses where people with mental illness were chained and abused. Her advocacy led to the creation of 32 state-funded psychiatric hospitals between 1843 and 1880.
- **The Kirkbride Plan**: Architect Thomas Kirkbride designed hospitals intended to be therapeutic environments with natural light, fresh air, and organized daily routines. Many were built across the country in the mid-19th century.
- **Overcrowding and Deterioration (1880s-1945)**: State hospitals quickly became overcrowded. By 1900, there were over 150,000 people in state institutions. Funding failed to keep pace with population growth, and hospitals deteriorated into custodial warehouses. Abuses included forced sterilization (32 states enacted eugenics laws), lobotomies (performed on an estimated 40,000-50,000 Americans between 1936 and 1967), and physical restraints.
- **Peak Institutionalization**: State psychiatric hospital populations peaked at 559,000 in 1955, representing approximately 339 beds per 100,000 population.

### The Deinstitutionalization Era (1945-1980): Promise and Betrayal

- **Post-War Exposés**: Journalists and conscientious objectors who had served as attendants during World War II published exposés of horrific asylum conditions, including Albert Deutsch's *The Shame of the States* (1948) and Life magazine's photo essay "Bedlam 1946."
- **Chlorpromazine (1954)**: The introduction of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) in 1954 -- the first effective antipsychotic medication -- made it conceivable for many people with schizophrenia to live outside hospitals. This was a genuine pharmacological breakthrough, but it was quickly co-opted as justification for closing hospitals before community alternatives existed.
- **Community Mental Health Act (1963)**: President Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act, envisioning 1,500 federally funded community mental health centers to replace state hospitals. Kennedy's personal connection to the issue -- his sister Rosemary had been lobotomized -- lent moral urgency to the initiative. However, only 789 centers were ever built, and most did not serve people with the most severe conditions.
- **Medicaid and the IMD Exclusion (1965)**: The creation of Medicaid included the Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion, which barred federal Medicaid payment for care in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds. This was intended to prevent states from shifting costs to the federal government, but it created a lasting disincentive against inpatient psychiatric capacity.
- **The Great Emptying**: Between 1955 and 1980, state hospital populations fell from 559,000 to approximately 130,000. Patients were discharged into communities that lacked housing, treatment, and support services. Many ended up homeless or in nursing homes that served as de facto warehouses.

### The Legal Rights Revolution (1970-1990): Liberty Without Services

- **O'Connor v. Donaldson (1975)**: The Supreme Court ruled that a state cannot constitutionally confine a non-dangerous person with mental illness who is capable of surviving safely in freedom. This landmark case established that mental illness alone does not justify involuntary confinement, but it said nothing about the obligation to provide treatment in the community.
- **Least Restrictive Alternative Doctrine**: Courts across the country adopted the principle that people with mental illness must be treated in the least restrictive setting appropriate to their needs, further accelerating discharge from hospitals.
- **Addington v. Texas (1979)**: The Supreme Court required "clear and convincing evidence" (not merely a preponderance) for civil commitment, raising the evidentiary standard for involuntary hospitalization.
- **Narrowing of Commitment Standards**: States rewrote civil commitment laws to require proof of imminent danger to self or others, effectively making it impossible to hospitalize someone who was deteriorating but had not yet reached crisis. By the mid-1980s, the standard in most states was "imminent dangerousness."
- **Olmstead v. L.C. (1999)**: The Supreme Court ruled that unjustified institutionalization is discrimination under the ADA, requiring states to provide community-based services when appropriate. While a victory for community integration, Olmstead was often used to justify further hospital closures without commensurate community investment.

### The Criminalization Era (1980-2010): From Hospital to Jail

- **Homelessness Crisis (1980s)**: The combination of hospital closures, failure to build community mental health infrastructure, loss of low-cost housing, and the Reagan-era cuts to federal mental health funding (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 replaced categorical mental health funding with block grants at 25% lower funding levels) produced a visible homelessness crisis. By 1990, an estimated 200,000 people with SMI were homeless.
- **Penrose's Law in Action**: British psychiatrist Lionel Penrose observed in 1939 that there is an inverse relationship between psychiatric hospital beds and prison populations. This pattern played out in the United States: as hospital beds decreased, the incarceration of people with mental illness increased dramatically. By 2000, there were approximately 10 times more people with SMI in jails and prisons than in state psychiatric hospitals.
- **War on Drugs Impact**: The War on Drugs disproportionately swept people with co-occurring SMI and substance use disorders into the criminal justice system, where they received little or no psychiatric treatment.
- **Kendra's Law (New York, 1999)**: Following the death of Kendra Webdale, pushed in front of a New York City subway by a man with untreated schizophrenia, New York enacted the first comprehensive assisted outpatient treatment (AOT) law. It allowed courts to order outpatient treatment for people with SMI who met specific criteria, including a history of hospitalization or violent behavior.
- **Laura's Law (California, 2002)**: California enacted its own AOT law following the murder of Laura Wilcox by a man with untreated SMI. Implementation was left to individual counties, and uptake was slow.

### The Modern Reform Era (2010-Present): Incremental Progress

- **Affordable Care Act (2010)**: The ACA designated mental health and substance use disorder services as essential health benefits, expanded Medicaid coverage (in states that opted in), and strengthened parity protections. However, the impact on SMI was limited because many people with the most severe conditions were already covered by Medicaid or Medicare.
- **21st Century Cures Act (2016)**: Created the position of Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, authorized the creation of an Interdepartmental Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee (ISMICC), and provided new grant programs. It represented the first federal legislation to specifically prioritize SMI as distinct from broader mental health concerns.
- **988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (2022)**: The transition from the 10-digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to the 3-digit 988 number represented a fundamental shift in crisis infrastructure, modeled on 911. In its first full year, 988 handled 5.5 million contacts.
- **Bipartisan Safer Communities Act (2022)**: Following the Uvalde school shooting, Congress passed the most significant mental health legislation in years, including expanded CCBHC funding, school-based mental health, and pediatric mental health access.
- **MHPAEA Final Rule (2024)**: The Departments of Labor, HHS, and Treasury issued a final rule strengthening mental health parity enforcement, requiring insurers to conduct and disclose comparative analyses of non-quantitative treatment limitations.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Promises Without Funding

The most consistent pattern in SMI history is the gap between legislative promise and actual implementation. The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 promised 1,500 centers; only 789 were built. The 21st Century Cures Act authorized new programs but left funding to annual appropriations. The 988 system launched with inadequate call center capacity. Repeatedly, the political system generates ambitious legislation but fails to sustain the funding necessary to deliver on commitments. Any new reform effort must include mandatory, sustained funding mechanisms rather than discretionary appropriations.

### Pattern 2: Shifting the Burden Without Solving the Problem

Deinstitutionalization did not eliminate the need for intensive care; it merely shifted where that care (or non-care) occurred. State hospitals gave way to jails, emergency rooms, homeless shelters, and family homes. Each shift was framed as progress -- from "asylum reform" to "least restrictive environment" to "community integration" -- but without adequate services, each was merely a transfer of responsibility from one inadequate setting to another. Meaningful reform must ensure that closing one door opens another, with verified capacity before transitions occur.

### Pattern 3: Rights Without Resources

The legal rights revolution of the 1970s was essential in ending genuine abuses, but "liberty" without treatment services is not freedom -- it is abandonment. The narrow focus on preventing involuntary confinement, without equal attention to ensuring access to voluntary and court-ordered outpatient treatment, left millions of people with SMI with the right to refuse treatment but no real access to it. Future policy must pair civil liberties protections with affirmative obligations to provide treatment.

### Pattern 4: Crisis-Driven Legislation

Major SMI legislation has almost always been triggered by high-profile tragedies -- Kendra's Law after a subway pushing, Laura's Law after a shooting, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act after Uvalde. While these events create political windows, they also skew policy toward violence prevention rather than the far more common outcomes of untreated SMI: homelessness, premature death, and quiet suffering. Sustained advocacy outside of crisis moments is essential.
