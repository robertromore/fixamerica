# Serious Mental Illness: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to serious mental illness reform requires a combination of federal structural legislation, state-level implementation, and regulatory action. The primary federal targets are: (1) making Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics a permanent Medicaid benefit, (2) reforming the Medicaid IMD exclusion to allow payment for acute psychiatric inpatient care, (3) creating federal incentives for robust Assisted Outpatient Treatment programs, and (4) expanding early intervention for first-episode psychosis. These legislative changes are complemented by regulatory reforms at the FDA (clozapine REMS) and CMS (LAI access, tenancy support services) that can proceed under existing authority.

The legislative strategy is incremental by design. Constitutional authority for most provisions rests on the Spending Clause (Article I, Section 8) through Medicaid and block grant conditions. No constitutional amendments are required. The approach builds on existing bipartisan precedents -- the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022, the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016, and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 -- while addressing the structural gaps those laws left unresolved.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for the proposed reforms. Federal authority to fund, incentivize, and condition mental health programs derives from the Spending Clause and the Commerce Clause. State authority over civil commitment, involuntary treatment, and police power is preserved. The proposed federal legislation creates incentive structures and funding conditions rather than direct mandates, consistent with the framework upheld in* South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).*

## Federal Legislation

### The Comprehensive Community Behavioral Health Act

**Purpose**: Establish Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) as a permanent Medicaid benefit available in all states, replacing the current grant-based demonstration model with sustained funding at enhanced federal matching rates.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Creates a mandatory Medicaid CCBHC benefit with a Prospective Payment System (PPS) ensuring cost-based reimbursement
2. Provides 90% federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for the first 5 years, declining to the standard state FMAP thereafter
3. Requires states to convert existing community mental health centers to CCBHC standards within 5 years
4. Mandates 24/7 crisis services, clozapine prescribing capability, and first-episode psychosis programs at every CCBHC

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to establish certified
community behavioral health clinics as a permanent Medicaid benefit,
and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Comprehensive Community Behavioral
Health Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to SAMHSA's 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and
Health, 14.1 million adults in the United States (5.5% of the adult
population) live with serious mental illness, and 34.6% of those
adults received no mental health treatment.

(2) People with serious mental illness die 10 to 25 years earlier
than the general population, primarily from preventable medical
conditions (NASMHPD, 2023).

(3) Approximately 383,000 people with serious mental illness are
confined in jails on any given day, constituting the de facto
largest mental health system in the nation (Treatment Advocacy
Center, 2022).

(4) CCBHC demonstration sites have shown a 60% reduction in
emergency department visits, 41% reduction in jail bookings, and
62% reduction in homelessness among clients (National Council for
Mental Wellbeing, 2023).

(5) The existing grant-based CCBHC model reaches only
approximately 540 sites in 10 states with full certification,
leaving the majority of communities without access to
comprehensive behavioral health care.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) CERTIFIED COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CLINIC.--The term
"certified community behavioral health clinic" or "CCBHC" means
an entity that--
    (A) provides a comprehensive range of behavioral health

    residency, or insurance status;
    (C) meets staffing, quality, and reporting standards
    established by the Secretary; and
    (D) has been certified by the State in which it operates.

(2) PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM.--The term "prospective payment
system" means a reimbursement methodology that provides per-client
per-month payments based on the expected cost of providing the
full scope of CCBHC services.

(3) SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.--The term "serious mental illness"
has the meaning given in section 1912(c) of the Public Health
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300x-1(c)).

    services shall be 90%.
    (2) Beginning in the 6th fiscal year, the Federal
    medical assistance percentage shall be the State's
    standard FMAP as determined under section 1905(b).

(d) STATE REQUIREMENTS.--
    (1) TRANSITION.--Each State shall certify a sufficient
    number of CCBHCs to ensure access to comprehensive
    behavioral health services in all geographic regions
    of the State, and shall convert existing community
    mental health centers to CCBHC standards within 5
    years of enactment.

year beginning after the date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual predicate for legislation by citing specific, current data on the scope of the SMI crisis and the demonstrated effectiveness of the CCBHC model.
- **Section 4 (Permanent Benefit)**: The core provision -- making CCBHCs a Medicaid benefit rather than a grant program ensures sustained funding and obligates states to participate. The 90% FMAP for 5 years mirrors the ACA Medicaid expansion structure, minimizing state fiscal objections.
- **Section 4(b)(10) (Clozapine)**: Requires every CCBHC to have clozapine prescribing capability, directly addressing the current ~4% utilization rate by embedding infrastructure in every community.
- **Section 5 (Workforce)**: Without workforce investment, expanded capacity is impossible. Loan repayment and training grants are essential complements to service expansion.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| CMS publishes proposed CCBHC certification standards | 12 months after enactment | CMS |
| Public comment period closes | 15 months after enactment | CMS / Public |
| Final rules published | 18 months after enactment | CMS |
| States begin CCBHC certification process | 24 months after enactment | State Medicaid agencies |
| All states certifying CCBHCs | 36 months after enactment | State Medicaid agencies |
| Full state conversion of community mental health centers | 60 months after enactment | States |

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS administers the Medicaid benefit; SAMHSA provides technical assistance and manages workforce grants. HHS establishes certification standards.

**Challenges**:

- **State fiscal concerns**: Even at 90% FMAP, states must contribute 10% initially and their full match after 5 years. Low-spending states may resist.
- **Workforce availability**: Expanding CCBHC infrastructure ahead of workforce capacity risks creating unfilled positions.
- **PPS rate adequacy**: Prospective payment rates must be set high enough to cover actual costs; past Medicaid rate-setting has often been inadequate.

**Refinements**:

- **Graduated state match**: Allow states below the median per-capita spending to receive 95% FMAP for the first 5 years.
- **Workforce bridge**: Permit telehealth delivery of certain CCBHC services to address rural workforce gaps during the transition period.

### The Serious Mental Illness Treatment Access Act

**Purpose**: Reform the Medicaid Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion to allow federal Medicaid payment for acute inpatient psychiatric care in facilities with more than 16 beds, subject to time limits and community investment conditions.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Permits Medicaid coverage for inpatient psychiatric stays of up to 60 days in IMD facilities
2. Conditions IMD waiver on concurrent state investment in community-based services
3. Requires discharge planning beginning at admission
4. Mandates annual outcome reporting disaggregated by race and ethnicity

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to reform the
institution for mental diseases exclusion for serious mental
illness treatment, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Serious Mental Illness Treatment
Access Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The Medicaid IMD exclusion, codified at 42 U.S.C. Section
1396d(a)(B), prohibits federal Medicaid reimbursement for
inpatient psychiatric care in facilities with more than 16 beds
for adults ages 21-64.

(2) This exclusion costs states an estimated $4-6 billion annually
in forgone federal Medicaid matching funds, contributing directly
to psychiatric bed shortages (Kennedy Forum, 2023).

(3) The United States currently has approximately 11.7 state
psychiatric beds per 100,000 population, well below the 40-60 per
100,000 recommended by the Treatment Advocacy Center.

(4) CMS has already approved IMD exclusion waivers for substance
use disorder treatment in over 40 states under Section 1115
demonstration authority, establishing precedent for SMI reform.

(5) People with SMI are currently institutionalized in jails
(383,000 on any given day) rather than in psychiatric facilities
designed to treat them.

SEC. 3. REFORM OF IMD EXCLUSION FOR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act is
amended by adding at the end:

"Notwithstanding subparagraph (B) of the preceding sentence,
medical assistance shall be available for inpatient psychiatric
services provided to an individual between the ages of 21 and
64 in an institution for mental diseases, subject to the
following conditions:

    (1) DURATION LIMIT.--Payment is limited to a maximum of
    60 days per admission per 12-month period.

    (2) COMMUNITY INVESTMENT REQUIREMENT.--The State shall
    demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that for
    each fiscal year in which it claims IMD reimbursement, it
    has maintained or increased expenditures on community-based
    mental health services, including outpatient treatment,
    supported housing, and crisis services, at a level not less
    than 105% of the prior fiscal year's expenditures.

    (3) DISCHARGE PLANNING.--The facility shall initiate
    discharge planning within 72 hours of admission, including
    identification of community providers, housing resources,
    and medication management plans.

    (4) QUALITY STANDARDS.--The facility shall meet quality
    standards established by the Secretary, including minimum
    staffing ratios, patient rights protections, and outcome
    reporting requirements.

    (5) OUTCOME REPORTING.--The State shall submit annual
    reports to the Secretary including readmission rates,
    community tenure after discharge, arrest rates,
    homelessness rates, and mortality data, disaggregated
    by race, ethnicity, gender, and diagnosis."

SEC. 4. REPORTING AND EVALUATION.

(a) The Secretary shall submit to Congress an annual report on
the implementation of this section, including State-level
outcomes and a cost-benefit analysis.

(b) The Government Accountability Office shall conduct an
independent evaluation of the effects of IMD exclusion reform
5 years after enactment.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1 of the first fiscal year
beginning after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3(a)(1) (Duration Limit)**: The 60-day limit prevents re-institutionalization while allowing adequate stabilization. Average state hospital stays are currently 86 days; the limit encourages efficient treatment and discharge planning.
- **Section 3(a)(2) (Community Investment)**: The 105% maintenance-of-effort requirement prevents states from diverting community funding to inpatient settings, addressing the central concern of community integration advocates.
- **Section 3(a)(5) (Racial Equity Reporting)**: Mandatory disaggregated data collection addresses legitimate concerns about racial disparities in involuntary treatment.

**Challenges**:

- **Olmstead concerns**: Community integration advocates will argue this incentivizes institutionalization. The community investment condition is designed to address this, but litigation under *Olmstead v. L.C.* is possible.
- **Cost**: Estimated $4-6 billion in additional annual federal Medicaid spending, though offset by reductions in state-only hospital costs, jail costs, and ED boarding.

**Refinements**:

- **Tiered implementation**: Allow states to phase in IMD reform over 3 years, with CMS providing technical assistance on community investment requirements.
- **Enhanced oversight**: Require CMS site visits to IMD facilities receiving Medicaid payment at least annually.

## State Model Legislation

### Model Assisted Outpatient Treatment Implementation Act

**Purpose**: Provide a template for states to enact or strengthen assisted outpatient treatment laws with robust service mandates, due process protections, and racial equity monitoring.

**Adaptability Notes**: 47 states plus D.C. already have some form of AOT law. This model is designed for the 3 states without AOT (Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts) and as a strengthening template for states with existing but underfunded laws. States should customize eligibility criteria, court procedures, and service mandates to align with existing state mental health and judicial infrastructure.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Assisted
Outpatient Treatment Implementation Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.--The Legislature finds that:
    (1) A significant number of individuals with serious mental
    illness lack awareness of their illness (anosognosia), which
    prevents them from voluntarily seeking treatment.
    (2) Without treatment, these individuals are at elevated risk
    of homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and premature
    death.
    (3) Assisted outpatient treatment has demonstrated reductions
    of 77% in hospitalization, 83% in arrest, and 74% in
    homelessness among participants (NYS OMH, 2023).

(b) PURPOSE.--To establish a framework for court-ordered
outpatient treatment that ensures both treatment access and
individual rights.

SECTION 3. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.

An individual is eligible for assisted outpatient treatment if
a court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that:
    (a) The individual is 18 years of age or older;
    (b) The individual has a serious mental illness;
    (c) The individual is unlikely to survive safely in the
    community without supervision;
    (d) The individual has a history of non-adherence to
    treatment that has resulted, within the preceding 48
    months, in at least two hospitalizations, incarceration,
    or acts of serious violence; and
    (e) The individual is likely to benefit from assisted
    outpatient treatment.

SECTION 4. DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS.

    (a) RIGHT TO COUNSEL.--The individual shall have the right
    to legal counsel at all proceedings. If the individual cannot
    afford counsel, the court shall appoint counsel at public
    expense.
    (b) JUDICIAL HEARING.--No order for assisted outpatient
    treatment shall be issued without a hearing before a judge
    at which the individual has the right to present evidence,
    cross-examine witnesses, and be present.
    (c) DURATION AND REVIEW.--Initial orders shall not exceed
    6 months. Renewal requires a new hearing with the same
    evidentiary standard.
    (d) RIGHT TO APPEAL.--The individual may appeal any order
    to the appropriate appellate court.

SECTION 5. SERVICE MANDATE.

    (a) ENTITLEMENT TO SERVICES.--An order for assisted
    outpatient treatment shall create an entitlement to the
    services specified in the treatment plan. The designated
    mental health authority shall ensure that all ordered
    services are available and accessible within 72 hours of
    the court order.
    (b) REQUIRED SERVICES.--Treatment plans may include
    medication management, case management, therapy,
    substance use treatment, supported housing, and
    supported employment.

SECTION 6. RACIAL EQUITY MONITORING.

    (a) DATA COLLECTION.--The State mental health authority
    shall collect data on all AOT orders disaggregated by
    race, ethnicity, gender, age, and geographic region.
    (b) ANNUAL REPORT.--Not later than 1 year after
    enactment, and annually thereafter, the State shall
    publish a report analyzing whether AOT is applied
    equitably across demographic groups.
    (c) CORRECTIVE ACTION.--If disparities exceeding 20%
    relative to population representation are identified,
    the State shall implement corrective measures including
    implicit bias training, community advisory input, and
    judicial education.

SECTION 7. APPROPRIATIONS.

There is appropriated from the general fund $[amount] for
each fiscal year to fund services required under Section 5,
including case management, medication, housing support, and
program administration.
```

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Health and Human Services, operating through CMS (Medicaid provisions), SAMHSA (block grants, workforce, and technical assistance), and FDA (clozapine REMS reform).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **CCBHC Certification Standards**: CMS must publish regulations defining CCBHC certification criteria, PPS rate-setting methodology, and state reporting requirements. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment of the Comprehensive Community Behavioral Health Act.
2. **IMD Exclusion Implementation Rules**: CMS must publish regulations implementing the 60-day stay limit, community investment conditions, and quality standards for facilities receiving IMD Medicaid reimbursement.
3. **Clozapine REMS Revision**: FDA must revise the Clozapine REMS Program to allow bimonthly ANC monitoring after 12 months of stable therapy, reducing the monitoring burden that contributes to underutilization.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: States that claim enhanced CCBHC FMAP without meeting certification standards face recoupment of excess federal payments.
- **Administrative Actions**: CMS may reduce or suspend enhanced matching rates for states that fail to meet community investment conditions under IMD reform.
- **Private Right of Action**: Individuals denied CCBHC services may bring suit under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 for Medicaid benefit denial.
- **Whistleblower Protections**: Employees of CCBHCs or IMD facilities who report quality violations are protected under existing HHS whistleblower provisions.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: All proposed federal legislation operates through Medicaid conditions and block grant incentives, firmly within Congress's Spending Clause authority. Under *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), Congress may condition federal funds on state compliance with program requirements, provided conditions are (1) related to the federal interest, (2) unambiguous, (3) not coercive, and (4) not requiring unconstitutional action. The proposed conditions (CCBHC standards, community investment requirements, reporting) satisfy all four prongs.

**Due Process**: AOT legislation implicates the Fourteenth Amendment's due process protections. The model state legislation addresses this by requiring clear and convincing evidence, judicial hearings, right to counsel, limited duration, and appeal rights -- consistent with the framework established in *Addington v. Texas*, 441 U.S. 418 (1979).

**Olmstead Compliance**: IMD exclusion reform must be designed to comply with *Olmstead v. L.C.*, 527 U.S. 581 (1999), which requires states to provide community-based services when appropriate. The community investment condition (105% maintenance-of-effort) and 60-day stay limit are designed to ensure that expanded inpatient capacity supplements rather than replaces community services.

### Preemption

Federal CCBHC standards and IMD exclusion reform operate as conditions on federal Medicaid funds, not as direct preemption of state law. States retain authority over civil commitment standards, AOT eligibility criteria, and mental health system governance. The AOT model legislation is offered as a template, not a federal mandate; states may adopt, modify, or decline it. Express savings clauses should be included to preserve state regulatory authority over licensure, staffing, and facility standards.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through (1) CMS monitoring of state Medicaid claims and certification data, (2) SAMHSA oversight of block grant performance measures, (3) annual Congressional reporting requirements, and (4) GAO independent evaluations at Year 5 and Year 10. States that repeatedly fail to meet performance benchmarks face graduated sanctions from technical assistance to reduced federal matching rates.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| CCBHC certification without service delivery | States certify clinics that meet structural requirements but do not actually deliver the full scope of required services, particularly clozapine and crisis services | High | Add outcome-based performance measures to certification; require CMS site audits of a random sample of 20% of CCBHCs annually |
| IMD 60-day limit circumvention | Facilities discharge patients on day 59 and readmit on day 61 to restart the clock | High | Count cumulative IMD days per 12-month period across all facilities; cap at 120 total days per year |
| Community investment maintenance-of-effort gaming | States count inflation-adjusted spending increases as "new investment" without actually expanding services | Medium | Define community investment in terms of per-capita service utilization and access metrics, not raw dollar amounts |
| AOT orders without services | Courts issue AOT orders but treatment services are unavailable or inadequately funded, making orders meaningless | High | Require states to certify service availability within 72 hours of order; create federal incentive funding contingent on service delivery, not just order issuance |
| Workforce grant diversion | CCBHC workforce grants used for administrative overhead rather than direct hiring and training | Medium | Cap administrative costs at 15% of grant funds; require quarterly reporting on positions filled and retention rates |
| PPS rate suppression | States set CCBHC prospective payment rates too low to cover actual costs, undermining the model | High | Require CMS to establish a federal floor for PPS rates based on national cost data; allow CCBHCs to appeal rate determinations |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Three states lack AOT laws | Approximately 2 million residents in CT, MD, and MA have no access to court-ordered outpatient treatment | State legislative opposition from civil liberties organizations | Federal incentive legislation conditioning a portion of Mental Health Block Grant on AOT implementation |
| Workforce shortage limits expansion speed | Even with full funding, workforce constraints limit how quickly new CCBHCs, crisis teams, and CSC programs can be staffed | Decades of underinvestment in psychiatric training pipeline | Multi-year workforce ramp-up with telehealth bridge; scope-of-practice expansion for NPs and PAs |
| Rural access gap | Rural communities with low population density may not support a full CCBHC | Fixed costs of comprehensive behavioral health clinics exceed what small populations generate in PPS revenue | Allow hub-and-spoke CCBHC models where a central CCBHC provides telepsychiatry and mobile services to rural satellite locations |
| Housing construction timelines | New permanent supportive housing units take 3-5 years from funding to occupancy | Land acquisition, zoning, construction, and permitting processes | Fund scattered-site and master-lease models alongside new construction; streamline environmental review for PSH projects |
| Clozapine uptake remains clinician-dependent | Even with REMS reform and support centers, individual prescriber reluctance may persist | Deep-rooted clinical culture of clozapine avoidance | Require clozapine prescribing training in all psychiatry residency programs; include clozapine metrics in CCBHC performance measures |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **CCBHC performance-based certification**: Amend CCBHC standards to include outcome-based metrics (ED visits, jail bookings, housing stability, clozapine utilization) alongside structural certification. Clinics failing to meet outcome benchmarks after 3 years enter corrective action.
2. **IMD cumulative day cap**: Amend the IMD reform provision to count total days across all IMD admissions per 12-month period (cap: 120 days), preventing discharge-and-readmit cycling.
3. **Community investment indexing**: Define maintenance-of-effort in terms of per-capita community service utilization rates (e.g., community mental health center visits per 1,000 population) rather than nominal spending, preventing states from claiming inflation as investment.
4. **AOT service guarantee fund**: Create a federal contingency fund (administered by SAMHSA) that states can draw on when court-ordered AOT services exceed state budget capacity, ensuring that orders are never unfunded.
5. **PPS rate floor**: Establish a federal minimum PPS rate (indexed to national CCBHC cost data) to prevent states from setting rates that undermine the model's financial viability.
6. **Residency mandate**: Require all ACGME-accredited psychiatry residency programs to include clinical rotations in community mental health settings and clozapine management training as a condition of accreditation.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The enhanced 90% FMAP for CCBHCs sunsets after 5 years, reverting to the standard state match. Congress must affirmatively extend enhanced rates.
- IMD exclusion reform includes a 10-year sunset requiring Congressional reauthorization based on GAO evaluation findings.
- AOT incentive funding is authorized for 5-year periods, requiring reauthorization.
- All federal programs include mandatory 5-year and 10-year evaluations by GAO with public reporting and Congressional testimony.
