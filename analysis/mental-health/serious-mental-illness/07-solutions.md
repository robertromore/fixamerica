# Serious Mental Illness: Solutions

Addressing the crisis in serious mental illness requires a multi-faceted approach that simultaneously expands treatment access, improves treatment quality, builds housing infrastructure, diverts people from the criminal justice system, supports families, and grows the workforce. No single intervention is sufficient; the solutions must work together as a system.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Treatment should be available before crisis, not only after crisis
- Evidence-based practices should be the default, not the exception
- Housing is healthcare -- stable housing is a prerequisite for recovery
- People with anosognosia need pathways to treatment that account for their inability to recognize their illness
- Racial equity must be embedded in every reform, not treated as an afterthought
- Family caregivers are partners in treatment, not obstacles to autonomy

### Theory of Change

The current SMI system fails because it is fragmented, underfunded, and designed around voluntary engagement in a population where 40-50% cannot voluntarily engage due to anosognosia. Reform must simultaneously (1) expand the supply of treatment services and housing, (2) create pathways for people who cannot engage voluntarily, (3) ensure that treatment is evidence-based and culturally responsive, and (4) shift funding from crisis response (jails, emergency rooms) to sustained treatment and recovery support. As treatment capacity increases and outcomes improve, public support for investment will grow, creating a virtuous cycle.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: National Expansion of Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs)

**Description**: CCBHCs are a comprehensive community-based care model that provides all behavioral health services regardless of ability to pay, including 24/7 crisis services, outpatient treatment, substance use treatment, primary care screening, and care coordination. Currently operating in approximately 540 sites across 10 states with full certification, CCBHCs should be expanded to all 50 states with full federal funding. The model uses a Prospective Payment System (PPS) that ensures clinics receive adequate reimbursement for the actual cost of care, unlike the underfunded fee-for-service model that community mental health centers currently rely on.

**Evidence Base**: CCBHC demonstration sites showed a 60% reduction in emergency department visits, 41% reduction in jail bookings, and 62% reduction in homelessness among clients (National Council for Mental Wellbeing, 2023). The PPS reimbursement model increased provider salaries by an average of 15%, improving recruitment and retention. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022 provided $430 million in expansion grants, demonstrating Congressional support.

**Implementation**: Amend the Medicaid statute to create a permanent CCBHC benefit available in all states. Provide federal matching funds at enhanced rates (90% FMAP) for the first 5 years, declining to the standard FMAP thereafter. Require states to convert existing community mental health centers to CCBHC standards within 5 years.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $4-6 billion in additional annual federal Medicaid spending, partially offset by reductions in emergency department, jail, and homelessness spending. CCBHC PPS rates average $250-350 per client per month.

**Timeline**: 2 years for legislative action and rulemaking, 5 years for full national implementation.

**Challenges**: States with low Medicaid spending may resist matching requirements. Workforce shortages may limit initial capacity in rural areas. Transitioning existing clinics to CCBHC standards requires training and infrastructure investment.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of CCBHCs per 100,000 population, emergency department psychiatric visits per capita, jail booking rates for people with SMI, client employment and housing outcomes.

### Solution 2: Clozapine Access and Utilization Initiative

**Description**: Clozapine is the only FDA-approved medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and the only antipsychotic proven to reduce suicide. Yet it is prescribed to only approximately 4% of Americans with schizophrenia, compared to 20-30% in Finland, New Zealand, and Australia. A national initiative would (1) reform the FDA Clozapine REMS program to reduce monitoring burden while maintaining safety, (2) establish clozapine prescribing and monitoring support centers in every state, (3) train and incentivize prescribers, and (4) expand point-of-care ANC testing to community settings.

**Evidence Base**: Clozapine reduces all-cause mortality in schizophrenia by 26% (Tiihonen et al., Lancet Psychiatry, 2009), reduces suicide by approximately 80% compared to other antipsychotics (Meltzer et al., Archives of General Psychiatry, 2003), and is effective in 30-60% of patients who fail other antipsychotics. A 2023 modeling study estimated that increasing U.S. clozapine utilization to 15% of schizophrenia patients would prevent 3,800 suicides and 91,000 hospitalizations over 10 years (Stroup et al., AJP, 2023).

**Implementation**: FDA reforms REMS to allow bimonthly (instead of monthly) ANC monitoring after 12 months of stable therapy. CMS increases Medicaid reimbursement for clozapine management visits by 50%. SAMHSA funds state-level Clozapine Support Centers providing telepsychiatry consultation, point-of-care testing supplies, and prescriber training.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $300-500 million annually for monitoring support and prescriber incentives. Clozapine itself is inexpensive ($50-200/month generic). Net savings from reduced hospitalizations and suicides estimated at $2-4 billion annually.

**Timeline**: FDA REMS reform within 1 year; state support centers operational within 2 years; target 15% utilization rate within 5 years.

**Challenges**: Prescriber culture change is slow. Some patients genuinely cannot tolerate clozapine. Point-of-care testing infrastructure is limited in rural areas.

**Impact Metrics**: Clozapine prescriptions per 1,000 schizophrenia patients, suicide rate among schizophrenia patients, hospitalization rate for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

### Solution 3: Expansion of Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) with Robust Services

**Description**: Ensure all 50 states have functional AOT laws that include court-ordered outpatient treatment for people with SMI who meet specific criteria (typically a history of repeated hospitalization, arrest, or violence linked to treatment non-adherence). Critically, AOT expansion must be paired with robust service mandates -- courts ordering treatment must also ensure treatment is available. This means the AOT order creates an entitlement to services, not just an obligation to comply.

**Evidence Base**: New York's Kendra's Law reduced hospitalization by 77%, homelessness by 74%, arrest by 83%, incarceration by 87%, and physical harm to self by 55% among participants (New York State Office of Mental Health, 2023). A Duke University randomized controlled trial found that AOT lasting 6+ months significantly reduced hospitalization and violent behavior (Swartz et al., 2022).

**Implementation**: Federal legislation incentivizing states to adopt and fund AOT programs, with minimum service standards. Condition a portion of the Mental Health Block Grant on AOT implementation. Require racial equity monitoring and annual outcome reporting. Include due process protections: judicial hearings, right to counsel, periodic review, and appeal rights.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $500 million-1 billion annually in federal incentive funding. State costs offset by reduced hospitalization, incarceration, and emergency services.

**Timeline**: Federal incentive legislation within 2 years; all 50 states implementing within 5 years; outcome data collection within 3 years.

**Challenges**: Three states (Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts) lack AOT laws. Civil liberties organizations will oppose expansion. Ensuring services actually exist behind court orders is the critical implementation challenge.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of people receiving AOT, hospitalization rates for AOT participants, arrest rates, housing stability, racial equity metrics.

### Solution 4: Permanent Supportive Housing Expansion

**Description**: Expand permanent supportive housing (PSH) -- affordable housing paired with on-site or linked support services including case management, psychiatric care, and substance use treatment -- by 100,000 units over 10 years. PSH is the single most effective intervention for ending chronic homelessness among people with SMI.

**Evidence Base**: The At Home/Chez Soi randomized controlled trial in Canada (Aubry et al., 2015) found that Housing First PSH reduced homelessness by 73% and improved mental health outcomes. U.S. studies show PSH reduces emergency department visits by 61%, hospitalizations by 77%, and jail bookings by 85% among chronically homeless people with SMI (CSH, 2023). PSH costs $20,000-25,000 per person per year compared to $40,000+ for jail and $100,000+ for state hospitalization.

**Implementation**: Increase HUD Section 811 (Housing for Persons with Disabilities) funding by $2 billion annually. Create HHS-HUD joint funding mechanism for supportive services. Incentivize local governments to zone for PSH by conditioning federal housing funds on zoning reform. Streamline Medicaid funding for tenancy support services.

**Cost/Resources**: Capital costs of $2-3 billion annually for new construction/acquisition; $1-2 billion annually for services. 10-year total: $30-50 billion. Offset by reduced emergency, jail, and shelter costs estimated at $15-25 billion over the same period.

**Timeline**: 10,000 new units per year for 10 years. Immediate pipeline of 20,000 units from converting existing homeless shelter funding.

**Challenges**: NIMBYism in local zoning; construction costs; workforce to provide on-site services; long development timelines.

**Impact Metrics**: Net new PSH units, chronic homelessness count (PIT), housing retention rates, health and justice outcomes for PSH residents.

### Solution 5: Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) for First-Episode Psychosis

**Description**: Scale the NIMH RAISE (Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode) model to every community in America. CSC provides team-based care including low-dose antipsychotic medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, family education and support, supported education and employment, and case management for young people experiencing their first episode of psychosis. Early intervention dramatically improves long-term outcomes.

**Evidence Base**: The NIMH RAISE study found that CSC participants had greater symptom improvement, were more likely to remain in work or school, and had better quality of life than those receiving usual care (Kane et al., American Journal of Psychiatry, 2016). Australia and the UK have implemented national early psychosis programs with favorable outcomes: the UK's IRIS Initiative showed 30% fewer hospitalizations and 50% better vocational outcomes (NICE, 2023).

**Implementation**: Expand the SAMHSA Community Mental Health Block Grant to require CSC programs in every state. Fund 300+ new CSC teams (currently approximately 350 exist nationally, serving only about 6% of eligible individuals). Create a federal matching program for state CSC funding at 80% FMAP.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $500 million-1 billion annually in federal grants. Average CSC program cost: $3,000-5,000 per client per year for 2-3 years of treatment. Net savings from reduced long-term disability and hospitalization estimated at $5-10 billion over 20 years.

**Timeline**: Legislation within 1 year; 150 new CSC teams within 3 years; full national coverage within 7 years.

**Challenges**: Workforce (CSC teams need psychiatrists, therapists, family specialists, employment specialists); identifying first-episode cases before they deteriorate; engaging young adults who may not self-identify as ill.

**Impact Metrics**: Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), percentage of first-episode patients receiving CSC within 90 days, 5-year employment/education rates, hospitalization rates.

### Solution 6: Long-Acting Injectable Antipsychotic Access Program

**Description**: Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) -- which are administered every 2 weeks to 6 months rather than taken daily -- dramatically improve medication adherence for people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Currently used by only 10-12% of eligible patients in the U.S. (compared to 25-50% in many European countries), LAIs should be available as a first-line treatment option, not a last resort after repeated relapses.

**Evidence Base**: The PRELAPSE trial found that LAIs reduced relapse risk by 57% compared to oral antipsychotics in early-phase schizophrenia (Subotnik et al., JAMA Psychiatry, 2015). A Scandinavian mirror-image study showed LAIs reduced hospitalization by 56% compared to the same patients' prior outcomes on oral medication (Tiihonen et al., Lancet Psychiatry, 2017). LAIs improve treatment adherence from approximately 50% (oral) to 85-90%.

**Implementation**: CMS issues guidance requiring Medicaid programs to cover LAIs without prior authorization. SAMHSA funds LAI administration sites (including pharmacies, mobile health units, and community centers). FDA expedites approval of new LAI formulations. Training programs for primary care providers on LAI administration.

**Cost/Resources**: LAIs cost $500-3,000 per injection (monthly-quarterly); however, net costs are offset by reduced hospitalization ($1,000-2,000/day inpatient). Estimated net savings of $2-5 billion annually from reduced hospitalizations.

**Timeline**: CMS guidance within 6 months; expanded administration sites within 2 years; target 25% utilization within 5 years.

**Challenges**: Higher per-unit cost than oral medication (perceived as barrier despite net savings); requires administration visits; some patients prefer oral medication; branded LAIs are expensive.

**Impact Metrics**: LAI prescription rate among eligible patients, relapse rates, hospitalization rates, medication adherence measures.

### Solution 7: Crisis System Transformation -- 988-911 Integration

**Description**: Build a comprehensive crisis response system that integrates the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline with 911 dispatch, mobile crisis teams, crisis stabilization units, and crisis residential facilities. The goal is that no person experiencing a psychiatric crisis is transported to jail or held in an emergency department for more than 4 hours.

**Evidence Base**: Georgia's crisis system model -- featuring 24/7 call centers, mobile crisis teams, and crisis stabilization units -- reduced state hospital admissions by 25%, emergency department psychiatric visits by 40%, and law enforcement transport by 60% (Georgia DBHDD, 2023). The CAHOOTS model in Eugene, Oregon, diverts 5-8% of all 911 calls to mental health responders, with zero use of force (White Bird Clinic, 2023).

**Implementation**: Fund 988 at $3 billion annually (currently $502 million). Require co-location of 988 and 911 call centers. Fund mobile crisis teams in every county. Build 500 additional crisis stabilization units nationally. Establish crisis residential beds at 10 per 100,000 population.

**Cost/Resources**: $3 billion annually for 988; $2 billion for mobile crisis teams; $1.5 billion for crisis stabilization infrastructure. Total approximately $6.5 billion annually, offset by $3-5 billion in reduced emergency department, jail, and state hospital costs.

**Timeline**: 988 fully funded within 2 years; mobile crisis teams in all counties within 5 years; crisis stabilization units within 7 years.

**Challenges**: 911-988 integration requires technical and governance changes across jurisdictions; mobile crisis team staffing in rural areas; capital costs for new facilities; interagency coordination.

**Impact Metrics**: 988 answer rate (target: 95%), average time from crisis call to response, emergency department boarding hours, law enforcement transports for psychiatric emergencies.

### Solution 8: IMD Exclusion Reform

**Description**: Modify the Medicaid Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion to allow federal Medicaid payment for acute inpatient psychiatric care in facilities with more than 16 beds, for stays of up to 60 days. Condition the waiver on concurrent investment in community-based services and discharge planning.

**Evidence Base**: CMS has already granted IMD exclusion waivers for substance use disorder in over 40 states, establishing a precedent. States with SUD IMD waivers showed improved access to residential treatment without re-institutionalization (MACPAC, 2023). The IMD exclusion costs states an estimated $4-6 billion annually in forgone Medicaid matching funds (Kennedy Forum, 2023), directly contributing to bed shortages.

**Implementation**: CMS issues Section 1115 demonstration waivers to all interested states, conditioned on (1) concurrent community investment requirements, (2) maximum 60-day stay limitations, (3) discharge planning beginning at admission, and (4) annual outcome reporting. Congressional legislation codifying the waiver authority provides permanence.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $4-6 billion annually in new federal Medicaid spending, partially offset by reduced emergency department and jail costs. States save an equivalent amount in state-only hospital spending.

**Timeline**: CMS guidance within 6 months; first state waivers within 1 year; legislation within 3 years.

**Challenges**: Civil liberties organizations will oppose; requires community investment conditions to prevent re-institutionalization; need to ensure quality standards in expanded facilities.

**Impact Metrics**: Psychiatric bed availability per 100,000, emergency department boarding hours, state hospital wait lists, community service investment levels.

## International Models

### Finland: Open Dialogue and Western Lapland Model

**Description**: The Open Dialogue approach provides immediate (within 24 hours), home-based crisis intervention for first-episode psychosis. Treatment teams include the patient, family, and 2-3 clinicians. Medication is used cautiously and only when necessary. The approach emphasizes transparent dialogue, shared decision-making, and social network activation.

**Results**: 80% of first-episode psychosis patients recovered and returned to work or school within 5 years. Only 35% used antipsychotic medication. Incidence of schizophrenia in Western Lapland decreased by 90% over 30 years (Seikkula et al., 2011).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The model requires a public health infrastructure and workforce density that the U.S. currently lacks. Elements can be adapted -- particularly the rapid response, family involvement, and careful medication approach -- but wholesale replication would require fundamental system restructuring. Several U.S. pilot sites are testing adapted versions.

### Australia: National Early Psychosis Program (EPPIC/Headspace)

**Description**: Australia operates a national network of early psychosis prevention and intervention centers (EPPIC) and youth mental health centers (Headspace). These provide low-stigma, youth-friendly entry points for early intervention, with specialized first-episode psychosis programs.

**Results**: EPPIC reduced time to treatment from months to days, improved 5-year vocational outcomes by 50%, and reduced long-term disability claims. The Headspace network serves 150,000+ young people annually (Orygen, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The RAISE model is the American equivalent of EPPIC but covers only ~6% of eligible individuals. Scaling RAISE to Australian levels of coverage would require 300+ additional CSC teams and approximately $1 billion in annual funding.

### Italy: Community-Based System (Post-Basaglia Reform)

**Description**: Italy closed all psychiatric hospitals in 1978 following the Basaglia Law, replacing them with community mental health centers, crisis residential facilities, and supported housing. Italy has approximately 10 psychiatric beds per 100,000 -- similar to the U.S. -- but with far more comprehensive community services.

**Results**: Italy's community-based system has achieved lower involuntary treatment rates and lower incarceration rates for people with SMI than the U.S., though outcomes vary by region. Northern Italy performs significantly better than southern Italy due to resource differences.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Italy demonstrates that a system with very few hospital beds can work if community services are adequately funded and staffed. The key lesson is that deinstitutionalization succeeds only with equivalent community investment -- the step the U.S. skipped.
