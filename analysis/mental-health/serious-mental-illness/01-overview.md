# Serious Mental Illness: Overview

## Overview

Serious mental illness (SMI) refers to mental, behavioral, or emotional disorders that result in substantial functional impairment, significantly interfering with or limiting one or more major life activities. The primary diagnoses classified under SMI include schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar I and II disorder, severe major depressive disorder, and schizoaffective disorder. In 2023, an estimated 14.1 million adults in the United States -- approximately 5.5% of the adult population -- were living with SMI, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Despite the severity of these conditions, only 65.4% of adults with SMI received any mental health treatment in that year, leaving nearly 4.9 million people with no care at all.

The human cost of untreated SMI is staggering. People with serious mental illness die 10 to 25 years earlier than the general population, primarily from preventable medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and respiratory illness (National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, 2023). An estimated 30% to 40% of people experiencing chronic homelessness have a serious mental illness (HUD, 2023). Approximately 2 million bookings per year into U.S. jails involve people with SMI, making the criminal justice system the nation's de facto largest mental health provider (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022). Families bear enormous caregiving burdens, with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) estimating that 8.4 million Americans serve as unpaid caregivers to adults with SMI.

The current crisis traces directly to the deinstitutionalization movement that began in the 1960s. State psychiatric hospital populations fell from 559,000 in 1955 to fewer than 37,000 by 2016, a 93% reduction. The community mental health centers that were supposed to replace institutional care were never built at sufficient scale, and the Medicaid Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion -- which prohibits federal Medicaid payments for psychiatric care in facilities with more than 16 beds -- continues to create a perverse disincentive against inpatient psychiatric capacity. Today the United States has approximately 11.7 psychiatric beds per 100,000 people, well below the 40 to 60 per 100,000 recommended by the Treatment Advocacy Center.

At the center of SMI policy lies an unresolved tension between the right to personal autonomy and the reality that many people with the most severe conditions -- particularly those experiencing anosognosia, a neurological symptom that impairs awareness of one's own illness -- cannot voluntarily seek the treatment they need. This tension shapes every debate about involuntary treatment, assisted outpatient treatment (AOT), civil commitment standards, and the role of families in treatment decisions. Addressing SMI effectively requires confronting this tension honestly while deploying the evidence-based practices that have proven effective: clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, long-acting injectable antipsychotics for medication adherence, coordinated specialty care for first-episode psychosis, and supported housing and employment as foundations for recovery.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of serious mental illness policy:

- **Treatment Access and Quality**: Availability of psychiatric beds, outpatient services, medication access (including clozapine and long-acting injectables), and evidence-based practices
- **Criminalization and Justice Involvement**: The pipeline from untreated SMI to arrest, incarceration, and recidivism, and alternatives including mental health courts and jail diversion programs
- **Housing and Homelessness**: The relationship between SMI and chronic homelessness, supportive housing models, and the role of Housing First approaches
- **Family Burden and Caregiver Support**: The impact on families, including HIPAA barriers, caregiver training, respite services, and family psychoeducation
- **Workforce and Infrastructure**: Psychiatric workforce shortages, community mental health center capacity, telehealth expansion, and peer support specialists
- **Legal and Ethical Framework**: Civil commitment standards, assisted outpatient treatment laws, guardianship, advance directives, and the autonomy-versus-care debate

| People with SMI in jails/prisons | ~383,000 on any given day | Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022 |
| Homelessness rate among people with SMI | 30-40% of chronically homeless | HUD Annual Homeless Assessment, 2023 |
| Clozapine utilization rate in U.S. | ~4% of schizophrenia patients | Stroup et al., American Journal of Psychiatry, 2023 |
| SAMHSA Mental Health Block Grant | $1.86 billion (FY2024) | SAMHSA, FY2024 |
| Medicaid IMD exclusion | Bars federal payment for psychiatric facilities >16 beds | 42 U.S.C. Section 1396d |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Autonomy vs. Treatment Need**: Respecting individual liberty while ensuring people who cannot recognize their illness due to anosognosia receive life-saving care. Approximately 40% to 50% of people with schizophrenia experience anosognosia, making voluntary treatment engagement fundamentally difficult.
- **Community Care vs. Institutional Capacity**: The deinstitutionalization movement rightly ended warehousing, but the failure to build adequate community alternatives left a gap that jails and shelters now fill. Rebuilding any inpatient capacity risks recreating past abuses if proper oversight is not ensured.
- **Medicaid Funding vs. IMD Exclusion**: Medicaid is the largest payer for mental health services, but the IMD exclusion blocks payment for the very facilities that serve people with the most severe conditions. Repealing it could improve access but also risks incentivizing institutionalization over community-based care.
- **Evidence-Based Practices vs. Clinical Reality**: Treatments like clozapine and long-acting injectables have strong evidence bases but are dramatically underutilized due to monitoring requirements, prescriber reluctance, and systemic barriers. Bridging the research-to-practice gap requires overcoming entrenched clinical culture.
- **Family Involvement vs. Privacy Protections**: Families are often the primary caregivers, but HIPAA and state confidentiality laws can prevent clinicians from sharing essential treatment information with them, leaving families unable to provide effective support or advocate during crises.

## Key Questions

1. How can the mental health system ensure that people with SMI who lack insight into their illness receive treatment without recreating the coercive institutional practices of the past?
2. What structural reforms -- including repeal or modification of the IMD exclusion -- are necessary to create adequate inpatient and outpatient psychiatric capacity?
3. Why does the United States dramatically underutilize clozapine compared to other high-income nations, and what policy interventions can close this gap?
4. How can the criminal justice system be effectively diverted from serving as the primary mental health system for people with untreated SMI?

## Vision of Success

A successful SMI policy framework in the 21st century would feature:

- **Treatment Before Crisis**: A continuum of care from early intervention for first-episode psychosis through long-term recovery support, with no one falling through the cracks between systems. Every community would have 24/7 psychiatric crisis response capacity.
- **Evidence-Based Medication Access**: Clozapine utilization rates for treatment-resistant schizophrenia approaching the 20% to 30% seen in other high-income nations, and long-acting injectable antipsychotics available as a first-line option rather than a last resort.
- **Housing Stability**: Adequate permanent supportive housing stock so that no person with SMI experiences chronic homelessness. The research is clear that Housing First works; the challenge is funding it at scale.
- **Decriminalization**: Jail diversion programs, mental health courts, and crisis intervention teams operating in every jurisdiction, reducing the number of people with SMI in jails and prisons by at least 50% within a decade.
- **Empowered Families**: Families equipped with psychoeducation, respite services, and legal authority to participate meaningfully in their loved one's care while respecting the dignity of the person with SMI.
