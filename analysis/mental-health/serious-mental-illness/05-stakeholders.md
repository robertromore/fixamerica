# Serious Mental Illness: Stakeholders

The landscape of serious mental illness policy is shaped by the interactions of people directly affected by SMI, their families, healthcare providers, government agencies, advocacy organizations, law enforcement, and the insurance industry. Each group has distinct interests, resources, and influence, and their alignment or conflict determines the pace and direction of reform.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Adults with SMI | Direct experience of illness, treatment access, housing, employment, civil liberties | 14.1 million (SAMHSA, 2023) | Access to effective treatment, housing stability, protection from coercion, employment opportunity |
| Family caregivers of people with SMI | Emotional, financial, and physical burden of caregiving; navigating fragmented systems | 8.4 million (NAMI, 2023) | Information access, respite services, legal authority to participate in care, crisis intervention |
| People with SMI in jails/prisons | Inadequate psychiatric treatment in correctional settings, longer sentences | ~383,000 on any given day (TAC, 2022) | Treatment in lieu of incarceration, diversion programs, transition services upon release |
| People with SMI experiencing homelessness | Exposure, victimization, untreated illness, barriers to housing | ~43,000-57,000 chronically homeless (HUD, 2024) | Permanent supportive housing, low-barrier shelter, outreach services |
| People with first-episode psychosis | Critical window for early intervention; average 74-week delay to treatment | ~100,000 new cases/year (NIMH, 2023) | Rapid access to coordinated specialty care, education/employment support |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Children of parents with SMI**: Approximately 2.7 million children in the U.S. have a parent with SMI, facing increased risks of neglect, trauma, and developing mental illness themselves (SAMHSA, 2023)
- **Employers**: People with SMI who receive effective treatment can work, but employers face accommodation requirements and may harbor stigma. Supported employment programs achieve competitive employment rates of 40-60% for people with SMI (Bond et al., 2022)
- **Neighbors and communities**: Communities hosting supportive housing or treatment facilities experience NIMBYism, but research consistently shows no increase in crime or property value decline (Galster et al., 2022)
- **Taxpayers**: The economic cost of untreated SMI -- including emergency services, incarceration, homelessness services, and lost productivity -- is estimated at $317 billion annually (NAMI, 2023)

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Congress | Federal legislation, appropriations | Mental health funding, Medicaid rules, parity enforcement | Annual budget authority | High |
| SAMHSA | Federal mental health program administration | Block grant distribution, CCBHC certification, 988 oversight | $7.5 billion discretionary (FY2024) | High |
| CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) | Medicaid/Medicare policy | IMD exclusion waivers, parity enforcement, reimbursement rates | ~$116 billion in behavioral health spending | High |
| State Mental Health Authorities | State psychiatric hospital operation, community program oversight | State hospital capacity, Medicaid plan design, civil commitment implementation | $44.5 billion total state spending (FY2022) | High |
| State Legislatures | State mental health laws | Civil commitment standards, AOT laws, state budgets, housing policy | Varies by state | High |
| Federal courts | Constitutional interpretation | Civil commitment standards, due process requirements | Legal authority | Medium-High |
| County/local governments | Crisis services, jails, housing | 911/988 dispatch, jail diversion, zoning for supportive housing | Varies widely | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)**: The largest grassroots mental health advocacy organization in the U.S. with over 600 state and local affiliates. NAMI represents both people with mental illness and family members, advocating for treatment access, parity, research funding, and caregiver support. Annual budget approximately $50 million.
- **Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC)**: A nonprofit focused specifically on people with the most severe mental illnesses, advocating for AOT, civil commitment reform, and psychiatric bed capacity. TAC publishes widely cited data on beds, criminalization, and treatment gaps.
- **Mental Health America (MHA)**: A community-based nonprofit focused on prevention, early identification, and expanding access. MHA publishes an annual "State of Mental Health in America" report ranking states.
- **National Council for Mental Wellbeing**: Represents 3,300 mental health and substance use treatment organizations, including community mental health centers. Leads the CCBHC initiative.
- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: The professional organization representing 38,000+ psychiatrists. Publishes clinical practice guidelines, advocates for workforce expansion and reimbursement increases.
- **Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)**: The lead federal agency for mental health programs, administering block grants, CCBHC certification, 988 oversight, and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).

### Influencers

- **Disability rights organizations (DREDF, Bazelon Center, ACLU Disability Rights)**: Advocate for community integration, least restrictive alternatives, and against involuntary treatment expansion. Oppose most AOT expansion as coercive. Significant influence through litigation.
- **Law enforcement organizations (IACP, Major Cities Chiefs Association)**: Increasingly advocate for mental health diversion, CIT training, and 988 alternatives to 911. Support keeping people with SMI out of jails.
- **Pharmaceutical industry (PhRMA, individual companies)**: Fund research, advocacy, and lobbying. Support treatment access expansion generally but have mixed incentives regarding generic clozapine vs. branded LAIs.
- **Academic researchers (NIMH-funded investigators, university departments)**: Generate the evidence base for policy. Key researchers include Jeffrey Swanson (Duke), Lisa Dixon (Columbia), Marvin Swartz (Duke), and Robert Drake (Dartmouth) on SMI policy.
- **Peer support movement**: People with lived experience of SMI who serve as peer specialists, advocates, and recovery coaches. Growing influence on program design and policy.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NAMI + TAC + APA | Expanded treatment access, clozapine utilization, AOT implementation | Strong |
| Law enforcement + NAMI + TAC | Jail diversion, CIT expansion, 988 crisis infrastructure | Strong |
| Peer specialists + MHA + disability rights | Community-based services, recovery orientation, voluntary engagement | Strong |
| Families + NAMI + religious organizations | Caregiver support, family psychoeducation, HIPAA reform | Moderate |
| CCBHCs + National Council + SAMHSA | Comprehensive community behavioral health clinic expansion | Strong |
| Housing advocates + HUD + supportive housing providers | Permanent supportive housing expansion | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Autonomy vs. Treatment**: Disability rights organizations (Bazelon Center, ACLU) oppose AOT expansion and involuntary treatment, while family advocates (NAMI) and treatment-focused organizations (TAC) support it for people who meet specific criteria. This is the deepest and most persistent divide in SMI advocacy.
- **Community vs. Institutional**: Community advocates push for community-only models, while treatment advocates argue that some level of institutional capacity (crisis stabilization, longer-term residential) is necessary. The Olmstead framework further complicates this by requiring community integration.
- **Medication-Focused vs. Recovery-Focused**: Psychiatric professionals emphasize medication adherence (including clozapine and LAIs), while some peer advocates and recovery-oriented organizations emphasize non-pharmacological approaches, shared decision-making, and minimizing medication.
- **Federal vs. State Control**: Some stakeholders push for federal mandates (parity enforcement, IMD exclusion repeal), while others (especially conservative state officials) prefer state flexibility and block grant approaches.

### The Treatment-Liberty Iron Triangle

The most entrenched power relationship in SMI policy is the tension among three groups:

1. **Treatment advocates** (TAC, NAMI family members, APA) who prioritize getting people into treatment, including through court orders when necessary
2. **Civil liberties advocates** (Bazelon Center, ACLU, some peer organizations) who prioritize protecting people from involuntary treatment and state coercion
3. **Fiscal conservatives** (state budget offices, some legislators) who prioritize cost control and resist the funding increases that both voluntary and involuntary treatment expansion would require

No reform can succeed without addressing all three legs of this triangle.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on SMI policy:

- **Lobbying**: NAMI, APA, PhRMA, and the National Council all maintain active lobbying operations in Washington and state capitals. Mental health lobbying spending totals approximately $30-40 million annually at the federal level (OpenSecrets, 2023).
- **Campaign Contributions**: The pharmaceutical industry is among the largest political donors, contributing over $100 million per election cycle. Mental health-specific PACs are small by comparison.
- **Litigation**: Disability rights organizations (Bazelon Center, DREDF) use litigation under the ADA, Olmstead, and constitutional law to shape policy. Court orders have driven much of the transition from institutional to community-based care.
- **Public Advocacy**: NAMI's grassroots network, including NAMIWalks events and Congressional briefings, raises public awareness. High-profile media coverage of tragedies involving untreated SMI creates short-term political windows.
- **Expertise and Data**: Organizations like TAC, NASMHPD, and NIMH-funded researchers provide the data and analysis that inform legislative debates. The SAMHSA NSDUH survey is the authoritative prevalence data source.
- **Revolving Door**: Movement between SAMHSA, CMS, state mental health authorities, and advocacy organizations is common. Former SAMHSA administrators have moved to leadership roles at NAMI, the National Council, and private mental health companies.
