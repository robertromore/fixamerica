# Serious Mental Illness: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Reforming the serious mental illness system requires a phased strategy that sequences administrative actions, legislative reform, and infrastructure investment so that each phase builds on the last. The approach follows a clear logic: Phase 1 uses existing executive authority and bipartisan legislation to produce quick wins that demonstrate effectiveness, build political support, and establish the infrastructure needed for larger reforms. Phase 2 enacts the major structural legislation -- CCBHC expansion, IMD exclusion reform, AOT incentives -- that requires Congressional action and sustained funding. Phase 3 completes the transformation by achieving full geographic coverage, closing the mortality gap, and building a self-sustaining system where investment in treatment generates measurable savings in emergency, criminal justice, and homelessness costs.

The theory of change is that early investments in crisis services, clozapine access, and coordinated specialty care will produce demonstrable reductions in emergency department boarding, jail bookings, and homelessness that justify the larger investments in Phases 2 and 3. Every phase includes workforce development, because no amount of funding or legislation succeeds without people to deliver care.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation and Quick Wins (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Use executive and regulatory authority to expand treatment access without new legislation
- Fully fund the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and begin 988-911 integration
- Reform the FDA Clozapine REMS to reduce monitoring burden
- Expand CCBHC grants to all 50 states under existing authority
- Launch IMD exclusion waiver applications in interested states
- Begin workforce pipeline expansion through loan forgiveness and residency expansion

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Reform FDA Clozapine REMS to allow bimonthly monitoring after 12 months of stable therapy | FDA | Months 1-12 | Regulatory review staff; stakeholder engagement | Revised REMS guidance published |
| Issue CMS guidance removing Medicaid prior authorization for LAIs | CMS | Months 1-6 | CMS staff; State Medicaid Director Letter | Guidance issued; 40+ states comply |
| Fund 988 at $3 billion annually through appropriations | Congress / SAMHSA | Months 1-18 | $3 billion annual appropriation | 988 answer rate reaches 95% |
| Launch 988-911 co-location pilot programs in 50 communities | SAMHSA / FCC | Months 6-24 | $200 million pilot grants | 50 co-located dispatch centers operational |
| Expand CCBHC grants to all 50 states | SAMHSA | Months 1-18 | $1.5 billion in expansion grants | CCBHCs operating in all 50 states |
| Begin Section 1115 IMD exclusion waivers for SMI | CMS | Months 6-18 | CMS waiver review capacity | 15+ states approved for waivers |
| Launch SAMHSA Clozapine Support Centers in every state | SAMHSA | Months 6-24 | $200 million; telepsychiatry infrastructure | 50 state-level support centers operational |
| Expand psychiatric residency slots by 500 through GME funding | CMS / HRSA | Months 12-24 | $350 million in GME reimbursement | 500 new residency positions funded |
| Expand National Health Service Corps mental health loan forgiveness | HRSA | Months 1-12 | $150 million annual increase | 2,000 additional mental health clinicians in shortage areas |

### Legislative Requirements

- FY2026 and FY2027 appropriations bills must include 988 funding at $3 billion, CCBHC expansion funding at $1.5 billion, and NHSC expansion
- No new authorizing legislation required for most Phase 1 actions; administrative authority exists for REMS reform, CMS guidance, and Section 1115 waivers

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, the 988 system will answer 95% of calls (up from approximately 85% in 2024), clozapine monitoring requirements will be significantly reduced, LAIs will be accessible without prior authorization in Medicaid, CCBHCs will be operating in all 50 states, and 15+ states will have IMD exclusion waivers. These changes will produce measurable reductions in emergency department psychiatric boarding (target: 20% reduction), law enforcement psychiatric transports (target: 15% reduction), and clozapine prescribing will begin to increase from the current ~4% baseline.

---

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Enact comprehensive CCBHC legislation making the model a permanent Medicaid benefit
- Pass federal AOT incentive legislation with service mandates and equity provisions
- Codify IMD exclusion reform through legislation with community investment conditions
- Fund 300+ new Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) teams for first-episode psychosis
- Begin permanent supportive housing pipeline of 10,000 units per year
- Build 500 additional crisis stabilization units nationally
- Deploy mobile crisis teams in every county with population over 50,000

### Key Actions

| Create federal workforce incentive program for SMI-specialized providers | HRSA | Years 3-5 | $500 million annually | 5,000 new SMI-specialized providers trained |

### Legislative Requirements

- Comprehensive Community Behavioral Health Clinic Act (permanent Medicaid CCBHC benefit)
- Assisted Outpatient Treatment Incentive Act (federal incentives, service mandates, equity provisions)
- IMD Exclusion Reform Act (codifying waiver authority with conditions)
- Mental Health Housing Investment Act (Section 811 expansion)
- First Episode Psychosis Early Intervention Act (CSC expansion)

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 2, the structural legislative foundation will be in place. CCBHCs will be a permanent part of the Medicaid infrastructure in all states. All 50 states will have funded AOT programs with due process protections and racial equity monitoring. The IMD exclusion will no longer prevent Medicaid from paying for acute psychiatric inpatient care in facilities with more than 16 beds (up to 60 days). Approximately 30,000 new PSH units will be in the pipeline. Crisis response capacity will cover most major population centers. Measurable targets: 30% reduction in jail bookings for people with SMI, 40% reduction in ED psychiatric boarding, clozapine utilization reaching 10% of schizophrenia patients, and 30% of first-episode psychosis cases receiving CSC within 90 days of onset.

---

## Phase 3: System Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Achieve full national coverage of evidence-based SMI services
- Complete 100,000 new permanent supportive housing units
- Reach clozapine utilization of 15% for schizophrenia and LAI utilization of 25%
- Reduce incarceration of people with SMI by 50%
- Begin closing the premature mortality gap through integrated physical-behavioral health care
- Every county has mobile crisis team and crisis stabilization capacity

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Complete PSH pipeline to 100,000 units | HUD / HHS | Years 6-10 | Continued $2-3 billion annually | 100,000 cumulative new units |
| Achieve CSC coverage for 100% of eligible first-episode patients | SAMHSA / States | Years 6-10 | 600+ total CSC teams nationally | Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) <12 weeks nationally |
| Expand mobile crisis teams to every county | SAMHSA / States | Years 6-10 | $3 billion annually | 3,000+ teams covering all U.S. counties |
| Integrate physical health into all SMI treatment settings | CMS / SAMHSA | Years 6-10 | CCBHC PPS rates cover integrated care | Cardiovascular mortality rate for people with SMI reduced 20% |
| Establish peer specialist workforce of 100,000 | SAMHSA / States | Years 6-10 | State certification programs; Medicaid reimbursement | 100,000 certified peer specialists employed |
| Conduct comprehensive 10-year program evaluation | GAO / SAMHSA | Year 10 | $50 million evaluation contract | Published evaluation with reauthorization recommendations |

### Expected Outcomes

By Year 10, the United States will have a functioning SMI treatment continuum from early intervention through long-term recovery support. Chronic homelessness among people with SMI will be reduced by at least 50% (from ~43,000-57,000 to ~21,000-28,000). Incarceration of people with SMI will be reduced by 50% (from ~383,000 to ~190,000 on any given day). Premature mortality will begin to close, with an initial target of reducing the life expectancy gap by 5 years (from 10-25 years to 5-20 years). Clozapine utilization will reach 15% of schizophrenia patients, approaching benchmarks seen in Finland and Australia. Every community will have crisis response capacity that does not rely on law enforcement as the default responder.

| Premature mortality gap | Ongoing | Life expectancy difference | 10-25 years | 10-25 years | 9-23 years | 5-20 years |

## Governance and Oversight

Effective implementation requires clear accountability:

- **Federal Interagency Council on SMI**: Establish a standing interagency body co-chaired by the SAMHSA Administrator and the CMS Administrator, with representation from HUD, DOJ, VA, and the Office of Management and Budget. This council meets quarterly to coordinate funding, data sharing, and policy alignment across agencies.
- **Congressional Reporting**: SAMHSA submits annual reports to the Senate HELP Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee detailing progress against all milestones, with disaggregated data by state, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis.
- **State Accountability**: States receiving enhanced CCBHC matching funds, AOT incentive grants, and IMD exclusion waivers must submit annual performance reports. States failing to meet minimum performance thresholds after 3 years face corrective action plans.
- **Independent Evaluation**: GAO conducts an independent mid-term evaluation (Year 5) and a comprehensive 10-year evaluation, with findings made public.
- **Racial Equity Monitoring**: All federal programs include mandatory collection and public reporting of outcome data disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and geography. Disparities trigger mandatory technical assistance and corrective action.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Insufficient Congressional Appropriations

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build bipartisan support by emphasizing cost-benefit data (every $1 in AOT saves $1.81; PSH costs $20,000-25,000/year vs. $40,000+ for jail). Secure commitments from key appropriators in both parties. Structure funding as mandatory spending where possible (e.g., Medicaid CCBHC benefit) rather than discretionary appropriations.

**Contingency Plan**: If full appropriations are not available, prioritize CCBHC expansion and 988 funding as the highest-leverage investments. Pursue administrative actions (CMS guidance, FDA REMS reform) that do not require appropriations.

### Risk 2: Workforce Shortage Limits Service Expansion

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Invest heavily in workforce from Year 1 -- expanded psychiatric residency slots, NHSC loan forgiveness, peer specialist certification programs, scope-of-practice reform for NPs and PAs. Use telepsychiatry to extend reach of existing workforce. Establish CCBHC PPS rates that allow competitive salaries.

**Contingency Plan**: If workforce growth lags, prioritize geographic areas with greatest unmet need (high homelessness, high incarceration rates) and use telepsychiatry and collaborative care models to extend existing capacity.

### Risk 3: Opposition from Civil Liberties Organizations Blocks AOT Expansion

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Include robust due process protections (judicial hearings, right to counsel, 6-month review periods, appeal rights) in all AOT legislation. Pair AOT expansion with major voluntary service investment at a ratio of at least 3:1. Include racial equity monitoring and community advisory boards. Engage civil liberties organizations in legislative design.

**Contingency Plan**: If AOT expansion is blocked federally, support state-level implementation in the 47 states that already have AOT laws, using SAMHSA grants to fund services behind existing court orders.

### Risk 4: NIMBYism Blocks Permanent Supportive Housing Construction

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Condition federal housing funds on local zoning reform. Provide community engagement funding to address neighborhood concerns proactively. Highlight research showing PSH does not reduce property values or increase crime. Use scattered-site models in addition to project-based PSH to reduce visibility.

**Contingency Plan**: Prioritize scattered-site and master-lease models that do not require new construction or zoning changes. Focus construction on sites with existing supportive zoning.

### Risk 5: States Fail to Implement Effectively

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Provide technical assistance through SAMHSA and CMS. Tie funding to performance metrics with clear benchmarks. Facilitate peer learning across states through learning collaboratives. Allow flexibility in implementation models while maintaining outcome accountability.

**Contingency Plan**: Redirect funding from chronically underperforming states to high-performing states or direct federal implementation in areas with persistent failure.
