# Serious Mental Illness: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to reform the SMI treatment system -- particularly those involving expanded involuntary treatment authority, increased public spending, and modifications to the Medicaid IMD exclusion -- face resistance from diverse quarters. Opposition comes from civil liberties advocates who fear a return to institutional coercion, fiscal conservatives who resist new spending, libertarians who oppose state intervention in individual medical decisions, and some members of the psychiatric survivor movement who reject the biomedical model of mental illness itself.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law | Protecting civil liberties of people with mental illness; opposing involuntary treatment expansion | Litigation capacity, foundation funding, legal expertise | Federal court litigation, amicus briefs, policy reports, Congressional testimony |
| ACLU (Disability Rights Project) | Individual liberty; opposing state-mandated treatment | $300+ million annual budget (organization-wide), legal staff | Litigation, public advocacy, legislative lobbying |
| National Council on Disability | Disability rights; community integration; opposing institutionalization | Federal advisory body; moral authority | Policy reports, Congressional briefings, public statements |
| Americans for Tax Reform / fiscal hawks | Opposition to new government spending programs | Lobbying networks, media presence | No-new-taxes pledges, budget scorecards, media campaigns |
| Anti-psychiatry movement (MindFreedom, Mad in America) | Opposing psychiatric diagnoses, involuntary treatment, and medication mandates | Online communities, small nonprofit budgets | Social media advocacy, protests, testimony at legislative hearings |
| Some pharmaceutical companies | Protecting revenue from branded medications (vs. generic clozapine promotion) | Billions in annual revenue, large lobbying operations | Lobbying against clozapine promotion policies that reduce branded antipsychotic sales |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Civil Libertarian**: Opposes any expansion of involuntary treatment as a violation of bodily autonomy and due process. Views AOT and involuntary commitment as state coercion that disproportionately affects marginalized communities.
- **Fiscal Conservative**: Opposes the $10-20 billion in additional annual federal spending that comprehensive SMI reform would require. Argues that mental health is primarily a state responsibility and that federal expansion creates dependency.
- **Anti-Psychiatry / Psychiatric Survivor**: Rejects the biomedical model of mental illness, opposes psychiatric medication (especially involuntary medication), and advocates for peer-led, non-medical alternatives. Views diagnosis itself as a form of social control.
- **Libertarian**: Opposes government involvement in medical decisions on principle, including civil commitment, mandatory medication, and publicly funded treatment programs. Favors private charity and voluntary treatment only.
- **States' Rights**: Opposes federal mandates that override state mental health law, including federally mandated AOT standards, national commitment criteria, or IMD exclusion repeal conditions.

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: Assisted Outpatient Treatment Is Coercive and Violates Civil Rights

**Claim**: AOT is a form of state coercion that forces people to take medication against their will, violating the fundamental right to refuse medical treatment. It disproportionately targets people of color and those in poverty.

**Evidence Cited**: Racial disparities in New York's Kendra's Law implementation (Black and Hispanic individuals were disproportionately represented in AOT orders); historical abuses of involuntary treatment in state hospitals; principles established in *Cruzan v. Director* (1990) affirming the right to refuse medical treatment.

**Reality**: AOT does not authorize forced medication in the community; it creates a court order for outpatient treatment, with non-compliance typically resulting in evaluation, not jail. AOT includes due process protections (judicial hearings, legal representation, periodic review). Research consistently shows AOT reduces hospitalization (by 77%), homelessness (by 74%), arrest (by 83%), and victimization (by 66%) among participants (Swartz et al., Duke University, 2022). Racial disparities in AOT implementation are real and must be addressed through reform of implementation practices, not by eliminating a program that improves outcomes for all participants.

**Rebuttal**: The alternative to AOT for many people with anosognosia is not freedom -- it is homelessness, incarceration, or death. AOT provides the framework for sustained treatment engagement that the affected individuals cannot initiate on their own. Reforms should focus on ensuring equitable access, robust due process, and high-quality services rather than eliminating the tool entirely.

### Argument 2: The IMD Exclusion Should Not Be Repealed Because It Will Lead to Re-Institutionalization

**Claim**: Repealing the Medicaid IMD exclusion would incentivize states to rebuild large psychiatric institutions, reversing decades of progress toward community integration mandated by *Olmstead v. L.C.* (1999).

**Evidence Cited**: History of overcrowded, abusive state hospitals; *Olmstead* requirement for community-based treatment; evidence that states have used institutional settings as cheaper alternatives to comprehensive community services.

**Reality**: The current IMD exclusion does not prevent institutionalization -- it prevents treatment. People with SMI are already being institutionalized, but in jails and prisons (383,000 on any given day) rather than psychiatric facilities designed to treat them. Modifying the IMD exclusion can be done with safeguards -- for example, limiting coverage to stays of 60 days or fewer, requiring community discharge planning, and conditioning federal payment on investment in community alternatives.

**Rebuttal**: The appropriate response to past institutional abuse is not to deny institutional care to people who need it, but to ensure that institutional care is properly funded, regulated, and time-limited. CMS has already approved IMD exclusion waivers for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment in over 40 states; extending similar waivers for SMI would bring parity between mental health and substance use treatment settings.

### Argument 3: Government Cannot Afford Comprehensive SMI Reform

**Claim**: The estimated $10-20 billion in additional annual federal spending needed for comprehensive SMI system reform is fiscally irresponsible during a period of high deficits. Mental health should be funded primarily by states, private insurance, and charitable organizations.

**Evidence Cited**: Federal deficit ($1.7 trillion in FY2023); existing entitlement spending growth; state mental health authority spending of $44.5 billion.

**Reality**: The economic cost of untreated SMI -- including emergency services ($10+ billion), criminal justice ($15+ billion), homelessness services ($5+ billion), and lost productivity ($200+ billion) -- far exceeds the cost of treatment. Every $1 invested in AOT saves $1.81 in reduced hospitalization and incarceration (Swanson et al., 2013). Permanent supportive housing costs $20,000-25,000 per person per year compared to $40,000+ for jail and $100,000+ for state hospitalization (CSH, 2023).

**Rebuttal**: Failing to invest in SMI treatment is not fiscal responsibility; it is cost-shifting. The money is already being spent -- just in the most expensive, least effective settings (emergency rooms, jails, and homeless shelters). Investing in evidence-based treatment and housing is both more effective and more cost-efficient.

### Argument 4: Mental Illness Is Overdiagnosed and Treatment Is Over-Medicalized

**Claim**: The biomedical model of mental illness leads to overdiagnosis, excessive medication, and the pathologizing of normal human experiences. Many people labeled with SMI would benefit more from peer support, talk therapy, nutrition, exercise, and social connection than from antipsychotic medications with serious side effects.

**Evidence Cited**: Concerns about antipsychotic side effects (metabolic syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, sedation); the "Open Dialogue" model in Finland; studies showing some people with psychosis recover without medication; criticism of DSM diagnostic categories.

**Reality**: Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe major depression are well-established neurobiological conditions with strong genetic components and measurable brain changes. While non-pharmacological approaches are valuable as complements, they are not substitutes for medication in most cases of SMI. Clozapine reduces suicide risk by 80% in people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia -- no non-pharmacological intervention comes close to this effect. The Open Dialogue model in Finland includes medication as a tool when needed and operates within a comprehensive public health system; it has not been replicated at scale in the U.S.

**Rebuttal**: Acknowledging that medication is essential for most people with SMI does not mean ignoring side effects or limiting treatment to pills. Comprehensive treatment includes medication management, psychotherapy, peer support, supported employment, housing, and physical health care. The goal is the right treatment for each individual, not a one-size-fits-all approach.

### Argument 5: Expanding Treatment Will Disproportionately Harm Racial Minorities

**Claim**: Given the history of racial bias in psychiatric diagnosis and involuntary commitment (Black Americans are diagnosed with schizophrenia at 3-4 times the rate of white Americans), expanding involuntary treatment authority will disproportionately harm communities of color.

**Evidence Cited**: Documented racial disparities in schizophrenia diagnosis (Schwartz & Blankenship, 2014); disproportionate representation of Black individuals in New York's AOT program; historical abuses including the "schizophrenia is a protest psychosis" framing in the 1960s.

**Reality**: Racial disparities in diagnosis and involuntary treatment are real, documented, and unacceptable. However, the solution is not to withhold effective treatment from everyone, but to address disparities directly through cultural competency training, diverse workforce development, community-based program design, and data-driven monitoring for racial equity. People of color with SMI also benefit from AOT, supported housing, and evidence-based medication -- and they are disproportionately harmed by the current non-system of emergency rooms, jails, and homelessness.

**Rebuttal**: Racial justice requires both ending discriminatory application of treatment and ensuring equitable access to effective care. Communities of color suffer disproportionately from the consequences of untreated SMI. Reform legislation should include mandatory racial equity monitoring, culturally responsive service requirements, and community advisory boards to prevent disparate impact.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

Opposition to SMI reform has been remarkably consistent across decades:

- **1960s-1970s**: Opposition to deinstitutionalization came from state hospital employee unions and rural communities dependent on hospital employment. Opposition to community mental health centers came from fiscal conservatives and NIMBYists.
- **1980s-1990s**: Opposition to increased mental health funding came from the Reagan administration and fiscal conservatives. Opposition to AOT came from civil liberties organizations alarmed by potential for coercion.
- **2000s-2010s**: Opposition to parity enforcement came from the insurance industry. Opposition to IMD exclusion reform came from community advocates who feared re-institutionalization.
- **2020s**: The same fault lines persist, with added dimensions of racial equity concerns and post-COVID fiscal constraints.

The fundamental pattern is that opposition is usually strongest from those who fear what reform might become (institutional abuse, fiscal overreach, racial targeting) rather than from those defending the clearly broken status quo.

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Build the family-law enforcement coalition**: Families of people with SMI and law enforcement agencies are natural allies with significant political credibility. Both groups experience the consequences of untreated SMI directly and can testify to the need for reform from personal and professional experience.
- **Use cost-benefit data aggressively**: Frame investment in SMI treatment as fiscal responsibility. The data showing that treatment is cheaper than jails and emergency rooms is compelling to fiscal conservatives.
- **Leverage the 988 infrastructure**: The 988 system has bipartisan support and creates a platform for expanding crisis services. Build on this momentum rather than starting from scratch.

### Communication Strategies

- **Lead with stories, follow with data**: Personal stories from families, people in recovery, and law enforcement officers are more persuasive than statistics alone. NAMI's model of pairing personal testimony with policy asks is effective.
- **Reframe "involuntary treatment" as "treatment before tragedy"**: The language of coercion provokes opposition. Framing AOT as ensuring people receive treatment before they become homeless, jailed, or dead is more politically viable.
- **Address racial equity proactively**: Acknowledge historical abuses upfront and include specific equity provisions in all reform proposals, rather than waiting for opponents to raise the issue.

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Include sunset clauses and evaluation requirements**: Addressing concerns about overreach by building in mandatory evaluations and reauthorization requirements.
- **Pair involuntary treatment expansion with voluntary treatment investment**: For every dollar spent on AOT, invest multiple dollars in voluntary services, supportive housing, and peer support. This addresses the legitimate concern that expanding coercive tools without expanding voluntary alternatives is wrong.
- **Condition IMD exclusion reform on community investment**: Require states that receive IMD exclusion waivers to simultaneously increase spending on community-based services, preventing states from simply rebuilding hospitals at the expense of community care.
