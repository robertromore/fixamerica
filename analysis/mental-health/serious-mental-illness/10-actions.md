# Serious Mental Illness: What You Can Do

Citizen engagement is essential to reforming the serious mental illness system. The 14.1 million Americans with SMI and their 8.4 million family caregivers are often unable to advocate effectively -- people with the most severe conditions may lack insight into their illness, and families are exhausted and stigmatized. That makes it all the more important for informed citizens, professionals, and community members to raise their voices. Policy change at the scale needed -- expanding CCBHCs, reforming the IMD exclusion, funding supportive housing, and building crisis systems -- requires sustained public pressure on elected officials at every level.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read E. Fuller Torrey's *American Psychosis* (2014) for the history of deinstitutionalization and its consequences, or Thomas Insel's *Healing* (2022) for a former NIMH director's perspective on what works
- Subscribe to the Treatment Advocacy Center's newsletter for regular policy updates on SMI (<https://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/>)
- Follow the SAMHSA CCBHC program page to track expansion of community behavioral health clinics in your state (<https://www.samhsa.gov/certified-community-behavioral-health-clinics>)
- Review your state's mental health spending per capita at NASMHPD.org and compare it to the national average of $134 per capita (NASMHPD, 2023)
- Use HRSA's Health Professional Shortage Area Finder to determine whether your community is designated as a mental health shortage area (<https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage-area/hpsa-find>)

### Make Personal Changes

- If you are a family member or caregiver, take NAMI's Family-to-Family course (free, 8-week evidence-based education program available in all 50 states): <https://www.nami.org/Support-Education/Mental-Health-Education/NAMI-Family-to-Family>
- Learn to recognize the signs of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, social withdrawal, and decline in functioning -- early intervention dramatically improves outcomes
- If you encounter someone in psychiatric crisis, call 988 (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline) rather than 911 when there is no immediate physical danger
- Challenge stigma in your daily life: correct misconceptions that people with schizophrenia are inherently violent (research shows they are far more likely to be victims; SMI accounts for only 3-5% of violent crime)
- Support family members and neighbors who are caregivers -- offer respite, practical help, and a listening ear without judgment

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call your U.S. Senators and Representative during appropriations season (typically February-September) to urge full funding of 988, CCBHC expansion, and mental health workforce programs. Call during mental health awareness month (May) and after high-profile incidents involving untreated SMI.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS, FDA, or SAMHSA issue proposed rules related to mental health (such as the Clozapine REMS revision, Medicaid parity enforcement, or CCBHC certification standards), submit public comments through regulations.gov. Comments from families and consumers carry significant weight.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When local news covers homelessness, incarceration, or public safety incidents involving people with untreated SMI, write letters connecting these outcomes to the failure of the mental health system and advocating for investment in treatment.
- **Share Information**: Share evidence-based resources from NAMI, the Treatment Advocacy Center, and SAMHSA on social media. Counter misinformation about SMI, particularly the myth that people with mental illness are primarily dangerous rather than primarily vulnerable.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Start or join a NAMI affiliate in your community (<https://www.nami.org/Get-Involved/Join-a-Local-NAMI>). NAMI affiliates provide education, support groups, and local advocacy.
- Attend your local Continuum of Care (CoC) meetings -- these HUD-funded bodies allocate homelessness funding and make decisions about supportive housing. Advocate for prioritizing people with SMI in housing allocation.
- Join or establish a community mental health advisory board connected to your local community mental health center or CCBHC. These boards provide community input on services and priorities.
- Organize a screening of documentary films about SMI (e.g., *Bedlam*, 2019; *The Definition of Insanity*, 2020) followed by discussion with local mental health providers, family members, and law enforcement.
- If your community has a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) program, attend citizen ride-alongs or training observation days to understand how law enforcement responds to psychiatric crises.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect family advocacy groups (NAMI affiliates) with law enforcement leaders (police chiefs, sheriffs) who see the consequences of untreated SMI daily. This family-law enforcement coalition is the most politically powerful force for SMI reform.
- Partner with local housing organizations, homeless service providers, and faith communities to advocate for permanent supportive housing in your area.
- Engage local business associations and chambers of commerce, framing SMI treatment as a public safety and economic development issue.
- Coordinate with reentry programs at local jails and prisons to support people with SMI transitioning out of incarceration.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During federal and state budget/appropriations processes (February-September at federal level; varies by state)
- When mental health legislation is introduced or scheduled for committee hearings (track at congress.gov)
- After high-profile incidents involving untreated SMI (frame as system failure, not individual failure)
- During Mental Health Awareness Month (May) and Schizophrenia Awareness Day (May 24)
- When your state legislature considers changes to civil commitment, AOT, or mental health funding

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Invest in Treatment for Serious Mental Illness

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge your support for
increased investment in treatment and services for people with serious mental
illness. An estimated 14.1 million Americans live with serious mental illness,
yet 34.6% receive no treatment at all. The consequences are devastating:
people with SMI die 10 to 25 years earlier than the general population, and
approximately 383,000 people with SMI are in our jails on any given day.

I specifically urge you to support:
- Full funding of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at $3 billion annually
- National expansion of Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs)
- Reform of the Medicaid IMD exclusion to allow treatment in psychiatric
  facilities
- Expansion of first-episode psychosis early intervention programs

Investment in treatment is not just humane -- it saves money. Every $1 invested
in assisted outpatient treatment saves $1.81 in reduced hospitalization and
incarceration. Permanent supportive housing costs $20,000-25,000 per year
compared to $40,000+ for jail.

[Optional: Include personal connection -- family member, professional
experience, or community impact.]

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling to
urge [Representative/Senator] [Last Name] to support full funding for the
988 crisis system and expansion of community behavioral health clinics for
people with serious mental illness. 14.1 million Americans have serious mental
illness, and nearly 5 million receive no treatment. I'd like the
[Representative/Senator] to prioritize mental health funding in the upcoming
appropriations process. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Expansion Act**: Expands the CCBHC model to all 50 states with permanent Medicaid funding. Contact members of the Senate HELP Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
- **988 Reauthorization and Full Funding**: Ensure sustained funding for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline beyond initial authorizations. Contact your appropriations subcommittee members.
- **Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act (reintroduction)**: Bipartisan legislation strengthening AOT, reforming the IMD exclusion, and expanding the psychiatric workforce. The original 2016 version became the 21st Century Cures Act; a strengthened version is needed.
- **State-level AOT implementation funding**: If you are in Connecticut, Maryland, or Massachusetts (states without AOT laws), contact state legislators to enact AOT legislation. In all other states, advocate for funded AOT programs with robust services.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your plan to address the 383,000 people with serious mental illness who are in jails on any given day rather than in treatment?"
2. "Do you support full federal funding for the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline and mobile crisis teams in every county?"
3. "What is your position on reforming the Medicaid IMD exclusion to allow treatment in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds?"
4. "Do you support expanding Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) as a permanent Medicaid benefit?"
5. "How will you address the psychiatric workforce shortage -- 60% of U.S. counties have no practicing psychiatrist?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who distinguish between "mental health" broadly and "serious mental illness" specifically -- SMI policy requires different solutions than general mental wellness
- Identify candidates who serve on key committees: Senate HELP Committee, House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Appropriations subcommittees for Labor-HHS-Education
- Support candidates who acknowledge the role of anosognosia and the need for involuntary treatment pathways alongside voluntary services

## Professional Actions

- **For Healthcare Providers**: Advocate within your institution for clozapine prescribing protocols and training. If you are a psychiatrist, consider becoming a clozapine prescriber -- the medication is dramatically underutilized (only ~4% of schizophrenia patients receive it). Support integrated behavioral-physical health care models.
- **For Law Enforcement**: Advocate for Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training in your department. Support 988-911 co-response programs. Collect and share data on the volume of psychiatric crisis calls your department handles to demonstrate the need for crisis system investment.
- **For Social Workers and Case Managers**: Advocate for CCBHC standards and adequate reimbursement rates in your community mental health center. Push for evidence-based practices including Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) and Forensic ACT teams.
- **For Attorneys**: Volunteer with legal aid organizations representing people in civil commitment and AOT proceedings. Advocate for due process protections and access to counsel in your state's mental health courts.
- **For Educators**: Learn to recognize early signs of psychosis in students (typically emerges ages 16-25). Develop referral pathways to local first-episode psychosis programs (CSC teams). Advocate for school-based mental health services.
- **For Employers**: Implement supportive employment programs for people with SMI. The Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model achieves 50-60% competitive employment rates for people with schizophrenia.
- **For Researchers**: Prioritize implementation science -- how to translate evidence-based practices into routine clinical settings. Study racial and ethnic disparities in SMI diagnosis and treatment. Evaluate state-level variation in AOT implementation and outcomes.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing serious mental illness policy with others, emphasize:

1. **The treatment gap is lethal**: 14.1 million Americans have SMI, but 4.9 million receive no treatment. People with SMI die 10 to 25 years earlier than the general population, primarily from treatable medical conditions (NASMHPD, 2023).
2. **Jails have replaced hospitals**: Approximately 383,000 people with SMI are in jails on any given day -- 10 times the number in state psychiatric hospitals. This is inhumane and far more expensive than treatment (Treatment Advocacy Center, 2022).
3. **Treatment works and saves money**: Assisted outpatient treatment reduces hospitalization by 77%, arrest by 83%, and homelessness by 74%. Every $1 invested saves $1.81 in reduced emergency and incarceration costs (NYS OMH, 2023; Swanson et al., 2013).
4. **We underuse our best medications**: Clozapine, the only drug proven to reduce suicide in schizophrenia, is used for only ~4% of U.S. patients -- compared to 20-30% in Finland, Australia, and New Zealand. Increasing use to 15% could prevent 3,800 suicides and 91,000 hospitalizations over 10 years (Stroup et al., AJP, 2023).
5. **Housing is healthcare**: Permanent supportive housing costs $20,000-25,000 per year and achieves 85% housing retention -- compared to $40,000+ for jail and $100,000+ for state hospitalization (CSH, 2023).

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "People with schizophrenia are violent and dangerous" | People with SMI are 11 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators. Untreated SMI accounts for only 3-5% of violent crime. | Desmarais et al., AJPH, 2014; Swanson et al., 2015 |
| "If someone with mental illness wanted help, they would seek it" | 40-50% of people with schizophrenia experience anosognosia -- a neurological symptom that impairs awareness of illness. They literally cannot recognize they are sick. | Amador, 2022 |
| "We closed the asylums, so the problem is solved" | State psychiatric hospitals went from 559,000 patients (1955) to 37,000 (2016). The community care that was supposed to replace them was never built at scale. | Treatment Advocacy Center, 2020 |
| "Mental health treatment is too expensive" | The cost of NOT treating SMI -- emergency rooms, jails, shelters, lost productivity -- exceeds $200 billion annually. Treatment is the cost-effective option. | SAMHSA, 2023; Insel, 2022 |
| "Assisted outpatient treatment is forced medication" | AOT is a court-ordered treatment plan, not forced injection. Non-compliance typically leads to evaluation, not jail. AOT includes due process protections including judicial hearings and legal representation. | Swartz et al., 2022 |
