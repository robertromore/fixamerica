# Serious Mental Illness

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of serious mental illness (SMI) policy in the United States, encompassing schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, severe major depression, and related conditions that substantially impair daily functioning.

## Overview

Approximately 14.1 million adults in the United States live with a serious mental illness, yet fewer than two-thirds receive any mental health treatment in a given year. The consequences of this treatment gap are devastating: people with SMI die 10 to 25 years earlier than the general population, experience homelessness at rates 5 to 10 times higher, and are disproportionately funneled into the criminal justice system rather than receiving appropriate clinical care. The deinstitutionalization movement that emptied state psychiatric hospitals beginning in the 1960s was never matched by the community-based treatment infrastructure it promised, leaving millions caught between systems that cannot or will not serve them.

This analysis examines the full landscape of SMI policy, from the underutilization of proven treatments such as clozapine and long-acting injectable antipsychotics to the structural barriers created by fragmented funding, workforce shortages, and the persistent challenge of anosognosia (impaired illness awareness). It explores the roles of SAMHSA, CMS, state mental health authorities, and the criminal justice system, and proposes evidence-based solutions grounded in supported employment, supported housing, coordinated specialty care, and civil commitment reform.

The analysis addresses the fundamental tension between individual autonomy and the duty to provide care to people who, by the nature of their illness, may not recognize their need for treatment. It also examines the enormous burden placed on families who serve as de facto caregivers without adequate support, training, or respite.
