# Primary Care and Mental Health Integration: Overview

## Overview

The integration of mental health services into primary care is widely recognized as the single most effective strategy for closing the behavioral health treatment gap in the United States. More than half of all mental health care is already delivered in primary care settings, yet the vast majority of primary care practices lack the infrastructure, workforce, and payment support needed to deliver evidence-based behavioral health treatment. The result is a system where the most common entry point for mental health care is also the least equipped to provide it.

The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM), developed at the University of Washington AIMS Center and validated in over 90 randomized controlled trials, has demonstrated consistent improvements in depression, anxiety, and substance use outcomes when compared to referral-based care. CoCM embeds a behavioral health care manager and consulting psychiatrist within the primary care team, using measurement-based treatment-to-target protocols. Medicare established dedicated CoCM billing codes (CPT 99492-99494) in January 2017, and commercial payers have followed. Yet adoption remains strikingly low: fewer than 3% of primary care practices bill CoCM codes, and fewer than 15% of Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) operate fully integrated models.

The gap between evidence and practice is driven by intersecting structural failures: fragmented payment systems that reimburse procedures rather than population health management, a behavioral health workforce that is too small and too siloed, electronic health record systems that do not support team-based care, and a medical culture that still treats mental health as separate from physical health. At the same time, the demand for integrated care is accelerating. The COVID-19 pandemic increased depression prevalence by over 25% (WHO, 2022), the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force expanded recommended screening to include anxiety in all adults (2023), and the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline has underscored the need for upstream, primary-care-based interventions.

The fundamental tension in this policy area is between the strong evidence base for integration and the structural incentives that reward the status quo. Closing this gap requires coordinated action across payment, workforce, technology, and organizational culture, making it a complex but achievable transformation.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of primary care and mental health integration:

- **Collaborative Care Model (CoCM)**: Structure, evidence base, billing codes (CPT 99492-99494), and adoption barriers for the most-studied integration model
- **Screening and Measurement-Based Care**: PHQ-9, GAD-7, and other validated instruments; USPSTF screening recommendations; treatment-to-target protocols
- **Workforce and Co-Location**: Behavioral health consultants, psychiatric consultants, care managers, and the training pipeline for integrated care
- **Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs)**: Integration progress in safety-net settings, SAMHSA-HRSA Center for Integrated Health Solutions, and health center expansion
- **Payment and Financing**: CoCM billing codes, value-based payment models, Medicaid integration incentives, and commercial payer adoption
- **Technology-Enabled Integration**: Project ECHO, telepsychiatry consultation, shared electronic health records, and digital behavioral health tools

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Primary care visits involving behavioral health component | 70% | Kathol et al., *General Hospital Psychiatry*, 2010 |
| Adults with mental illness receiving no treatment | 57.8% (28.3 million) | SAMHSA, NSDUH, 2022 |
| Randomized controlled trials supporting CoCM | Over 90 | University of Washington AIMS Center, 2024 |
| Primary care practices billing CoCM codes | Fewer than 3% | Psychiatry and Behavioral Health Learning Network, 2023 |
| FQHCs with integrated behavioral health services | 78% (some level); fewer than 15% fully integrated | HRSA UDS Data, 2023 |
| Medicare CoCM billing codes | CPT 99492, 99493, 99494 | CMS, effective January 2017 |
| USPSTF depression screening recommendation | Grade B (all adults 19+) | USPSTF, 2016; reaffirmed 2023 |
| USPSTF anxiety screening recommendation | Grade B (all adults under 65) | USPSTF, 2023 |
| Designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas | 6,585 (as of Q3 2024) | HRSA Data Warehouse, 2024 |
| Depression remission improvement with CoCM vs. usual care | 2x more likely to achieve remission | Archer et al., *Cochrane Review*, 2012 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Evidence vs. Adoption**: CoCM has the strongest evidence base of any behavioral health delivery model, yet fewer than 3% of practices use it. The gap between what works and what is implemented reveals deep structural barriers that evidence alone cannot overcome.
- **Fee-for-Service vs. Population Health**: CoCM is designed around caseload management, registries, and treatment-to-target, which are poorly suited to fee-for-service billing. Yet value-based payment models that would better support integration remain adopted by a minority of payers.
- **Specialization vs. Integration**: Many psychiatrists and psychologists have built practices around specialty referral models. Integration shifts demand toward consultative roles that require different skills and offer different economics, creating professional resistance.
- **Universal Screening vs. Capacity**: USPSTF recommends screening all adults for depression and anxiety, but most practices cannot deliver adequate treatment for the patients who screen positive. Screening without treatment capacity creates ethical and clinical risks.
- **Safety Net vs. Commercial Sector**: FQHCs have led integration efforts due to their community health orientation, but the commercial sector serves the majority of patients. Scaling integration requires reaching private practices and health systems, not just safety-net providers.
- **Workforce Supply vs. Demand**: Expanding integration increases demand for behavioral health care managers and psychiatric consultants precisely at a time when the behavioral health workforce faces severe shortages, with 160 million Americans living in designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HRSA, 2024).

## Key Questions

1. How can payment systems be reformed to incentivize population-based, team-based behavioral health care rather than episodic, procedure-based billing?
2. What workforce strategies can produce enough behavioral health care managers, consultants, and primary care clinicians trained in mental health to enable national-scale integration?
3. How should integration be adapted for diverse practice settings, including rural clinics, solo practices, and large health systems?
4. What role should technology, including telepsychiatry, digital therapeutics, and shared EHRs, play in bridging workforce gaps and enabling integration at scale?

## Vision of Success

A successful primary care and mental health integration system would feature:

- **Universal Screening**: Every adult and child visiting a primary care provider receives validated behavioral health screening (PHQ-9, GAD-7) as a standard vital sign, with systems in place to act on positive results
- **Embedded Behavioral Health Teams**: Every primary care practice has access to behavioral health care managers and psychiatric consultants, either on-site or through telehealth-enabled consultation models such as Project ECHO
- **Measurement-Based Treatment-to-Target**: All integrated practices use patient registries and standardized outcome measures to track clinical improvement and adjust treatment proactively, achieving depression remission rates above 50%
- **Aligned Payment**: Payers reimburse population-based caseload management, not just face-to-face encounters, through CoCM codes, value-based contracts, or capitated behavioral health carve-ins
- **Equity in Access**: Integration reaches FQHCs, rural health clinics, tribal health facilities, and small practices, not just large academic health systems, eliminating geographic and demographic disparities in behavioral health access
