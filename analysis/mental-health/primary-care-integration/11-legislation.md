# Primary Care and Mental Health Integration: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to primary care behavioral health integration requires coordinated action at federal and state levels to address the four interdependent barriers identified in this analysis: payment misalignment, workforce shortages, technology gaps, and organizational fragmentation. No single bill can accomplish this transformation. The strategy employs a comprehensive federal act establishing mandates and funding, supported by state model legislation for Medicaid implementation and regulatory action by CMS, HRSA, ONC, and SAMHSA.

The approach is incremental in structure but transformative in ambition. Federal legislation provides the mandate and funding; state legislation implements within Medicaid programs; and regulatory action fills gaps that do not require statutory change. Constitutional authority rests primarily on the Spending Clause (conditioning federal healthcare funding on integration requirements) and the Commerce Clause (regulating insurance coverage), both of which have well-established precedent in healthcare law.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for this reform.* The proposed legislation operates within existing Congressional authority under the Spending Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1) for conditions on federal healthcare funding, and the Commerce Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 3) for insurance coverage mandates. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (2008) and the Affordable Care Act (2010) provide direct precedent for federal mandates on behavioral health coverage.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish universal coverage for collaborative care model services,
create a behavioral health care manager workforce pipeline, mandate
integration of behavioral health into federally qualified health
centers, and incentivize state Medicaid behavioral health integration,
and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Primary Care Behavioral Health
Integration Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to SAMHSA's National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(2022), 57.8 percent of adults with mental illness in the United
States (28.3 million people) received no mental health treatment.

(2) The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) has been validated in over
90 randomized controlled trials and has been shown to double
depression remission rates compared to usual care (University of
Washington AIMS Center, 2024).

(3) Fewer than 3 percent of primary care practices in the United
States bill CoCM codes despite overwhelming evidence of efficacy
and cost-effectiveness (Psychiatry and Behavioral Health Learning
Network, 2023).

(4) Only 22 State Medicaid programs reimburse CoCM codes, leaving
the most vulnerable populations without access to evidence-based
integrated behavioral health care (Milliman/APA analysis, 2023).

(5) 160 million Americans live in designated Mental Health
Professional Shortage Areas, and 6,585 such areas have been
designated nationally, with only 27.8 percent of the need being
met (HRSA, 2024).

(6) FQHCs serve 30,500,000 patients nationally, with 78 percent
offering some behavioral health services but fewer than 15 percent
achieving full integration (HRSA UDS, 2023; NACHC, 2023).

(7) Studies demonstrate CoCM reduces total healthcare costs by an
average of $3,363 per patient over four years through decreased
emergency department use, hospitalization, and disability (Unutzer
et al., American Journal of Managed Care, 2016).

(8) Untreated mental illness costs the United States economy an
estimated $280,000,000,000 annually in lost productivity, disability,
and excess medical spending (Insel, JAMA Psychiatry, 2022).

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the Congressional record with specific, current data justifying action: the 57.8% treatment gap, over 90 RCTs supporting CoCM, fewer than 3% adoption, and $280 billion annual cost of untreated mental illness. These findings support the exercise of Spending and Commerce Clause authority.
- **Section 4 (Medicaid CoCM Coverage)**: The core coverage mandate. Adds CoCM services to the Medicaid mandatory benefits list, sets a minimum reimbursement floor at 80% of Medicare rates, and prohibits prior authorization. This ensures that all Medicaid beneficiaries in all states have access to integrated care.
- **Section 5 (BHCM Corps)**: Creates the workforce pipeline. Establishes national certification standards, funds 200 training programs, and deploys 10,000 BHCMs with NHSC-style loan repayment targeting shortage areas and FQHCs.
- **Section 6 (FQHC Integration)**: Requires the nation's safety-net health centers to achieve full integration. Phased compliance (3 years for large, 5 years for small) with $3 billion in supplemental funding to prevent unfunded mandates.
- **Section 7 (Enhanced FMAP)**: Incentivizes states to eliminate behavioral health carve-outs. The 10 percentage point FMAP increase for 5 years provides a significant financial incentive for state Medicaid agencies to transition.
- **Section 13 (Appropriations)**: $16 billion over 10 years, declining over time as sustainable payment models replace start-up grants. Partially offset by $8-12 billion in estimated reductions in ED use, hospitalization, and disability attributable to integration.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 90 days after enactment | N/A |
| BHCM certification standards published | 12 months after enactment | HRSA/SAMHSA |
| ONC proposed rule for EHR standards | 12 months after enactment | ONC |
| First BHCM training grants awarded | 18 months after enactment | HRSA |
| Medicaid CoCM coverage compliance deadline | 24 months after enactment | State Medicaid agencies |
| ONC final rule for EHR standards | 24 months after enactment | ONC |
| Large FQHCs at Level 5-6 integration | 3 years after enactment | HRSA/FQHCs |
| All psychiatric access programs operational (50 states) | 5 years after enactment | HRSA/States |
| All FQHCs at Level 5-6 integration | 5 years after enactment | HRSA/FQHCs |
| EHR vendor compliance with integration standards | 4 years after enactment | ONC/EHR vendors |
| 10,000 BHCMs deployed | 7 years after enactment | HRSA (BHCM Corps) |
| GAO final evaluation | 10 years after enactment | GAO |

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS administers the Medicaid coverage mandate and enhanced FMAP. HRSA administers the BHCM Corps, FQHC integration requirements, psychiatric access programs, and Project ECHO expansion. SAMHSA co-develops BHCM certification standards and provides integration technical assistance through CIHS. ONC implements EHR certification updates. AHRQ conducts evaluation research.

**Challenges**:

- **State fiscal concerns**: Medicaid CoCM mandate increases state spending, mitigated by minimum reimbursement floors set at 80% of Medicare (lower than full Medicare parity) and enhanced FMAP for carve-in states
- **Workforce ramp-up timing**: BHCM Corps cannot produce certified workers immediately; phased deployment timeline and interim telehealth provisions address the gap
- **EHR vendor compliance**: Major vendors (Epic, Cerner/Oracle) may resist certification changes; 24-month compliance timeline and existing 21st Century Cures Act authority provide leverage

**Refinements**:

- **Graduated reimbursement floors**: Start at 70% of Medicare in Year 1, increasing to 80% by Year 3, to ease state budget transition
- **Telehealth BHCM flexibility**: Allow BHCMs to serve multiple practices remotely during workforce ramp-up, with site-based deployment required as supply increases
- **Small FQHC exemption path**: Allow FQHCs under 5,000 patients to meet integration requirements through hub-and-spoke telehealth models rather than on-site staffing

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Behavioral Health Integration Act

**Purpose**: Enable state-level implementation of CoCM coverage, behavioral health integration standards, and workforce development for states seeking to advance integration beyond the federal minimum.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize based on their existing Medicaid structure (fee-for-service vs. managed care dominant), current scope-of-practice laws, existing behavioral health workforce capacity, and geographic characteristics (rural vs. urban balance). States with existing CoCM Medicaid coverage should focus on rate adequacy, carve-in transition, and workforce sections.

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Health and Human Services (CMS, HRSA, SAMHSA, ONC jointly)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **CMS Medicaid CoCM Coverage Rule**: Must define covered services, establish minimum reimbursement methodology, and specify state compliance requirements. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment. Must include guidance on integration with existing Medicaid managed care contracts and fee-for-service programs.
2. **HRSA BHCM Certification Standards**: Must establish educational requirements, clinical competencies, supervised practicum requirements, and continuing education standards. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment. Must be developed in collaboration with SAMHSA and professional associations (NASW, ANA, NBCC).
3. **HRSA FQHC Integration Standards**: Must define Level 5-6 integration criteria for Section 330 compliance, establish reporting requirements, and specify supplemental grant administration. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.
4. **ONC EHR Certification Update**: Must specify behavioral health screening tools, registry functionality, shared care plan modules, and billing automation requirements for certified EHR technology. Statutory deadline: 24 months after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties (State Medicaid non-compliance)**: CMS may withhold a portion of federal Medicaid matching funds for states that fail to implement CoCM coverage within the required timeline, consistent with existing Medicaid compliance enforcement
- **Administrative Actions (FQHC non-compliance)**: HRSA may condition Section 330 grant renewal on integration compliance, with phased enforcement beginning with technical assistance and escalating to grant reduction for persistent non-compliance
- **Private Right of Action**: Medicaid beneficiaries denied CoCM services may seek enforcement through existing Medicaid fair hearing processes and, where applicable, Section 1983 claims for violations of mandatory coverage provisions
- **Commercial Payer Enforcement (State level)**: State insurance commissioners enforce commercial coverage mandates through examination, complaint investigation, and civil penalty authority

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: The Medicaid CoCM coverage mandate and FQHC integration requirement condition federal healthcare funding on integration compliance. This is well within Spending Clause precedent, as established in *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987) (conditions must be related to federal interest in funded program). The requirement is directly related to Medicaid's purpose of providing adequate healthcare and imposes conditions on existing healthcare funding programs.

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Commercial payer CoCM coverage mandates rely on Commerce Clause authority over the insurance industry, as exercised in the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (2008) and ACA essential health benefits requirements. Self-insured ERISA plans present a preemption challenge (see below) but can be addressed through Department of Labor rulemaking.

**NFIB v. Sebelius Considerations**: The Supreme Court's 2012 ruling limiting Medicaid expansion as coercive does not apply here because the CoCM coverage mandate is an incremental adjustment to existing Medicaid benefits, not a fundamental restructuring of the program. The financial impact on states is modest relative to total Medicaid spending, and the enhanced FMAP mitigates fiscal impact.

### Preemption

**ERISA Preemption**: The Employee Retirement Income Security Act preempts state regulation of self-insured employer health plans. The commercial coverage mandate in the state model legislation applies only to fully insured plans regulated by state insurance commissioners. Federal legislation would be needed to extend CoCM coverage mandates to self-insured ERISA plans, which cover approximately 65% of employer-sponsored enrollees (KFF, 2023). The federal bill should include a provision directing the Department of Labor to issue guidance requiring CoCM coverage in ERISA-governed plans.

**Federal-State Relationship**: The federal Medicaid mandate sets a floor, not a ceiling. States remain free to set higher reimbursement rates, broader provider eligibility, and more expansive integration requirements. The state model legislation is designed to complement, not conflict with, federal requirements.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance monitoring uses a three-tier structure: (1) annual reporting requirements that generate public accountability data; (2) administrative enforcement through existing federal agency authority (CMS for Medicaid, HRSA for FQHCs, ONC for EHR vendors); and (3) individual enforcement through Medicaid fair hearing rights and potential judicial review. The combination ensures multiple enforcement pathways without creating excessive litigation risk.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Rate floor gaming | States could set CoCM rates at exactly 80% of Medicare while adding administrative burdens (complex credentialing, documentation requirements) that effectively discourage utilization | High | Add anti-circumvention clause: "States shall not impose administrative requirements on CoCM services that are more burdensome than requirements for comparable primary care services" |
| FQHC "paper integration" | FQHCs could claim Level 5-6 compliance by hiring staff without implementing population-based registries, measurement-based care, or team-based workflows | High | Require HRSA site visit verification using standardized integration assessment tool (e.g., DAIS or PSYCH-K); include registry utilization and screening rate data in UDS reporting as compliance metrics |
| Carve-in without integration quality | States could technically eliminate carve-outs to receive enhanced FMAP while not requiring managed care organizations to implement meaningful integration | Medium | Condition enhanced FMAP on state submission of managed care contract provisions demonstrating integration quality metrics, CoCM coverage, and behavioral health network adequacy standards |
| EHR minimal compliance | Vendors could implement minimal behavioral health features that technically satisfy certification criteria but are impractical for clinical use | Medium | ONC should develop functional testing scenarios (not just feature checklists) as part of certification, including workflow testing with practicing clinicians |
| Self-insured plan exemption | Self-insured ERISA plans could decline to cover CoCM, creating a coverage gap for approximately 65% of employer-sponsored enrollees | High | Include explicit ERISA provision directing Department of Labor to issue rules requiring CoCM coverage in self-insured plans within 24 months; alternatively, amend Section 712 of ERISA to include CoCM as a mandated benefit |
| Telehealth-only BHCM deployment | The BHCM Corps could deploy care managers primarily in telehealth-only arrangements, satisfying headcount targets without building local, community-embedded capacity | Medium | Require that at least 60% of BHCM Corps placements in Years 1-5 are in-person or hybrid (minimum 50% on-site), transitioning to flexibility once local capacity is established |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| BHCM Corps ramp-up delay | No new BHCMs available for 18-24 months after enactment; practices face coverage mandate before workforce is ready | Training program development takes time; cannot deploy workers before they are certified | Include interim telehealth consultation provisions; allow practices to bill CoCM with existing staff during transition period; accelerated 12-month pathways for experienced professionals |
| Rural broadband gaps | Telehealth-dependent integration models cannot function in areas without adequate internet infrastructure | Federal broadband investment (IIJA, 2021) is ongoing but incomplete | Allow asynchronous store-and-forward consultation for psychiatric access programs in areas without broadband; coordinate with USDA Rural Utilities Service for priority broadband deployment to health facilities |
| Small practice viability | Solo and small-group primary care practices (under 5 providers) may not generate sufficient CoCM volume to support a full-time BHCM | Fixed costs of integration infrastructure are not easily distributed across small patient panels | Allow shared BHCM arrangements across multiple small practices; create regional BHCM hub models; provide enhanced CoCM rates for practices under 5 providers to offset volume disadvantage |
| Mental Health Parity enforcement gap | Even with CoCM mandates, parity violations (discriminatory prior auth, restrictive utilization management) may undermine access to integrated services | Parity enforcement has historically been under-resourced at both federal and state levels | Strengthen parity compliance reporting requirements; include behavioral health integration access metrics in annual parity compliance submissions; fund state parity enforcement capacity |
| Scope-of-practice variation | BHCM Corps members certified under federal standards may face state scope-of-practice restrictions that limit their function in some states | State-level licensing boards control professional practice scope independently of federal certification | Include federal preemption of state scope-of-practice barriers for federally certified BHCMs serving in BHCM Corps placements; model on NHSC federal practice authority provisions |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-circumvention regulation**: CMS shall publish regulations within 12 months of enactment specifying that state administrative requirements for CoCM services may not exceed those for comparable primary care evaluation and management services, and that states may not impose diagnosis-specific limitations, visit count caps, or prior authorization requirements not applied to physical health services.
2. **FQHC integration verification protocol**: HRSA shall develop and publish a standardized integration assessment tool for site-based verification of Level 5-6 compliance, including functional assessment of registry utilization, screening workflow, care manager caseload, psychiatric consultation frequency, and outcome measurement.
3. **Enhanced FMAP verification**: CMS shall condition enhanced FMAP payments on annual state submission of managed care contract extracts demonstrating CoCM coverage provisions, integration quality metric requirements, and behavioral health network adequacy standards.
4. **EHR functional testing**: ONC shall develop clinical workflow-based functional testing scenarios for EHR behavioral health integration certification, developed in consultation with practicing primary care and behavioral health providers, and shall publish testing results for all certified products.
5. **ERISA coverage extension**: Congress should include in the Act an amendment to ERISA Section 712 explicitly requiring self-insured plans to cover CoCM services on the same terms as required for fully insured plans under state law. Alternatively, the Secretary of Labor shall issue regulatory guidance within 24 months.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The enhanced FMAP provision (Section 7) sunsets 5 years after first state utilization, requiring reauthorization for continuation. The BHCM Corps authorization (Section 5) expires after 7 years, with a required GAO evaluation at Year 5 to inform reauthorization. All other provisions are permanent but subject to the 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year GAO evaluations mandated in Section 12(c). The National Behavioral Health Integration Commission (Section 11) is required to conduct a midpoint review at Year 5 and submit reauthorization recommendations to Congress.
