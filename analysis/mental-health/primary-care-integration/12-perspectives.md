# Primary Care and Mental Health Integration: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the integration of behavioral health into primary care through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

Integrating mental health into primary care raises fundamental questions about the appropriate role of government in healthcare delivery, the balance between evidence-based mandates and market-driven adoption, the tension between federal standards and state autonomy, and whether healthcare is a right that demands public investment or a service best delivered through private initiative. These questions cut across partisan lines in unusual ways: both progressive and rural conservative constituencies have strong interests in integration, while both libertarian and some progressive voices raise concerns about standardization and the role of pharmaceutical treatment.

Different political traditions offer distinct visions for how to approach primary care behavioral health integration. This analysis examines the issue through nine distinct political perspectives, exploring how each tradition approaches the core questions and proposed solutions.

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concerns about federal overreach and cost are genuine but sometimes mask opposition to any expansion of government healthcare programs regardless of evidence |
| Principle consistency | Fiscal conservatism is applied selectively; defense spending and tax cuts are not subjected to the same cost-effectiveness scrutiny as healthcare programs |
| Goalpost stability | Positions on mental health have shifted positively in response to rural access concerns and opioid crisis, but resistance to mandates remains stable |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; willing to support voluntary programs but resist mandatory coverage expansions |

**Justification:** Conservative engagement on behavioral health integration is genuine but constrained by broader anti-government-healthcare ideology. Rural Republican members have been consistent supporters of psychiatric access programs and telehealth expansion, but the broader conservative coalition resists Medicaid mandates and new federal spending. The tension between pro-rural healthcare and anti-mandate positions creates mixed consistency.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan support for CCBHC expansion (2024) demonstrates conservative willingness to fund mental health programs when structured as grants rather than mandates
- Heritage Foundation health policy analysts have opposed Medicaid expansion while acknowledging behavioral health workforce shortages (Heritage Foundation, 2023)
- Republican rural caucus members have consistently supported telehealth flexibility and psychiatric access programs (Congressional Rural Caucus, 2022-2024)

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Accept data on treatment gap and workforce shortages; generally agree that integration is inadequate. Dispute framing that government mandates are the solution. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agree on workforce shortages, EHR barriers, and training pipeline problems. Disagree that payment mandates are the primary solution; prefer market incentives and deregulation. |

**Source references:**

- American Enterprise Institute. "Mental Health Policy: Market-Based Approaches." AEI Health Policy Series, 2023. Emphasizes deregulation and scope-of-practice reform over mandates.
- Heritage Foundation. "Federal Health Policy: Principles for Reform." 2023. Opposes Medicaid expansion mandates while supporting workforce flexibility.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Universal CoCM Payment Mandate | 3/10 | Opposes new federal mandates on Medicaid and commercial payers | Resistance to expanding government role in healthcare; concern about cost to states and businesses |
| BHCM Workforce Pipeline | 6/10 | Supports workforce expansion concept; prefers market-based training incentives | Concerns about creating another federal corps program; prefers tax credits for training |
| Statewide Psychiatric Access Programs | 7/10 | Supports telehealth expansion for rural access | Aligns with rural constituent needs; low federal footprint per state |
| Integration-Ready EHR Standards | 5/10 | Mixed; supports interoperability but resists new regulatory mandates on businesses | Concern about compliance costs for small EHR vendors and practices |
| FQHC Integration Mandate | 4/10 | Reluctantly accepts FQHC role but opposes unfunded mandates | Prefers voluntary quality improvement over compliance requirements |
| Project ECHO Expansion | 7/10 | Supports capacity building through education models | Low-cost, voluntary, knowledge-sharing model appeals to conservative principles |
| Medicaid Carve-In Incentive | 4/10 | Skeptical of enhanced FMAP as federal intrusion into state Medicaid design | States' rights concerns; worry about long-term dependency on enhanced match |
| Training Transformation Grants | 6/10 | Supports concept; prefers private sector partnerships | Concern about federal government directing medical school curricula |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act | 3/10 | Opposes comprehensive mandate approach; prefers incremental, voluntary reforms | $16 billion cost over 10 years; new Medicaid mandates; expanded federal role |
| Model State Behavioral Health Integration Act | 5/10 | Accepts state-level action over federal mandates; some support for commercial coverage requirements | Prefers state flexibility without federal floor |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would support an alternative approach emphasizing: (1) removing scope-of-practice barriers in all states to expand the eligible integration workforce without federal certification programs; (2) tax credits for practices investing in integration infrastructure rather than mandates; (3) Medicaid block grants giving states flexibility to fund integration as they see fit; (4) expanded telehealth deregulation allowing interstate psychiatric consultation without state-by-state licensure; and (5) voluntary CMS Innovation Center models testing integration payment approaches without mandating coverage.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on deregulation and scope-of-practice reform); Populist (on rural access); Centrist (on evidence-based voluntary programs)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on telehealth expansion and FQHC support with modified mandate structure); Religious Right (on mental health as family/community issue)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive and Democratic Socialist (on Medicaid mandates and federal spending levels)

---

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to healthcare access expansion; occasionally prioritize incremental wins over structural reform |
| Principle consistency | Consistently supports government role in healthcare access; may accept compromise positions that fall short of stated goals |
| Goalpost stability | Stable support for integration mandates and funding; willing to negotiate on implementation details |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; generally seeks inclusive coalitions and bipartisan compromise on mental health issues |

**Justification:** Liberals have been the most consistent legislative champions of behavioral health integration, supporting CoCM billing codes, CCBHC expansion, and parity enforcement. Their positions align well with stated principles of healthcare access and evidence-based policy. Minor inconsistency arises from willingness to accept incremental measures that may not address structural barriers fully.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic congressional members sponsored the CCBHC expansion and have introduced CoCM Medicaid coverage bills in multiple sessions (2019-2024)
- Biden Administration launched the Making Care Primary model with explicit behavioral health integration track (CMS, 2024)
- Center for American Progress published detailed integration policy blueprint supporting federal mandates (CAP, 2023)

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with data on treatment gap, workforce shortages, and payment barriers. Would emphasize equity and racial disparities more prominently. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree with structural analysis of payment misalignment, workforce shortages, and cultural barriers. Would add more emphasis on insurance industry profit motives. |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress. "A Blueprint for Behavioral Health Integration in Primary Care." 2023. Comprehensive policy proposal aligning closely with this analysis.
- Brookings Institution. "Closing the Mental Health Treatment Gap." 2023. Evidence-based analysis supporting federal integration mandates.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Universal CoCM Payment Mandate | 9/10 | Strongly supports; would make CoCM an essential health benefit | May prefer even stronger mandate with parity enforcement linkage |
| BHCM Workforce Pipeline | 9/10 | Strongly supports new federal workforce program | Would prefer larger scale and higher loan repayment amounts |
| Statewide Psychiatric Access Programs | 8/10 | Supports; would link to Medicaid expansion | Concerned about sustainability in non-expansion states |
| Integration-Ready EHR Standards | 8/10 | Supports regulatory mandates on technology | Wants stronger interoperability requirements across systems |
| FQHC Integration Mandate | 9/10 | Strongly supports; FQHCs are priority investment | Wants adequate funding to prevent unfunded mandate |
| Project ECHO Expansion | 8/10 | Supports capacity building; values education model | Wants equity requirements in hub selection |
| Medicaid Carve-In Incentive | 8/10 | Supports; aligns with healthcare coordination goals | Concerned about MBHO job losses; wants transition protections |
| Training Transformation Grants | 9/10 | Strongly supports; sees workforce transformation as essential | Would add diversity pipeline requirements |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act | 8/10 | Strong support; would strengthen in several areas | Wants higher Medicaid rate floor (90% vs 80%), stronger parity linkage, and explicit equity provisions |
| Model State Behavioral Health Integration Act | 8/10 | Supports; useful for progressive states to go beyond federal floor | Would add anti-discrimination provisions |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would strengthen the proposed legislation by: (1) raising the Medicaid CoCM rate floor to 90% of Medicare; (2) adding explicit health equity provisions requiring integration funding allocation proportional to disparities data; (3) linking CoCM coverage to Mental Health Parity enforcement with joint compliance reporting; (4) adding workforce diversity requirements to BHCM Corps training programs; and (5) requiring commercial payers to cover CoCM without any cost-sharing.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on federal mandates and funding); Democratic Socialist (on universal program approach); Centrist (on evidence-based policy)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on rural access and telehealth); Populist (on anti-insurance-industry framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on mandate approach); Constitutionalist (on federal authority)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to structural reform and healthcare as a right; integration is viewed as necessary but insufficient without single-payer |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies principles of universal access and structural change; occasionally views incremental reforms with suspicion |
| Goalpost stability | Stable commitment to universal behavioral health access; may push for broader reforms that delay achievable integration progress |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; willing to support integration reforms as stepping stones even if single-payer is the ultimate goal |

**Justification:** Progressives are principled advocates for universal behavioral health access and view integration as a component of broader systemic transformation. Their consistency is high on principles but occasionally compromised by strategic tension between supporting achievable reforms and holding out for more fundamental change.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus has consistently supported mental health funding increases and parity enforcement (2020-2024)
- Sanders/Jayapal Medicare for All proposals include fully integrated behavioral health as a covered benefit
- Economic Policy Institute analysis supports integration as a workforce and equity issue (EPI, 2023)

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with treatment gap data and structural failure analysis. Would frame more explicitly in terms of class and racial inequality. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | High agreement; would place greater emphasis on profit motives of insurance and pharmaceutical industries as root causes. |

**Source references:**

- Economic Policy Institute. "The Behavioral Health Workforce Crisis: Structural Causes and Structural Solutions." 2023. Emphasizes labor market and training pipeline failures.
- Congressional Progressive Caucus. "Mental Health Platform." 2024. Calls for universal behavioral health access through public investment.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Universal CoCM Payment Mandate | 8/10 | Supports but views as insufficient without single-payer reform | Multi-payer system perpetuates fragmentation; CoCM mandate is a patch, not a cure |
| BHCM Workforce Pipeline | 9/10 | Strongly supports public workforce investment | Would pay BHCMs higher wages and provide full student debt cancellation |
| Statewide Psychiatric Access Programs | 8/10 | Supports public consultation infrastructure | Prefers fully public system over grant-funded programs dependent on reauthorization |
| Integration-Ready EHR Standards | 7/10 | Supports; skeptical of reliance on private EHR vendors | Would prefer public EHR option or open-source mandate |
| FQHC Integration Mandate | 9/10 | Strongly supports FQHC investment as public health infrastructure | Would double funding levels |
| Project ECHO Expansion | 8/10 | Supports knowledge democratization model | Values the de-specialization and community empowerment aspects |
| Medicaid Carve-In Incentive | 7/10 | Supports eliminating carve-outs; skeptical of managed care generally | Would prefer public Medicaid managed care rather than private MCO contracts |
| Training Transformation Grants | 9/10 | Strongly supports transforming medical education | Would add community health worker pathway and reduce medical school debt as integration incentives |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act | 7/10 | Supports as necessary step; wants significantly larger appropriations | $16 billion over 10 years viewed as inadequate; should be $30+ billion with permanent BHCM funding |
| Model State Behavioral Health Integration Act | 7/10 | Supports; would add Medicaid-for-All option | State-level approach seen as inadequate without federal structural change |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would augment the proposed reforms by: (1) doubling authorized appropriations to $30+ billion; (2) making BHCM Corps permanent with full student debt cancellation; (3) including community health workers as a recognized integration workforce role; (4) requiring non-profit or public managed care organizations for Medicaid integration; and (5) treating integration as a component of Medicare for All, where single-payer financing eliminates fragmentation.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist (on public investment and universal programs); Liberal (on mandate approach and funding)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-insurance-company framing and rural access); Centrist (on evidence-based approach)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on federal spending levels); Libertarian (on mandate approach); Constitutionalist (on federal authority)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine principled opposition to government mandates in healthcare; not driven by industry lobbying |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies anti-mandate, pro-market principles across policy areas; does not selectively exempt healthcare |
| Goalpost stability | Stable opposition to coverage mandates and new federal programs; consistent support for deregulation |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; willing to support deregulatory reforms that advance integration without mandates |

**Justification:** Libertarians apply consistent anti-mandate, pro-market principles to behavioral health integration. Their opposition is principled rather than industry-driven, which makes their positions predictable. They are reliable coalition partners on deregulatory reforms (scope-of-practice, telehealth, licensing) even while opposing the mandate-based approach.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute has published analyses supporting scope-of-practice reform and telehealth deregulation while opposing healthcare mandates (Cato, 2022-2024)
- Libertarian Party platform consistently opposes government-mandated healthcare coverage
- Reason Foundation supports market-based mental health solutions including direct primary care models with integrated behavioral health

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Accept data on treatment gap and workforce shortages but attribute these to government regulation (licensing barriers, EHR mandates, insurance regulation) rather than insufficient government action. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agree on workforce maldistribution and EHR barriers but attribute root cause to excessive regulation, not insufficient mandates. View payment fragmentation as caused by government programs (Medicare, Medicaid) distorting the market. |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute. "Reforming Occupational Licensing in Healthcare." 2023. Argues licensing barriers are the primary obstacle to behavioral health access.
- Reason Foundation. "Market Solutions for Mental Health Access." 2022. Proposes direct primary care and deregulation as alternatives to mandates.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Universal CoCM Payment Mandate | 2/10 | Opposes; government should not mandate coverage models | Fundamental opposition to mandates; prefers voluntary market adoption |
| BHCM Workforce Pipeline | 3/10 | Opposes new federal corps; supports removing licensing barriers instead | Government workforce programs distort labor markets |
| Statewide Psychiatric Access Programs | 5/10 | Mixed; supports telehealth concept but not government program structure | Would prefer private telepsychiatry marketplace |
| Integration-Ready EHR Standards | 3/10 | Opposes; government should not dictate technology features | Regulation stifles innovation; let market determine EHR features |
| FQHC Integration Mandate | 3/10 | Opposes government-run health centers generally | FQHCs represent government healthcare that should be replaced by private alternatives |
| Project ECHO Expansion | 6/10 | Supports knowledge-sharing; skeptical of federal funding | Would prefer privately funded educational networks |
| Medicaid Carve-In Incentive | 3/10 | Opposes using federal funds to restructure state Medicaid | Enhanced FMAP is federal overreach into state program design |
| Training Transformation Grants | 4/10 | Prefers deregulation over government-directed training reform | Government should not dictate medical school curricula |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act | 2/10 | Opposes; comprehensive government mandate and spending program | $16 billion expansion of federal healthcare role; mandates on states and private businesses |
| Model State Behavioral Health Integration Act | 3/10 | Prefers state flexibility but opposes insurance mandates | State-level mandates still restrict market freedom |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would support: (1) universal scope-of-practice reform allowing any qualified professional to deliver behavioral health care in any setting without state-specific licensing barriers; (2) elimination of Certificate of Need laws restricting healthcare facility development; (3) interstate medical licensure compacts enabling telehealth across state lines; (4) direct primary care models with integrated behavioral health, exempt from insurance regulation; and (5) tax deductions for businesses that voluntarily invest in integrated care infrastructure.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on deregulation and scope-of-practice reform); Constitutionalist (on limited federal role)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on telehealth deregulation); Populist (on anti-institutional-establishment framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive and Democratic Socialist (on mandate and spending approach); Liberal (on coverage mandates)

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine concern about federal overreach into healthcare; not primarily industry-driven |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies federalism and enumerated powers principles; applies same framework to defense and healthcare |
| Goalpost stability | Stable position that healthcare is a state responsibility; willing to support state-level integration efforts |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; principled framework allows for state-level experimentation |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists apply consistent federalism principles to behavioral health integration, preferring state-level action over federal mandates. Their positions are predictable and principled. They can be coalition partners for state-level reforms and may support federal deregulatory measures that expand state flexibility.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Federalist Society publications consistently argue healthcare regulation is a state police power (Federalist Society, 2022-2024)
- Constitutional scholars associated with this perspective supported NFIB v. Sebelius limits on Medicaid coercion
- State-level constitutionalist legislators have supported state behavioral health reforms while opposing federal mandates

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Accept data on treatment gap but view federal programs as the problem, not the solution. Support state-level data and analysis. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agree workforce and technology barriers exist but attribute them to federal regulatory overreach, not insufficient federal action. View Medicaid as inherently inefficient. |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society. "Healthcare and the Constitution: Limits on Federal Power." 2023. Argues healthcare regulation exceeds enumerated federal powers.
- Pacific Legal Foundation. "Occupational Licensing and the Constitution." 2022. Challenges state licensing barriers under Due Process and Equal Protection.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Universal CoCM Payment Mandate | 2/10 | Opposes; federal government lacks authority to mandate state healthcare programs beyond conditional spending | Constitutional concern about coercive conditions on states |
| BHCM Workforce Pipeline | 4/10 | Supports concept at state level; opposes new federal corps | Federal workforce programs overstep enumerated powers |
| Statewide Psychiatric Access Programs | 6/10 | Supports state-run programs; opposes federal mandate for all states | Would prefer block grants giving states full design authority |
| Integration-Ready EHR Standards | 3/10 | Opposes federal technology mandates | Commerce Clause authority does not extend to dictating software features |
| FQHC Integration Mandate | 3/10 | Accepts FQHC federal role under Spending Clause but opposes new conditions | Views expanding Section 330 conditions as potentially coercive |
| Project ECHO Expansion | 6/10 | Supports educational programs; prefers state management | Federal funding with state implementation flexibility is acceptable |
| Medicaid Carve-In Incentive | 4/10 | Opposes; enhanced FMAP conditions are coercive under NFIB v. Sebelius reasoning | Financial incentives to restructure state programs cross constitutional lines |
| Training Transformation Grants | 5/10 | Supports educational grants; opposes ACGME mandate | Federal government should not direct accreditation standards |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act | 2/10 | Opposes; exceeds enumerated federal powers and coerces states | Federal mandates on state Medicaid programs and private businesses raise Spending Clause and Commerce Clause concerns |
| Model State Behavioral Health Integration Act | 7/10 | Supports state-level action as constitutionally appropriate | State legislation within police power is the proper venue for healthcare reform |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would support: (1) Medicaid block grants giving states full flexibility to design integrated care programs; (2) state-level integration legislation tailored to each state's needs and capacity; (3) federal deregulation removing barriers to state innovation (e.g., eliminating 42 CFR Part 2 restrictions, streamlining interstate licensure); (4) constitutional amendment clarifying healthcare as a state responsibility (aspirational); and (5) judicial challenges to coercive federal conditions on state healthcare programs.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on limited federal role); Conservative (on states' rights and fiscal restraint)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-Washington framing); Centrist (on state-level experimentation)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive and Democratic Socialist (on federal mandate approach); Liberal (on Medicaid expansion)

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine concern about rural healthcare access and working-class mental health needs; anti-elite framing sometimes masks policy confusion |
| Principle consistency | Anti-establishment rhetoric is consistent but policy positions can shift based on political dynamics and messaging |
| Goalpost stability | Support for rural mental health access is stable; positions on specific mechanisms (mandates vs. deregulation) vary |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; frames healthcare access as being taken from regular people by elites, insurers, and bureaucrats |

**Justification:** Populists have genuine and consistent concern about rural and working-class access to mental health services. However, their anti-establishment framing can lead to inconsistent policy positions: supporting government intervention to help "regular people" while opposing government programs in the abstract. This makes them valuable but sometimes unpredictable coalition partners.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Both left-populist (Sanders-aligned) and right-populist (Trump-aligned) constituencies support rural mental health funding
- Populist senators have supported CCBHC expansion and telehealth access while opposing ACA provisions
- Economic populist rhetoric about "forgotten communities" aligns with integration's rural access benefits

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Strong agreement on treatment gap and rural access failures. Frame the problem as elites and insurance companies denying care to working people. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agree that insurance companies and bureaucracy create barriers. Less interested in structural analysis; more interested in naming villains (MBHOs, big pharma, hospital administrators). |

**Source references:**

- American Compass (right-populist think tank). "Healthcare for the Common Good." 2023. Supports government investment in healthcare access for working families.
- Public polling showing 75%+ bipartisan support for expanding mental health access in rural areas (KFF Health Tracking Poll, 2023).

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Universal CoCM Payment Mandate | 6/10 | Supports making insurers cover mental health; skeptical of new bureaucracy | Framed as forcing insurers to do what's right; concern about government bureaucracy complexity |
| BHCM Workforce Pipeline | 7/10 | Supports sending mental health workers to underserved communities | Appeals to rural access and "forgotten communities" narrative |
| Statewide Psychiatric Access Programs | 8/10 | Strongly supports; direct benefit to rural constituents | High-visibility, tangible benefit for rural areas |
| Integration-Ready EHR Standards | 5/10 | Neutral; not a salient issue for populist base | Not a populist priority; too technical |
| FQHC Integration Mandate | 7/10 | Supports health center investment for working communities | FQHCs serve populist base; investment framing appeals |
| Project ECHO Expansion | 7/10 | Supports; bringing specialist knowledge to rural areas | De-centralizing expertise from elite academic centers resonates |
| Medicaid Carve-In Incentive | 5/10 | Mixed; supports fighting insurance company power but wary of government restructuring | Anti-MBHO framing appeals; government restructuring framing does not |
| Training Transformation Grants | 6/10 | Supports if framed as training workers for real communities | Prefers apprenticeship and community-based models over academic grants |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act | 5/10 | Mixed; supports intent but wary of $16 billion price tag and bureaucratic structure | Needs populist framing: "making insurance companies pay" rather than "creating government programs" |
| Model State Behavioral Health Integration Act | 6/10 | Supports state-level action; prefers local control | State legislation more accessible than federal to populist base |

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would frame integration as: (1) forcing insurance companies to cover mental health at the same level as physical health (strengthened parity enforcement with punitive damages for violations); (2) deploying mental health workers to "forgotten communities" in rural America and industrial heartland; (3) breaking up managed behavioral health organizations that profit from denying care; (4) creating community-based mental health apprenticeship programs that bypass academic gatekeeping; and (5) mandating pharmaceutical price transparency for psychiatric medications used in integrated care.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (on anti-insurance-company provisions); Progressive (on public investment in underserved areas)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on rural access); Religious Right (on community and family mental health)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on mandate approach); Constitutionalist (on federal programs)

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to evidence-based, pragmatic solutions; stated and actual motivations align |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies cost-effectiveness, evidence, and bipartisan viability criteria |
| Goalpost stability | Stable support for integration based on evidence; positions adjust with new data, not political winds |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low; actively seeks compromise and broad coalition |

**Justification:** Centrists are the most reliable coalition partners for behavioral health integration because their support is grounded in the overwhelming evidence base (over 90 RCTs) and cost-effectiveness data. Their positions are predictable, their engagement is genuine, and they actively seek bipartisan compromise. The primary limitation is that centrist emphasis on political viability can lead to proposals that are too modest to achieve transformation.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center has published detailed integration recommendations emphasizing evidence and cost savings (BPC, 2023)
- Centrist senators from both parties have co-sponsored CCBHC expansion and telehealth legislation
- Third Way has published healthcare integration analyses emphasizing cost-effectiveness and bipartisan appeal (Third Way, 2023)

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with data-driven analysis of treatment gap, adoption failure, and workforce shortages. Appreciate balanced presentation of evidence. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree with structural analysis; would emphasize lack of bipartisan political will alongside payment and workforce barriers. |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center. "Tackling America's Mental Health Crisis Through Primary Care." 2023. Evidence-based bipartisan recommendations.
- Third Way. "The Case for Behavioral Health Integration: Evidence and Cost Savings." 2023. Cost-effectiveness analysis targeting moderate lawmakers.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Universal CoCM Payment Mandate | 7/10 | Supports with phased implementation; prefers incentives before mandates | Wants to demonstrate cost savings before full mandate; concerned about political feasibility |
| BHCM Workforce Pipeline | 8/10 | Strongly supports; evidence-based workforce strategy | Wants performance metrics and accountability built in |
| Statewide Psychiatric Access Programs | 9/10 | Strongly supports; bipartisan appeal and proven track record | Ideal model: evidence-based, low controversy, bipartisan |
| Integration-Ready EHR Standards | 7/10 | Supports with adequate transition time for vendors | Wants to avoid overregulation while ensuring functionality |
| FQHC Integration Mandate | 8/10 | Supports with adequate funding and realistic timeline | Insists on avoiding unfunded mandates |

| Medicaid Carve-In Incentive | 7/10 | Supports incentive approach over mandate; values state flexibility | Prefers carrots to sticks; wants evaluation of carve-in outcomes |
| Training Transformation Grants | 8/10 | Supports evidence-based curriculum reform | Wants outcomes-based grant evaluation |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act | 7/10 | Supports core approach; would moderate some mandates | Would prefer phased mandate with incentive period first; concerned about political viability of $16 billion price tag |
| Model State Behavioral Health Integration Act | 8/10 | Supports; pragmatic state-level approach | Values state experimentation and adaptation |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would modify the proposed approach by: (1) beginning with a 3-year CMS Innovation Center voluntary integration model before mandating Medicaid coverage; (2) structuring the BHCM Corps as a public-private partnership with employer matching contributions; (3) using a performance-based funding model that rewards integration outcomes rather than compliance with structural requirements; (4) building the coalition with psychiatric access program and Project ECHO expansion first (high bipartisan appeal) before advancing controversial mandates; and (5) commissioning a CBO cost-benefit analysis before floor votes to address fiscal concerns.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (on evidence-based policy); Conservative (on fiscal responsibility and telehealth)
- **Potential bridges:** All perspectives; centrists serve as natural bridge-builders
- **Unlikely partners:** None are structurally excluded, though Libertarian and Democratic Socialist perspectives are hardest to bridge simultaneously

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine concern about mental health and family wellbeing; some positions influenced by suspicion of secular mental health profession |
| Principle consistency | Family-centered and faith-based principles are consistent; application to specific policies varies by how mental health treatment is framed |
| Goalpost stability | Support for mental health access has increased over time as evangelical leaders acknowledge mental health needs; some residual stigma concerns |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; concerned about government-funded mental health treatment conflicting with faith-based values |

**Justification:** The Religious Right has undergone a notable shift toward supporting mental health access, driven by recognition of mental health needs within faith communities and the opioid/suicide crises affecting conservative constituencies. However, positions are inconsistent due to tension between supporting mental health access and concern about secular treatment approaches that may conflict with faith-based values. Support is most reliable when framed around family wellbeing, suicide prevention, and community care.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- National Association of Evangelicals issued statement supporting mental health access and reducing stigma (NAE, 2023)
- Rick Warren's Saddleback Church launched mental health ministry after son's suicide, influencing evangelical attitudes
- Focus on the Family publications increasingly address mental health while emphasizing faith-based approaches alongside clinical treatment

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agree that mental health treatment gap exists and is a serious problem. Concerned that analysis does not adequately address faith-based support systems. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Partial agreement on structural barriers; believe root causes also include cultural decline, family breakdown, and secularization that are not addressed by clinical integration alone. |

**Source references:**

- National Association of Evangelicals. "Mental Health and the Church." 2023. Statement supporting mental health access and stigma reduction.
- Focus on the Family. "Faith and Mental Health: A Comprehensive Approach." 2023. Supports clinical treatment alongside faith-based counseling.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Universal CoCM Payment Mandate | 4/10 | Cautiously supportive of mental health access; wary of government mandates | Concern that mandated treatment excludes faith-based approaches; worry about government defining appropriate care |
| BHCM Workforce Pipeline | 5/10 | Supports workforce expansion; wants faith-based organizations included | Wants BHCM training to respect faith perspectives; chaplain integration |
| Statewide Psychiatric Access Programs | 6/10 | Supports access expansion, especially for families and youth | Values family-centered approach to mental health |
| Integration-Ready EHR Standards | 4/10 | Neutral to skeptical; privacy concerns | Concerns about mental health records being accessible to government |
| FQHC Integration Mandate | 5/10 | Supports community health but wants faith-based organizations included | Wants faith-based health centers eligible for integration funding |
| Project ECHO Expansion | 6/10 | Supports education and mentoring model | Values community-based knowledge sharing |
| Medicaid Carve-In Incentive | 4/10 | Skeptical of Medicaid restructuring | Worried about government control of mental health treatment decisions |
| Training Transformation Grants | 5/10 | Supports with inclusion of faith-informed training | Wants pastoral care and chaplaincy recognized in training programs |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act | 4/10 | Cautious; supports mental health access but opposes mandate structure | Wants conscience protections for faith-based providers; concerned about government defining treatment standards |
| Model State Behavioral Health Integration Act | 5/10 | Prefers state-level action; wants faith community provisions | Would support with faith-based organization eligibility amendments |

#### Alternative Proposals

The Religious Right would support integration reforms that: (1) include faith-based counseling organizations as eligible integration partners; (2) protect conscience rights of providers who incorporate faith-based approaches alongside clinical treatment; (3) fund chaplaincy and pastoral care integration alongside clinical BHCM programs; (4) emphasize family-centered mental health approaches with parental consent requirements for adolescent treatment; and (5) ensure mental health treatment respects patients' religious values and does not impose secular frameworks on faith-oriented patients.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on limited government and family values); Populist (on community-based solutions)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on evidence-based mental health access with values sensitivity); Liberal (on reducing stigma and expanding access)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive and Democratic Socialist (on scope of government program); Libertarian (minimal overlap on healthcare policy)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to healthcare as a public good and universal access; integration viewed as component of broader system transformation |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies universal public provision principles; views integration through lens of systemic change |
| Goalpost stability | Stable commitment to universal behavioral health access; may resist incremental reforms that stabilize the existing multi-payer system |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; willing to support integration reforms as stepping stones, though ultimate goal is single-payer |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists apply consistent principles of universal public provision to behavioral health integration. Their support for integration as policy is strong, but they view it as insufficient without broader systemic change (single-payer, public option). This creates tension between supporting achievable reforms and holding out for more fundamental transformation, slightly reducing consistency.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- DSA Health Justice Committee supports universal behavioral health access as component of Medicare for All (DSA, 2024)
- Sanders Medicare for All bill includes fully integrated behavioral health with no cost-sharing
- Jacobin magazine has published analyses supporting integration as a stepping stone toward decommodified healthcare

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with treatment gap and structural failure analysis. Would frame more explicitly as consequence of commodified healthcare system. |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | High agreement on structural barriers; would place primary blame on for-profit insurance and pharmaceutical industries rather than payment "misalignment." |

**Source references:**

- Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP). "Behavioral Health Integration Under Single-Payer." 2023. Analysis of how single-payer eliminates integration barriers.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Universal CoCM Payment Mandate | 7/10 | Supports mandate but views multi-payer implementation as inherently limited | Single-payer would eliminate the need for mandating coverage across fragmented payer systems |
| BHCM Workforce Pipeline | 9/10 | Strongly supports public workforce investment with living wages | Would make BHCMs public employees with full benefits, not loan-repayment-incentivized contractors |
| Statewide Psychiatric Access Programs | 8/10 | Supports public infrastructure for mental health access | Values public provision model |
| Integration-Ready EHR Standards | 7/10 | Supports but prefers public EHR system over regulating private vendors | Would invest in open-source public EHR rather than mandating features in private products |
| FQHC Integration Mandate | 9/10 | Strongly supports; FQHCs are model of public healthcare provision | Would expand FQHCs dramatically as foundation for universal primary care |
| Project ECHO Expansion | 8/10 | Supports democratization of specialist knowledge | Values the de-specialization and empowerment of community providers |
| Medicaid Carve-In Incentive | 6/10 | Supports eliminating carve-outs; opposes managed care generally | Would replace Medicaid managed care with public single-payer administration |
| Training Transformation Grants | 9/10 | Strongly supports with free public medical/behavioral health education | Would eliminate medical school tuition as the most effective workforce strategy |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act | 6/10 | Supports as stepping stone; views as insufficient without single-payer context | Would prefer integration provisions as part of Medicare for All rather than standalone bill |
| Model State Behavioral Health Integration Act | 6/10 | Supports state-level public investment; would add public option | State action viewed as partial solution without federal structural change |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic Socialists would replace or augment the proposed approach with: (1) Medicare for All with fully integrated behavioral health as a covered benefit, eliminating the multi-payer fragmentation that is the root cause of integration barriers; (2) public employment of all BHCMs and psychiatric consultants as government employees with living wages, full benefits, and student debt cancellation; (3) nationalized open-source EHR system eliminating private vendor dependence; (4) free public medical and behavioral health graduate education to permanently resolve workforce shortages; and (5) community health worker programs owned and governed by the communities they serve.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on public investment and universal access); Liberal (on coverage mandates and funding)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-corporate framing and community investment); Centrist (on evidence-based outcomes)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (on government role); Libertarian (on mandate and public provision approach); Constitutionalist (on federal authority)

| Medicaid Carve-In Incentive | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Populist, Constitutionalist, Religious Right | Libertarian |

**Key insight:** Psychiatric access programs and Project ECHO expansion have near-universal support across all nine perspectives and should be the legislative priority for bipartisan action. BHCM workforce investment and training grants command strong majority support. Coverage mandates face structural opposition from 3-4 perspectives but have sufficient coalition support (5-6 perspectives) for legislative viability in a center-left alliance.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Rural Mental Health Access Through Teleconsultation

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Populist + Centrist + Religious Right

**Core Agreement:** All five perspectives agree that rural and underserved communities need better access to mental health expertise, and that teleconsultation is a practical, cost-effective, and minimally intrusive way to deliver it.

**Policy Description:**

Expand statewide psychiatric access programs (MCPAP model) to all 50 states for both adult and child populations, with federal grant funding of $100 million/year for 5 years. Simultaneously expand Project ECHO behavioral health hubs to 100 nationally. Include faith-based health organizations as eligible participants. Require interstate telehealth licensing compacts for behavioral health professionals. No coverage mandates or new regulatory requirements on private payers.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Voluntary, low-federal-footprint, addresses rural access without mandates |
| Liberal | Expands access to underserved populations; builds infrastructure for future integration |
| Populist | Direct benefit to "forgotten communities" in rural America |
| Centrist | Evidence-based, bipartisan, cost-effective |
| Religious Right | Includes faith-based organizations; non-coercive approach |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepting $500 million in new federal spending over 5 years |
| Liberal | Deferring coverage mandates and Medicaid reform |
| Populist | Accepting academic medical center hub model rather than pure community-based approach |
| Centrist | Accepting a narrower scope than the full evidence supports |
| Religious Right | Accepting secular clinical teleconsultation alongside faith-based approaches |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (with potential Libertarian and Constitutionalist support for telehealth deregulation component)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Centrist dominate; Conservative and Populist less predictable)
- **Durability:** High; teleconsultation programs have demonstrated bipartisan durability across multiple congressional cycles
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone bipartisan bill or amendment to HRSA reauthorization; can pass with 60+ Senate votes

---

### Compromise 2: Workforce Investment with State Flexibility

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Conservative + Centrist + Populist + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Six perspectives agree that the behavioral health workforce is insufficient and that investment in training and deployment is necessary. The compromise balances federal investment with state flexibility in how workers are trained and deployed.

**Policy Description:**

Establish a federal BHCM training grant program ($200 million/year for 5 years) funding 200 training programs at accredited institutions. Include NHSC-style loan repayment for BHCMs serving in shortage areas. Allow states to define BHCM scope-of-practice within broad federal guidelines. Include scope-of-practice reform provisions enabling nurses, social workers, and counselors to serve as BHCMs without unnecessary licensing barriers. Require training programs to include exposure to faith-informed care approaches and community health worker models alongside clinical training.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Major federal workforce investment targeting underserved communities |
| Progressive | Public investment in healthcare workforce; community health worker inclusion |
| Conservative | State flexibility in scope-of-practice; deregulatory elements; market-compatible |
| Centrist | Evidence-based, measurable, bipartisan workforce strategy |
| Populist | Workers deployed to underserved communities; apprenticeship-compatible models |
| Democratic Socialist | Public workforce investment; debt relief component |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | State flexibility means uneven implementation; no coverage mandate |
| Progressive | Smaller investment than desired; not public employment model |
| Conservative | Accepting new federal spending program ($1 billion over 5 years) |
| Centrist | Some state flexibility may reduce consistency of outcomes |
| Populist | Academic institution-based training rather than pure community model |
| Democratic Socialist | Market-compatible structure rather than public employment |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist)
- **Durability:** High; workforce investment programs have strong bipartisan track record (NHSC model)
- **Implementation Path:** Bipartisan bill with HELP Committee and Finance Committee jurisdiction; 60+ Senate votes achievable with rural access framing

---

### Compromise 3: Phased Integration with Incentives Before Mandates

**Bridges:** Liberal + Centrist + Conservative + Populist + Religious Right

**Core Agreement:** Broad agreement that integration should expand, with disagreement on whether mandates or incentives should drive adoption. This compromise begins with incentives and transitions to mandates only after evidence of cost savings is demonstrated.

**Policy Description:**

Phase 1 (Years 1-3): CMS Innovation Center launches a voluntary primary care behavioral health integration model offering enhanced payments to participating practices. States receive bonus FMAP for voluntarily adding CoCM to Medicaid coverage. Federal grants support FQHC integration on a voluntary basis. Phase 2 (Years 4-7): Based on Phase 1 evaluation data, Congress considers mandatory Medicaid CoCM coverage only if Phase 1 demonstrates cost neutrality or savings. Mandatory coverage triggered only by positive CBO evaluation, not by legislative fiat.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Builds toward universal coverage; establishes federal infrastructure |
| Centrist | Evidence-based phase-in; demonstrates results before mandating |
| Conservative | Voluntary first; mandates conditional on proven cost savings |
| Populist | Expanded access for underserved communities from Year 1 |
| Religious Right | Voluntary participation protects provider autonomy |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Delayed mandate; 3-year voluntary period before mandatory coverage |
| Centrist | Potential that Phase 2 mandate never triggers if evidence is ambiguous |
| Conservative | Accepting that mandate may eventually follow if evidence supports it |
| Populist | Slower rollout than immediate universal access |
| Religious Right | Accepting potential future mandate if cost savings demonstrated |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 2/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Centrist); Conservative, Populist, and Religious Right less predictable
- **Durability:** Medium; conditional mandate structure creates uncertainty that may deter investment; evaluation outcomes could be contested
- **Implementation Path:** Bipartisan legislation with Innovation Center authority; can pass with 55-60 Senate votes; Phase 2 trigger requires separate authorization vote

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most achievable legislative coalition combines Liberal, Centrist, and Populist perspectives as the core, with Conservative support achievable on teleconsultation and workforce components. This coalition of 4-5 perspectives represents a realistic Senate majority for integration legislation when rural access benefits are prominently framed. The key is separating consensus components (psychiatric access programs, Project ECHO, workforce training) from contested components (coverage mandates, FMAP incentives) and advancing the consensus items first.

### Key Obstacles

The primary obstacle is not opposition to integration itself but opposition to the mechanism of federal mandates. Even perspectives that acknowledge the treatment gap and workforce crisis (Conservative, Constitutionalist, Religious Right) resist mandatory coverage requirements and new federal programs. Overcoming this requires either (1) achieving a critical mass of support (5+ perspectives) for mandate-based legislation through a center-left coalition, or (2) building sufficient voluntary adoption through incentives and technical assistance that mandates become less necessary.

### Low Consistency Partners

Conservative (3/5) and Populist (3/5) perspectives are the most valuable but least predictable coalition partners. Both have genuine interest in rural mental health access but may oppose legislation for broader political reasons (deficit concerns, anti-government rhetoric). Engaging these partners requires framing integration as: (a) a cost-saving measure, not a spending increase; (b) a rural access solution, not a government expansion; and (c) a workforce and deregulation strategy, not a mandate-based approach.

### Recommended Approach

Advance integration legislation in two tracks:

1. **Bipartisan Track (Years 1-2)**: Psychiatric access program expansion, Project ECHO, BHCM workforce training, and telehealth deregulation. This package commands 7-8 perspective support and can pass with broad bipartisan margins.

2. **Coalition Track (Years 2-4)**: Medicaid CoCM mandate, FQHC integration requirement, and enhanced FMAP for carve-in states. This package commands 5-6 perspective support and requires a center-left coalition. Advance only after bipartisan track builds momentum and generates cost-savings data.

This sequenced approach maximizes the probability of meaningful progress while building toward comprehensive reform.
