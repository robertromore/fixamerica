# Primary Care and Mental Health Integration: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Achieving universal integration of behavioral health into primary care requires coordinated, simultaneous action across four interdependent domains: payment reform, workforce development, technology infrastructure, and organizational transformation. No single domain can succeed in isolation because the barriers reinforce each other. A practice cannot sustain integrated care without adequate payment; payment cannot drive adoption without a trained workforce; workforce cannot be effective without enabling technology; and technology investments are wasted without organizational commitment to team-based care.

The roadmap is organized into three phases that progressively expand the reach and depth of integration. Phase 1 (Years 1-2) establishes the financial and regulatory foundation by mandating payer coverage and launching workforce and technology programs. Phase 2 (Years 3-5) scales adoption through targeted deployment of new workers, expanded technical assistance, and enforcement of integration standards. Phase 3 (Years 6-10) achieves near-universal integration, transitions to sustainable financing, and embeds integration as the standard of primary care practice.

The strategy prioritizes equity by targeting safety-net settings (FQHCs, rural clinics, tribal facilities) in the earliest phases, ensuring that populations with the greatest need receive integration infrastructure first. Each phase includes specific metrics, legislative requirements, and contingency plans to maintain accountability and adaptability.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Establish universal payer coverage for CoCM billing codes (Medicare, Medicaid, commercial)
- Launch the Behavioral Health Care Manager (BHCM) Corps and certification program
- Initiate EHR behavioral health integration standards through ONC rulemaking
- Expand psychiatric access programs and Project ECHO hubs to all 50 states
- Begin FQHC integration mandate with targeted capacity funding

### Key Actions

| HRSA launches BHCM Corps program design and accreditation standards | HRSA/SAMHSA | Months 1-12 | $50 million planning grant; interagency working group | Accreditation standards published; first training sites approved |
| ONC issues proposed rule for EHR behavioral health integration certification | ONC | Months 6-12 | Rulemaking capacity; vendor consultation | Proposed rule published; comment period opened |
| HRSA awards competitive grants for 30 new psychiatric access programs (adult) | HRSA | Months 6-18 | $100 million in Year 1 grants | 30 new state programs awarded |
| HRSA awards grants for 30 new Project ECHO behavioral health hubs | HRSA | Months 6-18 | $50 million in Year 1 grants | 30 hubs operational within 18 months |
| HRSA issues FQHC integration mandate proposed rule (Section 330 update) | HRSA | Months 12-18 | Rulemaking staff; NACHC consultation | Proposed rule published |
| CMS establishes enhanced FMAP (10 percentage points) for Medicaid carve-in states | CMS/Congress | Months 1-12 | Included in federal legislation | Enhanced FMAP available to qualifying states |

### Legislative Requirements

- **Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act**: Comprehensive legislation mandating Medicaid CoCM coverage, authorizing the BHCM Corps, providing FQHC integration funding ($3 billion over 5 years), and establishing enhanced FMAP for carve-in states
- **Supplemental appropriation**: $500 million in immediate funding for psychiatric access program expansion and Project ECHO hubs
- **ONC authorization update**: Explicit Congressional direction to include behavioral health integration in EHR certification criteria (may be included in main bill or separate 21st Century Cures Act amendment)

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Year 2, the legislative and regulatory foundation for national integration will be in place. All state Medicaid programs will be required to cover CoCM codes (with implementation deadlines staggered through Year 3). The BHCM Corps will have established accreditation standards and enrolled its first training cohort. Thirty new psychiatric access programs and 30 new Project ECHO hubs will be operational. The FQHC integration mandate will have been proposed with a compliance timeline. Five to ten states will have initiated Medicaid behavioral health carve-in transitions in response to the enhanced FMAP incentive.

## Phase 2: Scaling (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Achieve Medicaid CoCM coverage in all 50 states with enforcement of minimum rate floors
- Deploy the first 5,000 certified BHCMs through the BHCM Corps
- Achieve all-state coverage of adult and child psychiatric access programs (50 states)
- Complete FQHC integration mandate for large health centers (Level 5-6 compliance)
- Enforce EHR behavioral health integration certification standards
- Transition 20+ states from behavioral health carve-out to carve-in Medicaid models

| 20 states complete Medicaid behavioral health carve-in transition | State Medicaid agencies | Years 3-5 | Enhanced FMAP; SAMHSA-HRSA CIHS TA | 20 states carved in |

### Legislative Requirements

- **Reauthorization and adjustment**: Midpoint review of BHCM Corps funding and psychiatric access programs; potential supplemental appropriation if demand exceeds initial estimates
- **ACGME accreditation directive**: Congressional encouragement (non-binding) or HRSA conditioning of GME funding on integration training standards
- **Parity enforcement strengthening**: Amendment to MHPAEA requiring reporting on integrated care access as part of parity compliance

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Year 5, the infrastructure for national integration will be substantially built. All state Medicaid programs will reimburse CoCM codes. Five thousand certified BHCMs will be practicing in integrated settings, with the majority in underserved areas. Every state will have both adult and child psychiatric access programs providing same-day teleconsultation to primary care providers. Eighty percent of large FQHCs will have achieved full integration (Level 5-6). Major EHR vendors will have completed or begun implementing behavioral health integration features. Twenty or more states will have transitioned to behavioral health carve-in Medicaid models. CoCM billing will have expanded from fewer than 3% of primary care practices to an estimated 20-25%.

---

## Phase 3: Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Achieve 60%+ of primary care practices delivering integrated behavioral health (Level 4-6)
- Deploy 10,000 BHCMs; establish self-sustaining training pipeline
- Complete FQHC universal integration (all sites at Level 5-6)
- Transition federal funding from start-up grants to sustainable payment models
- Embed behavioral health integration as a core competency for all primary care graduates
- Achieve measurable reductions in national depression and anxiety treatment gaps

### Key Actions

### Expected Outcomes

By Year 10, behavioral health integration will be the standard of primary care in the United States. Over 60% of primary care practices will deliver Level 4-6 integrated care. A self-sustaining BHCM training pipeline will produce 2,000+ new care managers annually, supported by NHSC-style loan repayment rather than time-limited grants. All FQHCs will be fully integrated. EHR systems will universally support registry-based, team-based behavioral health workflows. The national treatment gap for depression and anxiety will have narrowed from approximately 57% untreated to under 35%, representing tens of millions of additional Americans receiving evidence-based behavioral health care in primary care settings. National health expenditure data will begin to demonstrate reductions in behavioral health-related emergency department use, hospitalization, and disability claims attributable to upstream primary care intervention.

## Governance and Oversight

A National Behavioral Health Integration Commission, established within HHS, will oversee implementation of the roadmap. The commission will include representatives from CMS, HRSA, SAMHSA, ONC, AHRQ, and external members drawn from primary care, behavioral health, patient advocacy, health systems, and state Medicaid agencies. The commission will:

- Publish annual progress reports on all milestones and metrics
- Conduct midpoint review (Year 5) with authority to recommend legislative adjustments
- Coordinate across federal agencies to prevent duplication and ensure alignment
- Advise Congress on reauthorization and funding adjustments
- Facilitate state-level implementation support through SAMHSA-HRSA CIHS

Accountability mechanisms include:

- **Annual HHS report to Congress**: Required under the authorizing legislation, covering all metrics, spending, and program performance
- **GAO evaluation at Years 3, 5, and 10**: Independent assessment of program effectiveness and cost-efficiency
- **AHRQ-funded national evaluation**: Comprehensive research study of integration impact on outcomes, costs, and disparities (contracted at Year 6, published at Year 10)
- **State-level reporting**: Medicaid agencies must report CoCM utilization, behavioral health access metrics, and integration quality indicators annually as a condition of enhanced FMAP

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Congressional Failure to Pass Comprehensive Legislation

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design a modular legislative approach that allows individual components (Medicaid CoCM mandate, BHCM Corps, FQHC integration funding) to advance as separate bills or riders if comprehensive legislation stalls. Build bipartisan coalition early by emphasizing the evidence base, cost savings, and rural access benefits that appeal across party lines.

**Contingency Plan**: If legislation stalls, pursue administrative actions available without new legislation: CMS rulemaking to encourage CoCM through existing authority (CMMI models, Medicare physician fee schedule updates), HRSA reallocation of existing workforce funds to BHCM training, and ONC regulatory action under 21st Century Cures Act. These actions would be less comprehensive but could sustain momentum.

### Risk 2: Insufficient Workforce Supply to Meet Deployment Targets

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Invest heavily in training pipeline from Year 1, with accelerated 12-18 month certification pathways for experienced social workers and nurses who can transition to BHCM roles. Leverage telehealth to enable BHCMs and psychiatric consultants to serve multiple practices remotely, reducing the total headcount needed. Expand scope-of-practice to allow more professionals to serve in care manager and prescriber roles.

**Contingency Plan**: If BHCM supply falls short of targets, prioritize deployment to FQHCs and MHPSAs. Increase reliance on telehealth-enabled consultation models (Project ECHO, psychiatric access programs) to provide specialist support to practices without on-site BHCMs. Provide bridge funding for shared BHCM positions that serve multiple small practices.

### Risk 3: State Resistance to Medicaid CoCM Mandate

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Structure the federal mandate with enhanced FMAP support (90/10 federal match for CoCM services in Years 1-3, transitioning to standard match), reducing the fiscal burden on states. Provide SAMHSA-HRSA CIHS technical assistance for State Plan Amendment development. Highlight early-adopter state data (e.g., Washington State) showing CoCM cost-effectiveness.

**Contingency Plan**: If states delay compliance, CMS can use existing Medicaid authority to condition managed care contract approval on CoCM coverage, achieving coverage through managed care organizations even if state fee-for-service programs are slower to adopt.

### Risk 4: EHR Vendor Resistance to Integration Standards

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Engage EHR vendors early in the rulemaking process. Provide a 24-month compliance timeline with phased requirements (basic screening templates first, full registry functionality second). Offer ONC technical assistance grants to smaller vendors. Frame requirements as enhancing product competitiveness in the value-based care market.

**Contingency Plan**: If major vendors delay, promote open-source registry add-on tools (such as those developed by the AIMS Center) that can integrate with existing EHR platforms via FHIR APIs, bypassing vendor dependence for core CoCM functionality.

### Risk 5: Political Changes Reversing Integration Commitments

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build integration into permanent programmatic structures (FQHC Section 330 requirements, Medicare fee schedule, ACGME accreditation standards) that are resistant to single-year appropriations changes. Emphasize bipartisan benefits: rural access, veteran care, cost savings. Cultivate support from health system CEOs and governors of both parties.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal commitment weakens, pivot to state-level implementation. States with carved-in Medicaid, existing psychiatric access programs, and state-funded BHCM training can sustain integration independently. The 50-state strategy ensures that progress is distributed and difficult to fully reverse.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Cost | Funding Source | Notes |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Years 1-2) | $2.5 billion | New federal appropriation; enhanced FMAP | Legislation + supplemental for psychiatric access/ECHO expansion |
| Phase 2 (Years 3-5) | $6.5 billion ($2.2 billion/year average) | Authorized appropriation; state match for FMAP | BHCM Corps scale-up; FQHC grants; ECHO expansion; Medicaid enhanced match |
| Phase 3 (Years 6-10) | $7.0 billion ($1.4 billion/year average) | Transitioning to sustainable payment models | Declining grants; increasing self-sustaining reimbursement revenue |
| **Total (10 years)** | **$16.0 billion** | **Federal appropriation + state match** | **Partially offset by estimated $8-12 billion in reduced ED/hospitalization costs** |

### Personnel

- **Federal staff**: Approximately 200 new FTEs across CMS, HRSA, SAMHSA, and ONC for program administration, rulemaking, and oversight (Years 1-5)
- **BHCM Corps**: 10,000 new certified BHCMs by Year 7, plus 500+ training program faculty and supervisors
- **Psychiatric access program staff**: Estimated 500-750 consulting psychiatrists and administrative support across 50 state programs
- **Project ECHO hub staff**: Approximately 800-1,000 specialists and coordinators across 100 hubs
- **FQHC workforce expansion**: Estimated 15,000-20,000 new behavioral health FTEs across the national FQHC network (funded through integration grants and sustainable CoCM billing revenue)

### Infrastructure

- **Technology**: EHR upgrades across approximately 200,000 primary care practices; estimated 18-24 months for major vendor compliance. BHCM training programs require telehealth-capable clinical sites and simulation facilities.
- **Telehealth**: Psychiatric access programs and Project ECHO hubs require HIPAA-compliant video conferencing, scheduling, and case management platforms. Rural broadband remains a prerequisite in underserved areas (addressed by Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, 2021).
- **Training facilities**: 200+ accredited BHCM training programs at schools of social work, nursing, and counseling, with integrated clinical practicum sites at FQHCs and primary care practices.
- **Quality measurement**: National behavioral health integration quality reporting system requiring data infrastructure at CMS, state Medicaid agencies, and practice level.
