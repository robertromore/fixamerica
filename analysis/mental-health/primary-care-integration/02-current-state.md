# Primary Care and Mental Health Integration: Current State

## Integration Models in Practice

The integration of behavioral health into primary care exists along a spectrum, from minimal coordination (referral to external specialists) to full integration (embedded team-based care with shared treatment plans). The SAMHSA-HRSA Center for Integrated Health Solutions defines six levels of integration across three broad categories: coordinated, co-located, and integrated.

### Levels of Integration

| Level | Category | Description | Prevalence (Estimated) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | Coordinated | Minimal collaboration; separate systems | ~40% of primary care practices |
| Level 2 | Coordinated | Basic collaboration at a distance | ~25% of primary care practices |
| Level 3 | Co-located | Basic collaboration on-site | ~15% of primary care practices |
| Level 4 | Co-located | Close collaboration on-site, some system integration | ~10% of primary care practices |
| Level 5 | Integrated | Close collaboration approaching integration | ~7% of primary care practices |
| Level 6 | Integrated | Full collaboration in a transformed/merged practice | Fewer than 3% of primary care practices |

### The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM)

CoCM is the most extensively studied integration model. It requires four core components:

1. **Patient-Centered Team Care**: A primary care provider (PCP), behavioral health care manager (BHCM), and psychiatric consultant work as a team
2. **Population-Based Care**: A patient registry tracks all patients receiving behavioral health services, enabling proactive follow-up
3. **Measurement-Based Treatment-to-Target**: Validated tools (PHQ-9 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety) are administered at every contact; treatment is adjusted until targets are met
4. **Evidence-Based Treatments**: Both pharmacotherapy and brief psychotherapy (e.g., behavioral activation, problem-solving therapy) are delivered within the primary care setting

| CoCM Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| RCTs demonstrating efficacy | Over 90 | AIMS Center, University of Washington, 2024 |
| Depression remission rate (CoCM) | 45-55% at 12 months | Unutzer et al., *JAMA*, 2002; Archer et al., *Cochrane*, 2012 |
| Depression remission rate (usual care) | 19-25% at 12 months | Unutzer et al., *JAMA*, 2002 |
| Number needed to treat (NNT) for depression improvement | 5.4 | Gilbody et al., *Archives of Internal Medicine*, 2006 |
| Cost-effectiveness | $594 per QALY gained | Simon et al., *Archives of General Psychiatry*, 2001 |
| Practices billing CoCM codes nationally | Fewer than 3% | Psychiatry and Behavioral Health Learning Network, 2023 |

## Screening Prevalence

### USPSTF Recommendations

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has issued screening recommendations directly relevant to primary care integration:

| Screening | Recommendation | Grade | Target Population | Instrument |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Depression | Screen all adults | B | Adults 19+ | PHQ-9 or PHQ-2 |
| Anxiety | Screen all adults under 65 | B | Adults 19-64 | GAD-7 |
| Depression in adolescents | Screen all adolescents 12-18 | B | Ages 12-18 | PHQ-A |
| Substance use (alcohol) | Screen all adults | B | Adults 18+ | AUDIT-C |
| Suicide risk | Insufficient evidence for universal screening | I | General adult population | Columbia Protocol (C-SSRS) |

Source: USPSTF, 2016 (depression, reaffirmed 2023); 2023 (anxiety); 2016 (adolescent depression); 2018 (alcohol)

### Screening Implementation Rates

| Setting | Depression Screening Rate | Anxiety Screening Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Large health systems (EHR-integrated) | 50-80% | 20-40% | CommonSpirit Health Report, 2023 |
| FQHCs | 65% (any screening) | 30% (estimated) | HRSA UDS Data, 2023 |
| Private primary care practices | 25-40% | 10-20% | Akincigil & Matthews, *Psychiatric Services*, 2017 (updated estimates) |
| Pediatric primary care | 45% for adolescent depression | N/A | Zuckerbrot et al., *Pediatrics*, 2018 |
| Rural primary care | 15-25% | Under 10% | Rural Health Information Hub, 2023 |

## Federally Qualified Health Centers

FQHCs serve as the primary safety-net setting for integrated behavioral health. As of 2023, HRSA reports 1,375 FQHC grantees operating over 15,000 service delivery sites, serving approximately 30.5 million patients.

| Collaborative Care via telehealth | BHCM and psychiatric consultant operate remotely | Adopted by ~30% of CoCM programs post-COVID | Fortney et al., *JAMA Psychiatry*, 2013 |
| Direct-to-patient telepsychiatry | Specialist care delivered via video from primary care site | Widespread post-COVID; coverage parity in 40 states | ATA, 2024 |

### Electronic Health Record Integration

| EHR Challenge | Current State | Impact on Integration |
|---|---|---|
| Separate behavioral health records | Most EHR systems maintain BH as separate module | Prevents team-based care; duplicates documentation |
| 42 CFR Part 2 restrictions | Federal regulations restrict sharing SUD records | Creates barriers to integrated treatment planning |
| Lack of registry functionality | Fewer than 20% of EHRs have built-in patient registries | Undermines CoCM population-based care approach |
| Interoperability | Limited data sharing between BH and primary care systems | Fragments care for co-managed patients |

| Tribal/Indian Health Service | Under 5% at Level 5-6 | Chronic underfunding; sovereignty considerations | IHS data, 2023 |

## Recent Trends

### Positive Developments (2019-2024)

- **USPSTF anxiety screening recommendation (2023)**: First-ever universal adult anxiety screening recommendation, creating new demand for primary care-based treatment
- **42 CFR Part 2 alignment (2024)**: SAMHSA final rule aligning substance use disorder records with HIPAA, reducing a major barrier to integrated care
- **CCBHC expansion (2024)**: Bipartisan Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act expanded CCBHCs to 540 clinics in 46 states with dedicated prospective payment
- **Telehealth flexibilities**: Post-COVID telehealth waivers made permanent or extended in most states, enabling remote CoCM delivery
- **Making Care Primary (MCP) model (2024)**: CMS Innovation Center launched 10-year primary care transformation model with explicit behavioral health integration track

### Persistent Challenges

- **CoCM adoption plateau**: Billing code utilization has grown slowly since 2017 launch, with fewer than 3% of practices billing
- **Workforce pipeline stagnation**: Graduate medical education funding for psychiatry and psychology internships has not kept pace with integration demand
- **Medicaid reimbursement gaps**: Only 22 states reimburse CoCM codes under Medicaid, and rates often fall below cost
- **Measurement infrastructure**: Most practices lack the registries and outcome tracking systems required for measurement-based care

## Emerging Challenges

- **Demand surge post-pandemic**: Depression and anxiety prevalence increased 25-30% during COVID-19 (WHO, 2022), straining already limited integration capacity
- **Digital behavioral health proliferation**: The rapid growth of mental health apps and digital therapeutics raises questions about integration with clinical care and evidence standards
- **Consolidation of primary care**: Private equity acquisition of primary care practices may deprioritize behavioral health integration if it reduces short-term revenue
- **AI and clinical decision support**: Emerging AI tools for screening triage and treatment recommendations require governance frameworks within integrated care settings
- **Youth mental health crisis**: The Surgeon General's advisory on youth mental health (2021) has increased pressure on pediatric primary care to deliver behavioral health services, but pediatric CoCM infrastructure is underdeveloped
