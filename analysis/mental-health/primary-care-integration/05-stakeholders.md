# Primary Care and Mental Health Integration: Stakeholders

The integration of behavioral health into primary care is shaped by the interactions of diverse groups, each with distinct interests, resources, and levels of influence over policy and practice.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Adults with untreated mental illness | 57.8% of adults with mental illness receive no treatment; integration would provide access in the settings where they already seek care | 28.3 million (SAMHSA, NSDUH, 2022) | Accessible, non-stigmatizing treatment in familiar settings |
| Primary care patients with comorbid conditions | Physical-behavioral comorbidity worsens outcomes and increases costs; integrated care addresses both simultaneously | ~60% of primary care patients have behavioral health component (Kathol et al., 2010) | Coordinated care that treats the whole person |
| People in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas | 160 million Americans live in MHPSAs where specialty behavioral health is unavailable; integration via telehealth is their primary pathway to care | 160 million (HRSA, 2024) | Any access to behavioral health services |
| FQHC patients | 30.5 million patients at safety-net clinics, many low-income and uninsured, who depend on FQHCs as their medical home | 30.5 million (HRSA UDS, 2023) | Integrated services without additional appointments, transportation, or cost |
| Children and adolescents with behavioral health needs | Youth mental health crisis intensifying; pediatric primary care is the most accessible intervention point | 7.7 million youth with treatable mental health conditions (NAMI, 2023) | Developmentally appropriate screening and treatment in pediatric settings |
| Rural residents | Severe workforce shortages make specialty referral impractical; integration and telehealth are the primary viable models | 60 million rural Americans (Census, 2020) | Teleconsultation-enabled access to psychiatric expertise |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Family members and caregivers**: An estimated 8.4 million family caregivers support adults with mental illness (NAMI, 2023). Integration reduces their burden by embedding support within routine medical visits.
- **Employers**: Mental health conditions cost employers an estimated $47.6 billion annually in lost productivity (American Heart Association CEO Roundtable, 2018). Integration through employer-sponsored health plans could reduce absenteeism and disability.
- **Criminal justice system**: People with untreated mental illness are disproportionately represented in jails and prisons. Effective primary care-based treatment could reduce justice system involvement.
- **Emergency departments**: Behavioral health visits to EDs increased 44% between 2006 and 2014 (HCUP, 2017), and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend. Integration can divert demand upstream.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) | Sets Medicare payment policy; approves state Medicaid plans | CoCM billing codes; Medicaid waivers; Innovation Center models | $1.5 trillion in annual spending (FY2024) | High |
| State Medicaid agencies | Decide whether to cover CoCM codes; set rates; manage carve-outs | State Plan Amendments; managed care contracts; rate-setting | $800+ billion combined state/federal Medicaid (FY2024) | High |
| Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) | Funds and oversees FQHCs; administers workforce programs | FQHC grants; NHSC; behavioral health workforce programs | $17.2 billion (FY2024) | High |
| SAMHSA | Administers block grants; certifies CCBHCs; operates CIHS | Community Mental Health Block Grant; CCBHC certification | $7.5 billion (FY2024) | High |
| Congress | Authorizes programs; appropriates funding; sets legislative mandates | Legislation; oversight; appropriations | Legislative authority | High |
| State legislatures | Medicaid policy; professional licensing; insurance regulation | State budgets; scope-of-practice laws; parity enforcement | Varies by state | Medium-High |
| CMS Innovation Center (CMMI) | Tests new payment and delivery models | Waiver authority; alternative payment model testing | $10 billion statutory funding | Medium-High |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **American Psychiatric Association (APA)**: The professional organization for psychiatrists, with approximately 38,800 members. APA has been a leading advocate for CoCM and integration, though some members express concern about shifts from direct patient care to consultative roles. APA publishes the Practice Guidelines that inform integration standards.
- **American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)**: Represents over 129,000 family physicians and is a primary voice for primary care integration. AAFP has advocated for expanded CoCM payment and workforce training.
- **National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC)**: Represents FQHCs and advocates for expanded funding and integration support in safety-net settings. NACHC is a critical voice on Capitol Hill for health center behavioral health capacity.
- **National Council for Mental Wellbeing**: Represents over 3,400 behavioral health organizations and has been a leading advocate for CCBHCs and integrated care. The National Council provides training, certification, and policy advocacy for integration.
- **University of Washington AIMS Center**: The research and training hub for CoCM, providing implementation support, clinical tools, and a national consultation network. Not a policy actor per se, but the primary source of CoCM evidence and training infrastructure.
- **SAMHSA-HRSA Center for Integrated Health Solutions (CIHS)**: The federal technical assistance center for integration, providing resources, frameworks, and consultation to health centers and community behavioral health organizations.

### Influencers

- **Insurance industry**: Managed care organizations (MCOs) and commercial payers control access to coverage for CoCM codes and integration services. Their decisions on coverage, rates, and prior authorization requirements directly shape practice economics. National payers such as UnitedHealthcare, Anthem, and Aetna collectively cover over 100 million enrollees.
- **Electronic health record vendors**: Epic, Cerner (now Oracle Health), and other EHR companies control the digital infrastructure of primary care. Their decisions about whether to build integrated behavioral health workflows, registries, and screening tools into standard products significantly affect integration feasibility.
- **Health system executives**: CEOs and chief medical officers of integrated delivery systems (e.g., Kaiser Permanente, Intermountain Health, Geisinger) make strategic decisions about investing in integration. Their choices influence adoption in their systems and serve as models for others.
- **Academic medical centers**: Training institutions shape the pipeline of clinicians prepared for integrated practice. Decisions about residency and fellowship curriculum have long-term effects on workforce readiness.
- **Patient advocacy organizations**: NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), Mental Health America, and the Kennedy Forum advocate for expanded access and integration policy. They bring consumer voice and political pressure.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Primary care organizations (AAFP, ACP, AAP) + Patient advocacy (NAMI, MHA) | Expanding behavioral health access through primary care settings | Strong |
| FQHC networks (NACHC) + SAMHSA + HRSA | Safety-net integration with dedicated funding | Strong |
| Behavioral health organizations (National Council) + Primary care | CCBHC expansion with prospective payment for integrated services | Strong |
| Employers + commercial payers | Reducing total cost of care through integration-driven early intervention | Moderate |
| Telehealth advocates + rural health organizations | Technology-enabled integration to overcome geographic barriers | Moderate |
| Academic medical centers + workforce development advocates | Training pipeline reform to produce integration-ready clinicians | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Specialty behavioral health vs. primary care integration**: Some specialty behavioral health providers and organizations view integration as redirecting patients and revenue away from specialty settings, even though evidence suggests integration increases rather than decreases appropriate specialty referrals for severe conditions.
- **Managed behavioral health organizations vs. carve-in advocates**: MBHOs have a direct financial interest in maintaining separate behavioral health benefit administration. Carving behavioral health into general medical management would reduce or eliminate their role.
- **Fee-for-service providers vs. value-based payment proponents**: Practices and providers that benefit from high-volume FFS billing may resist population-based payment models that reward outcomes over encounters.
- **Privacy advocates vs. information-sharing proponents**: Some patient advocacy groups resist the sharing of behavioral health records in integrated settings, citing stigma and potential discrimination, even though information barriers impede coordinated care.

### The Integration Iron Triangle

The persistence of fragmented behavioral health care is reinforced by an interconnected system of interests:

1. **Insurance structures**: Behavioral health carve-outs channel administrative fees to MBHOs and create separate provider networks, making integration administratively complex
2. **Training institutions**: Medical schools and psychology programs perpetuate separate training tracks that produce clinicians unprepared for team-based integrated practice
3. **Payment policy**: FFS payment rewards volume and discourages the population-health management activities central to CoCM

Each element reinforces the others: separate training produces clinicians who are comfortable with separate practice; separate payment systems make it economically rational to practice separately; and separate insurance structures make it administratively difficult to integrate even when clinicians and payment models support it.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on integration policy:

- **Lobbying**: The APA, AAFP, NACHC, and insurance industry maintain active lobbying operations in Washington. The APA spent $4.1 million on federal lobbying in 2023 (OpenSecrets, 2023). AHIP (insurance trade association) spent $8.6 million. Health center advocacy is coordinated through NACHC's annual policy and issues forum, which brings hundreds of health center leaders to Capitol Hill.
- **Campaign Contributions**: Healthcare industry political action committees are among the largest contributors to congressional campaigns. Insurance and pharmaceutical PACs contributed over $80 million in the 2022 election cycle (OpenSecrets, 2023). Behavioral health integration is rarely a direct campaign issue but is influenced by broader health policy positions.
- **Rulemaking Participation**: Federal regulatory processes, including CMS fee schedule rulemaking and SAMHSA regulatory updates, are shaped by public comments from stakeholder organizations. The 2024 42 CFR Part 2 final rule received over 1,000 public comments, heavily influenced by integration advocates.
- **Public Advocacy**: Patient organizations (NAMI, Mental Health America) conduct awareness campaigns, Congressional education, and grassroots mobilization. The Kennedy Forum's Parity Implementation Coalition monitors parity enforcement and advocates for behavioral health coverage equity.
- **Expertise and Evidence**: Academic researchers, particularly the AIMS Center at the University of Washington, provide the evidence base that shapes policy. CMS's decision to create CoCM billing codes was directly influenced by the accumulation of over 80 RCTs (at the time) demonstrating CoCM efficacy and cost-effectiveness.
