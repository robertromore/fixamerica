# Primary Care and Mental Health Integration

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of the integration of behavioral health services into primary care settings, including collaborative care models, screening protocols, co-located services, and payment reform.

## Overview

Mental health conditions are among the most common reasons patients visit primary care providers, yet the historical separation of behavioral and physical health care has left most patients without access to effective mental health treatment in the settings where they most often seek help. An estimated 70% of primary care visits involve a behavioral health component, but fewer than 3% of primary care practices operate a fully integrated collaborative care model. This gap contributes to delayed diagnosis, fragmented treatment, and preventable suffering and death.

Primary care integration represents the most evidence-backed strategy for closing the mental health treatment gap. The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM), developed at the University of Washington's AIMS Center, has been validated in over 90 randomized controlled trials and produces outcomes superior to standard referral-based care. Federal policy has increasingly recognized integration through dedicated billing codes (CPT 99492-99494), SAMHSA-HRSA partnerships, and Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) investments, but adoption remains far below what the evidence warrants.

This analysis examines the current landscape of integrated behavioral health in primary care, the historical and structural barriers to integration, the stakeholders shaping policy, and a comprehensive set of reforms including legislative proposals, implementation roadmaps, and strategies for achieving universal integration within a decade.
