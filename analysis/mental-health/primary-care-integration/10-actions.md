# Primary Care and Mental Health Integration: What You Can Do

Closing the gap between evidence-based integrated behavioral health care and what most Americans actually receive requires action at every level, from individuals choosing to engage with screening to clinicians transforming their practice models to advocates demanding policy change. The Collaborative Care Model has been validated in over 90 randomized controlled trials, yet fewer than 3% of primary care practices use it. Bridging this gap is not a technical problem; it is a political, organizational, and cultural challenge that citizen engagement can directly influence.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the AIMS Center's overview of the Collaborative Care Model at <https://aims.uw.edu/collaborative-care> to understand how integration works and why it matters
- Subscribe to STAT News mental health coverage (<https://www.statnews.com/category/mental-health/>) for reporting on integration policy and implementation
- Follow SAMHSA's behavioral health data releases (<https://www.samhsa.gov/data/>) to track national treatment gap statistics, including the 57.8% of adults with mental illness receiving no treatment (NSDUH, 2022)
- Read the Commonwealth Fund's integration reports (<https://www.commonwealthfund.org>) for state-by-state analysis of screening rates and CoCM adoption

### Make Personal Changes

- **Ask your primary care provider about behavioral health screening**: If your practice does not routinely screen for depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7), ask why. The USPSTF recommends screening all adults for depression and all adults under 65 for anxiety (USPSTF, 2016; 2023). Patients asking about screening signals demand to practices.
- **Complete screenings when offered**: When your primary care practice offers a PHQ-9 or GAD-7 questionnaire, complete it honestly. Screening is the first step in measurement-based care and can only work if patients participate.
- **Request integrated care if available**: Ask your insurer or practice whether Collaborative Care Model services are available. If they are, ask to be enrolled. If they are not, this creates a documented demand signal.
- **Share your experience**: If you have benefited from (or been unable to access) integrated behavioral health in primary care, share your story with your provider, insurer, and elected officials. Personal narratives drive policy change.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact your representatives**: Urge your U.S. Senators and Representative to support legislation mandating Medicaid CoCM coverage in all 50 states (currently only 22 states reimburse CoCM codes). Emphasize that you support the Behavioral Health Care Manager Corps to expand the integration workforce.
- **Submit public comments**: When CMS, ONC, or HRSA publish proposed rules affecting behavioral health integration (e.g., EHR certification standards, Medicaid managed care requirements), submit public comments supporting integration mandates. Federal Register notices are posted at <https://www.federalregister.gov>.
- **Write letters to the editor**: When local or national media covers the mental health crisis, write letters emphasizing that evidence-based solutions (CoCM, integrated care) already exist but are blocked by payment and policy barriers, not lack of knowledge.
- **Share information on social media**: Highlight the gap between evidence (over 90 RCTs for CoCM) and practice (fewer than 3% adoption) to build public awareness that the mental health treatment gap is a policy failure, not an inevitability.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- **Form a local behavioral health integration advocacy group**: Connect patients, family members, primary care providers, and behavioral health professionals who support integration. Focus on local implementation barriers (Does your FQHC offer integrated behavioral health? Does your state Medicaid program cover CoCM codes?).
- **Host community forums on mental health access**: Invite primary care providers, behavioral health professionals, and local health system leaders to discuss integration. Feature patient stories alongside data. Partner with NAMI affiliates, which operate in all 50 states.
- **Advocate to your local FQHC board**: FQHCs are governed by community boards that must include patient members. If your FQHC has not achieved Level 5-6 integration, advocate for it at board meetings. Ask about the center's behavioral health staffing levels and integration plans.
- **Partner with faith communities**: Churches, mosques, synagogues, and other faith communities are often the first place people seek help for mental health concerns. Partner with faith leaders to educate congregations about integrated care and reduce stigma around seeking behavioral health treatment in medical settings.

### Build Coalitions

- **Connect patient advocacy and provider organizations**: NAMI local affiliates, primary care professional societies (local AAFP chapters), and behavioral health provider groups often work in silos. Convene joint meetings to identify shared priorities around integration.
- **Engage employer groups**: Employers bear significant costs from untreated mental illness (estimated $47.6 billion annually in lost productivity, AHA CEO Roundtable, 2018). Local chambers of commerce and business coalitions can be powerful allies for integration, particularly for advocating commercial payer coverage of CoCM codes.
- **Work with school-based health centers**: Schools are increasingly providing on-site health services. Advocate for integrated behavioral health in school-based health centers, connecting youth mental health crisis response to the primary care system.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During annual federal and state budget processes, when mental health and healthcare funding is determined
- When behavioral health integration legislation is introduced or pending committee action
- When CMS, HRSA, or SAMHSA announce new rules, programs, or grant competitions related to primary care integration
- When your state legislature considers Medicaid reforms, scope-of-practice changes, or behavioral health parity enforcement

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Behavioral Health Integration in Primary Care

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge your support for integrating behavioral health services into primary care. The Collaborative Care Model has been validated in over 90 randomized controlled trials and doubles depression remission rates, yet fewer than 3% of primary care practices use it because of payment, workforce, and policy barriers.

I specifically ask you to support:
1. Federal legislation mandating Medicaid CoCM coverage in all 50 states (only 22 states currently reimburse these services)
2. Funding for a Behavioral Health Care Manager Corps to train and deploy 10,000 new integrated care workers
3. Enhanced funding for FQHCs to achieve full behavioral health integration
4. EHR standards requiring behavioral health integration functionality

More than 57% of adults with mental illness receive no treatment (SAMHSA, 2022). Primary care integration is the most evidence-based strategy for closing this gap, but it requires legislative action to overcome structural barriers.

[Optional: personal story about your experience with mental health care access]

Thank you for your service and attention to this issue.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling to ask [Representative/Senator] [Name] to support behavioral health integration in primary care. Specifically, I'd like them to co-sponsor legislation mandating Medicaid coverage of the Collaborative Care Model in all 50 states and funding for a Behavioral Health Care Manager workforce. Fewer than 3% of primary care practices use evidence-based integration despite over 90 clinical trials proving it works. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation and programs to support:

- **Bipartisan Excellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Act (Expansion)**: Expands CCBHCs nationally with prospective payment. Advocate for reauthorization and full national rollout.
- **Primary Care Behavioral Health Integration Act** (proposed): Would mandate Medicaid CoCM coverage in all states and fund the BHCM Corps. Contact your member of Congress to request introduction or co-sponsorship.
- **Making Care Primary (MCP) Model**: CMS Innovation Center 10-year primary care transformation model includes behavioral health integration track. Support through public comments when CMS solicits feedback.
- **Mental Health Parity enforcement legislation**: Strengthened parity enforcement ensures that integrated services are covered without discriminatory limitations. Support bills adding transparency and reporting requirements to MHPAEA.
- **State-level CoCM Medicaid coverage**: If your state is among the 28 that do not reimburse CoCM codes under Medicaid, contact your state legislators and Medicaid director to advocate for coverage.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support requiring all state Medicaid programs to cover the Collaborative Care Model, which has been proven in over 90 clinical trials to improve mental health outcomes in primary care?"
2. "What is your plan to address the behavioral health workforce shortage? Do you support federal funding to train and deploy behavioral health care managers in underserved communities?"
3. "Would you support requiring health insurance companies to cover integrated behavioral health in primary care without prior authorization barriers?"
4. "How would you ensure that FQHCs, which serve 30.5 million patients, have the resources to provide fully integrated behavioral health care?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who distinguish between mental health rhetoric (acknowledging the crisis) and mental health policy (specific proposals for integration, workforce, and payment reform)
- Key committee assignments that matter: Senate HELP Committee, Senate Finance Committee, House Energy and Commerce Committee, House Ways and Means Committee, and state health committee equivalents
- Evaluate candidates on their record with the National Council for Mental Wellbeing and NAMI legislative scorecards

## Professional Actions

- **For primary care providers**: Explore CoCM implementation through the AIMS Center (<https://aims.uw.edu>) training programs. Advocate within your practice or health system for hiring a behavioral health care manager. Bill CoCM codes (CPT 99492-99494) if you deliver integrated services; increased billing creates the utilization data that drives payer adoption.
- **For behavioral health professionals**: Seek training in primary care integration settings. Consider transitioning to or adding a behavioral health care manager role. Join the Collaborative Family Healthcare Association (CFHA) for professional development in integrated care.
- **For health system administrators**: Implement CoCM in at least one pilot site; use Intermountain Healthcare and Cherokee Health Systems as implementation models. Calculate the ROI of integration using the AIMS Center's business case tools. Advocate to your EHR vendor for behavioral health integration features.
- **For educators and training program directors**: Embed integrated care training in medical school, residency, and behavioral health graduate curricula. Apply for HRSA Title VII and Graduate Psychology Education grants for integration-focused training programs. Develop clinical practicum sites in integrated primary care settings.
- **For insurance and managed care executives**: Add CoCM codes to your covered benefits without prior authorization. Develop value-based contracts that reward behavioral health integration outcomes. Engage with the Diamond Initiative model for multi-payer CoCM collaboration.
- **For employers and HR professionals**: Ask your health plan whether it covers CoCM services. Advocate for behavioral health integration as part of your employee health benefits. Track the impact of mental health coverage on absenteeism and disability claims.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing primary care and mental health integration with others, emphasize:

1. **The evidence is overwhelming**: The Collaborative Care Model has been proven in over 90 randomized controlled trials to double depression remission rates compared to usual care, yet fewer than 3% of primary care practices use it (AIMS Center, 2024; Psychiatry and Behavioral Health Learning Network, 2023).
2. **The treatment gap is a policy failure, not an inevitability**: 57.8% of adults with mental illness (28.3 million people) receive no treatment (SAMHSA, 2022). The solutions exist; what is missing is the payment, workforce, and policy infrastructure to deliver them.
3. **Integration saves money**: CoCM has been shown to save $3,363 per patient over four years in reduced total medical costs (Unutzer et al., 2016). Untreated mental illness costs the U.S. economy an estimated $280 billion annually (Insel, 2022).
4. **Rural and underserved communities need this most**: 160 million Americans live in Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HRSA, 2024). Telehealth-enabled integration through psychiatric access programs and Project ECHO is the most viable pathway to behavioral health access for rural communities.
5. **Payment reform is the key**: Only 22 states reimburse CoCM under Medicaid, and fewer than 40% of commercial payers cover CoCM codes. Without payment, practices cannot sustain integration regardless of the evidence.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Integrating mental health into primary care will lower quality of care" | CoCM delivers care through structured teams with psychiatric oversight and measurement-based protocols, producing outcomes superior to traditional specialty referral for common conditions | Archer et al., *Cochrane Review*, 2012 (79 RCTs) |
| "Primary care providers don't have time for mental health" | CoCM uses embedded care managers to handle the time-intensive work; the PCP's role is to prescribe and adjust treatment based on team recommendations | AIMS Center CoCM implementation guide |
| "Integration costs too much" | CoCM saves $3,363 per patient over 4 years in total medical costs; untreated mental illness costs $280 billion/year in lost productivity and excess spending | Unutzer et al., 2016; Insel, 2022 |
| "People with mental health needs should see specialists" | Over 50% of patients referred to specialty behavioral health never complete the referral; integration eliminates this handoff failure | Cunningham, *Health Affairs*, 2009 |
| "The workforce doesn't exist to do this" | The workforce shortage is real but addressable through the BHCM Corps, telehealth-enabled consultation, and Project ECHO capacity building; the current shortage is perpetuated by the lack of infrastructure, not inherent limits | HRSA workforce data, 2024 |
