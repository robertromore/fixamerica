# Primary Care and Mental Health Integration: Solutions

Transforming the integration of behavioral health into primary care requires a multi-faceted approach that simultaneously addresses payment misalignment, workforce shortages, technology gaps, and organizational culture to move from fewer than 3% of practices using evidence-based models to universal access within a decade.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Evidence-based models (CoCM and validated adaptations) should be the foundation, while allowing flexibility for diverse practice settings
- Payment must align with the population-based, team-based nature of integrated care rather than fee-for-service encounter billing
- Workforce development must create new training pathways and expand existing pipelines to meet integration demand
- Technology must enable rather than obstruct integration, with shared records, registries, and telehealth as standard infrastructure
- Equity must guide implementation, prioritizing underserved populations and settings where specialty behavioral health is unavailable

### Theory of Change

The current integration gap is driven by the interaction of misaligned payment, insufficient workforce, inadequate technology, and siloed professional culture. No single reform will produce transformation because these barriers reinforce each other. The proposed strategy addresses all four barriers simultaneously through a coordinated federal-state initiative that provides financial incentives, workforce capacity, technical assistance, and regulatory framework reform. By creating the conditions for integration to be economically viable, professionally supported, technically feasible, and culturally normalized, the strategy breaks the self-reinforcing cycle of fragmentation.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Universal CoCM Payment Mandate

**Description**: Require all public and private payers to cover Collaborative Care Model services at Medicare-equivalent rates or above. Extend mandatory CoCM coverage to all 50 state Medicaid programs (currently 22 states), require commercial payers to cover CoCM codes without prior authorization, and establish minimum reimbursement floors indexed to the Medicare physician fee schedule. This addresses the fundamental economic barrier to integration: practices cannot sustainably deliver CoCM without adequate, predictable reimbursement.

**Evidence Base**: The University of Washington AIMS Center has documented that practices reaching 150+ patient caseloads with CoCM billing at Medicare rates achieve financial sustainability within 12-18 months (AIMS Center, 2023). In Washington State, Medicaid CoCM coverage has been associated with a 3.5x increase in CoCM adoption compared to non-coverage states (Washington State Health Care Authority, 2022). Medicare CoCM billing has grown 30% year-over-year since 2017 but remains limited by practice awareness and infrastructure.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation mandating Medicaid CoCM coverage (modeled on the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act framework); CMS rulemaking to update Medicare CoCM rates annually; state insurance commissioner enforcement of commercial coverage mandates.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $2.4 billion annually in new Medicaid CoCM spending (based on 26% of adult Medicaid beneficiaries with mental health conditions, 30% engagement rate, average CoCM cost of $1,800/patient/year). Partially offset by reductions in ED use and hospitalization estimated at $1.2-1.8 billion (Congressional Budget Office methodology).

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; Medicaid implementation over Years 2-3; commercial payer compliance by Year 3.

**Challenges**: State Medicaid budget concerns; commercial payer resistance to new mandates; need for practices to build infrastructure before billing.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of primary care practices billing CoCM codes (target: 25% by Year 5, 60% by Year 10); Medicaid CoCM encounter volume; average CoCM reimbursement rate relative to Medicare benchmark.

### Solution 2: Behavioral Health Care Manager Workforce Pipeline

**Description**: Establish a new federal Behavioral Health Care Manager Corps, modeled on the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), that trains, certifies, and deploys BHCMs to primary care practices in underserved areas. Create a standardized BHCM certification through collaboration between SAMHSA, HRSA, and professional associations. Fund 10,000 new BHCM training positions over five years through competitive grants to schools of social work, nursing, and counseling.

**Evidence Base**: The BHCM role is central to CoCM but has no standardized training pathway. Fewer than 10,000 professionals currently serve in this capacity nationally (AIMS Center estimate, 2023). The NHSC model has demonstrated success in deploying health professionals to shortage areas through loan repayment and scholarship incentives, with over 20,000 clinicians currently serving in NHSC-supported positions (HRSA, 2024).

**Implementation**: HRSA administers the new corps; certification standards developed by an interagency working group; training programs hosted at accredited institutions with clinical practica in integrated primary care settings.

**Cost/Resources**: $1.5 billion over five years ($300 million/year) for training stipends, loan repayment, and program administration. Estimated cost per BHCM trained: $75,000 (2-year certification program including clinical placement).

**Timeline**: Program design and accreditation standards in Year 1; first cohort enrollment in Year 2; first 2,000 certified BHCMs deployed by Year 3; 10,000 by Year 7.

**Challenges**: Developing standardized certification acceptable to all states; recruiting candidates to underserved areas; ensuring training program quality.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of certified BHCMs; geographic distribution relative to MHPSAs; practice-level patient registry caseload sizes; BHCM retention rates at 3 and 5 years.

### Solution 3: Statewide Psychiatric Access Programs in All 50 States

**Description**: Expand statewide psychiatric access programs (modeled on the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program, MCPAP) to all 50 states for both adult and child populations. These programs provide real-time teleconsultation to any primary care provider in the state, enabling PCPs to receive same-day psychiatric guidance without patient referral. Fund through a combination of federal grants and state Medicaid administrative matching.

**Evidence Base**: MCPAP, launched in 2004, has been replicated in over 40 states for child psychiatry. Studies show MCPAP reduced child psychiatry wait times from 6-8 months to same-day consultation and increased PCP comfort with prescribing psychotropic medications by 60% (Sarvet et al., *Pediatrics*, 2010). Adult psychiatric access programs exist in fewer than 15 states and cover fewer populations.

**Implementation**: HRSA competitive grants to states for program establishment or expansion; model program specifications based on MCPAP and Project ECHO frameworks; mandatory participation of all Medicaid-enrolled primary care providers.

**Cost/Resources**: $500 million over five years ($100 million/year in federal grants plus state match). Average state program operating budget: $3-8 million/year depending on state size.

**Timeline**: Grant competition in Year 1; first new state programs operational in Year 2; all 50 states with adult and child programs by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Recruiting sufficient consulting psychiatrists; ensuring program sustainability after federal grant funding ends; adapting models for states with very low psychiatrist density.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of states with operational adult psychiatric access programs; consultation volume per state; PCP utilization rates; time to consultation; patient outcomes (PHQ-9/GAD-7 score improvement).

### Solution 4: Integration-Ready EHR Standards

**Description**: Require all EHR systems certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program to include core behavioral health integration functionality: patient registries with population-based tracking, behavioral health screening templates (PHQ-9, GAD-7, AUDIT-C) integrated into primary care workflows, shared care plan modules for PCP-BHCM-psychiatrist collaboration, and CoCM billing automation. Establish these requirements as part of the existing ONC certification criteria.

**Evidence Base**: Fewer than 20% of primary care EHR systems currently support CoCM workflows (ONC Health IT Dashboard, 2023). Practices adopting CoCM frequently cite EHR limitations as a top-3 barrier (AIMS Center implementation survey, 2023). EHR-integrated screening has been shown to increase depression screening rates from 25-40% to 80-95% in health systems that implemented it (Commonwealth Fund, 2023).

**Implementation**: ONC rulemaking under existing 21st Century Cures Act authority; EHR vendor compliance timeline of 24 months from final rule; certification testing for behavioral health functionality.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal federal cost (regulatory action); vendor compliance costs estimated at $50-200 million across major EHR companies (absorbed in product development cycles). Practice-level cost: included in standard EHR licensing.

**Timeline**: Proposed rule in Year 1; final rule in Year 2; vendor compliance deadline in Year 4.

**Challenges**: EHR vendor resistance; potential burden on small vendors; defining minimum functional requirements without stifling innovation.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of certified EHRs meeting behavioral health integration standards; practice-level registry utilization; screening rate changes in practices using upgraded EHRs.

### Solution 5: FQHC Integration Mandate with Enhanced Funding

**Description**: Require all FQHCs to achieve Level 5-6 integration (fully integrated behavioral health) within five years as a condition of Section 330 grant funding. Provide $3 billion in targeted integration capacity funding over five years to support workforce hiring, training, EHR upgrades, and telehealth infrastructure. Establish integration performance metrics as part of the Uniform Data System (UDS) reporting requirements.

**Evidence Base**: FQHCs serve 30.5 million patients, disproportionately low-income and minority, and 78% already offer some behavioral health services (HRSA UDS, 2023). However, fewer than 15% have achieved full integration (NACHC estimate, 2023). FQHCs that have implemented CoCM report 30-40% higher depression remission rates than those without integration (Reiss-Brennan et al., *Journal of General Internal Medicine*, 2016).

**Implementation**: HRSA rulemaking updating Section 330 grant requirements; phased compliance timeline (Year 1-2 for large FQHCs, Year 3-5 for smaller sites); dedicated supplemental grants for integration infrastructure.

**Cost/Resources**: $3 billion over five years ($600 million/year) for integration grants; offset by expected reductions in ED use by FQHC patient populations (estimated $800 million over five years).

**Timeline**: Rulemaking in Year 1; first-wave compliance for large FQHCs by Year 3; universal compliance by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Small and rural FQHCs may struggle to recruit behavioral health staff; telehealth may be necessary where in-person co-location is infeasible; need to avoid unfunded mandates.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of FQHCs at Level 5-6 integration; behavioral health screening rates in UDS data; depression remission rates; patient satisfaction with integrated services.

### Solution 6: Project ECHO Expansion for Behavioral Health

**Description**: Fund a national expansion of Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) hubs focused on behavioral health integration. Establish 100 new ECHO hubs at academic medical centers, with each hub serving 200-500 primary care practices through telementoring in depression, anxiety, substance use disorder, and child/adolescent behavioral health. Provide ongoing CME/CE credit for participating providers.

**Evidence Base**: Project ECHO was developed at the University of New Mexico and has been replicated in over 800 programs across 50 states and 45 countries (ECHO Institute, 2024). The model uses a hub-and-spoke framework where specialist teams at academic centers provide case-based telementoring to community providers, building capacity over time. Studies show ECHO participants achieve outcomes equivalent to specialist-treated patients for hepatitis C (Arora et al., *NEJM*, 2011) and behavioral health conditions.

**Implementation**: HRSA competitive grants to academic medical centers for ECHO hub establishment; standardized behavioral health integration curriculum; connection to BHCM training pipeline.

**Cost/Resources**: $250 million over five years ($50 million/year). Average ECHO hub cost: $500,000-$1.5 million/year. Cost per participating practice: approximately $2,000-$5,000/year.

**Timeline**: Grant competition in Year 1; first 30 hubs operational in Year 2; 100 hubs serving 20,000+ practices by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Maintaining provider engagement over time; measuring clinical impact at practice level; ensuring sustainability beyond federal funding.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of ECHO hubs and participating practices; provider knowledge and confidence scores; patient-level clinical outcomes; prescribing pattern changes.

### Solution 7: Medicaid Behavioral Health Carve-In Incentive

**Description**: Provide enhanced federal Medicaid matching (10 percentage point FMAP increase for 5 years) to states that eliminate behavioral health carve-outs and integrate behavioral health benefits into general managed care contracts. Carve-in plans must include CoCM coverage, integration quality metrics in managed care contracts, and network adequacy requirements for behavioral health providers in primary care settings.

**Evidence Base**: States that have carved behavioral health into general Medicaid managed care have generally seen improved care coordination, reduced administrative complexity, and better integration outcomes. A 2019 MACPAC analysis found that carve-out plans had 23% lower access rates for mental health services (MACPAC, 2019). Multiple states (e.g., Washington, Oregon, Arizona) have demonstrated successful carve-in transitions.

**Implementation**: CMS State Plan Amendment approval process; enhanced FMAP authorized by Congress; state implementation support from SAMHSA-HRSA CIHS.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $1.5-2.5 billion annually in enhanced federal match (depending on state uptake). Cost-neutral or cost-saving over 10 years as integration reduces total cost of care.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; first states transitioning in Year 2-3; target 35+ states carved in by Year 7.

**Challenges**: Strong MBHO lobbying opposition; state administrative transition complexity; ensuring network adequacy during transition period.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of states with carved-in behavioral health; Medicaid behavioral health access rates; emergency department utilization for behavioral health conditions; total cost of care per beneficiary.

### Solution 8: Training Transformation Grants

**Description**: Fund curriculum reform in medical schools, family medicine residencies, and behavioral health graduate programs to embed integrated care training as a core competency. Require ACGME-accredited primary care residencies to include structured CoCM training. Fund 200 integrated care training grants to schools of medicine, social work, psychology, and nursing over five years.

**Evidence Base**: Only 34% of family medicine residency programs offer structured CoCM training (AAFP, 2022). Only 12% of clinical psychology internship programs include primary care integration rotations (APA, 2023). The training pipeline produces clinicians who are unprepared for integrated practice, perpetuating the culture of separation.

**Implementation**: HRSA Graduate Psychology Education grants and Title VII primary care training grants expanded to include integration requirements; ACGME residency review committee standards updated; CSWE social work accreditation standards updated.

**Cost/Resources**: $400 million over five years ($80 million/year). Average grant: $500,000-$1 million per institution over 3 years.

**Timeline**: Grant competition in Year 1; first cohort of reformed programs in Year 2; all primary care residencies meeting integration training standards by Year 7.

**Challenges**: Academic inertia; competing curriculum priorities; accreditation body timelines.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of primary care residencies with integrated care training; percentage of behavioral health graduates with primary care integration experience; trainee competency assessments; post-training practice integration rates.

## International Models

### United Kingdom: Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)

**Description**: The NHS launched IAPT in 2008 as a national program to provide evidence-based psychological therapies for depression and anxiety, primarily through general practice (primary care) settings. IAPT trains thousands of psychological wellbeing practitioners who deliver stepped care, including guided self-help and cognitive behavioral therapy, in GP surgeries.

**Results**: By 2022, IAPT was treating over 1.2 million people annually with a 50% recovery rate for those completing treatment (NHS Digital, 2022). Wait times for initial assessment were reduced to an average of 6 days (vs. months for traditional specialty referral). The program has been credited with reducing disability benefit claims and increasing employment among participants.

**Applicability to U.S.**: IAPT demonstrates that a national workforce training and deployment program can dramatically increase access to primary care-based psychological treatment. The U.S. would need to adapt for its multi-payer system, but the core model of training a new cadre of workers for stepped care in primary care settings directly parallels the proposed BHCM Corps.

### Canada: Quebec Collaborative Care Networks

**Description**: Quebec has implemented province-wide collaborative care networks that embed mental health professionals in family medicine groups (Groupes de medecine de famille, GMFs). Every GMF has access to a psychologist or social worker for integrated behavioral health, funded through the provincial health insurance system.

**Results**: A 2019 evaluation found that GMFs with embedded behavioral health achieved 35% higher rates of follow-up care for depression and 28% lower emergency department use for mental health conditions compared to GMFs without embedded services (Fleury et al., *Canadian Journal of Psychiatry*, 2019).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Quebec model demonstrates integration at scale within a single-payer system. While the U.S. cannot replicate single-payer financing, the model's use of standardized embedding protocols and province-wide quality metrics provides a template for state-level integration mandates.

### Australia: Primary Health Networks and Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS/AMHSP)

**Description**: Australia funds integrated behavioral health in primary care through Primary Health Networks (PHNs), which commission mental health services for GP practices, including psychological services, psychiatric consultation, and care coordination. The Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule reimburses GPs for mental health treatment plans and up to 10 individual allied health sessions per year.

**Results**: Australia has achieved 70%+ GP screening rates for depression using routine screening mandates and incentive payments (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2022). The system provides universal access to primary care-based mental health treatment, though regional access disparities persist.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Australian model demonstrates how payment incentives for GPs (similar to quality bonus payments) combined with commissioned community-based services can drive high screening and treatment rates. The PHN commissioning model could inform how U.S. Accountable Care Organizations or state Medicaid programs contract for integrated services.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Cherokee Health Systems (Tennessee)**: One of the oldest and most studied integrated care models in the U.S., Cherokee has provided fully integrated primary and behavioral health care since the 1980s. Depression remission rates exceed 50%, and total cost of care is 20% below comparable non-integrated systems (Cherokee Health Systems, 2022).
- **Intermountain Healthcare Mental Health Integration**: Intermountain implemented CoCM across its primary care network in Utah, demonstrating that large health system adoption is feasible. Results showed 46% depression remission at 12 months and $2,800 per patient savings in total medical costs (Reiss-Brennan et al., *Journal of General Internal Medicine*, 2016).
- **Diamond Initiative (Minnesota)**: A statewide CoCM implementation supported by major health plans, demonstrating multi-payer collaboration. Participating clinics achieved 40% depression response rates, and six health plans agreed on unified CoCM payment (Rossom et al., *Psychiatric Services*, 2017).
