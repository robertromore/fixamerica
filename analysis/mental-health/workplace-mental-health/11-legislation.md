# Workplace Mental Health: Legislation

## Overview

Workplace mental health reform requires a multi-layered legislative strategy combining federal regulation, statutory mandates, state model legislation, and administrative action. The legislative approach is incremental in phasing but comprehensive in scope, reflecting the reality that no single bill can address the full range of issues from OSHA psychosocial hazard standards to EAP modernization to paid mental health leave.

The federal legislative centerpiece is the Healthy Workplaces Act, which authorizes OSHA to develop enforceable psychosocial hazard standards and establishes a framework for employer compliance. This is complemented by the EAP Modernization Act (establishing minimum clinical standards for employer-sponsored counseling programs), the Workers' Compensation Mental Health Equity Act (setting federal minimums for state workers' comp coverage), and paid leave provisions integrated into a broader Healthy Workplaces Leave Act. State model legislation extends protections to workers not covered by federal law and provides regulatory laboratories for innovation.

No constitutional amendments are required for this reform. The Commerce Clause, combined with existing OSHA statutory authority under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, provides sufficient constitutional basis for federal regulation of workplace psychosocial hazards. However, the post-*Loper Bright* legal landscape increases the importance of clear statutory authorization for OSHA action.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments required for this reform.* The existing constitutional framework, particularly the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) and the Necessary and Proper Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 18), provides adequate authority for federal workplace mental health legislation. The OSH Act of 1970 already grants OSHA broad authority over workplace safety and health, and psychosocial hazard standards fall within this existing mandate.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Explicit congressional authorization for OSHA psychosocial hazard rulemaking
2. Requirement for employers to conduct periodic psychosocial risk assessments
3. Employer duty to implement control measures using the hierarchy of controls
4. Safe harbor provisions for employers demonstrating good-faith compliance

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to develop
and enforce standards addressing psychosocial hazards in the workplace,
and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Healthy Workplaces Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the American Psychological Association (2023), 76
percent of United States workers report experiencing burnout symptoms,
and workplace conditions are a significant contributor to the mental
health of the 160 million Americans in the labor force.

(2) The National Safety Council (2021) estimates that unaddressed
workplace mental health conditions cost employers $210,500,000,000
annually in lost productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism.

(3) The World Health Organization (2016) estimates a 4-to-1 return
on investment for employer mental health interventions, demonstrating
that prevention is cost-effective.

(4) Decades of occupational health research have established that
specific, measurable psychosocial hazards, including excessive workload,
low job control, poor social support, effort-reward imbalance,
organizational injustice, and workplace bullying, cause population-level
psychological harm independent of individual vulnerability.

(5) Australia, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, and
Denmark have adopted enforceable regulatory frameworks for psychosocial
hazards in the workplace, while the United States has no specific
standard addressing such hazards.

(6) The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651
et seq.) grants the Secretary of Labor broad authority to promulgate
standards ensuring safe and healthful working conditions, and
psychosocial hazards are recognized hazards within the meaning of
section 5(a)(1) of such Act.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) PSYCHOSOCIAL HAZARD.—The term "psychosocial hazard" means an
aspect of the design or management of work, or the work environment,
that increases the risk of work-related stress or psychological harm,
including but not limited to—
    (A) excessive job demands or workload;
    (B) low job control or decision latitude;
    (C) poor social support from supervisors or coworkers;
    (D) effort-reward imbalance;
    (E) organizational injustice;
    (F) role ambiguity or conflict;
    (G) job insecurity;
    (H) workplace bullying, harassment, or violence;
    (I) traumatic events or exposure to traumatic content; and
    (J) poor change management.

(2) PSYCHOSOCIAL RISK ASSESSMENT.—The term "psychosocial risk
assessment" means a systematic process of identifying psychosocial
hazards present in the workplace, evaluating the risks arising from
those hazards, and determining appropriate control measures.

(3) HIERARCHY OF CONTROLS.—The term "hierarchy of controls" means
the framework for controlling hazards that prioritizes, in order—
    (A) elimination of the hazard;
    (B) substitution of a less hazardous alternative;
    (C) engineering controls;
    (D) administrative controls; and
    (E) personal protective measures.

(4) VALIDATED INSTRUMENT.—The term "validated instrument" means a
psychometric tool that has demonstrated reliability and validity for
measuring psychosocial workplace conditions, as recognized by the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

SEC. 4. PSYCHOSOCIAL HAZARD STANDARD.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 36 months after the date of
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor, acting through the
Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, shall
promulgate a standard under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655(b)) requiring employers to—
    (1) conduct psychosocial risk assessments of the workplace using
    validated instruments at intervals not exceeding 24 months;
    (2) implement control measures to eliminate or minimize identified
    psychosocial hazards using the hierarchy of controls;
    (3) consult with workers and their representatives in conducting
    assessments and developing control plans;
    (4) maintain records of assessments, identified hazards, and control
    measures implemented; and
    (5) review and update assessments when there is a significant
    change in work design, organization, or conditions.

(b) PHASED IMPLEMENTATION.—The standard promulgated under subsection
(a) shall take effect—
    (1) for employers with 500 or more employees, not later than 12
    months after the date of promulgation;
    (2) for employers with 50 to 499 employees, not later than 36
    months after the date of promulgation; and
    (3) for employers with 15 to 49 employees, not later than 60
    months after the date of promulgation.

(c) SAFE HARBOR.—An employer that demonstrates good-faith compliance
with the requirements of the standard, including conducting timely
assessments and implementing reasonable control measures, shall not
be subject to penalties under section 17 of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 666) for violations arising from
the assessed conditions, provided the employer can demonstrate that—
    (1) the assessment was conducted using a validated instrument;
    (2) the employer consulted with workers in developing control
    measures;
    (3) the control measures were implemented within a reasonable
    timeframe; and
    (4) the employer reviewed the effectiveness of controls and made
    adjustments as necessary.

(d) ANTI-RETALIATION.—Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 660(c)) shall apply to any employee who
reports a psychosocial hazard, participates in a psychosocial risk
assessment, or exercises any right under the standard promulgated under
this section.

SEC. 5. COMPLIANCE ASSISTANCE.

(a) SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE.—The Secretary shall develop compliance
assistance materials, model risk assessment tools, and sector-specific
guidance to assist employers, particularly small businesses, in meeting
the requirements of the standard.

(b) CONSULTATION PROGRAM.—The Secretary shall expand the OSHA
Consultation Program under section 21(d) of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 670(d)) to include psychosocial
hazard assessment and control assistance.

(c) TRAINING.—The Secretary shall fund the development of training
curricula for employers, workers, and OSHA compliance officers on
psychosocial hazard identification, assessment, and control.

SEC. 6. REPORTING AND TRANSPARENCY.

(a) ANNUAL REPORTS.—Not later than 24 months after the date of
enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall
submit to Congress a report that includes—
    (1) the number of employers subject to the standard by size
    category;
    (2) compliance rates by employer size, industry, and geographic
    region;
    (3) enforcement actions taken;
    (4) aggregate results of psychosocial risk assessments;
    (5) trends in workplace-related mental health outcomes; and
    (6) recommendations for improvements to the standard.

(b) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY.—The Secretary shall make each report
submitted under subsection (a) publicly available on the internet
website of the Department of Labor.

(c) EMPLOYER REPORTING.—Employers with 500 or more employees shall
submit aggregate, anonymized psychosocial risk assessment results to
OSHA annually in a format prescribed by the Secretary. No individual
worker data shall be disclosed.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
    (1) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the congressional record with specific data supporting regulation, important for surviving legal challenge. The explicit finding that psychosocial hazards are "recognized hazards" addresses potential challenges under the General Duty Clause.
- **Section 3 (Definitions)**: Defines psychosocial hazards comprehensively but non-exhaustively, using the established occupational health taxonomy. The "validated instrument" definition ensures scientific rigor while allowing NIOSH flexibility to recognize new tools.
- **Section 4 (Psychosocial Hazard Standard)**: The core provision directs OSHA rulemaking within 36 months, with phased implementation by employer size. The safe harbor provision is critical for political feasibility, protecting good-faith employers from punitive enforcement.
- **Section 5 (Compliance Assistance)**: Addresses small business concerns by funding practical tools and expanding the consultation program. This section is essential for building bipartisan support.
- **Section 6 (Reporting)**: Creates transparency and accountability through annual congressional reporting and public disclosure of large employer assessment results. Aggregate, anonymized data protects worker privacy.
- **Section 7 (Appropriations)**: $850 million over 5 years funds OSHA rulemaking, enforcement, compliance assistance, and inspector training. This is approximately a 15% increase in OSHA's current budget.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 90 days after enactment | N/A |
| OSHA initiates rulemaking (advance notice of proposed rulemaking) | 6 months after enactment | OSHA |
| OSHA publishes proposed standard | 24 months after enactment | OSHA |
| Public comment period closes | 27 months after enactment | OSHA / Public |
| OSHA publishes final standard | 36 months after enactment | OSHA |
| Standard effective for 500+ employee firms | 48 months after enactment | Employers |
| Standard effective for 50-499 employee firms | 72 months after enactment | Employers |
| Standard effective for 15-49 employee firms | 96 months after enactment | Employers |

**Regulatory Authority**: OSHA, under the direction of the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health, administers the standard. NIOSH provides scientific support for validated instrument recognition and evidence review.

**Challenges**:

- **Legal challenge under the major questions doctrine**: *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022) and *Loper Bright v. Raimondo* (2024) create uncertainty about agency authority for novel regulatory approaches. Explicit congressional authorization in this Act mitigates but does not eliminate this risk.
- **Business opposition**: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and NAM will vigorously oppose. Safe harbor and phased implementation reduce but do not eliminate resistance.
- **Inspector capacity**: OSHA currently has ~1,850 inspectors for all workplace hazards. Adding psychosocial hazard expertise requires significant hiring and training.

**Refinements**:

- **Sector-specific standards**: As implementation proceeds, OSHA should develop sector-specific guidance for high-risk industries (healthcare, construction, emergency services, education).
- **Integration with state plans**: 22 states operate OSHA-approved state plans. Coordination provisions should ensure psychosocial hazard coverage in all state plans.
- **Digital tools**: OSHA should develop free, digital risk assessment tools to reduce compliance costs for small employers.

### The EAP Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Establish minimum federal standards for Employee Assistance Programs to ensure evidence-based care, adequate session limits, outcome measurement, and transparency.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Minimum 12-session limit per presenting problem
2. Requirement for evidence-based therapies (CBT, DBT, EMDR)
3. Mandatory outcome measurement using validated tools (PHQ-9, GAD-7)
4. Public reporting of utilization rates and aggregate outcomes
5. Care coordination with health insurance plans
6. Extension of EAP access to contract and gig workers through portable benefit model

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to
establish minimum standards for employee assistance programs, and
for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "EAP Modernization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Approximately 79 percent of employees at firms with 50 or more
workers have access to Employee Assistance Programs, yet average
utilization is only 3.5 to 5.5 percent (EASNA, 2023).

(2) The average EAP session limit of 3 to 8 sessions is insufficient
for evidence-based treatment of depression (which requires 16 to 20
sessions of CBT per NICE guidelines) or anxiety disorders (which
require 8 to 15 sessions).

(3) Individual-level wellness interventions without organizational
changes have shown no statistically significant mental health benefit
in large-scale research (Fleming, Industrial Relations Journal, 2023).

(4) An estimated 57 million gig and contract workers lack access to
employer-sponsored EAPs or mental health benefits.

SEC. 3. EAP MINIMUM STANDARDS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Part 7 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1185 et seq.) is
amended by adding at the end the following new section:

"SEC. 726. EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM STANDARDS.

"(a) MINIMUM SESSION LIMITS.—Any employee assistance program offered
by a group health plan or group health insurance issuer shall provide
not fewer than 12 sessions per presenting problem per plan year.

"(b) EVIDENCE-BASED CARE.—EAP counselors shall utilize evidence-based
therapeutic approaches as recognized by the American Psychological
Association or the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration.

"(c) OUTCOME MEASUREMENT.—EAP providers shall administer validated
outcome measures, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)
and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, at intake and
discharge for all clinical cases.

"(d) TRANSPARENCY.—EAP providers shall report annually to the plan
sponsor aggregate, de-identified data on utilization rates, presenting
problems, session utilization, outcome measure changes, referral rates,
and client satisfaction.

"(e) CARE COORDINATION.—EAP providers shall, with the consent of the
individual, coordinate with the individual's health insurance plan to
facilitate referral to ongoing treatment when clinically indicated.

"(f) PORTABLE EAP ACCESS.—The Secretary shall establish a mechanism
by which contract workers, gig workers, and self-employed individuals
may access EAP services through a pooled benefit arrangement, funded
by contributions from platform companies or hiring entities.".

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000 for each of
fiscal years 2027 through 2031 for the Department of Labor to
administer and enforce this Act.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

(a) The amendments made by section 3 shall take effect 24 months
after the date of enactment of this Act.
(b) The Secretary of Labor shall promulgate regulations implementing
this Act not later than 18 months after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3(a) (Session Limits)**: Increasing from 3-8 sessions to 12 aligns with evidence-based treatment protocols. Research shows that fewer than 8 sessions is insufficient for CBT treatment of depression (NICE, 2022).
- **Section 3(c) (Outcome Measurement)**: PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are validated, widely used, and take approximately 2-3 minutes to administer. This requirement enables evidence-based evaluation of EAP effectiveness.
- **Section 3(f) (Portable EAP)**: Addresses the gap for 57 million gig and contract workers through a pooled benefit model, funded by platform company contributions.

### The Workers' Compensation Mental Health Equity Act

**Purpose**: Establish federal minimum standards requiring all states to provide workers' compensation coverage for mental health conditions caused or substantially contributed to by workplace conditions.

**Key Provisions**:

1. All states must cover "mental-mental" claims (psychological injury without physical injury nexus)
2. Rebuttable presumption of work-relatedness for PTSD in first responders, healthcare workers, and other high-exposure occupations
3. Causation standard reduced to "substantial contributing factor" (replacing "predominant" or "exclusive" cause)
4. States have 3 years to comply or face loss of federal DOL grants

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish minimum federal standards for workers' compensation
coverage of mental health conditions, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Workers' Compensation Mental Health
Equity Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. MINIMUM STATE STANDARDS.

(a) MENTAL-MENTAL COVERAGE.—Each State shall provide workers'
compensation coverage for compensable mental health conditions arising
from workplace conditions, regardless of whether the claimant also
suffered a physical workplace injury.

(b) CAUSATION STANDARD.—No State shall require a claimant seeking
workers' compensation for a mental health condition to prove that
workplace conditions were the predominant, sole, or exclusive cause
of the condition. The applicable standard shall be that workplace
conditions were a substantial contributing factor to the condition.

(c) PRESUMPTION OF WORK-RELATEDNESS.—For the following occupations,
a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder,
or other specified trauma-related disorder shall be presumed to be
work-related if the individual was exposed to a qualifying event in
the course of employment:
    (1) Firefighters and emergency medical technicians.
    (2) Law enforcement officers.
    (3) Emergency dispatchers.
    (4) Healthcare workers in emergency, critical care, or psychiatric
    settings.
    (5) Military veterans employed in occupations involving trauma
    exposure.
    (6) Other occupations designated by the Secretary based on
    documented elevated exposure to traumatic events.

(d) COMPLIANCE DEADLINE.—States shall bring their workers'
compensation systems into compliance with this section not later than
3 years after the date of enactment of this Act.

(e) ENFORCEMENT.—A State that fails to comply with the requirements
of this section by the deadline established in subsection (d) shall
be ineligible for grants under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity
Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) until compliance is achieved.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated $50,000,000 for each of
fiscal years 2027 through 2031 for technical assistance to States
in achieving compliance.

SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

## State Model Legislation

### Model Workplace Psychological Safety Act

**Purpose**: Provide a template for states to adopt enforceable workplace mental health protections, either complementing or exceeding federal standards.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize employer size thresholds, penalty amounts, and enforcement mechanisms based on their existing occupational safety infrastructure. States with OSHA-approved state plans should integrate psychosocial hazard standards into their existing frameworks. States without state plans should establish independent state enforcement mechanisms.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Workplace
Psychological Safety Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) The Legislature finds that:
    (1) Psychosocial hazards in the workplace are a leading cause of
    mental health conditions, disability, and lost productivity among
    [State] workers.
    (2) Existing federal protections are insufficient to prevent
    workplace psychological harm.
    (3) Other jurisdictions, including Australia and the European Union,
    have successfully implemented enforceable psychosocial hazard
    standards.

(b) The purpose of this Act is to protect [State] workers from
preventable psychological harm by requiring employers to identify,
assess, and control psychosocial hazards.

SECTION 3. EMPLOYER REQUIREMENTS.

(a) Every employer with 15 or more employees shall:
    (1) Conduct a psychosocial risk assessment within 12 months of
    the effective date of this Act and at least every 24 months
    thereafter;
    (2) Develop and implement a psychosocial hazard control plan based
    on assessment results;
    (3) Consult with employees in conducting assessments and developing
    control plans;
    (4) Provide training to managers and supervisors on psychosocial
    hazard recognition and response; and
    (5) Maintain records of assessments, control plans, and training.

(b) The [State Labor Department/Occupational Safety Agency] shall
develop model assessment tools, guidance materials, and training
resources to assist employers in compliance.

SECTION 4. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) The [State Agency] shall enforce this Act through workplace
inspections, complaint investigations, and administrative penalties.
(b) Penalties for violations shall not exceed [$5,000] for a first
violation and [$25,000] for repeat violations.
(c) No employer shall retaliate against any employee for reporting
a psychosocial hazard or participating in an assessment.

SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect [12 months] after enactment.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Department of Labor

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Psychosocial Hazard Standard (29 CFR Part 1910, new subpart)**: Comprehensive standard defining employer obligations for psychosocial risk assessment and control. Statutory deadline: 36 months after enactment of the Healthy Workplaces Act.
2. **EAP Minimum Standards Regulation (29 CFR Part 2590, new section)**: DOL regulations implementing the EAP Modernization Act, including session limits, evidence-based care requirements, outcome measurement, and transparency. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment.
3. **Psychosocial Risk Assessment Reporting Rule**: OSHA regulation establishing the format and requirements for large employer reporting of aggregate risk assessment results. Deadline: 24 months after final psychosocial hazard standard.
4. **Workers' Compensation Compliance Guidance**: DOL guidance establishing criteria for determining state compliance with the Workers' Compensation Mental Health Equity Act. Deadline: 12 months after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: OSHA may impose civil penalties of up to $16,131 per serious violation and $161,323 per willful or repeat violation (current OSHA penalty levels, adjusted annually for inflation) for failure to comply with the psychosocial hazard standard.
- **Administrative Actions**: OSHA may issue citations requiring abatement of identified psychosocial hazards within specified timeframes. Failure to abate subjects employers to additional daily penalties.
- **Private Right of Action**: The legislation does not create a new private right of action. Workers who suffer retaliation may file complaints under Section 11(c) of the OSH Act. ADA and state tort remedies remain available for individual harm.
- **Criminal Penalties**: Existing OSHA criminal penalty provisions (29 U.S.C. 666(e)) apply to willful violations causing death. These could apply in extreme cases of workplace psychological harm leading to suicide.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: The regulation of workplace conditions has been consistently upheld under the Commerce Clause since *United States v. Darby Lumber Co.*, 312 U.S. 100 (1941). The OSH Act itself has never been struck down on Commerce Clause grounds. Psychosocial hazard regulation falls squarely within the established scope of federal workplace safety authority.

**Major Questions Doctrine**: Following *West Virginia v. EPA* (2022), courts may scrutinize whether OSHA has clear congressional authorization to regulate psychosocial hazards. The Healthy Workplaces Act addresses this by providing explicit statutory authorization, including detailed findings and specific rulemaking directives. This explicit authorization distinguishes the psychosocial hazard standard from the regulatory actions struck down in *West Virginia v. EPA*.

**First Amendment Considerations**: Employer speech about workplace culture, management philosophy, or organizational values is generally protected. The standard focuses on conditions and outcomes (hazard assessment and control), not on regulating employer speech. This is analogous to existing OSHA standards that require employers to take action (e.g., provide training, post warnings) without restricting expression.

### Preemption

The OSH Act preempts state occupational safety standards where a federal standard exists, unless the state has an OSHA-approved state plan (22 states and territories). The Healthy Workplaces Act should include a savings clause preserving state authority to establish more protective psychosocial hazard standards, consistent with the OSH Act's minimum-standard approach. The EAP Modernization Act amends ERISA, which broadly preempts state regulation of employee benefit plans; a careful savings clause is needed to preserve existing state EAP and mental health parity laws.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance monitoring will rely on: (1) OSHA inspections triggered by complaints or programmed inspections; (2) annual reporting by large employers; (3) workers' right to request inspections; (4) whistleblower protections encouraging worker reporting. The safe harbor provision reduces adversarial enforcement by rewarding good-faith compliance, shifting OSHA's role from punitive to collaborative for compliant employers.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Safe harbor abuse | Employers conduct superficial assessments and claim safe harbor protection without implementing meaningful controls | High | Require OSHA to define minimum assessment quality standards and document control measure implementation with worker verification |
| Employer size phase-in | Employers restructure into smaller entities to avoid coverage thresholds | Medium | Anti-evasion provision: treat commonly owned or controlled entities as a single employer for size determination purposes |
| Contractor exclusion | Employers classify workers as independent contractors to avoid coverage | High | Apply the standard to all workers performing work at a covered workplace, regardless of employment classification; adopt ABC test for worker classification |
| Assessment timing manipulation | Employers conduct assessments during low-stress periods to generate favorable results | Medium | Require assessments to reflect typical working conditions; OSHA may require re-assessment during representative periods |
| Gig worker EAP gap | Platform companies argue gig workers are not employees and thus not covered by EAP standards | High | The EAP Modernization Act's portable benefit provision addresses this, but enforcement depends on DOL rulemaking defining platform company contribution obligations |
| Retaliation through pretextual action | Employers retaliate against workers who report psychosocial hazards by using performance management or restructuring as pretext | Medium | Strengthen anti-retaliation protections with burden-shifting: once a worker establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the employer must prove legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Employers below 15 employees excluded from standard | ~12% of workers lack coverage | Political compromise to reduce small business opposition | OSHA consultation program; state laws can fill the gap; consider lowering threshold in future amendments |
| No private right of action for psychosocial hazard violations | Workers cannot directly sue employers for standard violations; must rely on OSHA enforcement | OSHA enforcement model traditionally excludes private right of action | Ensure adequate OSHA enforcement funding; preserve existing ADA, state tort, and workers' comp remedies |
| EAP modernization does not address clinical workforce shortage | Increased demand for EAP services may exceed available counselor supply | Decades of underinvestment in mental health workforce | Complementary workforce development legislation; expand NHSC loan repayment; integrate telehealth |
| Workers' comp reform relies on state compliance with federal minimum | Resistant states may delay or litigate rather than comply | Federalism constraints; political opposition in some states | Grant-loss enforcement mechanism; DOL technical assistance; model state legislation provides implementation pathway |
| Safe harbor may reduce enforcement rigor | Good-faith employers protected even if outcomes do not improve | Balance between encouraging compliance and ensuring effectiveness | Require periodic review of safe harbor criteria; sunset safe harbor after 5 years and replace with outcome-based standards |
| Psychosocial hazard measurement inherently less precise than physical hazard measurement | Validated instruments have measurement error; individual responses vary | Nature of psychological measurement | Use population-level assessment rather than individual diagnosis; require multiple assessment methods; establish NIOSH review of instrument validity |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Safe harbor quality standards**: Within 24 months of final standard, OSHA shall publish minimum quality standards for psychosocial risk assessments, including required sample sizes, validated instrument use, worker participation requirements, and documentation of control measure implementation.

2. **Anti-evasion provisions**: Add statutory language treating commonly owned, controlled, or affiliated entities as a single employer for purposes of employee size thresholds. Define "joint employer" status for staffing agencies and platform companies.

3. **Worker classification protection**: Incorporate the ABC test for worker classification (as used in California's AB 5) into the Healthy Workplaces Act, ensuring that workers performing services at a covered workplace are protected regardless of classification.

4. **Retaliation burden-shifting**: Amend Section 11(c) of the OSH Act to include burden-shifting for psychosocial hazard retaliation claims: once a worker establishes temporal proximity between protected activity and adverse action, the burden shifts to the employer to prove legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons.

5. **Five-year review and adjustment**: The Healthy Workplaces Act should include a mandatory 5-year review by GAO and the National Academies of Sciences, with recommendations for standard updates, safe harbor modifications, and coverage expansion.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The legislation should include a 10-year reauthorization requirement for appropriations, with mandatory GAO evaluation at Years 3, 5, and 8. The safe harbor provision should sunset after 5 years, at which point OSHA should evaluate whether to replace it with outcome-based compliance standards. The psychosocial hazard standard itself should not sunset, as workplace safety standards require long-term stability, but OSHA should be directed to review and update the standard at least every 7 years.
