# Workplace Mental Health: What You Can Do

Workplace mental health affects virtually every American worker, and meaningful reform requires active engagement from citizens at every level. With 76% of workers reporting burnout symptoms (APA, 2023), $210.5 billion in annual productivity losses (National Safety Council, 2021), and the United States lagging behind nearly every peer nation in psychosocial hazard regulation, the gap between the scale of the problem and the adequacy of the response is enormous. Individual, community, political, and professional actions can collectively drive the systemic changes needed.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to APA's *Work and Well-Being* annual report for the most comprehensive survey data on workplace mental health trends: <https://www.apa.org/pubs/reports/work-well-being>
- Read Mental Health America's annual *Mind the Workplace* report for worker-level perspectives on employer practices: <https://mhanational.org/mind-workplace>
- Follow OSHA's regulatory agenda for updates on psychosocial hazard rulemaking: <https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/unifiedagenda>
- Read the U.S. Surgeon General's *Framework for Workplace Mental Health and Well-Being* (2022) to understand the federal voluntary framework: <https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/workplace-well-being>
- Follow the WHO's workplace mental health guidelines (2022) for international best practices: <https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240053052>

### Make Personal Changes

- **Know your rights**: Review ADA reasonable accommodation provisions for mental health conditions. The Job Accommodation Network (JAN) provides free, confidential guidance at 1-800-526-7234 or <https://askjan.org>
- **Assess your workplace**: Take Mental Health America's free workplace mental health assessment to evaluate your employer's practices: <https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools/work-health-survey/>
- **Use available resources**: If your employer offers an EAP, use it. Current utilization is only 3.5%-5.5% (EASNA, 2023), and your use helps demonstrate demand. EAP services are confidential and typically cover 3-8 sessions at no cost.
- **Request accommodations**: If you have a mental health condition, consider requesting ADA accommodations. Common accommodations (flexible scheduling, telework, modified break schedule) cost employers $0 in the majority of cases (JAN, 2023). Only 3.2% of eligible workers currently request accommodations, partly due to stigma.
- **Document conditions**: If your workplace exposes you to psychosocial hazards (excessive workload, harassment, chronic understaffing, management abuse), document specific incidents with dates and details. This documentation supports workers' compensation claims, OSHA complaints, and accommodation requests.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact your representatives**: Urge support for workplace mental health legislation, particularly OSHA psychosocial hazard standards, EAP modernization, and paid mental health leave. Specify the bills by name when they are introduced.
- **Submit public comments**: When OSHA publishes its Request for Information or proposed rule on psychosocial hazards, submit a public comment describing your workplace conditions and supporting enforceable standards. Federal rulemaking requires public comment, and worker testimony is the most persuasive evidence.
- **Write letters to the editor**: Respond to local news coverage of workplace issues (burnout, healthcare worker shortages, teacher turnover) by connecting these stories to the need for systemic workplace mental health reform.
- **Share information**: Amplify key statistics and resources on social media and in workplace conversations. The $210.5 billion annual cost figure, the 76% burnout rate, and the comparison to international standards are compelling data points.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- **Form a workplace mental health advocacy group**: Connect with coworkers, local mental health organizations, and labor councils to advocate for better workplace practices and stronger regulations. NAMI affiliates in over 600 communities provide organizing infrastructure.
- **Host community education events**: Partner with local NAMI affiliates, Mental Health America chapters, or university psychology departments to hold public forums on workplace mental health. Focus on practical topics: workers' rights, accommodation requests, EAP utilization, and burnout prevention.
- **Engage local businesses**: Approach local business owners and chambers of commerce about workplace mental health best practices. The business case (4:1 ROI per WHO, reduced turnover, lower workers' comp costs) resonates with employers who may not respond to advocacy-only framing.
- **Support local mental health professionals**: Advocate for your community's mental health workforce through school board funding for counselors, city council support for community mental health centers, and county-level investments in crisis services.

### Build Coalitions

- **Connect workplace mental health to existing movements**: Link workplace mental health advocacy with labor rights, disability rights, healthcare access, and racial equity movements. The burdens of workplace psychological harm fall disproportionately on low-wage, frontline, and minority workers.
- **Engage faith communities**: Many religious organizations operate counseling and support programs. Partner with faith communities to destigmatize mental health help-seeking, particularly in communities where stigma is a primary barrier.
- **Collaborate with employer groups**: Progressive employers who already invest in workplace mental health can serve as champions. Organizations like One Mind at Work certify employer best practices and can connect advocates with supportive business leaders.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When OSHA announces any activity related to psychosocial hazard standards (Request for Information, proposed rule, public hearing)
- During congressional consideration of appropriations for OSHA, EEOC, and DOL (typically March-September)
- When workplace mental health legislation is introduced or scheduled for committee action
- After major workplace mental health incidents or reports (e.g., annual APA survey releases, Surgeon General statements)
- During election seasons, to establish workplace mental health as a constituent priority

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Enforceable Workplace Mental Health Standards

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State] writing to urge your support for
stronger workplace mental health protections. As a [worker/employer/
healthcare professional/concerned citizen], I have seen firsthand how
[brief personal connection to the issue].

I urge you to support:
1. OSHA development of enforceable psychosocial hazard standards,
   bringing the U.S. in line with Australia, the EU, and Japan
2. Modernization of Employee Assistance Programs with evidence-based
   clinical standards and meaningful session limits
3. Universal paid mental health leave through a social insurance model
4. Workers' compensation reform to cover workplace-caused mental health
   conditions in all 50 states

Workplace mental health costs the U.S. economy $210.5 billion annually
in lost productivity (National Safety Council, 2021), and 76% of workers
report burnout symptoms (APA, 2023). The current voluntary approach has
proven insufficient. I ask you to champion enforceable protections that
will benefit workers and employers alike.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm
calling to ask [Representative/Senator Last Name] to support enforceable
workplace mental health standards, including OSHA psychosocial hazard
regulations, EAP modernization, and paid mental health leave. Workplace
mental health costs $210.5 billion annually and affects 76% of workers.
Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current and anticipated legislation to support:

- **Mental Health Parity enforcement**: Support full MHPAEA enforcement through increased DOL and HHS funding. Contact members of the Senate HELP Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee.
- **First Responder and Healthcare Worker Mental Health Protection Act**: Workers' compensation PTSD presumptions and peer support grants. Contact members of relevant committees when introduced.
- **Manager Training Tax Credit**: $500 per manager credit for evidence-based mental health competency training. Encourage introduction through appropriations process.
- **OSHA Modernization**: Support appropriations increases for OSHA to build psychosocial hazard expertise. Contact members of Appropriations subcommittees for Labor-HHS.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support OSHA developing enforceable standards for psychosocial hazards in the workplace, similar to existing standards for physical hazards?"
2. "What is your position on establishing a federal paid mental health leave program through social insurance?"
3. "Will you support increased funding for the EEOC to enforce ADA mental health accommodation requirements?"
4. "Do you believe workers who develop PTSD or other mental health conditions from workplace exposure should be covered by workers' compensation?"
5. "What specific steps would you take to address the workplace burnout crisis affecting 76% of American workers?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Evaluate candidates' positions on OSHA authority and funding, as the agency is the primary vehicle for enforceable workplace mental health standards
- Review candidates' records on labor protections broadly, as workplace mental health reform builds on the same regulatory framework as physical safety
- Consider support for paid leave legislation, which is foundational to mental health leave access
- Examine committee assignments: the Senate HELP Committee and House Education and the Workforce Committee are the key legislative venues

## Professional Actions

Workplace mental health reform depends on action from specific professional communities:

- **For HR professionals**: Advocate within your organization for evidence-based mental health programs, including psychosocial risk assessments, meaningful EAP standards (12+ sessions, outcome measurement), and manager training. Use the business case ($210.5 billion in annual losses; 4:1 ROI) to secure executive support. Engage with SHRM's Mental Health Toolkit: <https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/topics/mental-health>
- **For managers and supervisors**: Complete Mental Health First Aid training through the National Council for Mental Wellbeing (<https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org>). Learn to recognize signs of distress, facilitate supportive conversations, and connect workers with resources. Model healthy work-life boundaries for your team.
- **For mental health professionals**: Advocate for EAP modernization within professional associations (APA, NASW, ACA). Provide evidence-based workplace mental health consultation. Serve as expert witnesses and public commenters in OSHA rulemaking. Conduct and publish research on workplace mental health interventions.
- **For occupational health professionals**: Champion psychosocial hazard assessment as a core occupational health function alongside physical hazard assessment. Advocate within ACOEM and AIOH for integration of psychosocial risk management into occupational health practice standards.
- **For union leaders and shop stewards**: Bargain for mental health provisions in collective agreements, including EAP access, paid mental health days, workload standards, and psychosocial risk assessments. File OSHA complaints regarding psychosocial hazards under the General Duty Clause. Document workplace conditions that cause psychological harm.
- **For attorneys**: Pursue ADA accommodation and discrimination cases involving mental health conditions. File workers' compensation claims for workplace-caused psychological injury. Challenge non-quantitative treatment limitations under MHPAEA. Represent workers in OSHA whistleblower proceedings.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing workplace mental health with others, emphasize:

1. **The scale of the problem**: 76% of U.S. workers report burnout symptoms (APA, 2023), and workplace mental health conditions cost $210.5 billion annually in lost productivity (National Safety Council, 2021). This is not a niche issue; it affects the vast majority of the workforce.
2. **The U.S. is a global outlier**: Australia, the EU, the UK, Japan, and Denmark all have enforceable psychosocial hazard regulations. The United States is the only major industrialized democracy with no specific regulatory standard for workplace psychological hazards.
3. **Prevention works and pays for itself**: The WHO estimates a 4:1 return on investment for workplace mental health interventions (2016). The cost of a single mental health workers' compensation claim ($42,000) or employee replacement ($15,000-$25,000) dwarfs the cost of prevention ($500-$2,000 per employer annually for risk assessment).
4. **Voluntary approaches have failed**: Despite the Surgeon General's 2022 framework and billions in corporate wellness spending, burnout rates remain at 76%, EAP utilization is stuck at 3.5%-5.5%, and only 3.2% of eligible workers request mental health accommodations. The data show that voluntary programs are insufficient.
5. **This is an occupational health issue, not just a personal one**: Research consistently demonstrates that specific workplace conditions (excessive workload, low autonomy, poor management, job insecurity) cause psychological harm independent of individual vulnerability. Workplace mental health is a workplace safety issue.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Workplace stress is just part of having a job" | Specific, measurable psychosocial conditions cause diagnosable mental illness. The WHO classifies burnout as an occupational phenomenon. | WHO ICD-11, 2019; Harvey et al., Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2017 |
| "Wellness apps and resilience training solve the problem" | A study of 46,336 workers found no measurable mental health benefit from individual-level wellness interventions. Organizational changes are required. | Fleming, Industrial Relations Journal, 2023 |
| "Mental health is a personal responsibility, not an employer's" | The OSH Act requires employers to provide workplaces free of recognized hazards. Psychosocial hazards are no different from physical ones in causing documented harm. | 29 U.S.C. 654; Karasek, 1979; Siegrist, 1996 |
| "Regulating psychosocial hazards is too subjective" | Validated instruments (COPSOQ, HSE Management Standards) have been used for decades in multiple countries. Australia enforces psychosocial hazard codes successfully. | Safe Work Australia, 2022; HSE UK, 2004 |
| "The costs would be prohibitive for businesses" | The 4:1 ROI for workplace mental health interventions means prevention saves money. The cost of inaction ($210.5 billion/year) vastly exceeds compliance costs. | WHO, 2016; National Safety Council, 2021 |
