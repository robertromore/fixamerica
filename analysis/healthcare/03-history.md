# Healthcare: History

## Overview

The American healthcare system evolved through a series of political battles, market developments, and policy choices that created its distinctive—and dysfunctional—structure. Unlike peer nations that built universal systems in the mid-20th century, the United States developed a fragmented patchwork of employer-sponsored insurance, public programs for specific populations, and large uninsured gaps. Understanding this history explains why reform is so difficult and why the system operates as it does.

## Lessons from History

### Why the U.S. Lacks Universal Coverage

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Path dependence** | Tax exclusion locked in employer system |
| **Federalism** | States can block national programs |
| **Interest groups** | Providers, insurers resist change |
| **Ideology** | "Socialized medicine" framing |
| **Racial politics** | Welfare state limited by exclusion |
| **Timing** | Missed post-war window for universal system |

### Patterns in Reform Failure

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Industry opposition | AMA (1940s), insurers (1990s) |
| Complexity | Clinton plan's managed competition |
| Federalism constraints | Medicaid expansion ruling |
| Political timing | Watergate (Nixon), midterms (Clinton) |
| Coalition fragmentation | Progressives vs. moderates |

### What Has Succeeded

| Success | Why It Worked |
|---------|---------------|
| Medicare (1965) | Narrow population, strong coalition |
| CHIP (1997) | Children = sympathetic population |
| ACA (2010) | Built on existing system, strong majority |
| State expansion | Ballot initiatives bypassed legislatures |
