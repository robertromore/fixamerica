# Healthcare Access

## Overview

Healthcare access encompasses the ability of individuals to obtain timely, affordable, and appropriate medical care. In the United States, access remains deeply unequal—shaped by insurance status, geography, income, race, and employment. Approximately 27 million Americans remain uninsured, while tens of millions more are underinsured with coverage that fails to protect against financial catastrophe.

## Reform Priorities at a Glance

| Priority | Approach | Feasibility |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Close coverage gap | Federal action for non-expansion states | Moderate (requires Congress) |
| Extend ACA subsidies | Make enhanced subsidies permanent | High (expiring 2025) |
| Expand Medicaid | Remaining 10 states | State-by-state |
| Address workforce shortages | Training, loan forgiveness, immigration | Medium-term |
| Reduce financial barriers | Out-of-pocket caps, medical debt reform | Achievable incrementally |
| Improve rural access | Telehealth, payment reform, facility support | Ongoing |

## Why This Matters

Access to healthcare is foundational to human dignity, economic productivity, and social stability. Lack of access leads to preventable deaths, financial devastation, and compounding health crises.

**Human Cost**:

- 45,000 excess deaths annually linked to lack of insurance
- Delayed diagnoses lead to worse outcomes and higher costs
- Medical debt is leading cause of bankruptcy

**Economic Cost**:

- Uncompensated care costs $42+ billion annually
- Lost productivity from untreated conditions
- Emergency care substitutes for cheaper primary care

**Systemic Cost**:

- Health disparities perpetuate inequality
- Rural community decline accelerates with hospital closures
- Workforce productivity suffers

Given America's federal structure, healthcare access raises fundamental questions about how to ensure baseline access nationwide while allowing states to adapt to local conditions.
