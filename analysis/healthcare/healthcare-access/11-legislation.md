# Healthcare Access: Legislation

## Overview

Achieving universal healthcare access requires a multi-pronged legislative approach: closing existing coverage gaps, strengthening the ACA framework, introducing public alternatives, and ultimately enabling broader structural reform. This legislative strategy prioritizes politically viable incremental steps while building toward comprehensive change.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for healthcare access reforms. Congress has established authority under the Commerce Clause and Taxing and Spending powers to regulate healthcare and establish coverage programs, as affirmed in *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012), with the limitation that Medicaid expansion cannot be coercively mandated on states.

## Federal Legislation

### Coverage Gap Elimination Act

**Purpose**: Provide federal coverage for the 2.2 million individuals in states that have not expanded Medicaid who earn too much for traditional Medicaid but too little for ACA subsidies.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Coverage Gap Elimination Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) approximately 2,200,000 individuals fall into a coverage gap in States
    that have not expanded Medicaid;
(2) these individuals earn below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level
    and are ineligible for premium tax credits under the ACA;
(3) lack of coverage leads to preventable deaths, financial hardship, and
    increased uncompensated care costs.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL COVERAGE FOR COVERAGE GAP POPULATION.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish
    a program to provide health coverage to individuals who—
    (1) have household income below 100 percent of the Federal poverty level;
    (2) are not eligible for Medicaid in their State of residence;
    (3) are not eligible for Medicare; and
    (4) are citizens or lawfully present.

(b) BENEFITS.—Coverage under this section shall include the essential health
    benefits described in section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection and
    Affordable Care Act.

(c) COST-SHARING.—The Secretary shall establish cost-sharing protections
    equivalent to those for individuals with income below 100 percent of
    poverty under Medicaid.

(d) ADMINISTRATION.—The Secretary may administer this program through—
    (1) contracts with qualified health plans on ACA exchanges;
    (2) direct enrollment in Medicare; or
    (3) a new federal program.

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as necessary to carry
out this Act.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act shall take effect on January 1 following enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This bill creates a federal fallback for individuals left behind by states that refused Medicaid expansion. It provides comprehensive coverage equivalent to Medicaid without requiring state participation.

**Challenges**: Cost (estimated $10-15 billion annually); political resistance in Congress; potential interaction with state Medicaid programs.

**Refinements**: Consider auto-enrollment through tax filing; integrate with existing ACA infrastructure; sunset provision to encourage state expansion.

### Permanent ACA Enhancement Act

**Purpose**: Make enhanced ACA subsidies permanent, extend subsidies to all income levels, and cap premiums at 8.5% of income.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Permanent ACA Enhancement Act".

SEC. 2. PERMANENT ENHANCED PREMIUM TAX CREDITS.
(a) Section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code is amended—
    (1) by striking the applicable percentage table and inserting the
        enhanced percentages established under the American Rescue Plan Act;
    (2) by striking "400 percent" each place it appears and inserting
        "no upper limit";
    (3) by ensuring that no household pays more than 8.5 percent of
        income for the benchmark plan.

SEC. 3. COST-SHARING REDUCTION FUNDING.
Congress hereby appropriates funds to fully reimburse insurers for
cost-sharing reductions as required by the Affordable Care Act.

SEC. 4. NAVIGATOR AND OUTREACH FUNDING.
(a) There are authorized to be appropriated $500,000,000 annually for
    Navigator programs.
(b) Funds shall be distributed to States based on uninsured population.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect for plan years beginning after December 31
following enactment.
```

**Explanation**: Makes the enhanced subsidies from COVID-era legislation permanent, eliminates the subsidy cliff at 400% FPL, and fully funds outreach.

**Challenges**: Cost (estimated $25-30 billion annually); requires overcoming budget rules; insurance industry may seek additional concessions.

### Public Health Insurance Option Act

**Purpose**: Create a federally administered public option available on ACA exchanges and to employers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Public Health Insurance Option Act".

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF PUBLIC OPTION.
(a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish a public
    health insurance option (referred to as "Medicare Part E") to be
    offered on exchanges established under the ACA.

(b) BENEFITS.—The public option shall provide—
    (1) essential health benefits under section 1302(b) of the ACA;
    (2) coverage for all services covered by Medicare Parts A and B;
    (3) prescription drug coverage equivalent to Medicare Part D.

(c) PREMIUMS.—Premiums shall be set to cover the cost of benefits and
    administration, without profit margin.

SEC. 3. PROVIDER PARTICIPATION AND PAYMENT.
(a) PARTICIPATION.—Any provider participating in Medicare shall
    participate in the public option unless opting out in writing.

(b) PAYMENT RATES.—Payment rates shall be set at Medicare rates plus
    10 percent for the first 5 years, transitioning to Medicare rates
    thereafter.

SEC. 4. EMPLOYER ACCESS.
Employers may offer the public option as an employee benefit, with
contributions treated equivalently to private insurance for tax purposes.

SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.
The public option shall be administered by the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services using existing Medicare infrastructure.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
The public option shall be available for enrollment beginning with
the plan year two years after enactment.
```

**Explanation**: Creates a government-run insurance option competing with private plans, using Medicare's administrative infrastructure and provider networks.

**Challenges**: Provider payment rates may limit participation; insurance industry opposition; potential for adverse selection if only sick enrollees choose public option.

---

## State Model Legislation

### State Public Option Act

**Purpose**: Allow states to create their own public option where federal action is delayed.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Public Option Act".

SECTION 2. ESTABLISHMENT.
The [State Insurance Commissioner/Health Authority] shall establish a
public health insurance option available to all State residents not
eligible for Medicare or Medicaid.

SECTION 3. BENEFITS.
The public option shall provide coverage of the essential health
benefits as defined by the Affordable Care Act.

SECTION 4. PREMIUMS.
(a) Premiums shall be set to cover the cost of claims and administration.
(b) No profit margin or shareholder return shall be included.

SECTION 5. PROVIDER PARTICIPATION.
(a) All providers participating in Medicaid shall participate in the
    public option.
(b) Payment rates shall be set at [Medicaid + 25% / Medicare rates].

SECTION 6. INTEGRATION WITH ACA.
The public option shall be offered on the State exchange and eligible
for premium tax credits.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect [date].
```

**Variation notes**: States may need federal waivers under Section 1332 to implement. Payment rates vary based on state Medicaid rates. Some states (WA, CO, NV) have enacted versions.

## Regulatory Framework

### CMS Regulations

**Authority**: Affordable Care Act, Social Security Act

**Key regulatory requirements**:

1. **Network Adequacy**
   - Maximum travel time/distance to providers
   - Minimum provider-to-enrollee ratios
   - Essential community provider requirements

2. **Auto-Enrollment**
   - Default enrollment for subsidy-eligible tax filers
   - Opt-out rather than opt-in
   - Integration with Medicaid renewal

3. **Standardized Plans**
   - Require standardized plan designs for comparability
   - Limit variation in cost-sharing structures
   - Simplify consumer choice

**Implementation timeline**: Regulations typically require 1-2 years from proposed rule to implementation.

**Enforcement mechanisms**: CMS certification of qualified health plans; state insurance commissioner enforcement; federal fallback enforcement.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Commerce Clause**: Established basis for ACA regulation of insurance markets
- **Taxing Power**: Premium tax credits well within congressional authority
- **Spending Power**: Federal coverage programs permissible; cannot coerce state Medicaid expansion per *NFIB*

### Preemption

- ERISA preemption limits state regulation of employer plans
- McCarran-Ferguson Act generally reserves insurance regulation to states
- ACA establishes federal floor; states may exceed

### Enforcement

- HHS/CMS enforcement of qualified health plan standards
- IRS enforcement of tax credit eligibility
- State enforcement of insurance regulations
- Private right of action for coverage denials

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Coverage gap workaround | States could structure Medicaid to create new gaps | Medium |
| Network adequacy gaming | Insurers could technically meet standards while limiting access | High |
| Short-term plan expansion | Administration could expand junk plans avoiding ACA requirements | High |
| Premium rate manipulation | Public option rates could be set to fail | Medium |
| Provider opt-out | Providers could refuse public option at allowed payment rates | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Employer coverage not addressed | Majority of insured still in fragmented employer system | Political difficulty of disrupting employer coverage |
| Undocumented exclusion | 11 million remain excluded from most coverage | Political opposition to immigrant coverage |
| Administrative complexity remains | Multiple programs, eligibility rules, enrollment periods | Incremental reform preserves existing structures |
| Cost-sharing still burdensome | Even with subsidies, deductibles can prevent care use | Balancing premium costs with cost-sharing |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Coverage gap workaround**: Include maintenance-of-effort requirements preventing state Medicaid reductions
2. **Network adequacy gaming**: Require secret shopper audits and appointment availability testing
3. **Short-term plan expansion**: Statutory limits on short-term plan duration and renewability
4. **Premium rate manipulation**: Require actuarial justification and public review of public option rates
5. **Provider opt-out**: Tie Medicare participation to public option participation; increase payment rates if necessary
6. **Undocumented exclusion**: Separate legislation allowing state/local coverage programs; eventual pathway to coverage

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Capacity**: CMS must scale to administer new programs
- **Funding**: Appropriations must match authorization
- **Transition**: Enrollment systems must handle increased volume
- **Political durability**: Risk of repeal with administration change
