# Healthcare Access: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Achieving universal healthcare access requires building political coalitions, demonstrating success through incremental wins, and ultimately restructuring the coverage system. The roadmap proceeds through three phases, each building legitimacy and capacity for the next.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)

### Close the Coverage Gap

- Pass federal legislation providing coverage for 2.2 million in gap
- Use existing Medicaid infrastructure
- 100% federal funding initially, transitioning to standard FMAP

### Enhance ACA Subsidies

- Make enhanced subsidies permanent (currently expire 2025)
- Extend subsidies to all income levels (remove 400% FPL cliff)
- Cap premiums at 8.5% of income

### Improve Enrollment

- Fund navigator programs in all states
- Implement auto-enrollment for subsidy-eligible
- Streamline Medicaid/CHIP enrollment
- Integrate with tax filing

### Protect Existing Coverage

- Codify pre-existing condition protections
- Strengthen network adequacy standards
- Limit short-term junk plans

## Phase 2: Building Momentum

### Introduce Public Option

- Create federally administered plan on ACA exchanges
- Tie provider payments to Medicare rates + percentage
- Allow employer buy-in
- Demonstrate administrative efficiency

### Medicare Buy-In (55+)

- Allow individuals 55-64 to purchase Medicare
- Provide subsidies for those below 400% FPL
- Reduce individual market risk pool age

### Provider Distribution Reforms

- Expand National Health Service Corps
- Loan forgiveness for primary care in underserved areas
- Telehealth expansion for rural access
- Scope of practice reforms to utilize nurse practitioners

### Address Underinsurance

- Cap deductibles as percentage of income
- Limit out-of-pocket maximums
- Standardize plan designs for comparability
- Require first-dollar coverage for primary care

## Phase 3: Structural Reform

### Universal Coverage System

Option A: Medicare for All
- Transition to single-payer over 4-year period
- Comprehensive benefits, no premiums
- Funded through progressive taxation

Option B: Regional Systems (Under Federalism)
- Federal floor guarantees minimum coverage
- Regions may exceed floors (single-payer, public option, etc.)
- Equalization ensures all regions can meet floors
- Portability across regional boundaries

### Provider System Transformation

- Move toward salary/capitation from fee-for-service
- Integrate behavioral health with primary care
- Invest in community health workers
- Address social determinants through healthcare system

## Success Metrics

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| Universal coverage | Uninsured rate | < 2% |
| Affordability | Medical bankruptcy rate | < 10% of current |
| Access | Average wait for appointment | < 2 weeks primary care |
| Equity | Coverage rate by race/income | < 2% variation |
| Satisfaction | Patient experience scores | > 80% positive |
| Cost | Healthcare spending as % GDP | < 12% |

## Risk Mitigation

### Political Resistance

- Build bipartisan coalition on incremental steps
- Demonstrate success in willing states/regions
- Engage provider groups as allies
- Frame as economic competitiveness issue

### Implementation Challenges

- Phase transitions to avoid disruption
- Maintain provider participation through adequate payment
- Invest in IT infrastructure
- Train enrollment workforce

### Legal Challenges

- Draft legislation to survive constitutional scrutiny
- Build on established precedents (Medicare, Medicaid)
- Avoid mandates vulnerable to NFIB-style challenges
- Consider tax-based mechanisms
