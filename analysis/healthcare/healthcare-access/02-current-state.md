# Healthcare Access: Current State

## Overview

The United States healthcare system produces paradoxical outcomes: world-class care for some, inaccessibility for many. Access varies dramatically by state, insurance status, geography, race, and income. While the Affordable Care Act reduced the uninsured rate by nearly half, 27.5 million Americans remain without coverage, and tens of millions more are underinsured with coverage that fails to protect against financial catastrophe.
