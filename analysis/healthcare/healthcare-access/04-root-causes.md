# Healthcare Access: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

Why does the United States—the wealthiest nation in history—fail to ensure healthcare access for all residents?

### Structural Causes

**Fragmented Coverage System**

The U.S. lacks a unified coverage mechanism. Instead:

- Employer coverage depends on job status
- Medicare covers only those 65+ or disabled
- Medicaid covers only the poor (in expansion states)
- Individual market is expensive without subsidies
- No automatic enrollment or universal default

**Coverage Tied to Employment**

- Job loss = coverage loss
- Part-time and gig workers often excluded
- Small employers often cannot afford coverage
- "Job lock" prevents entrepreneurship and mobility

**State-Level Fragmentation**

- Medicaid eligibility varies by state
- Insurance regulations differ across borders
- Provider networks are state-specific
- No national floor for access

### Institutional Causes

**Insurance Industry Profit Model**

- Risk selection incentives (avoiding sick enrollees)
- Administrative complexity as barrier
- Prior authorization delays care
- Narrow networks limit choice

**Provider Distribution Failures**

- Market-driven physician location (concentrates in wealthy areas)
- No requirement for geographic equity
- Specialist concentration in urban centers
- Medical education debt discourages primary care and rural practice

**Regulatory Fragmentation**

- 50+ state insurance regulators
- No federal authority over provider distribution
- Scope of practice laws limit nurse practitioners
- Certificate of need laws distort facility placement

### Political Economy

**Who benefits from the status quo?**

- Insurance industry: $1+ trillion annual revenue
- Pharmaceutical companies: U.S. prices 2-3x other countries
- Hospital systems: Consolidation enables price leverage
- Employer HR departments: Control over employee benefits
- High-income individuals: Tax exclusion worth more to wealthy

**Why change is blocked**

- Industry lobbying ($700+ million annually)
- Ideological opposition to government role
- Beneficiaries of current system are organized; uninsured are not
- Federalism enables state-level blocking

## Causal Diagram

```
Employment-based system → Coverage gaps for unemployed/underemployed
         ↓
State Medicaid variation → Geographic coverage cliffs
         ↓
Market-driven provider location → Rural/poor area shortages
         ↓
Insurance profit incentives → Administrative barriers to care
         ↓
     RESULT: Systematic access failures for vulnerable populations
