# Healthcare Access: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles

- **Universality**: Everyone should have access to necessary care
- **Portability**: Coverage should not depend on employment or location
- **Affordability**: Out-of-pocket costs should not prevent needed care
- **Adequacy**: Coverage should be comprehensive, not nominal
- **Simplicity**: System should minimize administrative barriers

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Close the Medicaid Coverage Gap

**Description**: Provide federal coverage for individuals in the "coverage gap"—those earning too much for pre-expansion Medicaid but too little for ACA subsidies in non-expansion states.

**Evidence**: Medicaid expansion states show:
- 40% reduction in uninsured rates
- Improved health outcomes
- Reduced uncompensated care
- Hospital financial stability
- No significant state budget burden (90% federal match)

**Challenges**:
- Requires federal legislation
- Political resistance in non-expansion states
- Creates different eligibility in same state

### Solution 2: Enhanced ACA Subsidies and Outreach

**Description**: Increase premium subsidies, cap out-of-pocket costs as percentage of income, fund navigator programs, and auto-enroll eligible individuals.

**Evidence**: Enhanced subsidies during COVID-19 increased enrollment by 3+ million. Auto-enrollment pilots show dramatic uptake increases.

**Challenges**:
- Ongoing federal funding required
- Does not address underlying fragmentation
- Insurance industry resistance to price controls

### Solution 3: Public Option

**Description**: Create a publicly administered insurance plan available to all, competing with private insurers on ACA exchanges and potentially employer markets.

**Evidence**: Public programs (Medicare, Medicaid) have lower administrative costs. Competition could reduce premiums. Provides fallback if private options fail.

**Challenges**:
- "Crowding out" concerns
- Provider payment rate controversies
- Political difficulty in Congress

### Solution 4: Medicare Expansion (Medicare for All or Medicare for More)

**Description**: Expand Medicare eligibility—either to all residents (single-payer) or to additional age groups (55+, children, etc.).

**Evidence**: Single-payer systems in other countries achieve universal coverage at lower cost. Administrative simplification could save $500+ billion annually.

**Challenges**:
- Transition disruption
- Job losses in insurance industry
- Requires significant tax increases (offset by eliminated premiums)
- Political viability uncertain

### Solution 5: State-Level Innovation

**Description**: Empower states to design coverage systems above federal floors—allowing state-level single-payer, state public options, or enhanced regulation through federal waivers.

**Evidence**: States like Massachusetts achieved near-universal coverage before ACA. Canadian provinces administer their own systems within federal framework. Several states have explored single-payer options.

**Challenges**:
- Risk of race to bottom without strong federal floors
- Cross-state care complications
- Varying state fiscal capacity

## International Models

| Country | System | Coverage | Cost (% GDP) | Outcomes |
|---------|--------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Canada | Single-payer, provincial | 100% | 10.8% | Good, some wait times |
| Germany | Multi-payer, mandated | 100% | 11.7% | Excellent |
| UK | National Health Service | 100% | 10.2% | Good, capacity constraints |
| France | Universal + supplemental | 100% | 11.1% | Excellent |
| USA | Fragmented | 91.6% | 17.3% | Poor relative to cost |

## Sequencing

1. **Immediate**: Close coverage gap via federal action
2. **Near-term**: Enhance ACA subsidies and auto-enrollment
3. **Medium-term**: Introduce public option
4. **Long-term**: Consider Medicare expansion or state innovation under federal framework
