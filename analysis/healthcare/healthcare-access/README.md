# Healthcare Access

Healthcare access encompasses the ability of individuals to obtain timely, affordable, and appropriate medical care. In the United States, access remains deeply unequal—shaped by insurance status, geography, income, race, and employment. Approximately 27 million Americans remain uninsured, while tens of millions more are underinsured with coverage that fails to protect against financial catastrophe.
