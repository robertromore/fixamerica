# Healthcare Access: History

## Overview

The history of healthcare access in America is a story of incremental expansion punctuated by failed attempts at universal coverage. Unlike peer nations that established comprehensive systems in the mid-20th century, the United States built a fragmented patchwork shaped by wartime accident, federalism, and sustained political opposition to government-guaranteed healthcare.

## Pre-Modern Era (Before 1900)

### Colonial and Early Republic

**Healthcare Before Modern Medicine**

| Era | Access Model | Limitations |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| Colonial | Family care, midwives, apothecaries | No formal system |
| Early Republic | Charitable hospitals, poor houses | Only for destitute |
| Mid-1800s | Voluntary hospitals emerge | Class-segregated |
| Late 1800s | Company doctors in mining/railroad | Limited to workers |

**Charitable Care System**

| Institution Type | Population Served | Funding |
|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Almshouses | Indigent sick | Local taxes |
| Religious hospitals | Poor of that faith | Church donations |
| Marine hospitals | Sailors | Federal (1798) |
| Dispensaries | Working poor | Philanthropy |

### Emergence of Modern Medicine

**Key Developments**

| Year | Development | Impact on Access |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| 1847 | AMA founded | Professionalization begins |
| 1860s | Germ theory accepted | Medicine becomes effective |
| 1873 | First nursing schools | Healthcare workforce grows |
| 1893 | Johns Hopkins model | Hospital-based training |
| 1910 | Flexner Report | Reduced physician supply |

**Flexner Report Consequences**

The 1910 Flexner Report closed half of medical schools, particularly those serving Black students and rural areas. While raising standards, it:

- Reduced physician supply
- Eliminated most Black medical schools (from 7 to 2)
- Created geographic maldistribution
- Made medicine more exclusive profession

## Progressive Era and Early Reform Attempts (1900-1940)

### First Push for Health Insurance

**Progressive Movement (1912-1920)**

| Year | Event | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1912 | Bull Moose platform includes health insurance | Roosevelt loses election |
| 1915 | AALL model bill proposed | AMA initially supportive |
| 1917 | AMA reverses position | Opposes "compulsory" insurance |
| 1918-19 | State campaigns fail | California, New York reject |
| 1920 | Movement collapses | WWI, Red Scare kill reform |

**Why the First Campaign Failed**

| Opposition | Argument |
|------------|----------|
| AMA | Threat to physician autonomy |
| Insurance industry | Government competition |
| Employers | Cost burden |
| Labor unions | Preferred bargaining for benefits |
| Anti-German sentiment | "Prussian" model rejected |

### Great Depression Era

**New Deal and Healthcare**

| Development | Year | Impact |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Social Security Act | 1935 | Excluded health insurance |
| Hill-Burton planning | 1930s | Hospital construction concept |
| Farm Security Administration | 1930s | Rural health cooperatives |
| Blue Cross/Blue Shield emerge | 1929-39 | Nonprofit hospital insurance |

**Why Health Insurance Was Excluded from Social Security**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| AMA opposition | Threatened to kill entire bill |
| Southern Democrats | Feared federal oversight of segregated hospitals |
| Complexity | Health insurance less understood than pensions |
| Political calculation | FDR prioritized passage |

---

## Employer-Based System Emerges (1940-1965)

### Wartime Accident Creates Modern System

**Key Policy Decisions**

| Year | Policy | Consequence |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1942 | Wage and price controls | Freeze on cash wages |
| 1942 | War Labor Board exempts benefits | Health benefits used to compete |
| 1943 | IRS Revenue Ruling 43-2 | Employer contributions tax-free |
| 1945 | War ends | Employer coverage entrenched |
| 1954 | IRC § 106 codified | Tax exclusion permanent |

**Growth of Employer Coverage**

| Year | Workers with Employer Coverage |
|------|--------------------------------|
| 1940 | 9% |
| 1945 | 24% |
| 1950 | 50% |
| 1960 | 68% |

### Truman's Failed National Health Insurance

**The 1945-1950 Campaign**

| Year | Event | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| 1945 | Truman proposes national health insurance | AMA launches opposition |
| 1946 | Republicans win Congress | Reform stalls |
| 1948 | Truman campaigns on healthcare | Wins upset victory |
| 1949 | Bill reintroduced | AMA spends $1.5M opposing |
| 1950 | Korean War begins | Reform abandoned |

**AMA Opposition Campaign**

The AMA's 1949-50 campaign was unprecedented in scale:

- $1.5 million spent (largest lobbying effort to date)
- "Socialized medicine" messaging
- Whitaker and Baxter PR firm
- Doctors distribute pamphlets to patients
- Coalition with business groups

### Post-Truman Incremental Approaches

**Kerr-Mills Act (1960)**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Purpose | Medical assistance for elderly poor |
| Funding | Federal-state matching |
| Coverage | Varied by state |
| Limitation | Only 32 states participating by 1963 |
| Legacy | Precursor to Medicaid |

---

## Medicare and Medicaid Era (1965-1985)

### The Great Society Breakthrough

**1965 Legislative Campaign**

| Factor | Role in Success |
|--------|-----------------|
| 1964 landslide | Democratic supermajorities |
| LBJ's skill | Master legislative tactician |
| Wilbur Mills | Ways and Means Chairman crafted compromise |
| AMA weakened | Public opinion shifted |
| Three-layer cake | Combined approaches satisfied factions |

**Medicare and Medicaid Architecture**

| Program | Population | Administration | Funding |
|---------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Medicare Part A | Elderly (65+) | Federal (SSA) | Payroll tax |
| Medicare Part B | Elderly (65+) | Federal (SSA) | Premiums + general revenue |
| Medicaid | Categorical poor | State-administered | Federal-state match |

### Implementation and Expansion

**Desegregation Impact**

Medicare implementation required hospital desegregation:

- Title VI compliance required
- 1,000+ hospitals integrated in months
- Federal dollars as leverage
- Southern healthcare transformed

**Program Growth**

| Year | Medicare Enrollment | Medicaid Enrollment |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1966 | 19 million | 4 million |
| 1970 | 20 million | 15 million |
| 1980 | 28 million | 22 million |

### Gaps in the New System

**Who Remained Uninsured**

| Group | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Working poor | Too much income for Medicaid, no employer coverage |
| Part-time workers | Excluded from employer plans |
| Early retirees | Gap before Medicare eligibility |
| Undocumented immigrants | Excluded from programs |
| Non-categorical adults | Medicaid only for specific groups |

---

## Managed Care and Market Era (1985-2010)

### EMTALA and Emergency Access

**Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (1986)**

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Medical screening | Determine if emergency exists |
| Stabilization | Cannot transfer until stable |
| No ability-to-pay inquiry | Before screening/stabilization |
| Transfer rules | Only appropriate transfers allowed |

**EMTALA Consequences**

| Effect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Safety net created | ERs became last resort |
| Unfunded mandate | Hospitals absorb costs |
| Cost-shifting | Insured patients pay more |
| Inappropriate use | ED used for primary care |
| Access without coverage | Treatment without prevention |

### Children's Health Insurance Program (1997)

**CHIP Design**

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Target population | Children in families 100-200% FPL |
| Administration | State flexibility (Medicaid expansion or separate) |
| Funding | Enhanced federal match |
| Enrollment | 2 million by 2000, 8 million by 2010 |

### Failed Reform Attempts

**Clinton Health Plan (1993-94)**

| Phase | Events |
|-------|--------|
| 1992 campaign | Clinton promises universal coverage |
| 1993 | Task force develops complex plan |
| 1993-94 | "Harry and Louise" ads attack |
| 1994 | Plan dies without vote |
| 1994 | Republicans win Congress |

**Why Clinton Reform Failed**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Complexity | 1,342-page bill incomprehensible |
| Secrecy | Task force process alienated Congress |
| Business opposition | Small business revolted |
| Insurance industry | $14 million ad campaign |
| Congressional dynamics | Democrats divided |

### Rising Uninsurance

**Uninsured Population Growth**

| Year | Uninsured (millions) | Percentage |
|------|----------------------|------------|
| 1987 | 31 | 12.9% |
| 1998 | 44 | 16.3% |
| 2008 | 46 | 15.4% |
| 2010 | 50 | 16.3% |

## Affordable Care Act Era (2010-Present)

### The 2010 Breakthrough

**Key ACA Provisions for Access**

| Provision | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Individual mandate | Required coverage (penalty) |
| Medicaid expansion | Coverage to 138% FPL |
| Insurance marketplaces | Subsidized individual market |
| Pre-existing conditions | Guaranteed issue, community rating |
| Essential health benefits | Minimum coverage standards |
| Young adult provision | Coverage to age 26 |

**Legislative Path**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| March 2009 | Obama begins push |
| July 2009 | House committees pass bills |
| December 2009 | Senate passes with 60 votes |
| January 2010 | Scott Brown wins MA Senate seat |
| March 2010 | House passes Senate bill, reconciliation fixes |
| March 23, 2010 | Obama signs ACA |

### Supreme Court Reshapes Access

***NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012)**

| Issue | Ruling | Consequence |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Individual mandate | Constitutional as tax | Mandate upheld |
| Medicaid expansion | Unconstitutionally coercive | Made optional for states |

**Coverage Gap Created**

The Court's Medicaid ruling created the coverage gap:

- Adults below 100% FPL in non-expansion states
- Too poor for marketplace subsidies (assumed Medicaid)
- Too "rich" for pre-ACA Medicaid (no coverage for non-disabled adults)
- 2.2 million in gap as of 2023

### Implementation and Expansion

**Medicaid Expansion Timeline**

| Year | States Expanded | Cumulative |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| 2014 | 25 + DC | 26 |
| 2015 | 4 more | 30 |
| 2020 | 4 more (including ballot measures) | 38 |
| 2023 | 2 more (NC, SD) | 40 + DC |

**ACA Coverage Gains**

| Year | Uninsured Rate | Uninsured (millions) |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| 2010 | 16.3% | 50.0 |
| 2016 | 8.6% | 27.3 |
| 2019 | 9.2% | 29.6 |
| 2023 | 8.4% | 27.5 |

### Recent Developments

| 2021 | *California v. Texas* | ACA upheld 7-2 |
| 2021 | American Rescue Plan | Enhanced subsidies through 2025 |

**COVID-19 Era Changes**

| Policy | Duration | Impact |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Medicaid continuous enrollment | 2020-2023 | Prevented disenrollment |
| Enhanced ACA subsidies | 2021-2025 | Lower premiums |
| Special enrollment periods | 2021-ongoing | Extended enrollment |
| Medicaid unwinding | 2023-2024 | Millions at risk of losing coverage |

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

1. **Incremental expansion**: Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, ACA each expanded coverage
2. **Categorical approaches**: Covering defined groups (elderly, children, poor) more achievable
3. **Ballot initiatives**: Direct democracy expanded Medicaid in resistant states
4. **Enhanced subsidies**: Lower premiums increase enrollment
5. **Automatic enrollment**: Reduces friction, increases coverage

### What Has Not Worked

1. **Comprehensive reform**: Truman, Nixon, Clinton all failed at universal coverage
2. **Voluntary expansion**: States left optional coverage gaps
3. **Employer reliance**: Leaves gaps for part-time, gig, and unemployed workers
4. **Individual mandate without enforcement**: Reduced enrollment pressure
5. **Complex systems**: Clinton plan's complexity contributed to defeat

### Recurring Patterns

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| AMA opposition | Every major reform from 1917-1965 |
| Federalism constraints | Medicaid variation, optional expansion |
| Incremental success | Each program expanded coverage |
| Crisis as opportunity | Depression, assassination, pandemic |
| Courts shape policy | *NFIB*, *King v. Burwell*, *California v. Texas* |
