# Healthcare

Healthcare in the United States presents a paradox: the nation spends more than any other country—$4.5 trillion annually, 17.3% of GDP—yet achieves worse outcomes on most measures. Approximately 27 million Americans remain uninsured, tens of millions more are underinsured, and medical debt affects 100 million people. The system's complexity, fragmentation, and cost create barriers to care that other developed nations have largely solved.
