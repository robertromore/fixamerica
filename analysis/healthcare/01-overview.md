# Healthcare

## Executive Summary

Healthcare in the United States presents a paradox: the nation spends more than any other country—$4.5 trillion annually, 17.3% of GDP—yet achieves worse outcomes on most measures. Approximately 27 million Americans remain uninsured, tens of millions more are underinsured, and medical debt affects 100 million people. The system's complexity, fragmentation, and cost create barriers to care that other developed nations have largely solved.

This analysis examines the American healthcare system across eleven critical dimensions: access to care, costs, the Medicaid program, Medicare, insurance markets, rural healthcare, public health infrastructure, mental health integration, healthcare workforce, maternal health, and health information technology.

## Scope

This topic covers:

- Health insurance coverage systems (public and private)
- Healthcare financing and cost drivers
- Access disparities and barriers to care
- Public health infrastructure and prevention
- Mental and behavioral health integration
- Rural and underserved communities
- Healthcare delivery and payment reform

This topic does not cover:

- Individual medical conditions or treatments (see mental-health for behavioral health policy)
- Biomedical research policy (see science/)
- Pharmaceutical industry beyond pricing (see technology/)
- Veterans healthcare (see veterans/)

## Key Questions

- Why does the U.S. spend so much on healthcare with such poor results?
- How can universal coverage be achieved given the federal-state structure?
- What reforms can control costs without sacrificing quality or access?
- How should federal and state roles in healthcare be balanced?
- What is the appropriate role for government vs. markets in healthcare?

### [Health Information Technology](health-it/01-overview.md)

Analysis of EHR adoption, interoperability failures, data blocking, cybersecurity, clinician burden, and health IT policy including HIPAA and information exchange.

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Federalism and Healthcare

Healthcare exemplifies the tensions in American federalism:

- Medicare is fully federal
- Medicaid is federal-state
- Insurance regulation is primarily state
- Public health is state/local with federal support

Reform proposals must navigate these complex intergovernmental relationships while establishing appropriate national floors.

### Health Equity

Disparities persist across race, income, geography, and other dimensions. Solutions must address:

- Coverage disparities (uninsured rates vary 3x+ by state)
- Access disparities (provider distribution, transportation)
- Outcome disparities (life expectancy gaps of 10+ years by neighborhood)
- Financial disparities (medical debt concentrated in communities of color)

### Healthcare and Economic Policy

Healthcare intersects with economic policy through:

- Employer-based coverage and labor markets
- Healthcare as major employment sector
- Medical debt and consumer finance
- Federal/state budget pressures

## Relationship to Other Topics
