# Rural Healthcare: History

## Historical Development

### Early Rural Healthcare (1900-1945)

- Country doctors served as sole providers in many rural areas
- Limited transportation meant healthcare was hyperlocal
- High maternal and infant mortality in rural areas
- Rural areas largely excluded from employer health insurance
- Federal government largely uninvolved in healthcare delivery

### Hill-Burton Era (1946-1970s)

- **1946**: Hill-Burton Act provides grants for hospital construction
- Over 4,600 hospitals built or expanded, many in rural areas
- Community hospitals became central to rural life
- Federal government encouraged geographic distribution
- Created infrastructure still in use today (but now aging)
- Did not address operating costs or workforce

### Medicare and Rural Hospitals (1965-1980s)

- **1965**: Medicare enacted, providing payment for elderly care
- Rural hospitals gained stable revenue source
- **1983**: Prospective Payment System (DRGs) implemented
- PPS created challenges for low-volume rural hospitals
- Some rural hospitals couldn't survive under volume-based payments

### Rural Hospital Crisis I (1980s-1990s)

- Over 300 rural hospitals closed 1980-1999
- DRG system disadvantaged rural facilities
- Economic decline in agriculture and manufacturing
- Population loss in many rural areas
- Congressional response: new designations and payment adjustments

### Critical Access Hospital Program (1997-Present)

- **1997**: Balanced Budget Act creates Critical Access Hospital (CAH) designation
- CAHs receive cost-based reimbursement from Medicare
- Requirements: 25 beds, 96-hour length of stay, 35 miles from nearest hospital
- Over 1,350 CAHs designated by 2024
- Provided lifeline for small rural hospitals
- Some CAHs still struggle despite program

### ACA and Rural Health (2010-Present)

- **2010**: ACA enacted with Medicaid expansion
- Expansion states saw rural hospital stabilization
- Non-expansion states: disproportionate rural closures
- ACA coverage provisions helped but didn't solve rural challenges
- **2012**: *NFIB v. Sebelius* makes Medicaid expansion optional

### Modern Crisis (2010s-Present)

- 150+ rural hospitals closed since 2010
- COVID-19 strained rural systems
- Temporary telehealth expansions
- Continued workforce shortages
- Broadband gaps limit technology solutions

## Key Turning Points

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1946 | Hill-Burton Act | Built rural hospital infrastructure |
| 1965 | Medicare enacted | Stable revenue for elderly care |
| 1983 | DRG implementation | Challenged low-volume hospitals |
| 1997 | CAH program created | Lifeline for small rural hospitals |
| 2010 | ACA enacted | Coverage expansion (in some states) |
| 2012 | Medicaid expansion made optional | Non-expansion states face worse closures |
| 2020 | COVID telehealth expansion | Temporary access improvements |

## Lessons from History

1. **Infrastructure without operating support fails**: Hill-Burton built hospitals; many couldn't survive under later payment rules

2. **Volume-based payment disadvantages rural providers**: Systems designed for urban hospitals create rural challenges

3. **Coverage matters**: Rural hospitals in Medicaid expansion states are more stable

4. **Special designations help but don't solve**: CAH program preserved many hospitals but closures continue

5. **Workforce requires dedicated investment**: No sustained federal commitment to rural workforce development

6. **Technology is not a complete solution**: Telehealth helps but doesn't replace physical presence for many services

7. **Rural decline is systemic**: Healthcare challenges reflect broader rural economic and demographic trends
