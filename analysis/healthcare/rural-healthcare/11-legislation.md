# Rural Healthcare: Legislation

## Overview

Rural healthcare reform requires federal legislation to stabilize hospitals, expand coverage, develop workforce, and build infrastructure. This legislative strategy addresses immediate crisis needs while establishing sustainable long-term systems.

## Constitutional Considerations

No constitutional amendments are required. Congress has clear authority under the Spending Clause for Medicare/Medicaid payment policy and rural health programs, and under the Commerce Clause for healthcare regulation. Federal broadband and infrastructure programs operate under established constitutional authority.

## Federal Legislation

### Rural Hospital Stabilization Act

**Purpose**: Provide emergency support and long-term stability for rural hospitals through financial assistance and payment reform.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Rural Hospital Stabilization Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) over 150 rural hospitals have closed since 2010;
(2) over 40 percent of rural hospitals are at financial risk;
(3) rural hospital closures eliminate healthcare access, jobs, and
    community viability;
(4) immediate action is needed to prevent further closures.

SEC. 3. RURAL HOSPITAL EMERGENCY FUND.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established in the Treasury a Rural
    Hospital Emergency Fund.

(b) AUTHORIZATION.—There are authorized to be appropriated $5 billion
    for fiscal years 2026-2030 for the Fund.

(c) USE OF FUNDS.—The Secretary may provide grants from the Fund for—
    (1) emergency operating support for hospitals at imminent risk
        of closure;
    (2) bridge financing during transformation planning;
    (3) technical assistance for turnaround or transformation;
    (4) capital improvements necessary for continued operation;
    (5) debt restructuring assistance.

(d) ELIGIBILITY.—Eligible hospitals are those designated as rural
    by the Secretary and demonstrating financial distress as defined
    by regulation.

(e) CONDITIONS.—Recipients shall comply with—
    (1) quality and safety standards;
    (2) transformation planning requirements;
    (3) community benefit obligations;
    (4) reporting and transparency requirements.

SEC. 4. RURAL MEDICARE PAYMENT REFORM.
(a) COST-BASED REIMBURSEMENT EXPANSION.—
    (1) The Secretary shall expand cost-based Medicare reimbursement
        to rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds.
    (2) The 96-hour length of stay limitation for Critical Access
        Hospitals is repealed.

(b) RURAL ADD-ON PAYMENT.—Medicare payment rates for rural hospitals
    shall include an add-on of 10 percent above otherwise applicable
    rates.

(c) GLOBAL BUDGET PILOT.—
    (1) The Secretary shall establish a voluntary global budget
        program for rural hospitals.
    (2) Participating hospitals shall receive prospective annual
        payment in lieu of fee-for-service.
    (3) Global budgets shall be calculated based on historical
        costs plus reasonable growth factor.

SEC. 5. RURAL EMERGENCY HOSPITAL IMPROVEMENTS.
(a) The Rural Emergency Hospital program established under section
    1861(kkk) of the Social Security Act is amended to—
    (1) increase the monthly facility payment by 50 percent;
    (2) authorize REH designations for facilities converting from
        nursing homes or other healthcare facilities;
    (3) permit REH to offer observation beds for up to 48 hours.

SEC. 6. RURAL HOSPITAL CLOSURE MORATORIUM.
(a) No hospital that is the sole community provider within 35 miles
    shall close without 180 days notice and completion of a community
    health needs assessment and transition plan.

(b) The Secretary shall provide transition planning assistance to
    any sole community hospital providing closure notice.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This bill provides both emergency assistance to prevent imminent closures and structural payment reforms to address underlying financial challenges. The global budget option allows hospitals to shift from unpredictable fee-for-service to stable annual payments.

**Challenges**: Cost (estimated $5-10 billion over 5 years for emergency fund; ongoing payment increases); defining eligible hospitals; ensuring accountability for funds received.

**Refinements**: Consider state matching requirements; establish performance metrics; create pathway from emergency support to sustainable model.

### Rural Coverage Expansion Act

**Purpose**: Eliminate the Medicaid coverage gap and ensure all rural residents have access to affordable coverage.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Rural Coverage Expansion Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) approximately 2.2 million Americans fall into the Medicaid
    coverage gap in states that have not expanded Medicaid;
(2) rural hospitals in non-expansion states experience significantly
    higher closure rates;
(3) coverage gaps contribute to rural health disparities and
    preventable deaths.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL COVERAGE FOR COVERAGE GAP POPULATION.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall provide health coverage to
    individuals who—
    (1) have household income below 138 percent of the Federal
        poverty level;
    (2) are not eligible for Medicaid in their State of residence;
    (3) are not eligible for Medicare; and
    (4) are citizens or lawfully present.

(b) BENEFITS.—Coverage shall include essential health benefits and
    Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment
    (EPSDT) services for individuals under 21.

(c) COST-SHARING.—Cost-sharing shall not exceed Medicaid levels.

(d) ADMINISTRATION.—The Secretary may administer coverage through—
    (1) contracts with qualified health plans;

## Regulatory Framework

### CMS Regulations

**Authority**: Social Security Act, ACA

**Key regulatory areas**:

1. **Rural Hospital Designations**
   - Critical Access Hospital criteria and reimbursement
   - Rural Emergency Hospital implementation
   - Sole Community Hospital designation

2. **Telehealth**
   - Covered services and modalities
   - Originating site requirements
   - Practitioner eligibility
   - Payment rates

3. **Rural Health Clinics**
   - Certification requirements
   - Payment methodology
   - Scope of services

4. **Workforce**
   - NHSC program regulations
   - GME rural track requirements
   - J-1 waiver administration

**Implementation timeline**: Major regulatory changes typically require 12-18 months from proposed rule.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Basis

- **Spending Clause**: Primary authority for Medicare/Medicaid
- **Commerce Clause**: Telehealth interstate practice
- **Federal preemption of state licensure for telehealth**: Novel but likely valid

### Preemption Issues

- State scope of practice laws may conflict with federal facility authority
- State telehealth licensure requirements may be preempted for federal programs
- State certificate of need laws may limit facility transformation

### Enforcement

- CMS oversight of rural designations and payment
- HRSA administration of workforce programs
- OIG fraud prevention in rural programs

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Emergency fund misuse | Funds used for non-essential purposes | Medium |
| Coverage gap gaming | States structure programs to maintain gap | Medium |
| Telehealth fraud | Billing for services not provided or inappropriate | High |
| Workforce flight | Providers leave after loan repayment | Medium |
| Broadband deployment cherry-picking | Easiest areas served, hardest ignored | High |
| Global budget gaming | Services reduced to meet budget | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Workforce pipeline timeline | Years before new providers practicing | Inherent training duration |
| Not all hospitals savable | Some communities too small | Population/economic reality |
| Broadband still inadequate | Full deployment takes years | Infrastructure timeline |
| State scope of practice variation | Provider utilization limited | State authority |
| Transportation not solved | Access barrier remains | Geographic reality |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Emergency fund misuse**: Require detailed use-of-funds reporting; independent audits; clawback provisions for non-compliant use; tie continued funding to performance metrics

2. **Coverage gap gaming**: Federal coverage automatic where state gap exists; maintenance-of-effort requirements; monitor for coverage reduction attempts

3. **Telehealth fraud**: Establish telehealth-specific billing codes; audit algorithms for unusual patterns; patient verification requirements; periodic in-person visit requirements for ongoing relationships

4. **Workforce flight**: Graduated loan repayment (not lump sum); service verification before each payment; extend commitment periods with larger awards; community integration support

5. **Broadband deployment**: Healthcare facility priority with enforceable timelines; penalties for missing deployment milestones; alternative technology (satellite) requirements where wired infeasible

6. **Global budget gaming**: Quality metrics tied to budget; patient satisfaction monitoring; community health needs assessment requirements; outlier review for concerning patterns

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Rural hospital capacity to manage programs**: Technical assistance essential
- **Workforce production pipeline**: Requires years; interim solutions needed
- **Broadband deployment timeline**: May take 5-10 years for universal access
- **Political sustainability**: Programs must survive administration changes
- **Coordination across agencies**: HRSA, CMS, USDA, FCC all involved
