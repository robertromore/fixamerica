# Rural Healthcare

Rural America faces a healthcare crisis. Over 150 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, with hundreds more at risk. Approximately 60 million Americans—nearly 20% of the population—live in rural areas where healthcare access is increasingly precarious. Rural residents travel farther for care, have fewer provider choices, experience worse health outcomes, and die younger than their urban counterparts. The rural healthcare crisis reflects broader patterns of rural economic decline, population loss, and the fundamental challenge of delivering healthcare in low-density areas with limited resources.
