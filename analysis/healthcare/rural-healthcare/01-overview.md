# Rural Healthcare

## Overview

Rural America faces a healthcare crisis. Over 150 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, with hundreds more at risk. Approximately 60 million Americans—nearly 20% of the population—live in rural areas where healthcare access is increasingly precarious. Rural residents travel farther for care, have fewer provider choices, experience worse health outcomes, and die younger than their urban counterparts. The rural healthcare crisis reflects broader patterns of rural economic decline, population loss, and the fundamental challenge of delivering healthcare in low-density areas with limited resources.

## The Closure Cascade

| Stage | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Hospital closes** | Immediate loss of emergency care |
| **Jobs disappear** | Hospital often largest local employer |
| **Population declines** | Families leave for better access |
| **Tax base erodes** | Less revenue for schools, services |
| **Businesses struggle** | Harder to attract workers |
| **Further decline** | Cycle accelerates |

## Reform Priorities at a Glance

| Priority | Approach | Feasibility |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Expand Medicaid | Improves rural hospital finances | 10 states remain |
| Telehealth expansion | Maintain COVID flexibilities | In progress |
| Workforce programs | NHSC, loan forgiveness, training | Incremental |
| Rural payment reform | Cost-based, global budgets | Pilot programs |
| Broadband investment | Infrastructure for telehealth | USDA, FCC programs |
| Transportation | Non-emergency medical transport | State programs |

## Why This Matters

Rural healthcare access is essential for multiple national priorities:

**For Rural Residents**:

- 60 million Americans depend on rural health infrastructure
- Longer travel times for emergencies cost lives
- Fewer provider choices reduce quality
- Health disparities widen

**For Rural Communities**:

- Hospital often largest employer
- Economic anchor for community
- Property values tied to services
- Population retention depends on access

**For the Nation**:

- Food and energy production depend on healthy rural workers
- Agricultural communities face unique occupational hazards
- Geographic equity is a measure of system success
- Rural votes influence health policy

**For Health Equity**:

- Rural populations are older, sicker, poorer
- Native American communities disproportionately rural
- Appalachian and Delta regions face concentrated poverty
- Veterans disproportionately rural

Addressing rural healthcare requires confronting fundamental questions about how to deliver care in low-volume settings and how to value access for all Americans.
