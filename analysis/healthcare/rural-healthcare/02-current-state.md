# Rural Healthcare: Current State

## Rural Hospital Crisis

### Closures

| Period | Closures |
|--------|----------|
| 2010-2015 | 47 |
| 2016-2020 | 60 |
| 2021-2024 | 45+ |
| **Total since 2010** | **152+** |

**Geographic concentration**: Texas (26), Tennessee (14), Georgia (10), Alabama (9), Oklahoma (8)

**Closure correlation with**:

- Medicaid non-expansion states (disproportionate closures)
- High uninsured rates
- Population decline
- Distance from urban centers

### At-Risk Hospitals

- 42% of rural hospitals operating at a loss
- 700+ hospitals at financial risk
- Average operating margin: -3%
- Many relying on short-term financing

### Financial Drivers

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Low patient volume | Cannot spread fixed costs |
| Payer mix | Higher Medicare/Medicaid, lower commercial |
| Uncompensated care | Uninsured patients unable to pay |
| Staffing costs | Premium wages to attract rural workers |
| Capital needs | Aging facilities, equipment |
| Regulatory burden | Compliance costs same regardless of size |

## Provider Shortages

### Physician Supply

| Area Type | Physicians per 10,000 Population |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Urban | 31.2 |
| Rural | 13.1 |
| Frontier | 5.4 |

### Specialty Access

- **Primary care**: 65% of rural counties are HPSAs
- **Mental health**: 65% of rural counties lack a psychiatrist
- **OB/GYN**: 56% of rural counties lack an OB/GYN
- **Specialists**: Many rural areas have zero access to specialists

### Nursing Shortage

- Rural nursing vacancy rate: 15-20%
- Average age of rural nurses higher than urban
- Travel nursing costs strain rural budgets
- Nursing education programs scarce in rural areas

### Other Health Professionals

- Pharmacists: Many rural areas losing pharmacies
- Dentists: 60% of rural counties are dental HPSAs
- Mental health: Severe shortage of counselors, social workers
- EMS: Volunteer services struggling to staff

## Access Barriers

### Distance and Transportation

| Access Metric | Rural vs. Urban |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Distance to hospital | 2-3x farther |
| Distance to specialist | 4-5x farther |
| Public transportation | Limited to none |
| EMS response time | 2x longer |

**Impact**: Delayed care, missed appointments, emergency complications

### Insurance Coverage

- Rural uninsured rate: ~12% (higher in non-expansion states)
- Underinsurance common due to high-deductible plans
- Medicaid non-expansion creates coverage gaps
- Medicare dominant among elderly rural population

### Broadband Access

- 35% of rural areas lack adequate broadband
- Telehealth requires connectivity
- Patient portals, scheduling inaccessible
- Provider recruitment hampered by connectivity

## Health Outcomes

### Mortality Disparities

| Cause | Rural vs. Urban Mortality |
|-------|---------------------------|
| All-cause | 20% higher |
| Heart disease | 25% higher |
| Cancer | 15% higher |
| Accidents | 50% higher |
| Suicide | 65% higher |
| Drug overdose | Variable (higher in some regions) |

### Contributing Factors

- **Delayed diagnosis**: Longer distances, fewer providers
- **Chronic disease management**: Limited follow-up capacity
- **Prevention gaps**: Fewer screenings, health education
- **Social determinants**: Poverty, education, food access
- **Occupational hazards**: Agriculture, mining, logging injuries

### Maternal Health Crisis

- Rural maternal mortality 60% higher than urban
- Hospital OB closures force long-distance deliveries
- Prenatal care access limited
- Postpartum follow-up challenges

## Current Programs and Support

### Federal Programs

- **Critical Access Hospital (CAH)** designation: Cost-based reimbursement
- **Rural Health Clinics (RHCs)**: Enhanced payment for primary care
- **Community Health Centers (FQHCs)**: Safety net care
- **National Health Service Corps**: Loan repayment for rural service
- **Area Health Education Centers (AHECs)**: Workforce development
- **USDA Rural Hospital Loan Program**: Facility financing

### State Programs

- State Offices of Rural Health
- Rural residency programs
- Telehealth policies
- Certificate of need laws (varied impact)
- Medicaid supplemental payments

### Telehealth Expansion

- **COVID-era flexibilities**: Expanded reimbursement, modalities
- **Current adoption**: 30%+ of rural visits via telehealth (some services)
- **Limitations**: Requires broadband; not appropriate for all care
- **Policy uncertainty**: Many flexibilities temporary
