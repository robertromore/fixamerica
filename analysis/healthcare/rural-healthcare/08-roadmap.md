- Fund operational within 6 months
- 200+ hospitals receiving support by Year 1
- Closure rate reduced by 50%

### Permanent Telehealth Policies

**Actions**:

- Make COVID Medicare telehealth flexibilities permanent
- Audio-only payment for underserved areas
- Remove geographic originating site restrictions
- Establish permanent out-of-state licensure pathway
- Telehealth equipment grants for rural providers

**Milestones**:

- Legislation enacted Year 1
- Regulations finalized Year 2
- 50% increase in rural telehealth utilization

### Coverage Gap Closure

**Actions**:

## Phase 3: Sustainable Systems (Years 5-10)

### Delivery System Transformation

- Advanced practice provider full practice authority nationwide
- Immigration pipeline established

**Milestones**:

- Rural physician supply at 75% of urban per capita

### Infrastructure Completion

**Actions**:

- Universal rural broadband
- Facility modernization grants
- Equipment replacement programs
- Transportation networks established

**Milestones**:

- 100% broadband coverage
- All critical facilities modernized
- Regional transportation systems operational

## Success Metrics

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| Hospital stability | Rural hospitals at risk | <200 (from 700+) |
| Access | Rural counties without hospital | <200 (from 500+) |
| Workforce | Rural HPSAs | 50% reduction |
| Outcomes | Rural-urban mortality gap | 50% reduction |
| Coverage | Rural uninsured rate | <5% |
| Connectivity | Rural broadband access | 100% |

## Risk Mitigation

### Political Risks

**Concerns**:

- Budget constraints limit funding
- Political polarization blocks action
- State resistance to federal programs

**Mitigation**:

- Frame as rural economic development, not just healthcare
- Build bipartisan coalitions (rural caucuses)
- Provide state flexibility within federal framework
- Demonstrate success in early states

### Implementation Risks

**Concerns**:

- Workforce pipeline takes years
- Broadband deployment delays
- Hospital closures continue during transition

**Mitigation**:

- Emergency stabilization while building long-term solutions
- Multiple workforce pathways (training, immigration, scope)
- Healthcare priority in broadband programs
- Bridge financing for at-risk hospitals

### Unintended Consequences

**Concerns**:

- Supporting unsustainable hospitals
- Creating dependency on subsidies
- Quality concerns in low-volume facilities

**Mitigation**:

- Performance requirements for support
- Transformation planning mandatory
- Quality monitoring and improvement support
- Appropriate model selection (not all need inpatient)
