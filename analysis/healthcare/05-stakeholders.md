# Healthcare: Stakeholders

## Overview

The American healthcare system involves a complex web of stakeholders with competing interests, varying levels of power, and different relationships to reform. Understanding who benefits from the status quo, who is harmed, and who has the power to change things is essential for effective advocacy. The fragmented nature of U.S. healthcare means that nearly every American is a stakeholder—as patient, taxpayer, employer, or worker—yet organized interests often dominate policy debates.
