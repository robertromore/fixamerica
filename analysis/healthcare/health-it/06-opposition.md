# Health Information Technology: Opposition

## Overview

Reform of health information technology faces opposition from entrenched interests that profit from the current fragmented, vendor-controlled ecosystem. Unlike many policy areas where opposition is ideological, health IT opposition is primarily economic--driven by business models that depend on information asymmetry, switching costs, and market control.

## EHR Vendor Opposition

### Epic Systems

**Opposition Tactics**

| Tactic | Description | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Narrative control | Presents self as interoperability leader | Confuses policymakers |
| Network effects | Care Everywhere as alternative to open exchange | Reduces pressure for standards |
| Technical complexity | Buries anti-competitive practices in implementation details | Hard for regulators to detect |
| Customer mobilization | Rallies health system clients against regulation | Political pressure |
| Strategic philanthropy | Donations create goodwill | Deflects criticism |

**Arguments Made**

| Argument | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| "We support interoperability" | Through proprietary Care Everywhere, not open standards |
| "Data sharing risks patient safety" | Exchange within Epic is fine; outside is "risky" |
| "We comply with all regulations" | Minimal compliance, maximum friction |
| "Customers choose our approach" | Customers are locked in |
| "Innovation requires investment protection" | Lock-in protects margins, not innovation |

**Political Influence**

| Channel | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| Lobbying | Federal and state lobbying on certification, interoperability |
| Industry associations | CHIME leadership, CCHIT influence historically |
| Revolving door | Former HHS officials consult for Epic |
| Customer mobilization | Health systems lobby on Epic's behalf |
| Academic relationships | Major academic medical centers as advocates |

### Oracle Health (Cerner)

**Opposition Approach**

| Tactic | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Standards participation | Active in standards bodies to shape direction |
| Government contracts | VA contract creates political leverage |
| Cloud strategy | Presents Oracle cloud as interoperability solution |
| Acquisition | Buys potential competitors |

**Arguments Made**

| Argument | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| "Open systems architecture" | Still significant lock-in |
| "VA will prove our model" | VA implementation troubled |
| "Cloud solves interoperability" | Vendor cloud is still a silo |

### Other Vendors and Industry Groups

**CHIME (College of Healthcare Information Management Executives)**

| Stance | Motivation |
|--------|------------|
| Opposes strict information blocking enforcement | Protects member interests (hospital IT) |
| Supports implementation flexibility | Delays true interoperability |
| Advocates for incremental approach | Preserves status quo |
| Questions patient access expansion | "Safety" and "governance" concerns |

**EHRA (EHR Association)**

| Stance | Motivation |
|--------|------------|
| Supports certification but opposes mandates | Certification provides barrier to entry |
| Opposes TEFCA requirements | Preserves proprietary exchange |
| Advocates for fee structures | Interface fees are profit center |
| Questions API requirements | Data access threatens business model |

## Health System Opposition

### Large Integrated Systems

**Why Large Systems Oppose Reform**

| Motivation | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Network effects | Current vendor investment creates competitive advantage |
| Referral control | Patients stay in-network where data flows |
| Competitive intelligence | Interoperability helps competitors |
| Sunk costs | Invested hundreds of millions in current systems |
| IT department alignment | Existing relationships with vendors |

**Common Arguments**

| Argument | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| "Implementation is complex" | Preserves status quo |
| "Security concerns" | Exchange within vendor network is fine |
| "Patient consent issues" | Consent frameworks exist |
| "Quality concerns" | Incomplete data is also a quality risk |
| "Cost of compliance" | Costs passed to smaller competitors |

### Academic Medical Centers

**Mixed Interests**

| Interest | Position |
|----------|----------|
| Research data access | Generally pro-interoperability |
| Clinical care dominance | Prefer locked-in patient relationships |
| Vendor partnerships | Deep ties to major vendors |
| Innovation reputation | Want to appear progressive |

## Privacy and Security Advocates

### Sincere Privacy Concerns

**Legitimate Arguments**

| Concern | Validity |
|---------|----------|
| Data breach risk | Real; exchange increases attack surface |
| Re-identification risk | Aggregated data enables identification |
| Consent complexity | Patients may not understand implications |
| Sensitive data | Mental health, HIV, substance use |
| Commercial exploitation | Data could be used against patients |

**Recommended Approach**

These concerns deserve serious response through strong security requirements, meaningful consent frameworks, and robust enforcement--not by blocking data sharing entirely.

### Weaponized Privacy

**Privacy Used as Blocking Tactic**

| Tactic | User | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| "Patient safety" framing | Vendors | Block third-party app access |
| Consent complexity | Health systems | Create friction for exchange |
| Security requirements | IT departments | Prevent interoperability |
| Data governance delays | All | Slow implementation |

**How to Distinguish Sincere from Instrumental**

| Indicator | Sincere | Instrumental |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Consistency | Applies same standards to own data sharing | Stricter for external than internal |
| Solutions offered | Proposes workable alternatives | Only raises problems |
| Patient voice | Supports patient choice | Paternalistic "protection" |
| Business impact | May hurt own interests | Always protects business model |

## Clinician Resistance

### Legitimate Frustration

**Valid Concerns**

| Concern | Basis |
|---------|-------|
| Documentation burden | EHRs are genuinely problematic |
| Alert fatigue | Clinical decision support poorly designed |
| Workflow disruption | Systems not designed for clinical work |
