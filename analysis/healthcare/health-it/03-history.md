# Health Information Technology: History

## Early Developments (1960s-1990s)

### The Pioneer Era

**Hospital Information Systems Emerge**

The earliest health IT systems appeared in the 1960s at academic medical centers with computer science resources and research missions.

| Year | Development | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1962 | COSTAR at MGH | One of first ambulatory care systems |
| 1968 | HELP system at LDS Hospital | Clinical decision support pioneer |
| 1972 | Regenstrief Medical Record System | Research-oriented EHR |
| 1976 | VistA precursor at VA | Government investment in health IT |
| 1979 | Epic founded | Started as billing system |

**Characteristics of Early Systems**

- Custom-built by individual institutions
- Primarily for billing and administrative functions
- Limited clinical functionality
- No standards for data exchange
- Mainframe-based, expensive to operate

### The 1980s: Standards Emerge

**HL7 and Early Interoperability**

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1987 | HL7 (Health Level Seven) founded | First messaging standard organization |
| 1988 | HL7 Version 1.0 | Initial standard for data exchange |
| 1989 | ASTM E1238 | Laboratory data standard |

**Commercial Market Develops**

The 1980s saw the emergence of commercial EHR vendors:

- Cerner founded (1979, products 1984)
- Meditech founded (1969, growth in 1980s)
- CPSI (1979) - community hospital focus
- HBO & Company (later McKesson) - hospital systems

**Persistent Challenges**

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Cost | Systems required mainframes and specialized staff |
| Usability | Interfaces designed by engineers, not clinicians |
| Integration | Each system a silo |
| Adoption | Limited to large academic centers and progressive hospitals |

### The 1990s: Internet Era Begins

**Key Developments**

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1991 | IOM "The Computer-Based Patient Record" | Influential call for EHR adoption |
| 1996 | HIPAA enacted | First federal health IT framework |
| 1998 | IOM "To Err is Human" in development | Patient safety crisis documented |

**HIPAA's Health IT Provisions**

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) included:

- Administrative simplification requirements
- Transaction and code set standards (X12, NCPDP)
- Privacy Rule (implemented 2003)
- Security Rule (implemented 2005)
- National Provider Identifier requirement

**Internet-Based Innovations**

- WebMD launched (1996) - consumer health information
- Early patient portals appear
- E-prescribing pilots begin
- Telemedicine experiments at academic centers

## The Quality and Safety Crisis (1999-2004)

### To Err Is Human

The 1999 Institute of Medicine report "To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System" transformed the conversation about health IT.

**Key Findings**

| Finding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 44,000-98,000 deaths from medical errors annually | Created urgency for safety systems |
| Medication errors a leading cause | CPOE becomes priority |
| Systems failures, not individual blame | Focus on technological solutions |
| Information gaps contribute to errors | EHR seen as solution |

### Quality Chasm Report (2001)

"Crossing the Quality Chasm" identified health IT as essential to quality improvement:

- Care coordination requires shared information
- Evidence-based practice needs decision support
- Patient-centered care requires patient access
- Continuous improvement requires data analytics

### Limited Progress

Despite growing recognition, adoption remained slow.

**Barriers to Adoption**

| Barrier | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| Cost | $15,000-50,000 per physician for ambulatory EHR |
| Workflow disruption | Productivity loss during implementation |
| No business case | Savings accrued to payers, not providers |
| Technical complexity | Small practices lacked IT expertise |
| Interoperability | Systems couldn't communicate |

**Adoption Rates (2004)**

| Setting | EHR Adoption |
|---------|--------------|
| Office-based physicians | 21% |
| Hospitals (basic) | 10% |
| Hospitals (comprehensive) | 2% |

## The Push for National Strategy (2004-2009)

### Bush Administration Initiative

**2004: National Health IT Coordinator Created**

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Executive Order 13335 | Created ONC position |
| David Brailer appointed | First National Coordinator |
| Federal Health IT Strategic Plan | Roadmap for adoption |
| Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs) | Pilot exchange networks |

**Key Initiatives**

- Certification Commission for Health IT (CCHIT) - voluntary certification
- Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) - exchange architecture
- American Health Information Community (AHIC) - stakeholder input

**Limited Impact**

| Challenge | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| No mandatory requirements | Adoption voluntary |
| No significant funding | Providers bore costs |
| Market fragmentation | RHIOs struggled financially |
| Vendor resistance | Interoperability not prioritized |

### Adoption Stagnation

By 2008, despite years of effort, adoption remained low.

| Metric | 2008 Rate |
|--------|-----------|
| Office-based physician EHR | 42% |
| Hospital basic EHR | 9% |
| Hospital comprehensive EHR | 1.5% |

The voluntary approach had failed to achieve meaningful progress.

## HITECH and Meaningful Use (2009-2016)

### The HITECH Act

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act.
