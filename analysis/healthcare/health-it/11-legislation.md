# Health Information Technology: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

This document provides draft legislative text and regulatory frameworks to address the systemic failures in American health information technology. The legislative approach focuses on four pillars: (1) strengthening interoperability requirements and enforcement, (2) addressing market concentration and vendor lock-in, (3) modernizing public health data infrastructure, and (4) establishing governance for emerging technologies like AI. Each proposal includes analysis of potential loopholes, shortcomings, and rectification procedures.

## Federal Legislation

### Health IT Interoperability and Competition Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen enforcement of information blocking prohibitions, address vendor anti-competitive practices, and ensure genuine technical interoperability.

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Health IT Interoperability and Competition Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Despite over $36 billion in federal investment since 2009, true interoperability of electronic health records has not been achieved.
(2) Information blocking by health IT vendors and healthcare providers continues to harm patients and increase costs.
(3) Market concentration among EHR vendors has reduced competition, increased prices, and stifled innovation.
(4) Current enforcement mechanisms for information blocking are insufficient.
(5) Patients continue to face barriers to accessing their own health information.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(1) COVERED ACTOR.—The term "covered actor" means—
    (A) a health IT developer of certified health IT;
    (B) a health information network;
    (C) a health information exchange; and
    (D) a health care provider that uses certified health IT.
(2) INFORMATION BLOCKING.—The term "information blocking" has the meaning given such term in section 3022 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300jj-52).
(3) INTEROPERABILITY.—The term "interoperability" means the ability of health IT systems to exchange electronic health information without special effort on the part of the user.

SEC. 4. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF INFORMATION BLOCKING.

(a) CIVIL MONETARY PENALTIES.—Section 3022(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300jj-52(b)) is amended—

```

**Explanation**:

This legislation addresses the core failures of the 21st Century Cures Act information blocking provisions:

- **Section 4**: Increases maximum penalties from $1 million to $5 million and requires scaling based on organization size, ensuring that penalties are meaningful to large vendors
- **Section 4(b)**: Creates a private right of action, allowing patients and developers harmed by information blocking to sue directly rather than waiting for government enforcement
- **Section 4(c)**: Adds qui tam provisions to incentivize whistleblowers to report violations
- **Section 5**: Addresses the practice of charging excessive interface fees to third-party developers
- **Section 6**: Requires actual cross-vendor testing before certification, addressing the problem of systems that are individually certified but cannot exchange data
- **Section 7**: Provides explicit antitrust authority for health IT markets

**Potential Challenges**:

- First Amendment arguments that limiting fees restricts speech
- Commerce Clause challenges to federal regulation of intrastate providers
- Industry lobbying against private right of action
- Technical complexity of defining "reasonable" fees
- Difficulty proving market dominance

**Refinements**:

- Fallback: Focus solely on enhanced government enforcement without private right of action
- Strengthening: Add treble damages for willful violations
- Phased implementation: Grandfather existing contracts for 2-year transition

### ONC Information Blocking Enforcement Regulation

**Existing Authority**: 42 U.S.C. 300jj-52 (21st Century Cures Act)

**Draft Regulation**:

```text
PART 171—INFORMATION BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT

Sec. 171.100 Purpose and scope.

This part establishes procedures for enforcement of information blocking prohibitions under section 3022 of the Public Health Service Act.

Sec. 171.101 Definitions.

(a) "Actual knowledge" means direct awareness that conduct constitutes information blocking, or awareness of facts that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that conduct constitutes information blocking.

```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause**

Federal health IT requirements rest on Commerce Clause authority. Healthcare clearly affects interstate commerce, and health IT systems routinely transmit data across state lines. The Supreme Court has upheld comprehensive federal healthcare regulation under this authority.

**First Amendment**

Mandated data sharing may raise First Amendment concerns if characterized as compelled speech. However, health information exchange requirements are better understood as conduct regulation rather than speech regulation. Commercial speech doctrine allows regulation of factual information in commercial contexts.

**Privacy (Fourth Amendment/Substantive Due Process)**

Mandated information sharing must be balanced against privacy interests. Constitutional requirements include:

- Legitimate government purpose (public health, care coordination)
- Reasonable limits on scope of sharing
- Security requirements for shared data
- Patient consent mechanisms for sensitive information

### Preemption Questions

**HIPAA Preemption**

HIPAA establishes a federal floor for privacy protection but allows more protective state laws. New health IT legislation should clarify that state laws providing greater patient rights are preserved.

**State Law Variation**

States have enacted varying health IT requirements. Federal legislation should:

- Establish minimum federal requirements
- Allow states to impose additional requirements
- Avoid directly displacing state HIE programs
- Permit state enforcement of federal requirements

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Administrative Enforcement**

- ONC: Information blocking investigation and penalties
- CMS: Payment incentives and penalties
- FDA: Medical device enforcement for AI/ML
- FTC: Antitrust enforcement for market concentration

**Private Enforcement**

- Individual lawsuits under private right of action
- Class actions for widespread violations
- Qui tam actions for fraud and abuse

**State Enforcement**

- State attorney general authority
- State health department enforcement
- State licensing board actions

### Sunset and Review Provisions

Recommended provisions:

- 5-year reauthorization requirement for appropriations
- GAO report at 3-year mark evaluating effectiveness
- ONC annual report on enforcement activities
- Automatic review of AI governance requirements as technology evolves

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Health IT Interoperability and Competition Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Exception manipulation | Covered actors may claim exceptions (security, privacy, infeasibility) broadly to avoid sharing | Critical |
| Fee restructuring | Vendors may restructure pricing to charge for services not covered by fee caps | High |
| Technical barriers | Meeting letter of interoperability requirements while maintaining practical barriers | High |
| Small actor exemption | Defining organizations to fall below enforcement thresholds | Medium |
| Subsidiary structures | Using subsidiary companies to avoid market dominance designations | High |
| Acquired innovation defense | Claiming acquisitions are for innovation rather than eliminating competition | Medium |
| Timeline gaming | Delaying compliance until deadline while continuing blocking | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Burden of proof | Difficult to prove information blocking intent | Legal standard complexity |
| Enforcement resources | Limited ONC staff for investigation | Appropriations constraints |
| Technical expertise | Regulators may lack expertise to evaluate claims | Public sector compensation |
| Market share measurement | Difficulty defining relevant markets for dominance test | Market complexity |
| Vendor cooperation | Investigation dependent on vendor-provided data | Information asymmetry |
| Remedy limitations | Penalties may be cost of doing business for large vendors | Penalty caps |
| Private action barriers | Patients may lack resources for litigation | Access to justice |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Narrow exceptions through rulemaking**: ONC should issue guidance limiting the scope of exceptions with specific, enumerable circumstances and burden on actor to prove exception applies.

2. **Fee cap implementation**: Define covered fees broadly in regulation to prevent restructuring; require all-in pricing disclosure; prohibit unbundling to circumvent caps.

3. **Technical interoperability validation**: Require third-party testing of actual data exchange, not just API availability; publish success rates.

4. **Anti-structuring provisions**: Apply requirements to parent companies and affiliates; aggregate market share across related entities.

5. **Merger review enhancement**: Require health IT-specific analysis in merger review; retain independent health IT economists at FTC/DOJ.

6. **Tiered penalties**: Structure penalties as percentage of revenue to ensure materiality regardless of organization size.

7. **Litigation support**: Establish legal aid program for patient and developer information blocking claims; fee-shifting provisions.

### Public Health Data Modernization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Reporting bypass | Providers may not use certified EHR for reportable conditions | High |
| State non-compliance | States may nominally participate while limiting data sharing | High |
| Condition scope | Narrowly defining "reportable conditions" to minimize reporting | Medium |
| Technical non-compliance | Meeting FHIR format requirements with incomplete data | Medium |
| Workforce diversion | Fellowship recipients leaving public health after service | Medium |
| Funding fungibility | States using grants to replace rather than supplement existing funding | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| State variation | Uneven implementation across states | Federalism |
| Sustainability | Time-limited authorization | Appropriations process |
| Privacy concerns | National database creates privacy risks | Aggregation risk |
| Workforce pipeline | Insufficient training programs exist | Infrastructure gap |
| Legacy integration | Existing systems difficult to replace | Technical debt |
| Provider burden | Additional reporting requirements | Compliance fatigue |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Comprehensive certified EHR use**: Condition Medicaid participation on certified EHR use for all encounters, closing reporting bypass.

2. **State performance metrics**: Publish state-by-state compliance metrics; condition continued grant eligibility on meeting performance thresholds.

3. **Broad condition definition**: Define reportable conditions comprehensively with regular updates; include emerging conditions automatically.

4. **Data quality validation**: Require completeness checking in eCR transmission; reject incomplete reports.

5. **Fellowship retention**: Extend service commitment; provide retention bonuses for continued public health employment.

6. **Maintenance of effort**: Require states to demonstrate maintenance of existing funding as condition of grants.

### Health IT Cybersecurity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Attestation without verification | Self-attestation may not reflect actual compliance | Critical |
| Small provider exemption abuse | Organizations structuring to qualify for exemptions | High |
| Incident underreporting | Classifying incidents below reporting thresholds | High |
| Framework gaming | Choosing least rigorous cybersecurity framework | Medium |
| Shared services avoidance | Providers not participating in regional centers | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Resource constraints | Small providers cannot afford compliance | Cost burden |
| Evolving threats | Requirements may lag threat landscape | Regulatory delay |
| Audit capacity | Insufficient auditors for verification | Workforce gap |
| Penalty concerns | Penalties may discourage reporting | Enforcement tension |
| Vendor dependency | Provider security depends on vendor security | Supply chain complexity |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Random audit program**: Implement random audits of attesting organizations with penalties for false attestation.

2. **Anti-structuring provisions**: Apply requirements based on actual activity, not organizational structure.

3. **Lower reporting thresholds**: Reduce incident reporting threshold; require reporting of operational disruption regardless of individual count.

4. **Framework specification**: Designate specific required frameworks or establish minimum baseline that all frameworks must meet.

5. **Mandatory regional participation**: Require providers receiving grants to participate in regional centers.

### Healthcare AI Governance Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| CDS exception | Claiming AI is decision support exempt from device regulation | Critical |
| Risk classification gaming | Designing to avoid high-risk classification | High |
| Training data obfuscation | Claiming competitive sensitivity to avoid disclosure | High |
| Bias testing manipulation | Testing on favorable populations | High |
| Human oversight theater | Nominal human review without meaningful oversight | High |
| Developer liability avoidance | Structuring to limit liability exposure | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Regulatory lag | Technology evolves faster than regulation | Inherent limitation |
| Definition challenges | AI/ML boundaries are unclear | Technical ambiguity |
| International competition | Strict requirements may disadvantage US developers | Global market |
| Clinical validation burden | Extensive trials slow beneficial innovation | Safety-access tradeoff |
| Expertise gap | Regulators lack AI expertise | Workforce limitation |
| Adaptive algorithm challenge | Continuous learning creates moving target | Technical characteristic |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Narrow CDS exemption**: Explicitly define CDS exemption to exclude AI making or significantly influencing clinical decisions.

2. **Intent-neutral classification**: Base risk classification on function, not developer's claimed intended use.

3. **Standardized disclosure**: Require standardized disclosure format that precludes selective omission.

4. **Independent bias testing**: Require third-party bias testing using standardized test datasets.

5. **Meaningful oversight requirements**: Define specific requirements for human oversight including time, expertise, and override capability.

6. **Entity-level liability**: Apply liability to parent companies regardless of subsidiary structure.

### General Implementation Concerns

**Systemic Issues**

| Issue | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Regulatory capture | Industry influence over enforcement | Inspector General oversight; term limits for regulators |
| Appropriations vulnerability | Funding cuts undermine implementation | Mandatory funding where possible; demonstrate ROI |
| Political transitions | Administration changes disrupt progress | Bipartisan coalitions; statutory mandates |
| Industry consolidation | Fewer actors to regulate but more powerful | Regular antitrust review |
| Technology evolution | Legislation becomes outdated | Delegated authority with guardrails |

**Sunset and Review Provisions**

1. All appropriations authorizations should include 5-year reauthorization requirements
2. GAO should report on implementation effectiveness at 3-year and 5-year marks
3. ONC should publish annual enforcement and performance reports
4. AI governance requirements should be reviewed every 2 years as technology evolves
5. Automatic penalty inflation adjustments should be included
6. Congressional hearings should be required prior to reauthorization
