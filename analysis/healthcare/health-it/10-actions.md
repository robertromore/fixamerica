# Health Information Technology: Actions

## Overview

Health IT reform requires sustained advocacy from multiple constituencies. Unlike more visible healthcare issues, health IT problems are often invisible to the public--experienced as frustrating bureaucracy rather than systemic failure. Effective action requires making these invisible harms visible and building coalitions that connect patient experience with systemic reform.
