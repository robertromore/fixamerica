# Health Information Technology: Overview

Health information technology (health IT) encompasses the electronic systems, software, and infrastructure used to create, store, share, and analyze health data. Despite over $36 billion in federal investment since 2009, the United States has failed to achieve the promised benefits of a connected, efficient, patient-centered healthcare information ecosystem. Instead, the current landscape is characterized by fragmented systems that cannot communicate with each other, vendor lock-in that stifles innovation, clinician burnout driven by poorly designed interfaces, massive cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and persistent barriers to patient access to their own records.
