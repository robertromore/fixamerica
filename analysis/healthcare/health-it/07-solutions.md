# Health Information Technology: Solutions

## Framework for Reform

Effective health IT reform requires addressing multiple interconnected failures: market concentration, information blocking, usability problems, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, public health data gaps, and emerging technology governance. Solutions must be mutually reinforcing--attacking vendor lock-in while building alternative infrastructure, enforcing existing mandates while expanding requirements, and investing in public goods while regulating private actors.

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Interoperability as default | Data exchange must be seamless unless explicitly restricted |
| Patient control | Patients own their data and direct its use |
| Clinician-centered design | Technology must reduce burden, not increase it |
| Competition over consolidation | Break lock-in, enable market entry |
| Public investment in public goods | Infrastructure that benefits all |
| Accountability with teeth | Real penalties for non-compliance |

## Interoperability Solutions

**Problem**: The 21st Century Cures Act prohibits information blocking, but enforcement has been minimal.

**Solutions**

| Action | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Fund ONC enforcement | $50M+ annual enforcement budget |
| Clear definitions | Remove ambiguity in "reasonable and necessary" exceptions |
| Complaint mechanism | Public portal for patients and developers to report |
| Civil monetary penalties | $1M+ per violation, scaled to organization size |
| Private right of action | Allow affected parties to sue |
| Qui tam provisions | Whistleblower rewards for reporting |

### Mandate True Technical Interoperability
