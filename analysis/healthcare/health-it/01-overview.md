# Health Information Technology: Overview

## Executive Summary

Health information technology (health IT) encompasses the electronic systems, software, and infrastructure used to create, store, share, and analyze health data. Despite over $36 billion in federal investment since 2009, the United States has failed to achieve the promised benefits of a connected, efficient, patient-centered healthcare information ecosystem. Instead, the current landscape is characterized by fragmented systems that cannot communicate with each other, vendor lock-in that stifles innovation, clinician burnout driven by poorly designed interfaces, massive cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and persistent barriers to patient access to their own records.

The stakes are enormous. Poor health IT contributes to an estimated 250,000 preventable deaths annually from medical errors, many involving incomplete or inaccessible patient information. Healthcare administrative costs consume 34% of total spending--twice the rate of other developed nations--in part because of inefficient data exchange. Clinicians spend two hours on documentation for every hour of patient care, contributing to burnout rates exceeding 50% in some specialties.

Reform requires addressing the structural failures that allowed a handful of vendors to dominate the market while resisting true interoperability, strengthening enforcement of existing information blocking prohibitions, investing in public health data infrastructure exposed as dangerously inadequate during COVID-19, and ensuring that emerging technologies like artificial intelligence serve clinical needs rather than vendor profits.

## Key Questions

This analysis addresses the following fundamental questions:

1. **Why has the U.S. failed to achieve interoperable health information exchange despite massive federal investment?** What structural, economic, and political factors have prevented the promised benefits of health IT from being realized?

2. **How has market concentration among EHR vendors affected innovation, costs, and clinical care?** What are the consequences of Epic and Oracle Health (formerly Cerner) controlling over 60% of the hospital market?

3. **Why do EHR systems impose such significant burdens on clinicians?** What design failures, regulatory requirements, and business incentives have created systems that clinicians often describe as obstacles to patient care?

4. **How can patient access to health records be meaningfully improved?** What barriers prevent patients from accessing and controlling their own health information?

5. **What reforms would create genuine interoperability and data liquidity?** How can federal policy overcome vendor resistance and legacy technical barriers?

6. **How should emerging AI technologies be governed in clinical settings?** What frameworks can ensure patient safety, clinical utility, and equitable outcomes?

7. **What investments are needed to modernize public health data infrastructure?** How can systems exposed as inadequate during COVID-19 be rebuilt for future emergencies?

8. **How can cybersecurity vulnerabilities in healthcare be addressed?** What structural changes would reduce the sector's attractiveness as a ransomware target?

## The Case for Reform

### Human Cost of Current Failures

The fragmented state of health IT directly harms patients:

**Preventable Deaths and Injuries**

- Medical errors involving missing or inaccessible information contribute to an estimated 250,000 deaths annually
- Duplicate testing due to unavailable prior results wastes resources and exposes patients to unnecessary procedures
- Medication errors from incomplete medication lists cause thousands of adverse drug events
- Care coordination failures leave patients navigating between providers who cannot share information

**Patient Experience**

- Patients must repeatedly provide the same information to different providers
- Accessing one's own records often requires navigating complex portals, fax requests, or fees
- Health information from different providers cannot be consolidated into a unified view
- Patients cannot easily share records with new providers, specialists, or during emergencies

### Economic Impact

**Administrative Waste**

- The U.S. spends $812 billion annually on healthcare administration (34% of total spending)
- Inefficient data exchange contributes significantly to administrative costs
- Prior authorization processes require manual intervention due to poor system integration
- Duplicate testing costs an estimated $200+ billion annually

**Vendor Lock-In Costs**

- Hospitals spend millions to switch EHR systems, creating switching costs that reduce competition
- Data migration between systems is often incomplete, expensive, and risky
- Lack of competition allows vendors to charge monopoly prices for interfaces and features
- Innovation is stifled when vendors control data access

### Clinician Burden

**Documentation Overload**

- Physicians spend 2+ hours on EHR documentation for every hour of direct patient care
- After-hours documentation ("pajama time") averages 1-2 hours daily
- Nursing documentation burden has increased substantially, reducing bedside care time
- Administrative demands contribute to burnout rates exceeding 50% in primary care

**Usability Failures**

- EHR interfaces prioritize billing compliance over clinical workflow
- Alert fatigue from poorly calibrated clinical decision support leads to overriding important warnings
- Copy-paste documentation creates bloated, difficult-to-review notes
- Mobile and remote access remains limited compared to other industries

### Public Health Consequences

**COVID-19 Exposed Critical Gaps**

- Case reporting relied on fax machines and manual data entry
- Testing results took days or weeks to reach public health authorities
- Contact tracing was hampered by inability to share data across jurisdictions
- Vaccine distribution suffered from fragmented immunization registries

**Ongoing Surveillance Weaknesses**

- Disease outbreak detection is delayed by slow, incomplete reporting
- Syndromic surveillance lacks standardization across states
- Electronic laboratory reporting remains incomplete
- Public health agencies lack modern data analytics capabilities
