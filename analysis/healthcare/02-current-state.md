# Healthcare: Current State

## Overview

The American healthcare system in 2024 is characterized by paradox: world-leading medical innovation alongside middling population health outcomes, the highest spending of any nation alongside tens of millions uninsured or underinsured, and extraordinary clinical capabilities alongside systematic access barriers. The system costs $4.5 trillion annually—nearly 18% of GDP—yet delivers worse outcomes than peer nations on most measures. Recent developments including the post-pandemic unwinding, ongoing workforce crisis, and continued consolidation are reshaping the healthcare landscape.
