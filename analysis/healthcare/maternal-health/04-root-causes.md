# Root Causes of the U.S. Maternal Health Crisis

## A Systems Failure

America's maternal health crisis is not the result of a single cause but rather a complex interaction of structural, systemic, and social factors. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective interventions. The crisis represents a failure of the healthcare system, public policy, and society to prioritize maternal wellbeing.

## I. Healthcare System Failures

### Fragmented Care Delivery

The U.S. healthcare system treats pregnancy as a series of disconnected episodes rather than a continuous journey requiring coordinated care.

**The Fragmentation Problem:**

| Care Phase | Typical Providers | Coordination Gap |
|------------|------------------|------------------|
| Preconception | Primary care, OB/GYN | No standard handoff to prenatal |
| Prenatal | OB/GYN, midwife | May not include chronic disease management |
| Labor/Delivery | Hospital team (different from prenatal) | Often first meeting at delivery |
| Postpartum | Single visit at 6 weeks | No continuity with delivery providers |
| Post-60 days | Return to primary care (if any) | Complete break in obstetric care |

**Consequences:**
- Information loss between providers and settings
- Chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension) poorly managed
- Warning signs missed when different providers see different pieces
- No single provider accountable for total maternal health
- Postpartum period especially neglected

### The Postpartum Care Gap

The traditional model of a single 6-week postpartum visit is dangerously inadequate:

**When Maternal Deaths Occur:**
- 52% of pregnancy-related deaths occur after delivery
- 33% occur between 43 days and 1 year postpartum
- Most common late causes: cardiomyopathy, mental health, substance use

**What Women Need Postpartum:**
- Wound healing assessment (cesarean, perineal)
- Blood pressure monitoring (preeclampsia can develop postpartum)
- Mood and mental health screening
- Chronic disease management resumption
- Breastfeeding support
- Contraception counseling
- Sleep and recovery support

**What Most Women Get:**
- Single visit at 6 weeks (often rescheduled or missed)
- Focus on clearance for activity/intercourse
- Minimal mental health assessment
- Insurance often lost (Medicaid) shortly after

### Quality of Care Variation

Maternal outcomes depend heavily on where a woman gives birth—a form of geographic lottery:

**Hospital Quality Variation:**
- Severe maternal morbidity rates vary 4-fold between hospitals
- Black-serving hospitals have higher complication rates
- Rural hospitals have less capacity for emergencies
- Safety bundle implementation inconsistent

**Evidence-Based Practice Gaps:**
| Practice | Evidence | Implementation |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Hemorrhage protocols | Reduces deaths 20-30% | 60% of hospitals |
| Hypertension protocols | Reduces deaths 40% | 50% of hospitals |
| Sepsis bundles | Reduces deaths 30% | 70% of hospitals |
| VTE prophylaxis | Prevents embolism | Variable |
| Team communication training | Reduces errors | 40% of hospitals |

**Why Quality Varies:**
1. No mandatory national standards for obstetric care
2. Voluntary accreditation only
3. Limited public reporting of outcomes
4. Malpractice liability drives defensive practice
5. Financial pressures reduce staffing
6. Training and continuing education gaps

### Workforce Crisis

The obstetric workforce is insufficient, maldistributed, and facing burnout:

**OB/GYN Shortage:**
- 49% of U.S. counties have no OB/GYN
- Average OB/GYN age is 51 years
- Projected shortage of 22,000 by 2050
- Urban concentration leaves rural areas underserved
- Lifestyle concerns (call schedule) deterring new physicians

**Midwifery Suppression:**
- Midwives attend only 12% of U.S. births (vs. 50%+ in other countries)
- Restrictive scope of practice laws in many states
- Physician supervision requirements limit autonomy
- Low Medicaid reimbursement rates
- Hospital credentialing barriers
- Medical establishment resistance

**Other Workforce Gaps:**
- Maternal-fetal medicine specialists concentrated in urban centers
- Perinatal mental health specialists extremely rare
- Anesthesiologists unavailable at rural hospitals
- Obstetric nurses facing burnout and leaving

## II. Insurance and Payment Failures

### The Medicaid Coverage Gap

Medicaid covers 42% of all U.S. births, yet its structure creates critical gaps:

**The 60-Day Problem:**

Historically, pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage ended 60 days postpartum:
- Coverage terminated when maternal mortality risk remained high
- Chronic conditions went unmanaged
- Mental health conditions untreated
- Women fell into coverage gap or uninsured status

**Post-ARP Status:**
- 46 states have extended to 12 months (as of 2024)
- Extension is optional, not mandatory
- 4 states still use 60-day cutoff
- Administrative burden for extension implementation

### Coverage Instability

Even with insurance, coverage gaps and changes create barriers:

**Coverage Churning:**
- Women may switch between Medicaid, marketplace, and employer coverage during pregnancy
- Each switch risks:
  - Different provider networks
  - Prior authorization requirements
  - Gaps during transitions
  - Cost-sharing changes

**Underinsurance:**
- 29% of working-age women are underinsured
- High deductibles delay care-seeking
- Copayments for prenatal visits
- Surprise bills from out-of-network providers

### Payment Models That Undervalue Maternity Care

How maternity care is paid for shapes how it is delivered:

**Fee-for-Service Problems:**
- Pays for procedures, not outcomes
- Cesarean sections reimbursed more than vaginal births
- No payment for care coordination
- No payment for community health worker support
- Postpartum care under-reimbursed

**Bundled Payment Gaps:**
- Bundled payments increasingly used
- Often exclude postpartum period
- May not cover complications
- Create incentives to avoid high-risk patients

**Maternity Care as Loss Leader:**
- Maternity units often unprofitable
- Leads to closure decisions
- Investment in quality improvement limited
- Staffing often inadequate

## III. Structural Racism in Healthcare

### The Disparity Cannot Be Explained Away

The 3x higher mortality rate for Black mothers persists across all socioeconomic levels:

**Key Evidence:**
- College-educated Black women have higher mortality than white women without high school diplomas
- Black women with private insurance have worse outcomes than white women on Medicaid
- Disparities exist within the same hospitals
- Black women's symptoms are more likely to be dismissed

**This Is Not About:**
- Education levels
- Income levels
- Insurance status
- Individual health behaviors

**This Is About:**
- Systemic racism in healthcare delivery
- Implicit bias among providers
- Structural factors affecting Black women's health
- Cumulative "weathering" effect of discrimination

### Mechanisms of Racial Disparity

**Provider Bias:**
- Studies document implicit bias affecting clinical decisions
- Black women's pain underestimated and undertreated
- Symptoms dismissed as exaggeration
- Less time spent with Black patients
- Slower response to Black patients' concerns

**Hospital Quality Segregation:**
- Black women disproportionately deliver at lower-quality hospitals
- Black-serving hospitals have higher complication rates
- Residential segregation limits hospital options
- Historical disinvestment in minority-serving facilities

**Weathering:**
- Cumulative effect of chronic stress from discrimination
- Accelerated biological aging
- Higher rates of hypertension, diabetes
- Elevated inflammatory markers
- Compromised immune function

**Medical Mistrust:**
- Historical abuses (Tuskegee, forced sterilization, Henrietta Lacks)
- Contemporary experiences of discrimination
- May delay seeking care
- May not report symptoms
- May avoid certain providers or facilities

### Indigenous Maternal Health

American Indian and Alaska Native women face distinct challenges:

**Key Factors:**
- Underfunding of Indian Health Service
- Geographic isolation of reservations
- Historical trauma affecting health
- Loss of traditional birthing practices
- Jurisdictional complexity affecting care
- Provider shortages in IHS facilities

## IV. Geographic and Access Barriers

### Maternity Care Deserts

Over 2.2 million women of reproductive age live in counties with no obstetric services:

**Desert Formation:**
- Rural hospital closures (financial pressures)
- OB unit closures even in remaining hospitals
- Physician retirement without replacement
- Insurance not covering telehealth adequately
- Limited public transportation

**Consequences of Distance:**
- Longer travel associated with preterm birth
- More unplanned out-of-hospital births
- Reduced prenatal care utilization
- Delayed emergency response
- Maternal stress from uncertainty

### Rural Hospital Collapse

The financial unsustainability of rural obstetrics drives closures:

**Why Rural OB Units Close:**
1. Low volume doesn't cover 24/7 staffing costs
2. Malpractice insurance expensive relative to volume
3. Medicaid reimbursement below cost
4. Specialists unwilling to locate rurally
5. Nurse shortages in rural areas

**Closure Cascade:**
- OB unit closes → pregnant women leave area for care
- Pediatric services weaken → families leave
- Overall hospital viability threatened → hospital closes
- Community loses all healthcare access

### Urban Access Challenges

Even urban areas have access problems:

**Urban Deserts:**
- Hospital closures in low-income neighborhoods
- Provider acceptance of Medicaid limited
- Transportation barriers (time, cost)
- Appointment availability limited
- Language barriers

## V. Social Determinants of Health

### Poverty and Economic Insecurity

Economic factors profoundly affect maternal health:

**Financial Stress Effects:**
- Delayed prenatal care due to cost/time
- Food insecurity affecting nutrition
- Housing instability and homelessness
- Work demands conflicting with care
- Inability to take time off for appointments

**Working Conditions:**
- No paid maternity leave (for most workers)
- No paid sick leave for prenatal appointments
- Exposure to occupational hazards
- High-stress work environments
- Inability to modify duties during pregnancy

### Social Support Deficits

Maternal health depends on social context:

**What Women Need:**
- Emotional support during pregnancy
- Help with childcare and household tasks
- Financial stability
- Safe living environment
- Freedom from violence

**What Many Women Face:**
- Social isolation
- Intimate partner violence (7% of pregnant women)
- Substance use disorders
- Untreated mental health conditions
- Housing instability

### Environmental Factors

Environmental conditions affect maternal outcomes:

**Environmental Exposures:**
- Air pollution linked to preterm birth
- Water contamination (lead, chemicals)
- Proximity to hazardous sites
- Heat exposure increasing
- Food deserts limiting nutrition

**Built Environment:**
- Walkability affecting physical activity
- Access to healthy food
- Safe housing conditions
- Neighborhood safety and stress

## VI. Policy and Political Failures

### Healthcare Policy Gaps

Federal and state policy has failed to prioritize maternal health:

**Federal Level:**
- No paid family leave mandate
- No universal healthcare coverage
- Limited maternal mental health investment
- Medicaid expansion optional
- Quality reporting voluntary

**State Level:**
- Wide variation in Medicaid eligibility and benefits
- Varying scope of practice laws for midwives
- Inconsistent certificate of need laws
- Variable regulation of birthing facilities

### Political Deprioritization

Maternal health has not received political attention commensurate with the crisis:

**Evidence of Deprioritization:**
- First major federal maternal health bill in decades (2018)
- Voluntary, not mandatory, quality standards
- Optional, not required, Medicaid extensions
- Minimal funding relative to crisis scale
- Maternal health overshadowed by other healthcare debates

### The Profit Motive

Market-driven healthcare creates misaligned incentives:

**Profit Over Outcomes:**
- Unprofitable maternity units closed
- Low Medicaid reimbursement limits access
- High-risk patients avoided
- Prevention underfunded relative to treatment
- Quality improvement seen as cost center

## VII. Cultural and Educational Factors

### Medical Education Deficiencies

Provider training contributes to the crisis:

**Training Gaps:**
- Implicit bias not adequately addressed
- Simulation training for emergencies inconsistent
- Maternal warning signs undertaught
- Team communication skills lacking
- Postpartum period receives little attention

### Patient Education and Empowerment

Women often lack information about danger signs:

**Knowledge Gaps:**
- Women don't know warning signs to report
- Don't know rights to refuse interventions
- Don't know when to seek emergency care
- May not understand insurance options
- May not know about birth options

### Childbirth Culture

American childbirth culture affects outcomes:

**Problematic Cultural Norms:**
- Birth viewed primarily as medical event
- Women expected to defer to medical authority
- Pain and suffering normalized
- "Tough it out" mentality delays care-seeking
- Postpartum struggle normalized ("baby blues")

## The Intersection of Causes

These root causes do not operate independently. They intersect and compound:

**Example Pathway:**
1. A Black woman in a rural area (structural racism + geography)
2. On Medicaid with 60-day limit (insurance gap)
3. Sees overtired physician with implicit bias (workforce + racism)
4. At hospital with inconsistent protocols (quality variation)
5. Has postpartum cardiomyopathy after discharge (fragmented care)
6. Cannot access follow-up due to distance and lost coverage (access + insurance)
7. Dies of preventable cardiac event (system failure)

Addressing the maternal health crisis requires interventions across all these domains simultaneously. Single-point solutions will not be sufficient when the causes are systemic and interconnected.
