# Maternal Health in America: A Crisis in the Developed World

## Executive Summary

The United States faces a maternal health crisis unprecedented among wealthy nations. With a maternal mortality rate of approximately 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births (2020), America has the highest rate of any developed country—more than three times higher than most other high-income nations. This crisis disproportionately affects Black, Indigenous, and rural women, revealing deep structural inequities in healthcare access and quality.

Approximately 80% of maternal deaths in the United States are preventable. This statistic alone represents a profound failure of the American healthcare system—not a lack of medical knowledge or technology, but a systemic breakdown in care delivery, access, and continuity. Each year, roughly 700 women die from pregnancy-related complications, and more than 50,000 experience severe maternal morbidity (life-threatening complications).

## Scope of the Crisis

### Mortality Statistics

| Metric | United States | Comparable Countries |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| Maternal mortality rate (per 100,000) | 23.8 | 6-8 average |
| Black maternal mortality rate | 55.3 | N/A |
| Indigenous maternal mortality rate | 26.5 | N/A |
| Hispanic maternal mortality rate | 18.2 | N/A |
| White maternal mortality rate | 19.1 | N/A |
| Severe maternal morbidity (per 10,000) | 144 | 50-80 |

### The Racial Disparity Crisis

The most alarming aspect of America's maternal health crisis is the stark racial disparity:

- **Black women** are 2.6 to 3 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women
- This disparity persists across all education and income levels
- A Black woman with a college degree has higher maternal mortality risk than a white woman with less than a high school education
- Indigenous women face mortality rates 2.3 times higher than white women

These disparities cannot be explained by individual health behaviors or socioeconomic status alone—they reflect systemic racism in healthcare delivery, implicit bias among providers, and the cumulative health effects of structural discrimination.

### Geographic Crisis: Maternity Care Deserts

More than 2.2 million women of reproductive age live in counties with no hospitals offering obstetric care, no birth centers, and no OB/GYN or certified nurse-midwife providers. These "maternity care deserts" have grown by 4% since 2020.

- **36% of U.S. counties** have no hospital obstetric services
- **Over 200 rural hospitals** have closed labor and delivery units since 2011
- Women in maternity care deserts travel **29 miles on average** to access prenatal care
- Rural maternal mortality rates are **60% higher** than urban rates

## Key Policy Areas

### 1. Prenatal Care Access

Early and consistent prenatal care dramatically reduces maternal and infant mortality. Yet significant barriers persist:
- 6.2% of women receive late or no prenatal care
- Rates of inadequate prenatal care are twice as high for Black and Indigenous women
- Insurance gaps, transportation barriers, and provider shortages limit access

### 2. Labor and Delivery Capacity

Hospital closures and consolidation have reduced birthing options:
- Rural hospital closures accelerating since 2010
- Urban hospitals closing labor units in low-income neighborhoods
- Concentration of care in fewer, larger facilities
- Increased travel times associated with worse outcomes

### 3. Postpartum Care Gaps

The traditional 6-week postpartum visit model is dangerously inadequate:
- Most maternal deaths occur in the postpartum period
- One-third occur between 7 days and 1 year after delivery
- Medicaid coverage historically ended 60 days postpartum
- Mental health and chronic condition management often neglected

### 4. Workforce Shortages

The OB/GYN workforce cannot meet demand:
- Half of U.S. counties have no OB/GYN providers
- Average OB/GYN age is 51, with looming retirements
- Midwifery scope of practice restrictions limit capacity
- Maldistribution concentrates providers in urban/suburban areas

### 5. Quality of Care

Even when care is accessible, quality varies dramatically:
- Wide variation in cesarean section rates (15-70% by hospital)
- Inconsistent implementation of evidence-based practices
- Failure to recognize warning signs, especially in Black women
- Hospital mergers reducing competition and accountability

## Why This Matters

The maternal health crisis is a symptom of broader healthcare system failures:

1. **Fragmented Care**: Lack of coordination between prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care
2. **Insurance Gaps**: Coverage instability during and after pregnancy
3. **Provider Bias**: Documented implicit bias affecting care quality for women of color
4. **System Underinvestment**: Maternity care is not profitable, leading to closures
5. **Policy Failures**: Inadequate Medicaid coverage, limited midwifery expansion, insufficient safety net

## The Path Forward

Addressing America's maternal health crisis requires:

- **Extended Medicaid Coverage**: Full 12-month postpartum coverage (now optional for states)
- **Maternity Care Desert Elimination**: Investment in rural and underserved obstetric capacity
- **Workforce Expansion**: Training more OB/GYNs, expanding midwifery, supporting doulas
- **Racial Equity Focus**: Addressing systemic racism through training, accountability, and community investment
- **Quality Improvement**: Implementing evidence-based bundles for hemorrhage, hypertension, and sepsis
- **Alternative Birth Settings**: Supporting birth centers and home birth options
- **Data and Accountability**: Strengthening maternal mortality review committees

The solutions exist. Other countries have proven that maternal mortality can be reduced to low single digits. The question is whether America has the political will to prioritize the lives of mothers.
