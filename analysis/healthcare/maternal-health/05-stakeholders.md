## Key Stakeholder Dynamics

### Physician-Midwife Tension

One of the most persistent dynamics is the relationship between physicians (particularly ACOG) and midwives:

**Historical Pattern:**
- Physicians suppressed midwifery in early 20th century
- Ongoing scope of practice battles
- Competition for patients and reimbursement
- Different philosophical approaches to birth

**Current State:**
- Increasing acceptance of collaborative models

- Continuing opposition in others
- Growing consumer demand for options

### Hospital Financial Pressures

Hospital decisions about maternity services are shaped by financial realities:

**Tension Points:**

- Rural hospitals especially stressed
- Medicaid underpayment a persistent issue

### Quality vs. Autonomy

Efforts to standardize care through protocols and bundles encounter resistance:

- Providers value clinical autonomy

- Voluntary participation limits reach

### Equity Focus Creating New Coalitions

The racial equity framing of maternal health has created new alliances:
