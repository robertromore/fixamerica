# Solutions for the Maternal Health Crisis

## Evidence-Based Interventions

The maternal health crisis is solvable. Other countries have achieved maternal mortality rates one-third to one-tenth of America's. California reduced its maternal mortality by 55% in a decade. The solutions exist—what is needed is the political will to implement them at scale.

This document outlines proven and promising interventions across the continuum of maternal health, organized by domain.

## I. Coverage and Access Solutions

### 1. Universal Postpartum Medicaid Extension

**The Problem:** Historically, pregnancy-related Medicaid ended 60 days postpartum, despite 33% of maternal deaths occurring between 43 days and 1 year.

**The Solution:** Extend Medicaid coverage to 12 months postpartum in all states.

**Current Status:**
- American Rescue Plan Act (2021) made 12-month extension a state option
- 46 states have implemented or approved extension
- 4 states remain at 60 days

**Evidence:**
- Postpartum coverage prevents gaps in chronic disease management
- Enables mental health treatment
- Maintains contraceptive access
- Addresses leading causes of late maternal death

**Policy Mechanism:**
- Make 12-month extension mandatory, not optional
- Automatic enrollment (no reapplication required)
- Full federal match for extended coverage

**Estimated Impact:** Could prevent 25-30% of late maternal deaths

### 2. Close the Coverage Gap

**The Problem:** 2 million women of reproductive age remain uninsured, concentrated in non-expansion states.

**The Solution:** Multiple pathways to universal coverage:

| Approach | Mechanism | Barriers |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Medicaid expansion | Expand eligibility to 138% FPL | State political opposition |
| Federal fallback | Federal coverage in non-expansion states | Congressional action needed |
| Pregnancy pathway expansion | Raise income limits for pregnant women | State budget concerns |
| Buy-in options | Allow purchase of Medicaid/public option | State and federal action |

**Priority Focus:** Close the coverage gap in the 10 non-expansion states where maternal outcomes are often worst.

### 3. Improve Medicaid Reimbursement

**The Problem:** Low Medicaid reimbursement limits provider participation and threatens facility sustainability.

**The Solution:** Increase Medicaid payment rates for maternity services:

- **Match Medicare rates** for obstetric services
- **Rate parity for midwives** (currently 60-80% of physician rates)
- **Birth center reimbursement** at sustainable levels
- **Doula reimbursement** that covers actual costs

**Implementation:**
- Federal minimum reimbursement floor
- Enhanced federal match for rate increases
- Value-based payment incentives

## II. Quality Improvement Solutions

### 4. Implement Universal Safety Bundles

**The Problem:** Evidence-based safety protocols are inconsistently implemented.

**The Solution:** Require implementation of AIM (Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health) safety bundles at all birthing facilities.

**Priority Bundles:**

| Bundle | Target Condition | Evidence of Effectiveness |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Obstetric Hemorrhage | Severe bleeding | 20-30% reduction in SMM |
| Severe Hypertension | Preeclampsia/Eclampsia | 40% reduction in strokes |
| Sepsis | Maternal infection | 30% reduction in sepsis mortality |
| VTE Prevention | Blood clots | Significant reduction in PE deaths |
| Care for Pregnant People of Color | Racial disparities | Emerging evidence |

**Implementation Mechanisms:**
- Condition of participation for Medicaid hospitals
- Joint Commission perinatal certification requirement
- Public reporting of bundle implementation
- Technical assistance for implementation

### 5. Establish Level of Maternal Care Designations

**The Problem:** Not all hospitals are equipped for high-risk deliveries, and risk-appropriate care matching is inconsistent.

**The Solution:** Implement standardized maternal levels of care with mandatory designation:

| Level | Capability | Patient Population |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| Level I | Basic care | Low-risk pregnancies |
| Level II | Specialty care | Moderate-risk pregnancies |
| Level III | Subspecialty care | High-risk, complex conditions |
| Level IV | Regional perinatal center | All patients, most complex cases |

**Requirements:**
- Mandatory state designation systems
- Periodic verification
- Regionalized referral networks
- Transport protocols
- Outcome monitoring by level

### 6. Strengthen Maternal Mortality Review

**The Problem:** Maternal mortality review committees lack consistency and enforcement power.

**The Solution:** Enhance MMRC effectiveness:

- **Mandate MMRCs in all states** (currently 48 states have them)
- **Standardize data collection** using CDC tools
- **Require public reporting** of findings and recommendations
- **Fund implementation** of recommendations
- **Legal protections** for review process
- **Multidisciplinary composition** including community members
- **Track preventability** and contributing factors

### 7. Improve Obstetric Emergency Response

**The Problem:** Delayed or inadequate response to obstetric emergencies causes preventable deaths.

**The Solution:** Obstetric emergency training and protocols:

- **Mandatory simulation training** for obstetric emergencies
- **Obstetric rapid response teams** at all birthing hospitals
- **Hemorrhage and hypertension carts** stocked and ready
- **Massive transfusion protocols** in place
- **Transfer agreements** with higher-level facilities
- **Time-to-treatment metrics** tracked and reported

## III. Workforce Solutions

### 8. Expand and Redistribute the OB/GYN Workforce

**The Problem:** OB/GYN shortage with severe maldistribution; 49% of counties have no OB/GYN.

**The Solutions:**

**Training Expansion:**

- Support loan repayment for underserved area practice
- Develop family medicine OB training

**Redistribution:**
- Expand National Health Service Corps for OB/GYN
- State-funded loan repayment for rural practice
- Telemedicine to extend specialist reach
- Regional referral networks

**Retention:**
- Address burnout and work-life balance
- Malpractice reform to reduce defensive practice
- Practice support and team-based models

### 9. Achieve Full Practice Authority for Midwives

**The Problem:** Scope of practice restrictions limit midwifery contribution to maternal health.

**The Solution:** Full practice authority for certified nurse-midwives in all states:

| Current Barrier | Solution |
|-----------------|----------|
| Physician supervision requirements | Remove; allow autonomous practice |
| Collaborative agreement mandates | Make optional, not required |
| Hospital privilege restrictions | Require non-discrimination |
| Medicaid payment disparities | Mandate 100% of physician rate |
| Prescriptive authority limits | Grant full prescriptive authority |

**Implementation Path:**
- State-by-state legislation
- Federal incentives for state action
- Model legislation (Nurse Practice Act)
- Public awareness campaigns

**Evidence:** Studies consistently show equivalent or better outcomes with midwifery care for low-risk pregnancies, with lower intervention rates.

### 10. Integrate Doulas into Maternity Care

**The Problem:** Doula support improves outcomes but is inaccessible to most low-income women.

**The Solution:** Medicaid coverage of doula services in all states:

**Current Status:**
- 12 states offer some Medicaid doula reimbursement

- Rates often inadequate

**Policy Elements:**
- Mandatory Medicaid doula benefit
- Adequate reimbursement (minimum $1,000-$1,500 per birth)
- Community doula training programs
- Integration with prenatal care
- Priority for high-risk and BIPOC women

**Evidence:** Doula support associated with:
- Reduced cesarean sections
- Reduced use of pain medication
- Shorter labors
- Higher breastfeeding rates
- Improved patient satisfaction
- Reduced preterm birth (some studies)

### 11. Develop Community Health Worker Models
