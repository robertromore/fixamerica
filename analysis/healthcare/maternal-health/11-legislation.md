## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

This section analyzes critical gaps in current maternal health legislation and proposes specific reforms.

### Coverage and Access Loopholes

| Loophole/Shortcoming | Current Law | Impact | Rectification |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Postpartum Medicaid is optional | ARP allows but does not require 12-month extension | 4 states still at 60 days; women lose coverage during high-risk period | Make 12-month postpartum Medicaid mandatory for all states through federal law |
| Medicaid expansion remains optional | ACA made expansion state choice | 10 states not expanded; coverage gap for low-income women | Federal fallback coverage or mandatory expansion with full federal funding |
| Immigration status bars coverage | Personal Responsibility Act (1996) | Undocumented and many documented immigrants excluded | Emergency Medicaid only or CHIP-like coverage for pregnant women regardless of status |
| Private insurance maternity gaps | ACA essential benefits apply only to individual/small group | Large employer plans may have maternity gaps | Extend essential health benefits to all private insurance |
| Short-term plans exclude maternity | Regulation allows exclusions | Consumers may unknowingly lack coverage | Ban short-term plans or require maternity coverage |

### Quality and Safety Shortcomings

| Loophole/Shortcoming | Current Law | Impact | Rectification |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| No mandatory safety bundles | Voluntary AIM participation | 30-50% of hospitals lack full implementation | Make AIM bundle implementation a CMS Condition of Participation |
| MMRC recommendations non-binding | Preventing Maternal Deaths Act funds but doesn't mandate | Recommendations may be ignored; no accountability | Require response and implementation plans from state agencies and hospitals |
| Hospital quality reporting voluntary | CMS quality reporting mostly voluntary for maternal measures | Public lacks information; no accountability | Mandatory public reporting of maternal outcomes at hospital level |
| No national birth facility standards | State-by-state licensing with wide variation | Quality depends on birth location | Federal minimum standards for all birthing facilities |
| Level of care designations inconsistent | No federal requirement | Inappropriate matching of risk to facility level | Mandate level of care designation systems in all states |
| No staffing requirements | No federal nurse staffing mandates | Understaffing contributes to adverse outcomes | Minimum nurse-to-patient ratios for labor and delivery |

### Workforce and Provider Shortcomings

| Loophole/Shortcoming | Current Law | Impact | Rectification |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| CNM scope of practice restrictions | State-by-state regulation | 14 states require physician involvement; limits access | Federal preemption establishing full practice authority or condition Medicaid on full practice authority |
| Medicaid midwifery payment disparity | States set rates; typically 60-80% of MD rates | Disincentives midwifery practice, especially for Medicaid | Federal requirement for 100% payment parity |
| OB/GYN geographic maldistribution | No federal distribution requirements | 49% of counties have no OB/GYN | Mandatory service in underserved areas for loan repayment, enhanced NHSC funding |
| No CPM Medicare coverage | Medicare does not cover CPM services | Limits birth center options for Medicare beneficiaries | Add CPMs to Medicare provider list |
| Doula coverage not required | No federal mandate | Most women lack access to doula support | Make Medicaid doula coverage mandatory |
| No community health worker standards | No federal recognition or reimbursement requirements | Inconsistent use of CHWs in maternal health | Federal CHW certification and Medicaid reimbursement standards |

### Equity and Discrimination Shortcomings

| Loophole/Shortcoming | Current Law | Impact | Rectification |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| No enforcement mechanism for disparities | Title VI relies on individual complaints | Systemic discrimination continues | Proactive disparity monitoring with consequences; equity audits |
| No mandatory implicit bias training | No federal requirement | Provider bias contributes to disparities | Require implicit bias training for Medicaid provider participation |
| SDOH not integrated in payment | Fee-for-service ignores social factors | Social determinants of maternal health unaddressed | Require SDOH screening and intervention as part of maternal care |
| No data standards for race/ethnicity | Inconsistent collection | Cannot track disparities accurately | Standardized, self-reported race/ethnicity data collection requirements |
| IHS chronic underfunding | Discretionary appropriations | Indigenous maternal health neglected | Mandatory full IHS funding; advance appropriations |

### Rural and Geographic Shortcomings

| Loophole/Shortcoming | Current Law | Impact | Rectification |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| No requirement to maintain OB services | Hospitals can close units at will | Rural OB closures accelerating; maternity care deserts expanding | Financial requirements or incentives to maintain OB services; closure review process |
| Inadequate rural hospital reimbursement | Medicare/Medicaid rates do not cover rural costs | Rural hospitals financially unsustainable | Enhanced rural obstetric reimbursement rates |
| Telehealth restrictions | Pre-pandemic restrictions partially relaxed | Geographic barriers to specialist consultation | Permanent telehealth flexibilities for maternal care |
| Birth centers face startup barriers | No federal support for development | Limited alternatives to hospital birth | Federal birth center development grants in underserved areas |
| Transportation not covered | Medicaid NEMT limited and underfunded | Women cannot reach care | Enhanced NEMT funding and requirements for maternal care |

### Mental Health Shortcomings

| Loophole/Shortcoming | Current Law | Impact | Rectification |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Mental health parity poorly enforced | MHPAEA on books but weak enforcement | Perinatal mental health coverage gaps | Aggressive parity enforcement; specific perinatal mental health requirements |
| No screening mandate | No federal requirement for perinatal depression screening | 40% not screened; conditions undiagnosed | Mandatory perinatal mental health screening as condition of payment |
| Inpatient maternal mental health beds lacking | No requirement for specialized beds | Mothers separated from infants; inadequate treatment | Incentives for mother-baby units |
| Perinatal mental health workforce shortage | No specific training requirements | Specialists extremely rare | Training program development and loan repayment |

### Data and Accountability Shortcomings

| Loophole/Shortcoming | Current Law | Impact | Rectification |
|----------------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Maternal death data delayed | Vital statistics reporting takes 1-2 years | Cannot respond quickly to trends | Real-time maternal death reporting requirement |
| SMM surveillance limited | No national surveillance system | Do not know true morbidity burden | National severe maternal morbidity surveillance system |
| Hospital outcomes not linked to payment | Value-based payment limited for maternity | No financial consequences for poor outcomes | Maternal outcome-based payment adjustments |
| No national maternal health commission | No standing oversight body | Fragmented federal response | Establish National Commission on Maternal Health |
