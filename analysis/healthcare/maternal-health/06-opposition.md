# Opposition to Maternal Health Reform

## Understanding Resistance

Despite the clear evidence of crisis and the existence of proven solutions, maternal health reform faces significant opposition. This resistance comes from multiple sources—economic interests, professional turf protection, ideological positions, and institutional inertia. Understanding these opposition forces is essential for developing effective advocacy strategies.

## Economic and Financial Opposition

### Hospital and Health System Resistance

**Opposition to Rural/Low-Volume Obstetric Requirements:**

Hospitals resist mandates to maintain maternity services:

| Opposition Argument | Industry Position | Counter-Argument |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| "Unprofitable to maintain OB" | Hospital choice to close | Cost-shifting creates system costs; community infrastructure lost |
| "Can't staff 24/7 for low volume" | Business decision | Telehealth, regionalization, alternative models exist |
| "Liability too high for occasional deliveries" | Risk management | Proper protocols and transfer agreements address safety |
| "Should consolidate at higher-volume centers" | Efficiency argument | Distance associated with worse outcomes |

**Opposition to Quality Mandates:**

- Hospitals resist mandatory safety bundle implementation as "unfunded mandate"
- Push back on public reporting of maternal outcomes
- Argue against staffing ratio requirements
- Resist external oversight and accountability measures

**Lobbying and Political Influence:**
- American Hospital Association is major lobbying force
- State hospital associations oppose many regulations
- Campaign contributions shape legislative outcomes
- Revolving door between industry and regulators

### Insurance Industry Opposition

**Opposition to Coverage Expansions:**

Private insurers resist requirements that increase costs:

| Measure | Industry Opposition |
|---------|-------------------|
| Extended postpartum coverage | Increases cost without offsetting savings |
| Mandatory doula coverage | Questions evidence, payment rates |
| Mental health parity enforcement | Coverage expansion resistance |
| Surprise billing protections | Affects network leverage |
| Essential health benefit mandates | Increases premiums |

**Opposition to Payment Reform:**
- Resistance to episode-based payments that transfer risk
- Pushback on quality incentives that require investment
- Opposing network adequacy requirements
- Resisting maternal-specific quality measures

### Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Interests

**Relevant Areas:**

While less central than in some healthcare areas, industry interests include:
- Maintaining high-cost interventions (epidurals, monitoring, interventions)
- Opposing low-cost alternatives (midwifery, birth centers)
- Influencing clinical guidelines toward product use
- Marketing directly to patients

## Professional and Turf Opposition

### Physician Opposition to Scope of Practice Expansion

**ACOG and State Medical Society Positions:**

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and state medical societies often oppose expanding the autonomous practice of non-physician providers:

**Arguments Made:**
1. "Patient safety requires physician supervision"
2. "Midwives lack training for complications"
3. "Only physicians should lead maternity care"
4. "Team-based care requires physician leadership"

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Countries with midwifery-led care have better outcomes
- Research shows equivalent or better outcomes with CNM care
- Safety record of birth centers excellent
- Collaboration models successful in many states

**What This Opposition Achieves:**
- Maintains physician market dominance
- Limits competition from lower-cost providers
- Preserves reimbursement differentials
- Controls facility privileges

**State-Level Battles:**

| State | Scope of Practice Status | Opposition Strength |
|-------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 26 states | Full CNM practice authority | N/A (achieved) |
| 14 states | Require physician involvement | Strong opposition |
| 10 states | Reduced barriers | Moderate opposition |

**Hospital Credentialing as Barrier:**
- Even where state law allows CNM autonomy, hospitals may:
  - Deny privileges to midwives
  - Require supervising physician approval
  - Limit types of patients midwives can manage
  - Create administrative barriers

### Opposition to Doula Integration

**Resistance to Medicaid Doula Coverage:**

Despite strong evidence, doula integration faces opposition:

**Arguments Against:**
- "Not evidence-based" (false—evidence is strong)
- "Duplicates nursing care"
- "Credential standards unclear"
- "Administrative burden of new provider type"
- "Cost concerns"

**Underlying Concerns:**
- Doulas may challenge medical authority
- Potential advocacy for patient preferences over provider convenience
- Introducing non-medical perspective into medical setting
- Competition for patient attention

### Turf Battles Within Healthcare

**Tensions Affecting Reform:**

- Physicians vs. midwives
- CNMs vs. CPMs (within midwifery profession)
- Nurses vs. doulas
- Specialists vs. generalists
- Hospital-based vs. community-based providers

These internal conflicts:
- Distract from maternal health improvement
- Divide potential reform coalitions
- Consume advocacy resources
- Allow status quo to persist

## Political and Ideological Opposition

### Fiscal Conservatism

**Opposition to Spending Increases:**

Some policymakers oppose maternal health investment on fiscal grounds:

| Proposal | Conservative Opposition |
|----------|------------------------|
| Medicaid expansion | "Can't afford entitlement growth" |
| 12-month postpartum coverage | "Costly new mandate" |
| Maternal health programs | "Federal overreach" |
| Rural hospital subsidies | "Market should decide" |
| Workforce investment | "Government shouldn't pick winners" |

**Counter-Arguments:**
- Preventable maternal deaths and complications are more expensive than prevention
- Maternal health investment has positive ROI through reduced NICU costs, healthier children
- International examples show universal coverage is more efficient
- Human cost of inaction immeasurable

### Anti-Government/Anti-Regulation Ideology

**Opposition to Mandates:**

- Resistance to any new regulations on providers or facilities
- Opposition to federal involvement in healthcare delivery
- Preference for "market-based solutions"
- Distrust of government quality standards

**Specific Applications:**
- Opposition to mandatory quality bundles
- Resistance to federal maternal health standards
- Opposing Medicaid program requirements
- Blocking certificate of need laws

### Abortion Politics Intersection

**How Abortion Politics Affects Maternal Health:**

Maternal health has become entangled with abortion politics:

**Negative Impacts:**
- Some oppose maternal health funding if any goes to Planned Parenthood
- "Pro-life" positions sometimes extend to opposing contraception access
- Fetal personhood legislation can criminalize pregnancy outcomes
- Abortion restrictions may delay care for complications

**Specific Policy Interactions:**
- Hyde Amendment restricts Medicaid coverage of abortion
- Hospital mergers with Catholic systems limit reproductive healthcare
- Emergency abortion restrictions may delay lifesaving care
- Gestational age limits may affect management of complications

**Potential Common Ground:**
- Focus on carrying healthy pregnancies to term
- Bipartisan support for reducing maternal mortality
- "Pro-life" could extend to maternal life
- Avoiding explicit abortion connections in maternal health policy

### Resistance to Racial Equity Framing

**Opposition to Centering Race:**

Some stakeholders resist the explicit focus on racial disparities:

**Arguments Made:**
- "Maternal health should be about all mothers"
- "Focusing on race is divisive"
- "Socioeconomic factors explain disparities"
- "Individual behavior, not systemic racism"
- "Implicit bias training is unscientific"

**Reality:**
- Racial disparities persist across socioeconomic levels
- Evidence of systemic bias is robust
- Addressing disparities requires naming them
- "Colorblind" approaches have failed
- Improving outcomes for Black women improves outcomes for all

**Political Implications:**
- Some policymakers uncomfortable with racism language
- Equity focus seen as partisan by some
- May affect coalition-building
- Advocates must navigate carefully

## Institutional and Bureaucratic Resistance

### Healthcare Institution Inertia

**Resistance to Change:**

Healthcare institutions are famously resistant to change:

| Change Proposed | Institutional Resistance |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| New safety protocols | "We've always done it this way" |
| Team-based care | Hierarchical culture resistance |
| Quality transparency | Fear of liability, competition |
| Community partnerships | Outside institutional expertise |
| Patient engagement | Challenges medical authority |

**Root Causes:**
- Risk-averse culture
- Hierarchical power structures
- Training and habit
- Lack of incentives for change
- Fear of liability

### Regulatory Capture and Bureaucratic Inertia

**Government Agency Limitations:**

- State agencies may lack expertise or resources for maternal health
- Regulatory agencies influenced by those they regulate
- Slow bureaucratic processes delay implementation
- Staff turnover affects program continuity
- Budget constraints limit enforcement

**Federal Program Challenges:**
- CMS rulemaking is slow
- State flexibility leads to variation
- Enforcement of existing requirements limited
- Data systems outdated

## Specific Policy Opposition

### Opposition to Medicaid Expansion

In 10 states that have not expanded Medicaid:

**Arguments Against:**
- State budget impact
- Federal funding uncertainty
- Philosophical opposition to "welfare"
- Political positioning

**Impact on Maternal Health:**
- Coverage gaps for low-income women
- Women lose coverage before becoming pregnant
- Churn between programs
- Higher uninsured rates

### Opposition to Certificate of Need Laws

**Policy Background:**

Certificate of need (CON) laws require state approval before building new facilities.

**Opposition Arguments:**
- Restricts competition
- Protects incumbent providers
- Limits consumer choice
- Barrier to innovation

**CON Relevance to Maternal Health:**
- May affect birth center establishment
- Could block new obstetric services
- Might prevent hospital closures
- Affects rural facility development

**Status:** Active debates in many states about CON modification or repeal

### Opposition to Mandatory Quality Reporting

**Resistance to Transparency:**

Hospitals and providers often resist public reporting of outcomes:

**Arguments Against:**
- Risk adjustment concerns
- Gaming of metrics
- Unfair to safety-net hospitals
- Liability exposure
- Administrative burden

**What Transparency Advocates Say:**
- Patients deserve information
- Transparency drives improvement
- Other industries manage public accountability
- Methodology can address fairness concerns

## Strategies of Opposition
