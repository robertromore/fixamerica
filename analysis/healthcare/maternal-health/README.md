# Maternal Health in America: A Crisis in the Developed World

The United States faces a maternal health crisis unprecedented among wealthy nations. With a maternal mortality rate of approximately 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births (2020), America has the highest rate of any developed country—more than three times higher than most other high-income nations. This crisis disproportionately affects Black, Indigenous, and rural women, revealing deep structural inequities in healthcare access and quality.
