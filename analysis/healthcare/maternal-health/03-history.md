# History of Maternal Health in America

## The Arc of Progress and Regression

The history of maternal health in the United States is a story of remarkable progress followed by troubling stagnation and reversal. Understanding this history reveals how America went from having one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the developed world in the early 20th century, to achieving dramatic improvements mid-century, to now once again holding the worst record among wealthy nations.

## Early American Childbirth (Colonial Era - 1900)

### Home Birth and Midwifery Dominance

For most of American history, childbirth was a home-based event attended by midwives:

- **Midwives attended over 50% of births** until the early 1900s
- Communities developed strong traditions of "granny midwives" and lay midwives
- African American midwives served both Black and white families in the South
- Immigrant midwives brought traditions from their home countries

**Maternal mortality in this era was extremely high:**
- Estimated 600-900 deaths per 100,000 live births
- Primary causes: puerperal (childbed) fever, hemorrhage, eclampsia
- No antisepsis or understanding of germ theory until late 1800s
- Maternal death was a common, accepted risk of childbearing

### The Rise of Physician-Attended Birth

Beginning in the mid-1800s, physicians began to compete with midwives:

**1847**: American Medical Association founded, soon beginning campaign against midwifery
**1860s-1880s**: Germ theory and antisepsis developed (Semmelweis, Lister, Pasteur)
**1880s-1900s**: Medical schools expand obstetrics training
**1900**: Approximately 50% of births attended by physicians

**Consequences of Medicalization:**
- Physicians often had less experience than midwives
- Overuse of forceps and interventions increased injuries
- Hospital births introduced new infection risks
- Maternal mortality actually increased in some areas initially

## The Progressive Era and Early Reform (1900-1940)

### The Sheppard-Towner Act (1921-1929)

The first federal maternal and child health program emerged from Progressive Era reform:

**Context:**
- U.S. had highest maternal and infant mortality among developed nations
- Women gained the vote in 1920
- Growing public health movement

**Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Act (1921):**
- First federal social welfare program
- Provided matching funds to states for maternal and infant health
- Established prenatal clinics, visiting nurse programs
- Funded midwife training and education
- Reduced infant mortality by 11% in participating states

**Demise:**
- AMA opposed the program as "socialist"
- Funding eliminated in 1929
- Left a legacy of federal responsibility for maternal health

### The Medicalization of Childbirth

The 1920s-1940s saw dramatic transformation of birth practices:

| Year | Physician-Attended Births | Hospital Births |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 1900 | 50% | 5% |
| 1920 | 65% | 30% |
| 1940 | 85% | 55% |
| 1960 | 98% | 97% |

**Key Developments:**
- **1914**: First maternal mortality study (NYC) reveals preventable causes
- **1920s**: Hospital birth becomes marker of "modern" motherhood
- **1930s**: Sulfa drugs dramatically reduce puerperal fever deaths
- **1936**: Maternal Mortality in New York City study shocks nation

### The Elimination of Midwifery

The medical profession systematically marginalized midwifery:

**Strategies Used:**
1. Licensing laws requiring physician supervision
2. Characterizing midwives as ignorant and dangerous
3. Racial and immigrant prejudice against midwives
4. Excluding midwives from hospitals
5. Medical school expansion to produce more obstetricians

**By 1960:**
- Midwives attended only 2% of births
- Granny midwifery eliminated in most states
- Nurse-midwifery survived only in frontier areas

**Lasting Impact:**
- Loss of low-intervention birth option
- Loss of community-based perinatal support
- Concentration of birth in hospitals
- Loss of cultural birthing traditions

## The Golden Age of Improvement (1940-1980)

### Dramatic Mortality Decline

Maternal mortality fell dramatically during this period:

| Year | Maternal Deaths per 100,000 Live Births |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| 1940 | 376.0 |
| 1950 | 83.3 |
| 1960 | 37.1 |
| 1970 | 21.5 |
| 1980 | 9.2 |

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **Antibiotics**: Penicillin (1940s) eliminated most infection deaths
2. **Blood banking**: Safe blood transfusions for hemorrhage
3. **Prenatal care expansion**: Identification of high-risk pregnancies
4. **Hospital delivery**: Access to emergency intervention
5. **Anesthesia improvements**: Safer cesarean sections
6. **Family planning**: Ability to space and limit pregnancies

### Racial Disparities Persist

Despite overall improvement, racial disparities remained stark:

**1960 Maternal Mortality Rates:**
- White women: 26.0 per 100,000
- Black women: 97.9 per 100,000
- Ratio: 3.8x higher for Black women

**Contributing Factors:**
- Segregated and inferior hospital care
- Exclusion from private physician practices
- Limited prenatal care access
- Poverty and discrimination
- Continuing reliance on less-trained midwives

### Federal Programs Expand

**Medicaid (1965):**
- Extended healthcare coverage to poor pregnant women
- Created pathway for prenatal care access
- Established federal role in pregnancy care

**Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant:**
- Continued federal support for maternal health
- State flexibility in program design
- Infrastructure for public health programs

### The Natural Childbirth Movement

Beginning in the 1960s, women challenged medicalized birth:

**Key Developments:**
1. **Lamaze method** introduced (1960)
2. **La Leche League** founded (1956) promoting breastfeeding
3. **Our Bodies, Ourselves** published (1970)
4. **Ina May Gaskin's Farm Midwifery Center** (1971)
5. **Birth center movement** begins (1975)

**Movement Goals:**
- Woman-centered birth experience
- Reduction of unnecessary interventions
- Father's presence in delivery
- Alternatives to hospital birth
- Revitalization of midwifery

## Stagnation and Rising Inequality (1980-2000)

### Progress Halts

After decades of improvement, maternal mortality decline stopped:

| Year | Maternal Deaths per 100,000 |
|------|----------------------------|
| 1980 | 9.2 |
| 1990 | 10.0 |
| 2000 | 9.8 |

**Factors in Stagnation:**
1. Rising cesarean section rates
2. Increasing maternal age
3. Rising obesity and chronic disease
4. Fragmented care systems
5. Healthcare access inequities
6. Rural hospital closures beginning

### Rising Cesarean Rates

C-section rates rose dramatically:

| Year | C-Section Rate |
|------|---------------|
| 1965 | 4.5% |
| 1975 | 10.4% |
| 1985 | 22.7% |
| 1995 | 20.8% |
| 2005 | 30.3% |
| 2020 | 31.8% |

**Contributing Factors:**
- Malpractice liability concerns
- Electronic fetal monitoring interpretation
- Convenience for providers and patients
- Declining VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) rates
- Financial incentives

### Managed Care and Maternity

The rise of managed care transformed maternity services:

**1980s-1990s Changes:**
- Drive-through deliveries (24-48 hour discharges)
- Pressure to reduce length of stay
- Prior authorization for services
- Network restrictions limiting provider choice
- Cost-cutting affecting staffing

**1996: Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act**
- Required minimum 48-hour stays for vaginal delivery
- 96 hours for cesarean section
- Response to public outcry over premature discharge

### Midwifery Revival

The natural birth movement produced policy changes:

**1970s-1990s Developments:**
- American College of Nurse-Midwives grows
- States begin licensing certified nurse-midwives
- Birth center accreditation established (1985)
- Midwifery education programs expand
- Hospital privileges slowly granted

**Continuing Barriers:**
- Physician resistance to autonomous practice
- State-by-state scope of practice battles
- Limited Medicaid reimbursement
- Malpractice insurance challenges

## The Modern Crisis (2000-Present)

### Maternal Mortality Rises

In stark contrast to other developed nations, U.S. maternal mortality began increasing:

| Year | U.S. Rate | UK Rate | Sweden Rate |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 2000 | 9.8 | 6.2 | 5.0 |
| 2010 | 16.7 | 8.5 | 4.0 |
| 2020 | 23.8 | 9.7 | 4.0 |

**Contributing Factors:**
1. **Chronic disease burden**: Rising obesity, diabetes, hypertension
2. **Advanced maternal age**: More births to women 35+
3. **Medicaid coverage gaps**: 60-day postpartum coverage limit
4. **Rural hospital closures**: Maternity care deserts expand
5. **Quality variation**: Inconsistent evidence-based practices
6. **Systemic racism**: Persistent disparities for Black women
7. **Data improvement**: Better tracking reveals true rates

### Major Policy Developments

**2010: Affordable Care Act (ACA)**
- Maternity care defined as essential health benefit
- Medicaid expansion (in participating states)
- Preventive services coverage
- Dependent coverage to age 26
- Pre-existing condition protections

**2016-Present: State Maternal Mortality Review Committees**
- CDC funding for all states to establish MMRCs
- Standardized data collection
- Identification of preventable deaths

### The California Model

California achieved the most significant maternal mortality reduction:

**Timeline:**
- **2006**: California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative founded
- **2008**: Hemorrhage prevention toolkit released
- **2013**: Preeclampsia prevention toolkit released
- **2016**: 55% reduction in maternal mortality achieved

**Key Elements:**
1. Statewide quality improvement collaborative
2. Evidence-based safety bundles
3. Hospital-level data and accountability
4. Peer learning networks
5. Leadership from hospitals, providers, and state

### COVID-19 Impact

The pandemic exacerbated the maternal health crisis:

**2021 Data:**
- Maternal mortality increased 40% over 2020
- COVID-19 became a leading cause of maternal death
- Prenatal care disruptions
- Hospital visitor restrictions
- Healthcare worker burnout
- Disproportionate impact on communities of color

## Lessons from History

### What Worked

1. **Public health infrastructure**: Sheppard-Towner, Title V, WIC
2. **Medical advances**: Antibiotics, blood banking, safe surgery
3. **Insurance expansion**: Medicaid, ACA coverage
4. **Quality improvement**: California collaborative model
5. **Data and accountability**: Maternal mortality review

### What Failed

1. **Eliminating midwifery**: Lost low-intervention option
2. **Fragmented care**: No coordination prenatal to postpartum
3. **Racial discrimination**: Disparities built into healthcare systems
4. **Rural disinvestment**: Closures creating care deserts
5. **Short-term coverage**: 60-day Medicaid cutoff

### The Central Question

The United States demonstrated the capacity to reduce maternal mortality dramatically from 1940-1980. Other countries continue to improve. The central historical question is: **Why has America regressed while others progressed?**

The answer lies in fragmented healthcare systems, persistent racism, market-driven healthcare that undervalues maternity care, and failure to learn from what works both domestically (California) and internationally.
