# Current State of Maternal Health in America

## The Statistical Reality

### Maternal Mortality: America's Shameful Standing

The United States maternal mortality rate has been climbing while other developed nations have achieved steady declines. According to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics:

**2021 Maternal Mortality Rates (deaths per 100,000 live births):**

| Country | Rate | Comparison to U.S. |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| United States | 32.9 | Baseline |
| United Kingdom | 9.7 | 3.4x lower |
| Canada | 8.4 | 3.9x lower |
| France | 8.0 | 4.1x lower |
| Germany | 4.0 | 8.2x lower |
| Sweden | 4.0 | 8.2x lower |
| Japan | 3.4 | 9.7x lower |
| Norway | 1.8 | 18.3x lower |

The U.S. rate increased 40% between 2020 and 2021, partly attributed to COVID-19 impacts, but the crisis predates the pandemic.

### Racial and Ethnic Disparities

The disparity in maternal mortality by race represents one of the starkest health inequities in America:

**2021 Maternal Mortality by Race/Ethnicity:**

| Group | Deaths per 100,000 | Ratio to White Rate |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Black (non-Hispanic) | 69.9 | 2.6x |
| American Indian/Alaska Native | 65.2 | 2.4x |
| White (non-Hispanic) | 26.6 | 1.0x |
| Hispanic | 28.0 | 1.1x |
| Asian (non-Hispanic) | 13.2 | 0.5x |

**Critical Finding**: These disparities persist across all socioeconomic and education levels. A study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that college-educated Black women have a 60% higher maternal mortality risk than white women without a high school diploma.

### Severe Maternal Morbidity

For every maternal death, approximately 100 women experience severe maternal morbidity (SMM)—life-threatening complications that require significant medical intervention.

**Severe Maternal Morbidity Trends:**
- Rate has increased 200% since 1993
- Currently affects approximately 50,000-60,000 women annually
- Blood transfusion is the most common SMM indicator
- Hysterectomy, ventilation, and ICU admission are common complications

**Leading Causes of SMM:**
1. Hemorrhage (severe bleeding)
2. Hypertensive disorders (preeclampsia, eclampsia)
3. Sepsis and infection
4. Cardiac conditions
5. Thromboembolism (blood clots)

### Timing of Maternal Deaths

Understanding when maternal deaths occur is essential for prevention:

| Timing | Percentage | Key Causes |
|--------|------------|------------|
| During pregnancy | 22% | Cardiovascular conditions, hemorrhage |
| Day of delivery | 13% | Hemorrhage, amniotic fluid embolism |
| 1-6 days postpartum | 13% | Hemorrhage, infection, cardiomyopathy |
| 7-42 days postpartum | 19% | Cardiomyopathy, infection, mental health |
| 43-365 days postpartum | 33% | Cardiomyopathy, mental health, substance use, violence |

**Critical Insight**: One-third of maternal deaths occur between 6 weeks and 1 year postpartum—after the traditional postpartum visit and, for Medicaid recipients in many states, after insurance coverage ended.

## Causes of Maternal Death

The CDC's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System identifies leading causes:

**Contributing Factors to Pregnancy-Related Deaths:**

| Cause | Percentage |
|-------|------------|
| Cardiovascular conditions | 26.6% |
| Other medical conditions | 14.5% |
| Infection/Sepsis | 12.5% |
| Hemorrhage | 11.0% |
| Cardiomyopathy | 10.7% |
| Thrombotic pulmonary embolism | 9.1% |
| Hypertensive disorders | 6.9% |
| Mental health conditions | 6.5% |
| Amniotic fluid embolism | 5.5% |

### Preventability

State Maternal Mortality Review Committees consistently find that **60-80% of maternal deaths are preventable**. Common contributing factors include:

- **Provider/System Factors** (60-70% of deaths):
  - Failure to diagnose or delayed diagnosis
  - Ineffective treatment
  - Lack of care coordination
  - Poor provider-patient communication

- **Patient Factors** (30-40% of deaths):
  - Delay in seeking care (often due to systemic barriers)
  - Non-adherence to treatment (often due to cost or access)
  - Underlying chronic conditions

- **Facility Factors** (20-30% of deaths):
  - Lack of protocols or failure to follow protocols
  - Inadequate staffing
  - Equipment or supply issues
  - Transfer delays

## Access to Maternity Care

### Maternity Care Deserts

The March of Dimes defines maternity care deserts as counties with:
- No hospital offering obstetric care
- No birth centers
- No OB/GYN or certified nurse-midwife providers

**Current Statistics (2022):**
- **1,119 counties** (36% of all U.S. counties) are maternity care deserts
- **2.2 million women** of childbearing age live in these counties
- **146,000 babies** are born annually to women in these counties
- **Additional 868 counties** have limited access (low provider levels)

**State Variation:**
| Most Affected States | % Counties as Maternity Care Deserts |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Alaska | 70% |
| Nebraska | 73% |
| Texas | 51% |
| Montana | 63% |
| South Dakota | 68% |

### Hospital Closures

Rural hospital obstetric unit closures have accelerated:

- **1,342 rural hospitals** closed obstetric services between 2004-2014
- **More than 200 additional closures** since 2014
- Average distance to obstetric care increased from 8 to 29 miles in affected areas
- Hospital closures associated with 10% increase in preterm births

**Consequences of Closures:**
- Increased out-of-hospital births (unplanned)
- Higher rates of deliveries in cars and ERs
- Increased preterm birth rates
- Higher neonatal mortality in affected communities
- Reduced prenatal care utilization

### Prenatal Care Utilization

Adequate prenatal care is defined as beginning in the first trimester with appropriate visit frequency.

**2020 Prenatal Care Statistics:**

| Measure | Percentage |
|---------|------------|
| Early prenatal care (first trimester) | 77.5% |
| Adequate prenatal care | 74.7% |
| Late or no prenatal care | 6.2% |
| No prenatal care | 1.2% |

**Disparities in Prenatal Care:**

| Group | Late/No Prenatal Care Rate |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Non-Hispanic Black | 9.9% |
| American Indian/Alaska Native | 11.3% |
| Non-Hispanic White | 4.5% |
| Hispanic | 7.6% |
| Asian | 4.0% |

## Insurance Coverage

### Medicaid and Pregnancy

Medicaid is the largest payer for births in the United States:

- **42% of all births** are covered by Medicaid
- **65% of births** covered by Medicaid in some states
- Pregnancy is a qualifying condition for Medicaid regardless of other eligibility

**The 60-Day Coverage Gap Problem:**

Historically, pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage ended 60 days after delivery, creating a dangerous gap:
- Women lost coverage during critical postpartum period
- 33% of maternal deaths occur 43-365 days postpartum
- Chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension) went unmanaged
- Mental health conditions untreated
- Contraception access disrupted

**American Rescue Plan Act (2021)** gave states the option to extend postpartum Medicaid to 12 months. As of 2024:
- 46 states have extended coverage to 12 months
- 4 states still use 60-day cutoff
- CMS made 12-month extension permanent option

### The Uninsured

Despite expansions, coverage gaps persist:
- 12% of women aged 19-64 are uninsured
- Uninsured rates higher in non-Medicaid expansion states
- Immigration status bars many from coverage
- Coverage churning during pregnancy creates gaps

## Workforce Shortage

### OB/GYN Availability

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists identifies significant workforce challenges:

**Current Workforce Statistics:**
- ~46,000 OB/GYNs in practice
- 49% of U.S. counties have no OB/GYN
- Only 59 OB/GYNs per 100,000 women nationally
- Shortage projected to reach 22,000 by 2050

**Workforce Distribution:**
- 90% of OB/GYNs practice in metropolitan areas
- Rural areas have 6 OB/GYNs per 10,000 women vs. 12 in urban areas
- Lowest ratios in South and Midwest

### Midwifery and Advanced Practice

Certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) and certified professional midwives (CPMs) can help address shortages:

**Current Midwifery Workforce:**
- ~15,000 CNMs in practice
- Attend approximately 12% of U.S. births
- 88% of CNMs practice in urban/suburban areas
- Scope of practice varies dramatically by state

**Barriers to Midwifery Expansion:**
- 14 states require physician supervision or collaborative agreements
- Medicaid reimbursement averages 60-80% of physician rates
- Hospital credentialing barriers
- Lack of integration into healthcare systems

### Doulas and Community Health Workers

Community-based perinatal support is growing but faces barriers:

- Only 6% of birthing people currently use doulas
- Doula support associated with improved outcomes
- 12 states offer some Medicaid reimbursement for doulas
- Training and certification standards vary

## Quality of Care Variation

### Cesarean Section Rates

C-section rates vary enormously, indicating overuse and underuse:

**National C-Section Rate:** 32.1% (2021)

**Variation:**
- Hospital rates range from 15% to 70%
- Low-risk first-birth C-section rates: 19-37% by hospital
- Repeat C-section rate: 87% (despite VBAC safety for most)
- States range from 22% (Alaska) to 38% (Mississippi)

The WHO recommends C-section rates of 10-15% for optimal outcomes.

### Hospital Quality Variation

Maternal outcomes vary significantly by facility:

- **Severe maternal morbidity rates** vary 4-fold between hospitals
- Higher volume hospitals generally have better outcomes
- Hospitals in majority-Black zip codes have higher complication rates
- Teaching hospitals show mixed results

### Evidence-Based Practice Implementation

Proven safety bundles remain inconsistently implemented:

- **Hemorrhage bundles**: ~60% of hospitals fully implemented
- **Hypertension bundles**: ~50% of hospitals fully implemented
- **Sepsis protocols**: ~70% of hospitals have protocols
- **VTE prophylaxis**: Variable implementation

## Mental Health

### Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders

Mental health is an underrecognized component of maternal mortality:

**Prevalence:**
- 1 in 5 women experience perinatal mood disorders
- 80% of cases go undiagnosed or untreated
- Depression affects 10-15% of pregnant/postpartum women
- Anxiety affects 15-20%

**Consequences:**
- 23% of postpartum deaths are suicide or overdose
- Mental health conditions are leading cause of pregnancy-associated death
- Associated with preterm birth, low birth weight
- Intergenerational impacts on child development

**Screening Gaps:**
- 40% of mothers are not screened for depression
- Access to perinatal mental health specialists is extremely limited
- Integration with OB care remains poor

## State Variation in Maternal Health

### Best and Worst Performing States

**Maternal Mortality Rate by State (Deaths per 100,000, 2018-2021 average):**

| Best Performing | Rate | Worst Performing | Rate |
|----------------|------|------------------|------|
| California | 10.2 | Louisiana | 44.8 |
| Massachusetts | 13.1 | Georgia | 43.2 |
| Nevada | 14.3 | Arkansas | 40.2 |
| Connecticut | 15.1 | Alabama | 36.4 |
| New York | 16.8 | Tennessee | 35.8 |

**Contributing Factors to State Variation:**
- Medicaid expansion status
- Medicaid reimbursement rates
- Insurance coverage rates
- Provider availability
- Implementation of quality initiatives
- Socioeconomic factors
- Racial composition and segregation
- Rural/urban distribution

### The California Success Story

California achieved a 55% reduction in maternal mortality (2006-2016) through:

1. **California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC)**
2. **Hemorrhage and preeclampsia toolkits**
3. **Quality improvement initiatives at all birthing hospitals**
4. **Data review and feedback systems**
5. **Statewide leadership and accountability**

This demonstrates that maternal mortality is not inevitable—it can be dramatically reduced with systematic intervention.
