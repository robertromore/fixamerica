# Roadmap for Maternal Health Reform

## Implementation Strategy

Transforming America's maternal health outcomes requires a phased, multi-level approach. This roadmap outlines a realistic pathway from the current crisis to a system where maternal deaths are rare, racial disparities are eliminated, and every woman has access to high-quality maternity care.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Urgency**: Women are dying preventable deaths every day—action cannot wait
2. **Equity**: Racial disparities must be central to every intervention
3. **Evidence**: Prioritize interventions with proven effectiveness
4. **Feasibility**: Build political will through winnable battles
5. **Sustainability**: Create lasting structural change, not temporary programs
6. **Accountability**: Measure outcomes and enforce standards
