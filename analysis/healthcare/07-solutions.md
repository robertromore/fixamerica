# Healthcare: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming American healthcare requires addressing coverage gaps, controlling costs, improving quality, and fixing the underlying structural problems that perpetuate dysfunction. Solutions range from incremental improvements within the current system to fundamental restructuring. This analysis presents the full spectrum of approaches, their trade-offs, and evidence of effectiveness.

## Guiding Principles

### What Reform Should Achieve

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Universal coverage** | Everyone has access to healthcare |
| **Affordability** | No one faces financial hardship from healthcare |
| **Quality** | Care is effective, safe, and patient-centered |
| **Equity** | No disparities based on race, income, or geography |
| **Efficiency** | Resources used wisely, administrative waste reduced |
| **Sustainability** | System is financially viable long-term |

### Evaluating Proposals

| Criterion | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| Coverage | How many newly covered? Who remains uninsured? |
| Cost | What does it cost? Who pays? What are savings? |
| Access | Can people actually get care? Provider networks? |
| Quality | Does it improve outcomes? Reduce disparities? |
| Feasibility | Can it pass? Can it be implemented? |
| Durability | Will it survive political opposition? |

## Coverage Expansion Solutions

### Complete the ACA

| Policy | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Close coverage gap** | Federal program for non-expansion states |

| **Continuous eligibility** | 12-month Medicaid enrollment |
| **Immigrant coverage** | Remove restrictions on legal immigrants |

**Pros**: Builds on existing system, politically feasible, proven model.
**Cons**: Maintains fragmentation, doesn't control costs, leaves some uninsured.

### Public Option

| Design Choice | Options |
|---------------|---------|
| **Who can enroll** | Uninsured only vs. anyone |

**Cons**: Industry opposition, adverse selection risk, doesn't eliminate fragmentation.

### Medicare-for-All (Single Payer)

| Feature | Design |
|---------|--------|
| **Coverage** | Universal, comprehensive |
| **Financing** | Tax-funded, eliminate premiums |
| **Administration** | Single federal payer |
| **Provider payment** | Negotiated rates |
| **Transition** | Immediate vs. phased |

**Pros**: Universal coverage, administrative savings, cost control, equity.
**Cons**: Massive transition, political opposition, provider income cuts.

### Medicare Buy-In

| Approach | Design |
|----------|--------|
| **Age-based** | Lower eligibility age (55, 50, etc.) |

| **Employer option** | Employers can buy Medicare for workers |
| **CHIP integration** | Merge children's coverage into Medicare |

**Pros**: Popular program, proven administration, incremental path.
