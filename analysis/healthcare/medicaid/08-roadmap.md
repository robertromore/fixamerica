# Medicaid: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Medicaid reform requires navigating complex federal-state dynamics while building toward more uniform national coverage. The roadmap prioritizes achievable wins that demonstrate benefits and build constituencies for larger reforms.

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Close Coverage Gap

- Pass federal legislation covering gap population
- Use existing infrastructure (Medicaid or ACA)
- 100% federal funding for gap coverage
- Implement within 1 year of enactment

### Continuous Eligibility

- Mandate 12-month continuous eligibility federally
- Increase FMAP to offset state costs
- Reduce churning and administrative burden
- Implement over 2 years

### Stabilize Post-Unwinding

- Extend enhanced outreach funding
- Require ex parte renewals before termination
- Monitor and address improper terminations
- Immediate implementation

## Phase 2: Building Momentum

### Automatic Enrollment

- Pilot automatic enrollment in willing states
- Use tax data to identify eligible individuals
- Default enrollment with opt-out
- Expand based on pilot results

### Administrative Simplification

- Standardize enrollment across states
- Create national eligibility system option
- Reduce documentation requirements
- Implement electronic verification

### Payment Reform

- Increase federal match for rate increases
- Tie enhanced match to access standards
- Require participation for Medicare providers
- Phase in over 3 years

## Phase 3: Structural Reform

### Federal Minimum Standards

- Mandate 138% FPL eligibility in all states
- Establish federal benefit floor
- Create enforcement mechanisms
- Transition over 5 years

### State Innovation

- Enable state Medicaid innovation through waivers
- Maintain federal floors
- Allow state innovation above floors
- Coordinate across state healthcare systems

## Success Metrics

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| Coverage | Medicaid eligible enrolled | 95%+ |
| Gap closure | Uninsured in gap | 0 |
| Stability | Annual churning rate | < 10% |
| Access | Appointment availability | < 2 weeks |
| Equity | Coverage rate by state | < 5% variation |

## Risk Mitigation

### Political Resistance

- Build hospital/provider coalition
- Demonstrate fiscal neutrality or savings
- Use waiver flexibility strategically
- Frame as working family support

### State Capacity

- Provide implementation funding
- Offer technical assistance
- Allow phased transitions
- Maintain current systems during transition

### Legal Challenges

- Design around NFIB constraints
- Use spending power carefully
- Build on existing precedents
- Prepare litigation defense
