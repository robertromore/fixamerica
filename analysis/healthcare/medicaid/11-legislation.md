# Medicaid: Legislation

## Overview

Medicaid reform requires balancing federal standards with state flexibility within the constraints established by *NFIB v. Sebelius*. The legislative strategy focuses on closing the coverage gap, establishing national floors, and simplifying administration while preserving the federal-state partnership.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for Medicaid reform. Congress has broad authority under the Spending Clause to set conditions on federal Medicaid funding, subject to the anti-coercion limits established in *NFIB v. Sebelius*.

## Federal Legislation

### Medicaid Coverage Gap Elimination Act

**Purpose**: Provide federal coverage for individuals in non-expansion states who fall into the coverage gap.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Medicaid Coverage Gap Elimination Act".

SEC. 2. FEDERAL COVERAGE FOR GAP POPULATION.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish a program to provide
    medical assistance to individuals who—
    (1) have household income below 100 percent of the Federal poverty
        level;
    (2) are not eligible for Medicaid in their State of residence;
    (3) are not eligible for Medicare;
    (4) are citizens or lawfully present; and
    (5) reside in a State that has not expanded Medicaid pursuant to
        section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Social Security Act.

(b) BENEFITS.—Benefits shall be equivalent to the Medicaid expansion
    population benefits.

(c) ADMINISTRATION.—The Secretary may administer this program through—
    (1) contracts with managed care organizations;
    (2) the HealthCare.gov platform; or
    (3) direct federal administration.

(d) FUNDING.—There are appropriated such sums as necessary. The Federal
    medical assistance percentage for this population shall be 100 percent.

SEC. 3. TRANSITION TO STATE PROGRAMS.
If a State subsequently expands Medicaid, eligible individuals shall
transition to the State program with 90 percent FMAP.
```

**Explanation**: Creates federal fallback coverage without requiring state participation, avoiding NFIB coercion concerns. Maintains incentive for states to expand by offering transition to regular enhanced FMAP.

**Challenges**: Cost (approximately $10-15 billion annually). Political resistance. Implementation complexity in unwilling states.

### Medicaid Continuous Coverage Act

**Purpose**: Mandate 12-month continuous eligibility for all Medicaid beneficiaries.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Medicaid Continuous Coverage Act".

SEC. 2. CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY.
Section 1902(e) of the Social Security Act is amended by adding—

"(17) CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY.—
    (A) A State plan shall provide that an individual determined eligible
        for medical assistance shall remain eligible for a period of not
        less than 12 months.
    (B) During such period, the State may not terminate eligibility
        except upon—
        (i) death;
        (ii) request of the beneficiary;
        (iii) relocation to another State; or
        (iv) incarceration.
    (C) Eligibility redetermination shall occur no more frequently than
        every 12 months."

SEC. 3. ENHANCED FMAP.
For the costs attributable to continuous eligibility, the Federal medical
assistance percentage shall be increased by 5 percentage points.

SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect for eligibility determinations made 1 year after
enactment.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces churning that causes coverage gaps. Enhanced FMAP offsets state costs. Builds on success of COVID continuous enrollment.

**Challenges**: State system changes required. Some additional cost. Balancing with redetermination integrity.

### Medicaid Automatic Enrollment Act

**Purpose**: Automatically enroll eligible individuals using tax and program data.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Medicaid Automatic Enrollment Act".

SEC. 2. AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT.
(a) REQUIREMENT.—The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of
    the Treasury, shall establish a system for automatic enrollment of
    individuals likely eligible for Medicaid or CHIP.

(b) IDENTIFICATION.—The Secretary shall identify likely eligible
    individuals through—
    (1) tax return data indicating income below eligibility thresholds;
    (2) participation in other means-tested programs;
    (3) other available data sources.

(c) NOTIFICATION AND ENROLLMENT.—
    (1) Identified individuals shall receive notification of likely
        eligibility.
    (2) Individuals shall be enrolled unless they affirmatively opt out
        within 60 days.
    (3) Enrolled individuals may disenroll at any time.

(d) VERIFICATION.—The Secretary shall verify eligibility using available
    electronic data sources, minimizing documentation requirements.

SEC. 3. STATE IMPLEMENTATION.
States shall accept federal automatic enrollment determinations or
implement equivalent state systems.

SEC. 4. PRIVACY.—Data sharing shall comply with applicable privacy laws.
Data shall be used only for enrollment purposes.
```

**Explanation**: Shifts from opt-in to opt-out enrollment. Uses existing data to identify eligible individuals. Reduces administrative barriers.

**Challenges**: Data sharing across agencies. State system integration. Privacy concerns. Verification accuracy.

## State Model Legislation

### State Medicaid Expansion Act

**Purpose**: For non-expansion states, implement ACA Medicaid expansion.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Medicaid Expansion Act".

SECTION 2. EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY.
(a) The [State Medicaid Agency] shall expand eligibility for medical
    assistance to include individuals—
    (1) with household income at or below 138 percent of the Federal
        poverty level;
    (2) who are not otherwise eligible for medical assistance; and
    (3) who are not eligible for Medicare.

(b) The expanded eligibility shall qualify for the enhanced Federal
    medical assistance percentage under section 1905(y) of the Social
    Security Act.

SECTION 3. BENEFITS.
Individuals eligible under this section shall receive the alternative
benefit plan established pursuant to section 1937 of the Social Security
Act.

SECTION 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect upon approval of the State plan amendment by the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
```

**Variation notes**: Some states have added work requirements (mostly struck down) or premiums. Clean expansion preferred.

## Regulatory Framework

### CMS Regulations

**Authority**: Social Security Act, ACA

**Key regulatory requirements**:

1. **Ex Parte Renewals**
   - Require states to use electronic data before requesting information
   - Minimize documentation burden
   - Auto-renew when possible

2. **Enrollment Processing**
   - 45-day maximum for application processing
   - Presumptive eligibility requirements
   - Online application availability

3. **Managed Care Standards**
   - Network adequacy requirements
   - Quality metrics
   - Rate-setting transparency

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **NFIB Limits**: Cannot coerce states to expand
- **Spending Clause**: Can condition funding on federal requirements
- **Equal Protection**: Benefits must be rationally distributed

### Preemption

- Federal law establishes minimum standards
- States may exceed federal floors
- ERISA does not apply to Medicaid

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| State resistance to gap program | States could refuse cooperation | Medium |
| Documentation gaming | States could impose excessive requirements | High |
| Managed care access issues | MCOs could limit networks | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No path to universal state expansion | 10 states still won't expand | NFIB precedent |
| Provider participation voluntary | Access issues persist | Payment rates |
| State administrative variation | Uneven implementation | Federalism |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **State resistance**: Direct federal administration option
2. **Documentation gaming**: Federal oversight and enforcement
3. **Managed care access**: Strengthen network adequacy requirements
4. **Provider participation**: Enhanced FMAP for rate increases

### General Implementation Concerns

- **State capacity**: Technical assistance needed
- **Data systems**: Integration across agencies
- **Transition**: Current beneficiaries should not lose coverage
- **Funding**: Appropriations must match authorization
