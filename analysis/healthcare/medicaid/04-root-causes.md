# Medicaid: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

Why does Medicaid remain fragmented, with coverage depending on state of residence?

### Structural Causes

**Federal-State Structure**

- States set eligibility within federal minimums
- States choose whether to expand
- States design delivery systems
- States bear 10-50% of costs
- Creates inherent variation

**Optional vs. Mandatory Populations**

- Some populations must be covered (children, pregnant women)
- Others are optional (adults without children in non-expansion states)
- States cover optional groups based on fiscal capacity and politics

**Fiscal Federalism Tensions**

- States with lowest capacity have lowest federal match
- States bearing more cost resist expansion
- Economic downturns hit states when need is highest
- Federal match doesn't fully align with need

### Institutional Causes

**State Budget Pressures**

- Medicaid is largest/second-largest state budget item
- Competes with education, infrastructure, public safety
- During recessions, enrollment rises as revenue falls
- Countercyclical nature strains state budgets

**Provider Participation Limits**

- Medicaid pays less than Medicare and commercial
- Some providers limit Medicaid patients
- Access varies by region and specialty
- Low payment = access problems

**Administrative Complexity**

- Enrollment barriers (documentation, renewal)
- Churning as eligibility changes
- Coordination with other programs (CHIP, Medicare, SSI)
- Each state has unique systems

### Political Economy

**Who benefits from fragmentation?**

- States seeking to limit spending
- Taxpayers in low-coverage states (lower taxes)
- Providers in low-coverage states (no expansion = less Medicaid competition)
- Political actors opposing "welfare"

**Why gaps persist**

- Coverage gap population lacks political power
- Ideological opposition to expansion in some states
- Federal structure protects state discretion
- Supreme Court prevented mandated expansion

## Causal Diagram

```
Federal-state structure → State discretion on eligibility
         ↓
NFIB v. Sebelius → Optional expansion → Coverage gap
         ↓
Low payment rates → Provider reluctance → Access limits
         ↓
Administrative complexity → Churning → Coverage instability
         ↓
     RESULT: 2.2 million in coverage gap; variable access nationally
```
