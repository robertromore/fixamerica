# Medicaid: Opposition Analysis

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Anti-expansion governors | Fiscal conservatism, ideology | State power | Refuse expansion |
| Conservative policy groups | Reduce government role | Foundation funding | Block grants, work requirements |
| Some taxpayer groups | Limit spending | Grassroots | "Welfare" framing |
| Some provider groups | Status quo preferred | Lobbying | Oppose payment reform |

### Ideological Opposition

**Fiscal Conservatism**

- Medicaid is unsustainable entitlement
- State budgets cannot afford growth
- Federal deficit concerns
- Future generations will pay

**Anti-Welfare Ideology**

- Medicaid creates dependency
- Able-bodied adults should work
- Program discourages employment
- Personal responsibility emphasis

**Federalism Concerns**

- Federal mandates override state choices
- One-size-fits-all inappropriate
- States know their populations best
- Block grants would allow flexibility

## Opposition Arguments

### Argument 1: "Expansion Is Unaffordable"

**Claim**: States cannot afford the 10% match; federal government cannot sustain 90%.

**Reality**: Expansion states have seen net budget savings from reduced uncompensated care and economic activity. Federal match is sustainable within overall healthcare spending.

### Argument 2: "Medicaid Doesn't Improve Health"

**Claim**: Oregon study showed Medicaid doesn't improve physical health outcomes.

**Reality**: Oregon study showed significant mental health benefits, financial protection, and access improvements. Longer-term studies show mortality reductions in expansion states.

### Argument 3: "Work Requirements Will Improve Self-Sufficiency"

**Claim**: Requiring work will help beneficiaries become independent.

**Reality**: Most Medicaid adults who can work already do. Requirements primarily cause coverage loss through administrative barriers. Those not working often cannot due to health, caregiving, or job market.

### Argument 4: "Block Grants Would Give States Flexibility"

**Claim**: Converting Medicaid to block grants would let states innovate.

**Reality**: Block grants are designed to cap federal spending. States would face impossible choices during recessions. Historical block grants (TANF) resulted in declining coverage.

## Counter-Strategies

**Demonstrate Fiscal Benefits**

- Show hospital/provider savings from expansion
- Document economic multiplier effects
- Highlight avoided costs (emergency care, incarceration)

**Share Stories**

- Beneficiaries with improved health
- Working families with coverage
- Cancer survivors, diabetes management

**Use Conservative Framing**

- "Hospital support" rather than welfare
- "Working families" emphasis
- State flexibility within expansion
