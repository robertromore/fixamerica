# Medicaid: Current State

## Overview

Medicaid is the largest health insurance program in the United States, covering over 85 million Americans—more than Medicare, employer coverage, or any single private insurer. As a joint federal-state program, Medicaid exhibits extreme variation across 56 jurisdictions, creating a patchwork where access, benefits, and quality depend heavily on where one lives.

## Geographic Variation

### Expansion Status (2024)

**40 States + DC Expanded**

| Region | Expansion States |
|--------|------------------|
| Northeast | All states expanded |
| Midwest | IA, IL, IN, MI, MN, NE, ND, OH |
| South | AR, KY, LA, MD, NC, OK, VA, WV, DE |
| West | All states expanded |

**10 States Not Expanded**

| State | Coverage Gap | Non-Expansion Rationale |
|-------|--------------|------------------------|
| Texas | 771,000 | Legislative opposition |
| Florida | 445,000 | Governor/legislative opposition |
| Georgia | 248,000 | Work requirement alternative |
| Tennessee | 139,000 | Legislative opposition |
| Alabama | 97,000 | Legislative opposition |
| South Carolina | 89,000 | Legislative opposition |
| Mississippi | 86,000 | Legislative opposition |
| Kansas | 67,000 | Legislative opposition |
| Wisconsin | 0* | Covers to 100% FPL without expansion |
| Wyoming | 19,000 | Legislative opposition |

*Wisconsin covers adults to 100% FPL through state plan, not ACA expansion, so no coverage gap but misses enhanced federal match.

|------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Parents | 138% FPL (expansion) | 18% FPL (Alabama) |
| Childless adults | 138% FPL (expansion) | 0% (most non-expansion) |

| Below average | TX, FL, GA, AZ | $6,000-8,000 |
| Lowest | NV, UT, ID | $5,500-6,500 |

**Drivers of Variation**

- Provider payment rates
- Managed care vs. fee-for-service mix
- LTSS utilization patterns
- State cost of living
- Population health status
- Administrative efficiency

## Coverage Gap

### Who Is in the Gap

The coverage gap consists of adults in non-expansion states who:

- Earn too much for traditional Medicaid (often $0 income limit)
- Earn too little for ACA marketplace subsidies (below 100% FPL)

| Total | 2.2 million |
| Working | 60% |
| Parents | 40% |
