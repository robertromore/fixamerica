# Medicaid

## Overview

Medicaid is the nation's largest health insurance program, covering over 85 million Americans—including low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly, and people with disabilities. As a joint federal-state program, Medicaid exemplifies both the promise and peril of American federalism: it enables state flexibility and experimentation while creating a patchwork of coverage that varies dramatically based on where one lives.

## Why This Matters

Medicaid is the foundation of the American safety net for health coverage:

**Coverage Impact**:

- 1 in 4 Americans covered by Medicaid
- 40% of all children
- 40% of all births
- 60%+ of nursing home residents

**Economic Impact**:

- $805 billion annual spending
- Largest item in most state budgets
- Major employer in healthcare sector
- Reduces uncompensated care

**Health Impact**:

- Expansion reduced mortality 6%
- Improved access to care
