# Medicaid: History

## Overview

Medicaid has evolved from a modest afterthought to Medicare into the largest health insurance program in the United States. Created in 1965 as a grant program for states to provide medical assistance to welfare recipients, Medicaid now covers over 85 million Americans—more than Medicare, employer coverage, or any other single source. This trajectory reflects both intentional policy expansion and unintended consequences of American federalism.

## Creation Era (1965-1972)

### The Medicare Afterthought

**Origins of Medicaid**

| Factor | Role |
|--------|------|
| Medicare focus | National debate centered on elderly coverage |
| Welfare-linked design | Built on existing Kerr-Mills program |
| State flexibility | Allowed to secure state support |
| Optional participation | States not required to participate |
| Minimal expectations | Expected to remain small program |

**1965 Social Security Amendments**

| Program | Design Choice | Long-term Implication |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Medicare Part A | Hospital insurance for elderly | Federal program, uniform benefits |
| Medicare Part B | Physician coverage, voluntary | Standardized nationally |
| Medicaid | State-administered, variable | Created 50+ different programs |

### Original Eligibility Categories

Medicaid initially covered only those receiving cash assistance:

| Category | Basis | Federal Requirement |
|----------|-------|---------------------|
| AFDC families | Welfare recipients | Mandatory |
| SSI recipients | Elderly, disabled | Mandatory |
| Foster children | State wards | Mandatory |
| Medically needy | Income too high for welfare but unable to afford care | Optional |

### Early State Adoption

| Period | States Participating | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| 1966 | 26 states | Largest states joined first |
| 1968 | 37 states | Growing but uneven |
| 1970 | 48 states | Near-universal except Arizona |
| 1982 | 50 states | Arizona finally joined |

**Why Arizona Held Out**

Arizona resisted Medicaid until 1982, preferring county-based care. When it finally joined, it created AHCCCS—the first statewide Medicaid managed care program, which became a national model.

## Expansion and Mandates Era (1980-1997)

### Decoupling from Welfare

The 1980s and 1990s saw systematic expansion of eligibility beyond welfare recipients:

**Children and Pregnant Women Mandates**

| Year | Legislation | Expansion |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1984 | DEFRA | States must cover pregnant women and infants in two-parent families |
| 1986 | COBRA | States may cover pregnant women and children to 100% FPL |
| 1988 | MCCA | Pregnant women and infants to 100% FPL mandatory |
| 1989 | OBRA | Pregnant women and children under 6 to 133% FPL mandatory |
| 1990 | OBRA | Children 6-18 to 100% FPL mandatory (phased in) |

**Why Congress Expanded for Children**

- Bipartisan support for child health
- Incremental approach avoided comprehensive reform debate
- Evidence of poor child health outcomes
- Lower cost than adult coverage

### Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1967 | EPSDT created requiring comprehensive child health services |
| 1989 | OBRA strengthened enforcement and expanded services |
| Today | Most comprehensive pediatric benefit in U.S. healthcare |

### Welfare Reform Impact (1996)

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act fundamentally changed Medicaid:

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Delinking from cash assistance | Medicaid eligibility no longer tied to AFDC/TANF |
| Direct coverage | People could qualify for Medicaid without welfare |
| Immigration restrictions | Legal immigrants barred for 5 years |
| Work requirements for TANF | Did not apply to Medicaid (at the time) |

**Significance**: Delinking from welfare meant Medicaid could expand independently of cash assistance, setting the stage for eventual adult expansion.

### CHIP Creation (1997)

The Children's Health Insurance Program extended coverage beyond Medicaid:

| Feature | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Target population | Children in families above Medicaid but lacking employer coverage |
| Income limits | Typically 200-300% FPL |
| State flexibility | Could expand Medicaid or create separate program |
| Federal funding | Enhanced match rate (higher than Medicaid FMAP) |
| Enrollment | 10+ million children at peak |

---

## Managed Care Era (1990s-2000s)

### Shift to Managed Care

| Year | Managed Care Enrollment |
|------|------------------------|
| 1991 | 2.7 million (10%) |
| 1996 | 13.3 million (40%) |
| 2000 | 18.8 million (56%) |
| 2010 | 34.6 million (71%) |
| 2023 | 60+ million (72%) |

**Drivers of Managed Care Adoption**

- State desire to control costs
- Federal waivers enabling mandatory enrollment
- Industry lobbying
- Promise of coordinated care
- Risk transfer to private plans

### 1915(b) and 1115 Waivers

States used waivers to reshape Medicaid delivery:

| Waiver Type | Purpose | Examples |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| 1915(b) | Freedom of choice | Mandatory managed care |
| 1915(c) | Home and community-based services | LTSS alternatives |
| 1115 | Demonstration projects | Expansion experiments |

**TennCare (1994)**: Tennessee used 1115 waiver to move entire Medicaid population to managed care and expand coverage—an early experiment with broader implications.

## Long-Term Care Evolution

### Institutional Bias Origins

Medicaid was designed with institutional long-term care in mind:

| Era | Dominant Model | Funding Approach |
|-----|----------------|------------------|
| 1965-1980 | Nursing homes | Mandatory coverage |
| 1981-2000 | Gradual shift | HCBS waivers optional |
| 2000-present | Community preference | Money Follows the Person, HCBS expansion |

### Olmstead Decision (1999)

*Olmstead v. L.C.* transformed Medicaid long-term care:

| Holding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Unnecessary institutionalization violates ADA | States must offer community alternatives |
| Integration mandate | Preference for home/community settings |
| Reasonable pace | States can phase in over time |
| Impact | Accelerated HCBS expansion |

### Money Follows the Person (2005)

| Feature | Design |
|---------|--------|
| Purpose | Help nursing home residents transition to community |
| Federal funding | Enhanced match for transition services |
| Results | 100,000+ transitioned |
| Demonstration states | 43 states participated |

---

## ACA Era (2010-2012)

### The Medicaid Expansion

The Affordable Care Act included the most significant Medicaid expansion since creation:

| Feature | Original ACA Design |
|---------|---------------------|
| Eligibility | All adults under 138% FPL |
| Federal funding | 100% for expansion population through 2016 |
| Phase-down | 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, 90% thereafter |
| State requirement | Mandatory—states would lose all Medicaid funding for non-compliance |

**Expansion Population Estimate**

- 17 million previously uninsured adults
- Primarily childless adults (previously excluded in most states)
- Working poor without employer coverage
- Highest uninsured rates: young, minority, rural

### NFIB v. Sebelius (2012)

The Supreme Court fundamentally altered the ACA's Medicaid design:

| Issue | Ruling |
|-------|--------|
| Individual mandate | Constitutional under taxing power |
| Medicaid expansion | Unconstitutionally coercive |
| Remedy | States can choose whether to expand |
| Vote | 7-2 on Medicaid (Roberts + liberals on severance) |

**Chief Justice Roberts' Reasoning**

- Expansion was "a shift in kind, not merely degree"
- Threatened all Medicaid funding for non-compliance
- Created "gun to the head" of states
- States could not have anticipated expansion when they joined Medicaid

**Consequences**

| Outcome | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Optional expansion | States could reject federal dollars |
| Coverage gap created | 2-4 million people in non-expansion states with no coverage option |
| Political divide | Expansion became partisan issue |
| Patchwork system | Return to extreme interstate variation |

---

## Post-ACA Era (2012-Present)

### Expansion Adoption Over Time

| Period | States Expanding | Total Expanded |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| 2014 | 24 + DC | 25 |
| 2015-2016 | 7 more | 32 |
| 2017-2019 | 4 more (incl. ballot initiatives) | 36 |
| 2020-2023 | 4 more | 40 |
| Remaining | 10 states not expanded | — |

**Paths to Expansion**

| Method | States |
|--------|--------|
| Legislative action | Most expansion states |
| Ballot initiative | ME, NE, UT, ID, OK, MO, SD |
| Governor executive action | Some initially, usually later codified |

### Work Requirements Experiment

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2018 | Trump administration approves Arkansas work requirement |
| 2018-2019 | 18,000+ lose coverage in Arkansas |
| 2019 | Courts strike down Arkansas, Kentucky waivers |
| 2020 | Supreme Court grants cert |
| 2021 | Biden administration withdraws waivers |
| 2023 | Georgia work requirement takes effect |

**Research Findings (Arkansas)**

- Work requirements did not increase employment
- 18,000+ people lost coverage
- Many working but unaware of or unable to meet reporting requirements
- Administrative burden caused most coverage losses

### COVID-19 and Continuous Enrollment (2020-2023)

| Date | Policy |
|------|--------|
| March 2020 | Families First Act passes |
| March 2020 | Continuous enrollment begins (6.2% FMAP increase tied to no disenrollment) |
| 2020-2023 | Enrollment grows from 70M to 94M |
| March 2023 | Continuous enrollment ends |
| 2023-2024 | Unwinding: 15M+ disenrolled |

**Unwinding Impact**

| Outcome | Numbers |
|---------|---------|
| Total disenrolled | 15+ million |
| Procedural terminations | 70%+ (paperwork, not ineligibility) |
| Children affected | 5+ million |
| Re-enrollment efforts | Ongoing |

## Key Turning Points

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1965 | Medicaid creation | Established federal-state health coverage structure |
| 1972 | SSI linkage | Connected Medicaid to disability programs |
| 1981 | HCBS waivers | Enabled community-based long-term care |
| 1989 | EPSDT expansion | Created comprehensive child health benefit |
| 1996 | Welfare reform | Delinked from cash assistance |
| 1997 | CHIP creation | Extended coverage to near-poor children |
| 1999 | Olmstead decision | Required community integration |
| 2010 | ACA passage | Mandated expansion to all adults under 138% FPL |
| 2012 | NFIB ruling | Made expansion optional |
| 2020 | Continuous enrollment | Expanded to 94M enrollees |
| 2023 | Unwinding begins | Largest coverage disruption in program history |

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

1. **Incremental mandates**: Congressional requirements for children achieved near-universal child coverage
2. **Enhanced matching**: Higher federal funding induces state action (CHIP, expansion)
3. **Waivers as laboratories**: State experiments spread successful innovations
4. **Court mandates**: Olmstead transformed long-term care
5. **Ballot initiatives**: Voters support expansion when legislators won't act

### What Has Failed

1. **Optional expansion**: When states can opt out, millions are left behind
2. **Administrative complexity**: Churning and procedural barriers cause unnecessary coverage loss
3. **Underfunding**: Low payment rates limit provider participation
4. **Work requirements**: Reduce coverage without increasing employment
5. **Block grant proposals**: Would shift costs and reduce coverage

### Recurring Patterns

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| States resist, then adopt | Arizona (1982), ACA expansion |
| Federal mandates drive equity | Children's coverage, EPSDT |
| Courts shape policy | NFIB, Olmstead, Stewart v. Azar |
| Incrementalism succeeds | Decades of child expansions |
| Bureaucracy causes harm | Unwinding procedural terminations |
