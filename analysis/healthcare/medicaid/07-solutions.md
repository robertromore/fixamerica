# Medicaid: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles

- **Universality**: All low-income Americans should have access
- **Adequacy**: Benefits should be comprehensive and meaningful
- **Stability**: Coverage should not depend on state politics
- **Efficiency**: Administrative simplification reduces waste
- **Equity**: Eliminate geographic disparities in access

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Close the Coverage Gap

**Description**: Federal fallback coverage for individuals in non-expansion states, using ACA or Medicaid infrastructure.

**Evidence**: Expansion states show better health outcomes, hospital finances, and no state budget crisis. Coverage gap population would benefit similarly.

**Challenges**: Political resistance in Congress. Implementation in unwilling states. Coordination with existing programs.

### Solution 2: Federal Medicaid Minimum

**Description**: Establish federal floor for eligibility (138% FPL for all) with federal funding for non-compliant states.

**Evidence**: Federal minimums for children achieved near-universal child coverage. Same approach can work for adults.

**Challenges**: NFIB precedent limits coercion. Requires willing Congress. State opposition.

### Solution 3: Automatic Enrollment

**Description**: Automatically enroll eligible individuals using tax data, with opt-out rather than opt-in.

**Evidence**: Countries with auto-enrollment achieve higher coverage. Reduces administrative burden and churning.

**Challenges**: Data sharing requirements. State system changes. Privacy concerns.

### Solution 4: 12-Month Continuous Eligibility

**Description**: Once enrolled, beneficiaries remain covered for 12 months regardless of income changes.

**Evidence**: Continuous eligibility for children reduced churning and improved outcomes. COVID continuous enrollment demonstrated benefits for adults.

**Challenges**: Some additional federal cost. State systems need adjustment.

### Solution 5: Payment Reform

**Description**: Increase Medicaid payment rates toward Medicare levels; require provider participation.

**Evidence**: Access improves when payment increases. States with higher payment have better provider networks.

**Challenges**: Cost increase (estimated 10-20%). Provider mandate would face opposition.

## International Models

| Country | Approach | Relevance |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Canada | Provincial administration, federal standards | Model for state flexibility within federal framework |
| Germany | Sickness funds with federal rules | Multi-payer with floors |
| UK | National system, local administration | Centralized standards |

## Sequencing

1. **Immediate**: Close coverage gap; 12-month continuous eligibility
2. **Near-term**: Automatic enrollment; administrative simplification
3. **Medium-term**: Payment increases; federal minimum standards
4. **Long-term**: Integration with broader coverage reform
