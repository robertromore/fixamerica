# Public Health: Legislation

## Overview

Rebuilding America's public health infrastructure requires federal legislation to establish sustainable funding, modernize systems, develop workforce, and ensure preparedness. This legislative strategy addresses chronic underfunding while protecting public health authority from political interference.

## Constitutional Considerations

Congress has clear authority under the Spending Clause to fund public health programs and under the Commerce Clause to regulate interstate disease transmission. State public health authority derives from reserved police powers. Federal-state coordination operates through conditional funding. Court decisions have consistently upheld public health authority, including vaccine mandates (*Jacobson v. Massachusetts*, 1905).

## Federal Legislation

### Public Health Infrastructure Investment Act

**Purpose**: Establish sustainable, adequate funding for federal, state, and local public health infrastructure.

**Draft Text**:

```text

Congress finds that—
(1) the COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical weaknesses in America's
    public health infrastructure;
(2) public health spending has declined 25 percent in inflation-adjusted
    terms since 2008;
(3) 80,000 public health workers have been lost since 2008;
(4) every dollar invested in public health prevention saves an
    estimated $14 in healthcare costs;
(5) sustained investment is needed to protect against future threats.

SEC. 3. CDC FUNDING.
(a) There are authorized to be appropriated for the Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention—
    (1) $15,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) such sums as necessary adjusted for inflation for subsequent
        fiscal years.

(b) MANDATORY APPROPRIATION.—Of the amounts authorized, $8,000,000,000
    shall be mandatory spending not subject to annual appropriation.

SEC. 4. STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH GRANTS.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish a grant program
    for state and local public health infrastructure.

    (1) demonstrate progress toward foundational public health
        capabilities as defined by the Secretary;
    (2) maintain minimum staffing levels;
    (3) participate in national data systems;
    (4) submit annual performance reports.

(e) PASS-THROUGH TO LOCAL.—States shall pass through at least 50
    percent of funding to local health departments.

SEC. 5. PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH FUND PROTECTION.
(a) The Prevention and Public Health Fund established under section
    4002 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act shall not
    be reduced below $2,000,000,000 annually.

(b) Amounts in the Fund shall be used exclusively for prevention
    activities and public health infrastructure.

SEC. 6. PUBLIC HEALTH TRUST FUND.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established in the Treasury a Public
    Health Trust Fund.

```

**Explanation**: This bill establishes the funding levels needed to rebuild public health infrastructure, with mandatory appropriations to provide stability beyond annual budget fights.

**Challenges**: Cost ($15+ billion annually represents significant increase); budget constraints; making funding mandatory is difficult politically.

**Refinements**: Consider phasing in funding increases; dedicated revenue source; stronger accountability measures.

## Regulatory Framework

### HHS/CDC Regulations

**Authority**: Public Health Service Act, ACA

**Key regulatory areas**:

1. **Disease Reporting**
   - Notifiable disease list
   - Reporting timelines and formats
   - Data sharing requirements

2. **Preparedness**
   - Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) cooperative agreement
   - Hospital preparedness
   - Strategic National Stockpile management

3. **Prevention**
   - Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations
   - Prevention fund allocation
   - Preventive services coverage

4. **Scientific Integrity**
   - Publication policies
   - Advisory committee procedures
   - Communication standards

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Basis

- **Spending Clause**: Primary authority for federal public health programs
- **Commerce Clause**: Interstate disease regulation
- **State Police Power**: Traditional public health authority reserved to states
- **Due Process**: Limits on quarantine, mandatory vaccination

### Key Precedents

- *Jacobson v. Massachusetts* (1905): States may mandate vaccination
- *Zucht v. King* (1922): School vaccination requirements constitutional
- *Compagnie Francaise v. Louisiana Board of Health* (1902): Quarantine authority

### Preemption Issues

- Federal public health law generally sets floor, not ceiling
- States may exceed federal requirements
- ERISA may limit state health insurance mandates
- Interstate commerce limits some state authority

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Funding diversion | Infrastructure funds used for other purposes | High |
| Capability certification gaming | States claim compliance without capacity | Medium |
| Data system fragmentation | New systems still incompatible | Medium |
| Stockpile mismanagement | Inadequate rotation and maintenance | High |
| Scientific integrity exceptions | Political interference through informal channels | Medium |
| State preemption of local authority | States undermine local public health despite funding conditions | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Workforce pipeline timeline | Years before new workers trained | Inherent training duration |
| Political vulnerability | Funding subject to future cuts | Annual appropriations process |
| State variation | Uneven capacity despite funding | Federalism |
| Private sector competition | Can't match salaries | Budget constraints |
| Trust erosion | Public skepticism persists | Years of politicization |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Funding diversion**: Require detailed use-of-funds reporting; independent audits; clawback provisions; tie continued funding to documented spending

2. **Capability certification gaming**: Third-party assessment of capabilities; CDC verification visits; outcome measures not just process

3. **Data system fragmentation**: Mandatory use of specified standards; interoperability testing; penalties for non-compliance

4. **Stockpile mismanagement**: Regular inventory audits; rotation schedules with expiration tracking; automated reordering systems; congressional reporting

5. **Scientific integrity exceptions**: Clear chain of approval documentation; record-keeping of all communications; whistleblower protections with anonymous channels

6. **State preemption of local authority**: Tie funding to demonstrated local authority preservation; require state justification for any preemption; local health department standing to challenge

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Political sustainability**: Reforms must survive administration changes
- **State cooperation**: Federal programs depend on state partnership
- **Workforce recruitment**: Competition with private sector
- **Technology complexity**: Data modernization is multi-year effort
- **International coordination**: Pandemic response is global
