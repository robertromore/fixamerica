# Public Health: Current State

## Federal Public Health Infrastructure

### Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

**Budget (FY 2024)**: $9.2 billion

| Program Area | Funding |
|--------------|---------|
| Immunization | $1.3 billion |
| HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STI, TB | $1.5 billion |
| Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases | $0.7 billion |
| Chronic Disease Prevention | $1.2 billion |
| Environmental Health | $0.2 billion |
| Injury Prevention | $0.3 billion |
| Public Health Preparedness | $0.9 billion |
| Global Health | $0.6 billion |
| Other | $2.5 billion |

**Core Functions**:

- Disease surveillance and outbreak investigation
- Laboratory reference and support
- Epidemic intelligence and response
- Research and scientific guidance
- Technical assistance to states and localities
- Data collection and analysis

**Challenges**:

- Budget constraints limit capacity
- Politicization undermines credibility
- Aging data systems
- Workforce limitations
- Coordination gaps with states

### Other Federal Agencies

- **NIH**: Research ($48 billion budget)
- **FDA**: Drug/device/food safety ($6.7 billion)
- **HRSA**: Health resources and safety net ($15 billion)
- **SAMHSA**: Mental health and substance abuse ($7.5 billion)
- **CMS**: Medicare/Medicaid preventive services
- **ASPR**: Preparedness and response ($2.7 billion)

## State and Local Health Departments

### Structure

- **State health departments**: 50 states, DC, territories
- **Local health departments**: ~2,800 agencies
- **Governance models**: Varied (centralized, decentralized, mixed)
- **Funding sources**: Federal grants (23%), state (40%), local (23%), fees (14%)

### Funding Crisis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Per capita state/local public health spending | $90/person |
| Spending decline since 2008 (inflation-adjusted) | -25% |
| Health departments that cut programs post-2008 | 75% |
| Departments with budget cuts during pandemic | 25% |

### Capacity Gaps

- **Foundational capabilities**: Many departments cannot perform all 10 essential public health services
- **Data systems**: Often outdated, incompatible
- **Laboratory capacity**: Limited surge capacity
- **Epidemiologists**: Shortage of trained personnel
- **Informatics**: Lack of modern data infrastructure

## Public Health Workforce

### Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Public health workers | ~300,000 |
| Workers lost since 2008 | 80,000 |
| Eligible to retire within 5 years | 25% |
| Vacancy rate (local departments) | 20%+ |
| Median salary (epidemiologist) | $75,000 (below hospital equivalents) |

### Workforce Challenges

- **Compensation**: Below private sector equivalents
- **Training pipeline**: Limited public health schools in many regions
- **Burnout**: COVID-19 drove mass exodus
- **Threats**: Public health workers faced harassment, threats during pandemic
- **Career appeal**: Competition from private sector, clinical roles

### Critical Shortages

- Epidemiologists
- Biostatisticians
- Health informaticists
- Laboratory scientists
- Environmental health specialists
- Public health nurses

## Pandemic Preparedness

### Post-COVID Assessment

**Successes**:

- Vaccine development (Operation Warp Speed)
- Hospital surge capacity (in most areas)
- Some emergency authorities

**Failures**:

- Initial testing capacity
- Contact tracing at scale
- Supply chain (PPE, tests)
- Data systems for surveillance
- Public communication
- Coordination (federal-state-local)
- Health equity (disparate outcomes)

### Strategic National Stockpile

- PPE shortages revealed inadequate stockpile
- Stockpile rebuilding underway but incomplete
- Distribution systems need improvement
- Maintenance and rotation challenges

### Biosecurity

- Laboratory biosafety concerns
- Bioterrorism preparedness
- International health security
- Pandemic early warning systems

## Prevention Programs

### Immunization

- Childhood vaccination rates: 92-94% for most vaccines (but declining in some areas)
- Adult vaccination rates: Suboptimal (flu: 50%; COVID boosters: 20%)
- Vaccine hesitancy: Growing challenge
- Infrastructure: Largely dependent on private healthcare system

### Chronic Disease Prevention

| Program | Reach | Funding |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Tobacco prevention | 50 states | $232 million |
| Diabetes prevention | Limited | $175 million |
| Heart disease/stroke | 50 states | $142 million |
| Cancer prevention | Variable | Included in NCI |

### Maternal and Child Health

- WIC: 6.3 million participants
- Title V: $700 million for state MCH programs
- Home visiting: Limited reach
- Maternal mortality: Rising (highest among developed nations)

## Data and Surveillance

### Current Systems

- **NNDSS**: National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System
- **BioSense**: Syndromic surveillance
- **NHANES**: Health and nutrition survey
- **BRFSS**: Behavioral risk factor surveillance
- **Vital statistics**: Birth, death records

### Gaps

- Real-time data often unavailable
- Interoperability between jurisdictions limited
- Electronic lab reporting incomplete
- Demographic data gaps (race, ethnicity)
- Social determinants data limited

## Environmental Health

- Air quality monitoring
- Water quality oversight
- Food safety inspection
- Lead poisoning prevention
- Climate and health programs
- Vector control (mosquitoes, ticks)
