# Public Health

Public health encompasses the organized efforts of society to prevent disease, promote health, and prolong life through population-level interventions. Unlike clinical medicine, which treats individuals, public health focuses on communities and populations—surveillance, prevention, health promotion, and emergency response. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical weaknesses in America's public health infrastructure: underfunding, fragmentation, workforce shortages, and politicization. The United States spends more on healthcare than any nation but invests far less in public health prevention, resulting in worse population health outcomes and vulnerability to emerging threats.
