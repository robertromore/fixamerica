## Key Turning Points

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1918 | Influenza pandemic | Demonstrated need for coordinated response |
| 1946 | CDC established | Federal disease control capacity |
| 1955 | Polio vaccine | Public health triumph; vaccine confidence |
| 1964 | Smoking report | Public health addresses chronic disease |
| 1980 | Smallpox eradication | Global public health achievement |
| 1988 | IOM report | Identified public health system gaps |
| 2001 | Anthrax/9-11 | Bioterrorism preparedness investment |
| 2010 | ACA Prevention Fund | Dedicated public health funding (later raided) |
| 2020 | COVID-19 | Exposed systemic weaknesses |

## Lessons from History

1. **Crises drive investment**: Public health funding spikes after emergencies, then declines
2. **Prevention works but is undervalued**: Sanitation, vaccines, smoking reduction saved millions
3. **Politics affects public health**: From HIV response delays to pandemic politicization
4. **Infrastructure requires maintenance**: Capacity built after 2001 eroded by 2020
5. **Coordination is essential**: Federal-state-local fragmentation creates gaps
6. **Trust matters**: Public health depends on public cooperation
7. **Inequity persists**: Vulnerable populations bear disproportionate burden throughout history

## The 1918 Comparison

The COVID-19 pandemic echoed 1918 in troubling ways:

| Factor | 1918 | 2020 |
|--------|------|------|
| Political interference | Yes (wartime censorship) | Yes (CDC messaging) |
| Local variation | Dramatic | Dramatic |
| Mask debates | Yes | Yes |
| Second wave | Devastating | Significant |
| Health inequity | Severe | Severe |
| Public health capacity | Limited | Eroded |
