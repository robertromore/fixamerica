# Healthcare Costs: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles

- **Value over volume**: Pay for outcomes, not services
- **Transparency**: Prices should be knowable and comparable
- **Competition or regulation**: Markets require competition; monopolies require regulation
- **Administrative simplification**: Reduce intermediation and complexity
- **International benchmarking**: Learn from countries achieving more with less

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: All-Payer Rate Setting

**Description**: Establish uniform payment rates across all payers for hospital and physician services, similar to Maryland's system.

**Evidence**: Maryland's all-payer system has:
- Controlled hospital cost growth below national average
- Maintained hospital financial viability
- Reduced uncompensated care
- Enabled global budgets and quality focus

**Challenges**:
- Political opposition from providers
- Complexity of implementation
- Federal waivers required for Medicare

### Solution 2: Drug Price Negotiation and Reference Pricing

**Description**: Expand Medicare negotiation authority; tie U.S. prices to international reference prices.

**Evidence**:
- IRA negotiation projected to save $100+ billion over decade
- International reference pricing could save $50+ billion annually
- Other countries achieve access at 50-70% lower prices

**Challenges**:
- Pharmaceutical industry opposition
- "Innovation" concerns
- Implementation complexity

### Solution 3: Administrative Simplification

**Description**: Standardize billing, prior authorization, and quality reporting across payers.

**Evidence**:
- Administrative costs consume 15-30% of spending
- Single-payer nations spend 2-5% on administration
- Standardization could save $200-500 billion annually

**Challenges**:
- Payer/provider coordination
- System changes require investment
- Job displacement in billing industry

### Solution 4: Global Budgets for Hospitals

**Description**: Pay hospitals a fixed annual budget rather than per-service, incentivizing efficiency.

**Evidence**:
- Maryland model shows viability
- Global budgets in other countries control costs
- Removes volume incentive

**Challenges**:
- Transition complexity
- Quality monitoring needs
- Capital investment funding

### Solution 5: Anti-Consolidation Enforcement

**Description**: Strengthen antitrust enforcement against hospital/physician/insurer mergers; consider breakups.

**Evidence**:
- Hospital consolidation raised prices 20-40%
- Little quality improvement from mergers
- Market power is primary price driver

**Challenges**:
- Courts have been permissive
- "Efficiency" defenses
- Political influence of health systems

## International Models

| Country | Cost Control Mechanism | Result |
|---------|----------------------|--------|
| Germany | All-payer rate setting | 11.7% GDP, universal coverage |
| France | Reference pricing, negotiation | 11.1% GDP, excellent outcomes |
| UK | Global budgets (NHS) | 10.2% GDP, some access issues |
| Japan | Fee schedule, utilization controls | 11.1% GDP, high utilization, good outcomes |
| Canada | Provincial global budgets | 10.8% GDP, some wait times |

## Sequencing

1. **Immediate**: Expand drug price negotiation; enforce price transparency
2. **Near-term**: Standardize administrative processes; strengthen antitrust
3. **Medium-term**: Pilot all-payer rate setting in willing states
4. **Long-term**: National all-payer system or single-payer
