# Healthcare Costs: Legislation

## Overview

Controlling healthcare costs requires legislation addressing multiple drivers: pharmaceutical pricing, hospital market power, administrative complexity, and payment incentives. This legislative strategy combines federal action on drug prices with state flexibility on broader cost controls.

## Constitutional Amendments

No constitutional amendments are required for healthcare cost control. Congress has clear authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate healthcare markets, as established in *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012). States have broad police powers over healthcare within their borders.

## Federal Legislation

### Comprehensive Drug Pricing Reform Act

**Purpose**: Expand Medicare drug price negotiation, implement international reference pricing, and extend savings to all payers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Comprehensive Drug Pricing Reform Act".

SEC. 2. EXPANDED MEDICARE NEGOTIATION.
(a) Section 1191 of the Social Security Act is amended to—
    (1) remove numerical limits on drugs subject to negotiation;
    (2) extend negotiation authority to all Part B and Part D drugs with
        annual spending exceeding $100,000,000;
    (3) require negotiation to begin within 2 years of market entry.

SEC. 3. INTERNATIONAL REFERENCE PRICING.
(a) The maximum negotiated price shall not exceed 120 percent of the
    volume-weighted average price in reference countries.
(b) Reference countries are: Canada, France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom,
    and Australia.

SEC. 4. COMMERCIAL MARKET EXTENSION.
(a) Negotiated prices shall be available to all payers.
(b) No manufacturer may charge a commercial payer more than the Medicare
    negotiated price plus 10 percent.

SEC. 5. INFLATION REBATES.
Manufacturers must pay rebates when prices increase faster than inflation,
applicable to both Medicare and commercial markets.

SEC. 6. BIOSIMILAR COMPETITION.
(a) Patent dance procedures are streamlined.
(b) Pay-for-delay agreements are prohibited.
(c) Exclusivity periods may not exceed statutory minimums.

SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT.
Failure to comply subjects manufacturers to excise tax equal to 95 percent
of revenues on non-compliant products.
```

**Explanation**: Builds on IRA to create comprehensive drug price controls. International reference pricing provides objective benchmark. Commercial extension prevents cost-shifting.

**Challenges**: Pharmaceutical industry opposition. "Innovation" concerns require response. Implementation of reference pricing is complex.

### Healthcare Price Transparency and Competition Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen price transparency requirements and antitrust enforcement in healthcare markets.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Healthcare Price Transparency and Competition Act".

SEC. 2. ENHANCED TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS.
(a) All hospitals and physician practices shall publish—
    (1) negotiated rates with each payer;
    (2) cash-pay prices;
    (3) out-of-pocket estimator tools.
(b) Prices must be published in machine-readable and consumer-friendly formats.
(c) Failure to comply results in penalty of $1,000,000 per month.

SEC. 3. PROSPECTIVE PRICE DISCLOSURE.
(a) Providers must provide binding cost estimates before scheduled services.
(b) Patients are not liable for charges exceeding estimates by more than
    20 percent unless they provided informed consent.

SEC. 4. ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT.
(a) There are authorized to be appropriated $500,000,000 annually to the
    Federal Trade Commission for healthcare competition enforcement.
(b) Mergers resulting in market share exceeding 30 percent are presumptively
    anticompetitive.
(c) Private equity acquisitions of healthcare entities are subject to
    enhanced scrutiny and disclosure.

SEC. 5. ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONTRACT TERMS.
The following contract provisions are prohibited—
(1) all-or-nothing contracting;
(2) anti-steering clauses;
(3) gag clauses on price information;
(4) most-favored-nation clauses that raise prices.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect 1 year after enactment.
```

**Explanation**: Creates meaningful transparency with real penalties. Strengthens antitrust capacity. Bans contract terms that facilitate price increases.

**Challenges**: Provider opposition. Enforcement capacity. State preemption issues for commercial market.

### Administrative Simplification Act

**Purpose**: Standardize administrative processes across payers to reduce waste.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Healthcare Administrative Simplification Act".

SEC. 2. UNIFORM PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.
(a) The Secretary shall establish uniform prior authorization requirements
    applicable to all payers.
(b) Authorization decisions must be made within—
    (1) 24 hours for urgent services;

    and payers.
(b) Credentialing decisions are valid for 3 years minimum.

SEC. 6. IMPLEMENTATION.
Full implementation within 3 years of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: Reduces administrative waste by standardizing processes. Modest politically compared to other reforms.

**Challenges**: Implementation complexity. IT system changes. Payer/provider coordination.

## State Model Legislation

### State All-Payer Rate Setting Act

**Purpose**: Establish uniform payment rates for hospital services across all payers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] All-Payer Rate Setting Act".

SECTION 2. HEALTH SERVICES COST REVIEW COMMISSION.
(a) There is established a Health Services Cost Review Commission.
(b) The Commission shall set rates for hospital services applicable to

```

**Variation notes**: Maryland has operated all-payer system since 1970s. Federal waiver required for Medicare. States may begin with commercial-only.

## Regulatory Framework

### CMS Regulations

**Authority**: Social Security Act, ACA

**Key regulatory requirements**:

1. **Site-Neutral Payment**
   - Equalize Medicare payment for hospital outpatient vs. physician office
   - Phase in over 3 years
   - Protect rural and safety-net facilities

2. **Value-Based Payment Expansion**
   - Require participation in value-based models
   - Increase shared savings/risk percentages
   - Include cost performance in quality measures

**Implementation timeline**: Regulatory changes typically 1-2 years from proposed rule.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Commerce Clause**: Clear authority for drug pricing and market regulation
- **Takings Clause**: Price regulation not a taking if reasonable return allowed
- **First Amendment**: Transparency requirements are commercial speech regulation

### Preemption

- ERISA preempts some state regulation of employer plans
- States can regulate fully insured market, providers
- Federal legislation can extend protections to self-insured

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Reference pricing gaming | Countries could be pressured to raise prices | Medium |
| Transparency avoidance | Providers could make data hard to use | High |
| Merger workarounds | Systems could integrate without formal merger | High |
| Administrative complexity shift | Complexity could move rather than decrease | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Physician pricing unaddressed | Physician costs rising rapidly | Political difficulty |
| Employer market fragmentation | Reforms apply unevenly | ERISA preemption |
| Implementation capacity | CMS/FTC may lack resources | Appropriations constraints |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Reference pricing gaming**: Include anti-circumvention provisions; annual country review
2. **Transparency avoidance**: Require standardized formats; fund enforcement
3. **Merger workarounds**: Define integration broadly; apply to affiliations
4. **Administrative complexity shift**: Mandate measurable simplification targets
5. **Physician pricing**: Extend all-payer to physician services in Phase 2
6. **ERISA preemption**: Include explicit ERISA preemption provision for cost reforms

### General Implementation Concerns

- **CMS capacity**: Additional appropriations needed
- **Provider financial adjustment**: Transition period for payment changes
- **Political durability**: Risk of reversal with administration change
- **State coordination**: Federal-state alignment on commercial market
