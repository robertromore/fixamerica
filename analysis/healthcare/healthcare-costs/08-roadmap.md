# Healthcare Costs: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Controlling healthcare costs requires attacking multiple drivers simultaneously while building political support through demonstrated savings. The roadmap sequences reforms to build momentum and overcome opposition.

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Drug Pricing Reform

- Expand IRA negotiation to all Medicare drugs
- Extend negotiated prices to commercial market
- Implement international reference pricing
- Close pay-for-delay loopholes
- Accelerate biosimilar competition

### Price Transparency Enforcement

- Require machine-readable price files
- Mandate advance cost estimates
- Create price comparison tools
- Enforce penalties for non-compliance
- Publicize price variation data

### Anti-Consolidation Action

- Block anticompetitive mergers
- Challenge recent problematic mergers
- Increase FTC/DOJ healthcare resources
- Prohibit anti-competitive contract terms
- Review private equity acquisitions

## Phase 2: Building Momentum

### Administrative Simplification

- Standardize prior authorization
- Unify billing codes across payers
- Create national provider directory
- Streamline quality reporting
- Develop common credentialing

### Payment Reform Expansion

- Expand Medicare value-based programs
- Tie commercial payment to outcomes
- Pilot global budgets in additional states
- Reduce fee-for-service volume incentives
- Integrate behavioral health payment

### Site-of-Service Neutrality

- Equalize payment for hospital vs. office settings
- Eliminate facility fees for routine care
- Encourage shift to lower-cost settings
- Protect access in rural/underserved areas

## Phase 3: Structural Reform

### All-Payer Rate Setting

- Establish state or regional rate-setting authorities
- Set uniform rates across all payers
- Include quality and equity requirements
- Transition to prospective budgets
- Monitor for unintended consequences

### Single-Payer Option

- State-level single-payer pilots (with federal waiver)
- Medicare-for-All legislation
- Transition planning for displaced workers
- Provider payment standardization

### State-Level Systems

- Enable state-level rate-setting through waivers
- State all-payer systems within federal floors
- Cross-state care coordination
- Federal support for state capacity

## Success Metrics

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| Total spending | Healthcare as % GDP | < 12% |
| Price reduction | Average prices vs. 2023 | -20% |
| Administrative cost | Admin as % spending | < 8% |
| Drug prices | Prices vs. international average | < 120% |
| Out-of-pocket burden | Median OOP spending | -30% |
| Quality maintenance | Outcome measures | No decline |

## Risk Mitigation

### Provider Resistance

- Grandfather existing payment levels temporarily
- Demonstrate administrative savings offset rate reductions
- Engage physicians separately from hospital systems
- Emphasize quality of care, not just cost

### Access Concerns

- Monitor for provider exit from markets
- Maintain rural and safety-net protections
- Ensure network adequacy requirements
- Track outcomes alongside costs

### Political Opposition

- Build business/employer coalition
- Highlight waste, not "rationing"
- Use state pilots to demonstrate viability
- Sequence to build constituencies for next steps
