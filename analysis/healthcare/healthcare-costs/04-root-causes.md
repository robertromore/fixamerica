# Healthcare Costs: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

Why does the U.S. pay twice as much for healthcare as peer countries with no better outcomes?

### Structural Causes

**Prices, Not Utilization**

The primary driver of U.S. cost excess is prices, not utilization:

- Americans use fewer hospital days and physician visits than peers
- Per-unit prices are 2-5x higher for identical services
- "It's the prices, stupid" (Health Affairs, 2003)

**Market Failures**

Healthcare violates basic market assumptions:

- Information asymmetry (patients cannot evaluate quality)
- Inelastic demand (people will pay anything when sick)
- Principal-agent problems (doctors order, patients pay)
- Third-party payment removes price discipline

**Consolidation and Market Power**

- Hospital systems have merged into regional monopolies
- Physician practices increasingly owned by hospitals/PE
- PBMs consolidated to three major players
- Insurers consolidated but face concentrated providers

### Institutional Causes

**Fee-for-Service Payment**

- Rewards volume, not outcomes
- Incentivizes procedures over prevention
- No reward for coordination or efficiency
- Each service generates revenue regardless of value

**Administrative Complexity**

- Multiple payers with different rules
- Prior authorization requirements
- Billing and coding complexity
- Quality reporting burden
- Each adds cost without adding care

**Pharmaceutical Pricing**

- No government price negotiation (until 2022 IRA, limited)
- Patent system enables monopoly pricing
- Pay-for-delay agreements extend exclusivity
- International reference pricing absent
- Direct-to-consumer advertising unique to U.S.

### Political Economy

**Who benefits from high costs?**

- Hospitals: Higher revenues, capital accumulation
- Physicians: Higher incomes than international peers
- Pharmaceutical companies: U.S. is global profit center
- Medical device makers: Premium pricing
- Intermediaries: Insurers, PBMs, consultants, billers
- Real estate: Medical construction boom

**Why costs remain high**

- Provider lobbying exceeds all other industries
- Fragmented payers cannot coordinate
- Patients don't experience true prices
- Employers pass costs to workers invisibly
- Ideological opposition to price regulation

## Causal Diagram

```
Third-party payment → Price insensitivity
         ↓
Consolidation → Market power → High prices
         ↓
Fee-for-service → Volume incentives → Overutilization
         ↓
Administrative complexity → 15-30% overhead
         ↓
Drug monopolies → No price negotiation → 2-3x prices
         ↓
     RESULT: 17.3% of GDP, worst outcomes among peers
```
