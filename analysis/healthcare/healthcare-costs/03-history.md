# Healthcare Costs: History

## Overview

American healthcare costs have grown from a negligible share of the economy to nearly one-fifth of GDP over the past century. This trajectory reflects specific policy choices—tax subsidies for employer insurance, fee-for-service payment, resistance to price regulation, and tolerance of consolidation—that created a system optimized for revenue extraction rather than value delivery.

## Pre-Modern Era (Before 1940)

### Healthcare as a Minor Expense

**Early 20th Century**

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Healthcare share of GDP | ~3% | Minor economic sector |
| Hospital stay cost | $5-10/day | Affordable for many |
| Physician visit | $1-3 | Cash payment |
| Life expectancy | 47 years (1900) | Limited medical effectiveness |

**Limited Insurance**

| Development | Year | Effect |
|-------------|------|--------|
| Baylor Hospital plan | 1929 | First Blue Cross precursor |
| Blue Cross/Shield | 1930s | Nonprofit hospital insurance |
| Commercial insurers | 1940s | Entered market |

### Why Costs Were Low

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Limited technology | Few expensive interventions |
| Cash payment | Price sensitivity |
| Minimal insurance | No cost insulation |
| Low physician income | Not yet high-status profession |
| Charity care model | Hospitals had mission focus |

## Insurance Era (1940-1965)

### Tax Subsidy Creates Demand

**Wartime Origins**

| Year | Policy | Effect |

|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1940 | 9% | Minimal |
| 1950 | 50% | Rising |
| 1960 | 68% | Accelerating |

### Insurance Drives Cost Growth

**Moral Hazard Effect**

| Mechanism | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Third-party payment | Patients insensitive to price |
| Fee-for-service | Providers rewarded for volume |
| Comprehensive coverage | No cost-sharing barrier |
| Provider pricing power | Insurers pass costs through |

**Hospital Expansion**

| Program | Year | Effect |
|---------|------|--------|
| Hill-Burton Act | 1946 | Federal hospital construction |
| Hospital expansion | 1940s-60s | Capacity growth |

## Medicare/Medicaid Era (1965-1983)

### Government Enters as Major Payer

**1965 Legislation**

| Program | Design Choice | Cost Implication |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Medicare Part A | Hospital insurance | Fee-for-service payment |

| Medicaid | State-administered | Variable payment policies |

**Provider-Friendly Design**

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| "Usual, customary, reasonable" fees | Providers set own prices |

| Private intermediaries | Limited oversight |

### Cost Explosion

**Price Effects**

| Study Finding | Source |
|---------------|--------|
| 20-40% price increases post-merger | Multiple academic studies |

## International Comparison History

### Divergent Paths

| Country | Path | Result |
|---------|------|--------|
| United States | Private insurance, fee-for-service | 18% of GDP |
| Germany | Bismarck model (1883) | 12% of GDP |
| United Kingdom | NHS (1948) | 10% of GDP |
| Canada | Single-payer (1966) | 11% of GDP |

### Why America Diverged

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| No post-war health system creation | Missed window for reform |
| Employer-based system entrenched | Path dependence |
| AMA opposition to government insurance | Defeated Truman plan |
| Federalism | State-by-state variation |
| Industry lobbying | Blocked comprehensive reform |

## Lessons from History

### What Has Worked

1. **Prospective payment**: DRGs slowed hospital cost growth temporarily
2. **Competition when possible**: Generic drugs reduce costs
3. **Government negotiation**: VA, Medicaid achieve lower prices
4. **Global budgets**: Limited Maryland hospital experiment shows promise

### What Has Not Worked

1. **Voluntary cost control**: Providers adapt to maintain revenue
2. **Consumer-driven care**: High deductibles shift costs, don't reduce them
3. **Price transparency alone**: Consumers don't shop for healthcare
4. **Incremental reforms**: System absorbs piecemeal changes

### Recurring Patterns

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Industry defeats reform | Carter, Clinton, ACA weakening |
| Consolidation follows reform | Post-ACA hospital mergers |
| Balloon squeezing | Cut one area, costs shift to another |
| Gaming incentives | DRG upcoding, quality metric manipulation |
| Short-term savings erode | BBA savings reversed |
