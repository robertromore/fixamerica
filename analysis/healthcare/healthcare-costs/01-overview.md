# Healthcare Costs

## Overview

The United States spends more on healthcare than any other nation—both in total dollars and per capita—yet achieves worse outcomes on most measures. In 2022, healthcare spending reached $4.5 trillion, representing 17.3% of GDP. These costs burden families, employers, and governments while failing to deliver commensurate value.

## Why This Matters

Excessive healthcare costs harm Americans at every level:

**Families**:

- $23,968 average family premium (employer + worker share)
- $6,000+ average deductible before coverage begins
- 100 million Americans carry medical debt
- Medical bills are leading cause of bankruptcy

**Employers**:

- Healthcare costs reduce competitiveness
- Costs suppress wage growth
- Small businesses priced out of coverage
- Benefits administration burden

**Government**:

- Medicare/Medicaid consume growing budget share
- Crowds out other investments
- Long-term fiscal unsustainability
- State budgets strained

**Economy**:

- Job lock limits labor mobility
- Entrepreneurship discouraged
- Productivity losses from untreated conditions
- International competitiveness harmed

Given America's federal structure, healthcare costs present both challenges and opportunities—states and the federal government must collaborate on funding, while state-level variation enables experimentation with cost control strategies.
