# Medicare

Medicare is the federal health insurance program for Americans aged 65 and older and certain younger people with disabilities or end-stage renal disease. Enacted in 1965 as a cornerstone of the Great Society, Medicare now covers over 67 million Americans and represents the largest single purchaser of healthcare services in the United States. The program faces significant challenges: long-term solvency concerns, benefit gaps that leave enrollees exposed to substantial out-of-pocket costs, payment systems that inadequately reward value, and complex coordination with Medicaid for the 12 million "dual eligible" beneficiaries who qualify for both programs.
