## Success Metrics

| Goal | Metric | Target |
|------|--------|--------|
| Solvency | Trust Fund depletion date | 2050+ |
| Affordability | Beneficiary OOP spending | -40% |
| Coverage | Beneficiaries with dental coverage | 90% |
| Integration | Dual eligibles in integrated care | 80% |
| Value | MA payment vs. traditional Medicare | 100% |
| Expansion | Enrollment (with age 55+) | 85 million |
| Satisfaction | Beneficiary satisfaction | >85% |

## Risk Mitigation

### Political Resistance

**Risks**:

- Insurance industry opposition to MA reforms
- Pharmaceutical industry challenges to drug pricing
- Conservative opposition to expansion
- Provider opposition to payment changes

**Mitigation**:

- Build beneficiary coalition for improvements
- Demonstrate savings to fiscal moderates
- Sequence popular changes (benefits) before difficult ones (payment)
- Offer transition assistance for affected industries

### Implementation Challenges

**Risks**:

- CMS capacity constraints
- IT system limitations
- Provider network adequacy for new benefits
- Transition disruption for dual eligibles

**Mitigation**:

- Increase CMS administrative funding
- Phase implementation to manage complexity
- Build dental/vision/hearing networks in advance
- Protect beneficiary continuity during transitions

### Unintended Consequences

**Risks**:

- Provider exit from Medicare
- MA plan market exit
- Benefit gaming or fraud
- Regional access disparities

**Mitigation**:

- Monitor provider participation rates
- Ensure adequate payment levels
- Strengthen program integrity
- Address geographic variation explicitly
