# Medicare: Root Causes

## Why Medicare's Challenges Persist

### Structural Design Limitations

**Original Program Gaps**

Medicare was designed in 1965 based on the private insurance model of that era, which emphasized acute hospital care. The program was never intended to cover:

- Long-term care (seen as welfare, not insurance)
- Outpatient prescription drugs (added only in 2003)
- Dental, vision, and hearing (considered "routine")
- Comprehensive preventive care

These gaps persist because adding benefits requires legislation and funding, while removing gaps creates winners (beneficiaries) and losers (taxpayers, providers of supplemental coverage).

**Fragmented Structure**

The four-part structure (A, B, C, D) creates:

- Administrative complexity
- Gaps between coverage categories
- Multiple enrollment decisions
- Varying financing mechanisms
- Opportunities for cost-shifting

### Financial Architecture Problems

**Trust Fund Fiction**

The Part A Trust Fund is an accounting mechanism, not a true reserve:

- Represents claims on future general revenue
- "Depletion" triggers automatic benefit cuts (to match incoming revenue)
- Creates artificial crisis points for political leverage
- Does not reflect true fiscal capacity

**Demographic Imbalance**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Baby Boomer retirement | 10,000 new beneficiaries daily through 2030 |
| Increasing longevity | More years of coverage per beneficiary |
| Declining worker ratio | Fewer workers supporting each beneficiary |
| Healthcare cost growth | Spending growing faster than wages |

**Payroll Tax Limitations**

- Taxes tied to employment, not wealth or capital gains
- Aging population reduces working-age tax base
- Wage stagnation limits revenue growth
- Political resistance to rate increases

### Payment System Dysfunction

**Fee-for-Service Incentives**

Medicare's dominant payment model rewards:

- More services (volume)
- More expensive services (higher RVUs)
- Specialty care over primary care
- Treatment over prevention
- Fragmentation over coordination

**Failed Cost Control Attempts**

- SGR created "doc fix" ritual, undermining credibility
- MACRA's MIPS is burdensome with limited impact
- ACOs show modest savings at best
- Value-based payment models struggle to scale

**Provider Payment Rates**

Medicare pays approximately 80% of private insurance rates:

- Providers cost-shift to private payers
- Some providers limit Medicare patients
- Creates pricing distortions across the system
- Reduces Medicare's leverage to drive system change

### Medicare Advantage Structural Issues

**Overpayment by Design**

MA plans are paid based on projected costs for similar beneficiaries in traditional Medicare, but:

- Risk adjustment encourages diagnosis "upcoding"
- Plans attract healthier enrollees
- Quality bonuses are easily gamed
- Actual savings to Medicare are negative

**Private Profit Incentives**

MA plans profit by:

- Receiving capitated payments while managing utilization
- Using prior authorization to deny/delay care
- Coding diagnoses aggressively for higher payments
- Marketing selectively to healthier populations
- Underpaying providers relative to traditional Medicare

**Regulatory Capture**

- Insurance industry has substantial lobbying power
- MA overpayments benefit politically powerful constituencies
- CMS lacks capacity for aggressive oversight
- Congress protects MA from payment cuts

### Dual Eligible Coordination Failure

**Two-Program Problem**

- Medicare is federal; Medicaid is state/federal
- Different eligibility rules, benefits, payment systems
- No single accountable entity for care coordination
- Cost-shifting incentives between programs
- Beneficiaries navigate two bureaucracies

**Misaligned Incentives**

- Medicare pays for acute care; Medicaid pays for long-term care
- Neither program invests in services that benefit the other
- Hospital readmissions cost Medicare; community support costs Medicaid
- No shared savings mechanism to align incentives

### Political Economy Constraints

**Beneficiary Politics**

- Seniors vote at high rates
- Any benefit reduction triggers backlash
- Program expansion is more popular than reform
- "Don't touch my Medicare" limits restructuring

**Provider Politics**

- AMA, hospital associations, specialty societies are powerful
- Payment cuts face organized opposition
- Volume-based incentives benefit incumbent providers
- Practice pattern change threatens existing business models

**Industry Influence**

- Insurance industry protects Medicare Advantage
- Pharmaceutical industry fought drug negotiation for decades
- Device manufacturers resist reference pricing
- Private equity seeks profit from Medicare payments

### Ideological Constraints

**Market vs. Government Debate**

- Conservatives favor privatization through Medicare Advantage
- Progressives favor expanding traditional Medicare
- Compromise produces hybrid system with worst features of both
- Coherent reform blocked by ideological standoff

**Incrementalism Trap**

- Major reform seen as politically impossible
- Incremental changes preserve dysfunctional structure
- Each patch creates new complications
- Fundamental problems never addressed
