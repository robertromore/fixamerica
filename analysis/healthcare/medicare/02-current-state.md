- **Prior authorization**: Denials for medically necessary services
- **Network adequacy**: Access issues in some markets
- **Cherry-picking**: Marketing to healthier beneficiaries
- **Quality**: Mixed evidence on outcomes vs. traditional Medicare

## Dual Eligible Population

### Demographics

- 12.4 million people eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid
- Average age: 63 (younger than Medicare-only population)
- 40% have cognitive or mental impairments

- Limited integrated care options

## Payment System Issues

### Fee-for-Service Incentives

- Volume over value
- Specialty care over primary care
- Procedures over cognitive services
- Fragmentation over coordination

### Value-Based Payment Progress

- Accountable Care Organizations cover 12+ million beneficiaries
- Bundled payments in some service areas
- Quality bonuses in Medicare Advantage
- MIPS (Merit-based Incentive Payment System) for physicians
- Limited impact on overall spending trends

## Regional Variation

- Medicare spending per capita varies 2x across regions
- Higher spending does not correlate with better outcomes
- Reflects local practice patterns and supply factors
- Creates inequities and inefficiency
