# Medicare: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles

- **Universal coverage foundation**: Medicare should be the path to universal coverage, not fragmented by privatization
- **Fiscal sustainability**: Reforms must address long-term solvency without cutting benefits
- **Benefit adequacy**: Out-of-pocket exposure must be reduced; coverage gaps closed
- **Value-based payment**: Payment should reward outcomes and coordination, not volume
- **Dual eligible integration**: Medicare and Medicaid coordination must be seamless for those in both programs

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Medicare Solvency Package

**Description**: Comprehensive financing reform to ensure long-term program sustainability.

**Components**:

1. **Payroll tax adjustments**
   - Apply Medicare tax to all income (currently wages only)
   - Increase additional high-income tax from 0.9% to 1.5%
   - Index tax base to healthcare cost growth

2. **Revenue diversification**
   - Dedicate portion of financial transaction tax to Medicare
   - Tax sugar-sweetened beverages with revenue to Medicare
   - Redirect portion of estate tax to Trust Fund

3. **Spending reforms**
   - Expand drug negotiation to all Medicare drugs immediately
   - International reference pricing (110% of average developed country price)
   - Site-neutral payment for all services
   - Medicare Advantage payment parity (no overpayments)

**Evidence**: CBO and MedPAC analyses indicate these reforms could extend Trust Fund solvency beyond 2050 while maintaining or improving benefits.

**Challenges**: Political resistance to tax increases; provider opposition to payment cuts; insurance industry opposition to MA reforms.

### Solution 2: Closing the Benefit Gaps

**Description**: Add dental, vision, and hearing coverage to traditional Medicare; establish out-of-pocket maximum.

**Components**:

1. **Dental coverage**
   - Comprehensive dental benefits including preventive, restorative, periodontal
   - $500 annual maximum out-of-pocket
   - Phased implementation beginning with preventive services

2. **Vision coverage**
   - Annual eye exams
   - Eyeglasses or contact lenses every two years
   - Treatment for vision conditions

3. **Hearing coverage**
   - Hearing exams
   - Hearing aids and fitting
   - Cochlear implants where medically appropriate

4. **Out-of-pocket maximum**
   - $2,000 annual cap on Part A and B combined out-of-pocket costs
   - Eliminates catastrophic exposure
   - Reduces need for Medigap coverage

**Evidence**: Other developed countries include these benefits in universal coverage. Dental and hearing care linked to overall health outcomes.

**Challenges**: Cost (estimated $350 billion over 10 years); provider network adequacy; defining covered services.

### Solution 3: Medicare Advantage Reform

**Description**: Reduce overpayments, increase oversight, and level the playing field with traditional Medicare.

**Components**:

1. **Payment reform**
   - Set MA payments at 100% of traditional Medicare costs (not 106-122%)
   - Reform risk adjustment to prevent upcoding
   - Require rebates for excessive profits

2. **Transparency requirements**
   - Public reporting of claims-equivalent data
   - Disclosure of prior authorization denial rates
   - Provider payment rate disclosure

3. **Consumer protection**
   - Limit prior authorization; require 24-hour decisions
   - Automatic external review for denials
   - Simplified comparison tools

4. **Traditional Medicare improvements**
   - Add supplemental benefits (telehealth, care coordination)
   - Reduce Medigap premiums through competition reforms
   - Voluntary care coordination services

**Evidence**: MedPAC, OIG, and academic studies document MA overpayments and quality concerns. Reforms could save $30-50 billion annually.

**Challenges**: Insurance industry opposition; beneficiary concern about disruption; implementation complexity.

### Solution 4: Dual Eligible Integration

**Description**: Create seamless coverage for the 12 million people eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.

**Components**:

1. **Federal assumption of dual eligible costs**
   - Shift full-dual eligibles to Medicare
   - Federal government takes over Medicaid LTSS costs for duals
   - States contribute maintenance-of-effort payments

2. **Integrated benefit design**
   - Single card, single provider network
   - Combined benefits package
   - Unified care coordination
   - Shared savings for preventive investments

3. **D-SNP reform**
   - Require exclusively aligned enrollment
   - Integrate Medicare and Medicaid benefits
   - Single contracts covering both programs

**Evidence**: Integrated care demonstrations show improved outcomes and reduced costs for dual eligibles. Current fragmentation is universally criticized.

**Challenges**: Federal-state negotiations; financing transition; managed care integration.

### Solution 5: Medicare Expansion Options

**Description**: Expand Medicare eligibility beyond current populations.

**Options**:

**Option A: Medicare at 55**

- Lower eligibility age from 65 to 55
- Buy-in option with subsidies for low-income
- Voluntary employer participation
- Estimated 15-20 million new enrollees

**Option B: Medicare for All**

- Universal Medicare coverage
- Transition employer and individual market to Medicare
- Comprehensive benefits without premiums
- Significant tax revenue required

**Option C: Medicare Public Option**

- Medicare-based plan available on ACA exchanges
- Competes with private plans
- Available to all ages
- Gradual market transition

**Evidence**: International examples show single-payer and multi-payer systems can achieve universal coverage at lower cost. Expansion builds on Medicare's administrative efficiency.

**Challenges**: Political feasibility varies dramatically by option; transition complexity; provider payment adequacy.

## International Models

| Country | Senior Coverage Model | Key Features |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| Canada | Provincial single-payer | Universal, no premiums, some LTSS gaps |
| Germany | Statutory insurance | Competing sickness funds, mandatory for most |
| France | National insurance | Universal, supplemental coverage common |
| Japan | National insurance for 75+ | Dedicated program, comprehensive |
| UK | NHS | Universal, tax-funded, some wait times |

## Sequencing

1. **Immediate** (Year 1-2)
   - Expand drug negotiation
   - MA payment reform
   - Benefit gap coverage (preventive dental, hearing)

2. **Near-term** (Year 3-5)
   - Out-of-pocket maximum
   - Dual eligible integration
   - Full dental/vision/hearing benefits

3. **Medium-term** (Year 5-10)
   - Eligibility expansion (55+)
   - Comprehensive payment reform
   - Solvency package enactment

4. **Long-term** (Year 10+)
   - Medicare for All consideration
   - Regional variation in implementation
   - Full integration of health and LTSS
