# Medicare

## Overview

Medicare is the federal health insurance program for Americans aged 65 and older and certain younger people with disabilities or end-stage renal disease. Enacted in 1965 as a cornerstone of the Great Society, Medicare now covers over 67 million Americans and represents the largest single purchaser of healthcare services in the United States. The program faces significant challenges: long-term solvency concerns, benefit gaps that leave enrollees exposed to substantial out-of-pocket costs, payment systems that inadequately reward value, and complex coordination with Medicaid for the 12 million "dual eligible" beneficiaries who qualify for both programs.

| Drug price negotiation | Expand beyond IRA | Ongoing, incremental |
| Medicare Advantage oversight | Payment accuracy, quality | Administrative action |
| Lower eligibility age | Medicare at 55 or 60 | Requires legislation |
| Trust Fund solvency | Revenue or benefit changes | Politically difficult |

## Why This Matters

Medicare is both a lifeline for seniors and people with disabilities and a significant driver of federal spending:

**For Beneficiaries**:

- Near-universal coverage for 65+ population
- Protects against catastrophic illness costs
- Enables retirement security
- But: significant gaps require supplemental coverage

**For the Healthcare System**:

- Largest single payer (shapes provider behavior)
- Payment rates influence commercial pricing
- Quality measurement and reporting driver
- Innovation through payment reform pilots

**For the Federal Budget**:

- $1+ trillion annual spending
- Fastest-growing major program
- Trust Fund solvency concerns
- Long-term fiscal sustainability challenge

**For Health Reform**:

- Foundation for Medicare for All proposals
- Model for public option concepts
- Payment reform laboratory
- Drug pricing policy leader

As the population ages and healthcare costs rise, Medicare reform becomes increasingly urgent. The program also serves as the foundation for broader coverage proposals, from Medicare for All to targeted expansions, making its structure and performance central to the future of American healthcare.
