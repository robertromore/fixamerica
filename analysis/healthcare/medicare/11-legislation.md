# Medicare: Legislation

## Overview

Medicare reform requires federal legislation to address solvency, close benefit gaps, reform payment systems, and potentially expand coverage. This legislative strategy prioritizes achievable near-term improvements while building toward comprehensive reform.

## Constitutional Considerations

No constitutional amendments are required for Medicare reforms. Congress has clear authority under the Taxing and Spending Clause to establish and modify the Medicare program. The Commerce Clause provides additional authority for regulating healthcare markets and insurance. Court challenges are possible but unlikely to succeed given Medicare's 60-year history and established constitutional basis.

## Federal Legislation

### Medicare Solvency and Benefit Improvement Act

**Purpose**: Ensure long-term financial sustainability while expanding benefits to include dental, vision, and hearing coverage.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Medicare Solvency and Benefit Improvement Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is projected to be depleted by 2031;
(2) Medicare beneficiaries face significant out-of-pocket costs averaging
    over $6,600 annually;
(3) traditional Medicare does not cover dental, vision, or hearing services
    essential to beneficiary health;
(4) comprehensive reform can achieve solvency while improving benefits.

SEC. 3. MEDICARE TAX REFORM.
(a) APPLICATION TO ALL INCOME.—Section 3101(b) of the Internal Revenue
    Code is amended to apply the Medicare tax to all income, including
    capital gains, dividends, and other investment income.

(b) INCREASED RATE ON HIGH INCOMES.—The additional Medicare tax under
    section 3101(b)(2) is increased from 0.9 percent to 1.5 percent on
    income exceeding $400,000 ($500,000 married filing jointly).

(c) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made by this section apply to
    taxable years beginning after December 31 following enactment.

SEC. 4. DENTAL, VISION, AND HEARING BENEFITS.
(a) DENTAL COVERAGE.—Title XVIII of the Social Security Act is amended
    to provide coverage for—
    (1) preventive dental services including exams, cleanings, and x-rays;
    (2) basic dental services including fillings and extractions;
    (3) major dental services including crowns, bridges, and dentures;
    with cost-sharing limited to 20 percent and subject to the annual
    out-of-pocket maximum established in section 5.

(b) VISION COVERAGE.—Coverage shall include—
    (1) annual eye examinations;
    (2) one pair of eyeglasses or contact lenses annually;
    (3) treatment for eye diseases.

(c) HEARING COVERAGE.—Coverage shall include—
    (1) hearing examinations;
    (2) hearing aids, including fitting and adjustment;
    (3) cochlear implants where medically appropriate.

(d) EFFECTIVE DATE.—Coverage under this section shall be available
    beginning January 1 of the second year following enactment.

SEC. 5. OUT-OF-POCKET MAXIMUM.
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established an annual out-of-pocket
    maximum of $2,000 for cost-sharing under Parts A and B combined.

(b) ADJUSTMENT.—The Secretary shall adjust this amount annually
    based on the Consumer Price Index for medical care.

(c) EFFECTIVE DATE.—This section takes effect January 1 of the
    third year following enactment.

SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.
There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as necessary to
carry out this Act.
```

**Explanation**: This bill addresses solvency through progressive revenue measures while immediately improving beneficiary coverage. The tax changes apply Medicare contributions to all income types, not just wages, and increase rates for high earners. Benefit additions address the most significant coverage gaps.

**Challenges**: Opposition to tax increases; cost estimates ($350+ billion over 10 years for benefits); provider network adequacy for dental; implementation timeline.

**Refinements**: Consider phasing in benefits by income level; establish provider payment rates; create dental network development grants.

### Medicare Advantage Accountability Act

**Purpose**: End overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans, strengthen oversight, and protect beneficiaries from improper denials.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Medicare Advantage Accountability Act".

SEC. 2. PAYMENT REFORM.
(a) PAYMENT PARITY.—Beginning with plan year 2027, Medicare Advantage
    benchmark payments shall not exceed 100 percent of traditional
    Medicare per capita costs in each county.

(b) RISK ADJUSTMENT REFORM.—
    (1) The Secretary shall implement risk adjustment methodologies
        that prevent payment for diagnoses not documented in
        treatment records.
    (2) The Secretary shall conduct annual audits of at least 20
        percent of Medicare Advantage organizations for risk
        adjustment accuracy.
    (3) Overpayments identified through audits shall be recouped
        with interest.

(c) REBATE REQUIREMENTS.—Plans receiving payments exceeding 115 percent
    of actual costs shall return excess payments to the Medicare Trust Fund.

SEC. 3. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REFORM.
(a) TIMELINE REQUIREMENTS.—
    (1) Urgent requests: 24 hours
    (2) Non-urgent requests: 72 hours
    (3) Failure to respond constitutes approval

(b) TRANSPARENCY.—Plans shall publicly report—
    (1) prior authorization denial rates by service category;
    (2) appeal rates and outcomes;
    (3) average processing times.

(c) AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL REVIEW.—Any denial upheld on internal appeal
    shall automatically proceed to independent external review.

SEC. 4. NETWORK ADEQUACY.
(a) STANDARDS.—The Secretary shall establish and enforce standards
    requiring adequate access to all specialties within—
    (1) 30 miles or 30 minutes for primary care;
    (2) 60 miles or 60 minutes for specialty care;
    (3) 90 miles for tertiary care.

(b) ENFORCEMENT.—Plans failing to meet network standards shall be
    subject to enrollment suspension and civil monetary penalties.

    (3) beneficiary complaints;
    (4) risk score trends.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect on the date of enactment, with full implementation
required by plan year 2027.
```

**Explanation**: This bill addresses documented problems with Medicare Advantage, including overpayments (estimated at $75-140 billion annually), inappropriate care denials, and gaming of risk adjustment. It preserves MA as an option while ensuring taxpayers and beneficiaries are protected.

**Challenges**: Insurance industry opposition; beneficiary concern about disruption; implementation capacity at CMS.

### Medicare Drug Pricing Expansion Act

**Purpose**: Expand Medicare drug price negotiation authority and establish international reference pricing.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Medicare Drug Pricing Expansion Act".

SEC. 2. EXPANDED NEGOTIATION.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1192 of the Social Security Act is amended to—
    (1) remove numerical limitations on drugs subject to negotiation;
    (2) authorize negotiation for all covered Part B and Part D drugs
        with annual Medicare spending exceeding $100 million;
    (3) accelerate the negotiation timeline to begin within one year
        of FDA approval for high-cost drugs.

SEC. 3. INTERNATIONAL REFERENCE PRICING.
(a) MAXIMUM PRICE.—The negotiated price for any drug shall not exceed
    110 percent of the average price in the reference countries.

(b) REFERENCE COUNTRIES.—Reference countries shall include—
    (1) Canada
    (2) France
    (3) Germany
    (4) Japan
    (5) United Kingdom
    (6) Australia

(a) INTERCHANGEABILITY.—FDA shall expedite interchangeability
    determinations for biosimilars.

(b) REIMBURSEMENT.—Medicare shall reimburse biosimilars at rates
    that encourage adoption.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect on the date of enactment, with negotiated
prices effective within 18 months.
```

**Explanation**: This bill builds on the IRA's breakthrough by removing limitations on negotiation and establishing international reference pricing as a ceiling. Extension to the commercial market prevents cost-shifting.

**Challenges**: Pharmaceutical industry opposition; "innovation" concerns; international pricing data availability; legal challenges.

### Medicare Eligibility Expansion Act

**Purpose**: Lower the Medicare eligibility age to 55 and eliminate the disability waiting period.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Medicare Eligibility Expansion Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) Americans aged 55-64 face the highest uninsured and underinsured
    rates of any age group;
(2) the 24-month Medicare waiting period for people with disabilities
    causes coverage gaps, health deterioration, and financial hardship;
(3) expanding Medicare eligibility would improve health outcomes
    and reduce healthcare system fragmentation.

SEC. 3. AGE ELIGIBILITY.
(a) Section 226 of the Social Security Act is amended to lower the
    age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 55.

(b) PHASE-IN.—
    (1) Beginning January 1 of year 2 after enactment: age 60
    (2) Beginning January 1 of year 4 after enactment: age 55

(c) PREMIUMS.—Individuals aged 55-64 shall pay premiums calculated
    to cover the actuarial cost of their coverage, with subsidies
    available for those below 400 percent of the federal poverty level.

SEC. 4. DISABILITY WAITING PERIOD ELIMINATION.
(a) Section 226(b) of the Social Security Act is amended to eliminate
    the 24-month waiting period for Medicare eligibility for individuals
    entitled to disability insurance benefits.

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—Elimination of the waiting period takes effect
    January 1 of the year following enactment.

SEC. 5. EMPLOYER BUY-IN.
(a) Employers may enroll employees aged 55-64 in Medicare in lieu
    of other coverage.

(b) Employer premium contributions shall receive equivalent tax
    treatment as contributions for private insurance.

SEC. 6. FINANCING.
(a) PREMIUM REVENUE.—Premiums from newly eligible populations shall
    be deposited in the Trust Funds.

(b) GENERAL REVENUE.—Subsidies shall be funded from general revenue.

(c) AUTHORIZATION.—Such sums as necessary are authorized.
```

**Explanation**: This bill extends Medicare to the near-elderly population most vulnerable to coverage gaps and eliminates the cruel disability waiting period. Premium structure ensures new enrollees contribute to costs.

**Challenges**: Cost ($200+ billion over 10 years); impact on ACA markets; employer coverage transitions; provider capacity.

### Dual Eligible Integration Act

**Purpose**: Create a unified federal program for individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Dual Eligible Integration Act".

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIFIED PROGRAM.
(a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish a
    unified Medicare-Medicaid program for all individuals eligible
    for both programs.

(b) ENROLLMENT.—All full-benefit dual eligible individuals shall
    be enrolled in the unified program.

SEC. 3. BENEFITS.
(a) The unified program shall provide—
    (1) all Medicare Parts A, B, and D benefits;
    (2) all Medicaid benefits for which the individual would qualify;
    (3) long-term services and supports;
    (4) integrated care management.

(b) COST-SHARING.—No cost-sharing shall exceed current Medicaid
    levels for the dual eligible population.

SEC. 4. FINANCING.
(a) FEDERAL ASSUMPTION.—The federal government shall assume full
    financial responsibility for dual eligible coverage.

(b) STATE CONTRIBUTION.—States shall pay to the federal government
    a maintenance-of-effort amount equal to 80 percent of their
    current dual eligible Medicaid spending, adjusted annually.

(c) TRANSITION.—State contributions shall phase down over 10 years
    as states are relieved of dual eligible costs.

SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION.
(a) CMS shall administer the unified program using Medicare
    infrastructure.

(b) INTEGRATED CARE.—The program shall emphasize integrated care
    delivery through—
    (1) single care management entity per beneficiary;
    (2) unified provider network;
    (3) aligned quality metrics and payment incentives.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect on January 1 of the third year after enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This bill solves the dual eligible fragmentation problem by creating a single federal program. States contribute to costs but are relieved of administrative burden and complex cost-sharing calculations.

**Challenges**: Federal-state negotiations; managed care transitions; cost estimates; implementation complexity.

## State Model Legislation

### State Medicare Supplement Reform Act

**Purpose**: Reduce Medigap costs and improve coverage options for state residents.

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Medicare Supplement Reform Act".

SECTION 2. GUARANTEED ISSUE.
(a) All Medicare supplement insurers shall offer coverage to any
    Medicare beneficiary during—
    (1) the initial enrollment period;
    (2) a 63-day period following loss of employer coverage;
    (3) a 63-day period following disenrollment from Medicare Advantage.

(b) Premiums during guaranteed issue periods shall not exceed 110
    percent of standard rates.

SECTION 3. STANDARDIZED RATE REVIEW.
(a) The [Insurance Commissioner] shall review all Medigap rate
    increases exceeding 5 percent.

(b) Rate increases shall be justified by claims experience, not
    projected costs.

SECTION 4. COMPARISON TOOLS.
The [Insurance Commissioner] shall maintain a public website comparing
all Medigap plans, including—
(1) premium rates by age and county;
(2) rate increase history;
(3) claims denial rates;
(4) consumer complaints.

SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect [date].
```

**Variation notes**: States have limited authority over Medigap regulation but can enhance consumer protections. Federal action may be needed for comprehensive reform.

## Regulatory Framework

### CMS Regulations

**Authority**: Social Security Act, ACA, IRA

**Key regulatory areas**:

1. **Medicare Advantage Oversight**
   - Network adequacy standards
   - Prior authorization requirements
   - Risk adjustment audits
   - Marketing restrictions

2. **Drug Pricing Implementation**
   - Negotiation procedures
   - Price ceiling calculations
   - Manufacturer compliance

3. **Quality Measurement**
   - Star ratings methodology
   - Value-based payment models
   - Outcome reporting requirements

4. **Beneficiary Protection**
   - Appeals procedures
   - Coverage determination standards
   - Anti-discrimination enforcement

**Implementation timeline**: Major regulatory changes typically require 18-24 months from proposed rule to full implementation.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Basis

- **Taxing and Spending Clause**: Primary authority for Medicare
- **Commerce Clause**: Supports regulation of healthcare markets
- **Supremacy Clause**: Federal Medicare law preempts state interference

### Preemption Issues

- ERISA preemption affects employer Medicare supplement plans
- State insurance regulation applies to Medigap
- Medicare Advantage federal standards preempt conflicting state rules

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- CMS administrative enforcement for MA and Part D plans
- OIG fraud and abuse authority
- DOJ civil and criminal prosecution
- Private right of action for beneficiaries (limited)

### Potential Legal Challenges

- Drug negotiation challenges (unlikely to succeed given IRA precedent)
- MA payment reduction challenges (courts deferential to CMS)
- Tax increase challenges (within congressional authority)

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| MA upcoding evolution | Plans develop new coding strategies to circumvent audit reforms | High |
| Reference pricing circumvention | Manufacturers create "new" formulations to reset prices | High |
| Network adequacy gaming | Plans technically meet standards while limiting practical access | Medium |
| Benefit design manipulation | Plans structure benefits to discourage high-cost enrollees | Medium |
| Dual eligible carve-outs | States seek waivers to avoid maintenance-of-effort | Medium |
| Prior auth workarounds | Plans shift denials to different mechanisms | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Long-term care not addressed | Beneficiaries still face catastrophic LTSS costs | Scope limitation; cost concerns |
| Incremental expansion only | Medicare for All not advanced | Political feasibility constraints |
| Provider payment adequacy | Risk of provider participation decline | Budget constraints |
| Rural access gaps persist | Rural beneficiaries face limited provider choice | Structural healthcare workforce shortage |
| Administrative complexity remains | Multiple programs, enrollment periods continue | Incremental reform preserves existing structure |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **MA upcoding evolution**: Require diagnosis documentation in contemporaneous treatment notes; implement machine learning detection of coding anomalies; tie audits to statistical outliers; increase penalties for systematic upcoding

2. **Reference pricing circumvention**: Define "new" formulation standards; require demonstration of meaningful improvement for reset pricing; apply reference pricing to all versions of a drug molecule

3. **Network adequacy gaming**: Require secret shopper audits; measure actual appointment availability, not just contracted providers; tie network adequacy to claims patterns showing out-of-network utilization

4. **Benefit design manipulation**: Standardize benefit designs for key service categories; prohibit discriminatory cost-sharing structures; require actuarial certification of non-discriminatory design

5. **Dual eligible carve-outs**: Specify maintenance-of-effort requirements in statute; limit waiver authority; create federal fallback if states fail to contribute

6. **Prior auth workarounds**: Define covered utilization management techniques; require approval rates within specified ranges; automatic external review for patterns of denial

### General Implementation Concerns

- **CMS capacity**: Agency must scale to manage expanded oversight responsibilities
- **Provider networks**: Dental, vision, hearing provider capacity may be insufficient
- **IT systems**: Medicare systems require modernization for new programs
- **Political durability**: Risk of reversal with administration change
- **Transition management**: Beneficiary disruption during implementation
