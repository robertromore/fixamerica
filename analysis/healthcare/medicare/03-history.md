# Medicare: History

## Historical Development

### Pre-Medicare Era (1900-1965)

- Private health insurance emerged in 1930s-1940s, primarily employer-based
- Elderly largely excluded from coverage (too costly, out of workforce)
- Multiple failed attempts at national health insurance
- By 1965, only 50% of seniors had any health insurance
- Medical costs drove many elderly into poverty

### Creation and Early Years (1965-1980)

- **1965**: Medicare and Medicaid enacted as Titles XVIII and XIX of Social Security Act
- President Johnson signed bill with Harry Truman present
- Part A (hospital) and Part B (medical) established
- Initially covered 19 million Americans
- **1972**: Extended to people with disabilities and ESRD
- **1973**: HMO Act encouraged managed care development
- Rapid spending growth exceeded projections

### Cost Control Era (1980-2000)

- **1983**: Prospective Payment System (DRGs) for hospitals
- Shifted from cost-plus reimbursement to fixed payments
- **1989**: Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) for physicians
- **1997**: Balanced Budget Act
  - Created Medicare+Choice (precursor to Medicare Advantage)
  - Established sustainable growth rate (SGR) for physician payments
  - Reduced provider payments substantially
- **1999**: Medicare+Choice enrollment collapsed after payment cuts

### Modernization Era (2000-2010)

- **2003**: Medicare Modernization Act
  - Created Part D prescription drug benefit
  - Established Medicare Advantage (replacing Medicare+Choice)
  - Health Savings Accounts introduced
  - "Non-interference" clause prohibited drug price negotiation
- **2008**: Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act
  - Prevented SGR cuts (start of "doc fix" cycle)
  - Improved low-income subsidy programs

### ACA and Beyond (2010-Present)

- **2010**: Affordable Care Act
  - Extended Trust Fund solvency (reduced provider payments)
  - Created Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI)
  - Established Accountable Care Organizations
  - Began closing Part D coverage gap ("donut hole")
  - Added free preventive services
- **2015**: MACRA
  - Repealed SGR with permanent physician payment reform
  - Created MIPS and alternative payment models
- **2022**: Inflation Reduction Act
  - Authorized Medicare drug price negotiation
  - Capped insulin at $35/month
  - Eliminated cost-sharing in coverage gap
  - Capped out-of-pocket Part D spending at $2,000 (2025)

## Key Turning Points

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1965 | Medicare enacted | Universal coverage for elderly |
| 1972 | Disability expansion | Extended to non-elderly disabled |
| 1983 | DRG implementation | Transformed hospital payment |
| 1997 | BBA and Medicare+Choice | First managed care push |
| 2003 | MMA and Part D | Drug coverage; MA expansion |
| 2010 | ACA | Solvency extension; value-based care |
| 2022 | IRA | Drug negotiation breakthrough |

## Lessons from History

1. **Medicare achieved near-universal coverage for its population**: Unlike the under-65 market, Medicare demonstrates that public insurance can provide reliable coverage

2. **Payment reform is difficult but possible**: DRGs, RBRVS, and MACRA show that payment system changes can be implemented, though often with unintended consequences

3. **Private plan integration is contentious**: Medicare Advantage shows both the appeal and problems of introducing private competition into a public program

4. **Drug benefit design matters**: The MMA's non-interference clause and coverage gap created problems that took decades to address

5. **Trust fund solvency drives action**: Imminent depletion dates force congressional attention; distant projections are ignored

6. **Incremental expansion is achievable**: Disability extension in 1972, drug benefit in 2003, and preventive services expansion show that benefits can be added
