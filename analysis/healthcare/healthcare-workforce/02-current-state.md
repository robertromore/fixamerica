## Present Conditions

The American healthcare workforce is experiencing unprecedented strain. Chronic shortages, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have created critical gaps across all health professions. The pipeline for new clinicians cannot keep pace with growing demand from an aging population, while existing clinicians face unsustainable workloads driving early retirement and career exits.

### Physician Workforce

| Primary care shortage | 17,800-48,000 | Critical |
| Specialty shortage | 21,000-77,100 | Severe |
| Average physician age | 53 years | Rising |
| Physicians over 65 | 20%+ | Increasing |

### Medical Education Pipeline

**Medical School Capacity**:
- 158 accredited MD-granting schools (2023)

- Annual DO graduates: ~8,500
- First-year enrollment increased 30% since 2006

**Residency Bottleneck**:
- ~35,000 first-year residency positions annually
- Medicare-funded positions capped since 1997 at ~100,000
