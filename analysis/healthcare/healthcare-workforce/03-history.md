# Healthcare Workforce: History

## Historical Evolution

The American healthcare workforce has been shaped by a century of policy decisions, market forces, and professional interests. Understanding this history reveals how current shortages and maldistribution patterns emerged from deliberate choices rather than inevitable outcomes.

### Pre-Modern Era (Before 1910)

**Unregulated Medical Practice**:
- No standardized medical education requirements
- Proprietary medical schools of widely varying quality
- African Americans, women, and immigrants operated numerous medical schools
- Competition kept physician supply high and prices accessible
- Quality varied dramatically; many practitioners poorly trained

**Early Nursing**:
- Nursing emerged as profession during Civil War
- Florence Nightingale model imported from Britain
- Hospital-based diploma programs dominated
- Nursing defined as female auxiliary to physician authority

### Flexner Report Era (1910-1945)

**The Flexner Revolution (1910)**:
The Flexner Report, funded by the Carnegie Foundation, transformed American medical education:

- Recommended closing "inferior" medical schools
- Established Johns Hopkins model as gold standard
- Medical schools required university affiliation
- Clinical training and laboratory science mandated
- Admission standards dramatically raised

**Consequences of Flexner**:
- Medical school count dropped from 155 to 66 by 1935
- African American medical schools reduced from 7 to 2 (Howard, Meharry)
- Women's medical schools closed or merged
- Rural and working-class access to medical education declined
- Physician supply contracted, increasing incomes

**AMA Supply Control**:
The American Medical Association used accreditation authority to limit medical school class sizes:
- Maintained "physician oversupply" as policy concern through 1970s
- Lobbied against federal funding for medical education
- Opposed expanding osteopathic medicine
- Protected physician income through supply restriction

### Post-War Expansion (1945-1965)

**Federal Investment Begins**:
- Hill-Burton Act (1946): Hospital construction, created facility infrastructure
- GI Bill funded medical education for veterans
- NIH expansion created academic medical center research enterprise
- National Mental Health Act (1946) began psychiatric training support

**Nursing Professionalization**:
- Cadet Nurse Corps (1943-1948) trained 124,000 nurses during WWII
- Shift from diploma to degree programs began
- Nursing shortage emerged as hospital employment expanded
- American Nurses Association pushed for professional standards

**Emergence of Specialty Training**:
- Residency training standardized post-war
- Specialty boards proliferated
- Fellowship training added years to preparation
- Primary care (general practice) began decline

### Medicare and the Training Explosion (1965-1980)

**Medicare Graduate Medical Education Funding**:
The 1965 Medicare legislation included graduate medical education (GME) funding:
- Direct Graduate Medical Education (DGME) payments for resident salaries
- Indirect Medical Education (IME) payments for teaching hospital costs
- Teaching hospitals became dependent on Medicare GME funding
- Created financial incentive to expand residency programs

**Medical School Expansion**:
- Federal Health Professions Education Assistance Act (1963)
- Medical school enrollment doubled from 1960-1980
- 40 new medical schools opened
- First physician assistant programs launched (1967)
- Nurse practitioner programs began (1965)

**Health Maintenance Organizations**:
- HMO Act of 1973 promoted managed care
- Kaiser Permanente model demonstrated team-based care
- Early recognition of primary care importance

### Managed Care and Oversupply Fears (1980-1997)

**GMENAC Report (1980)**:
The Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee predicted physician oversupply:
- Projected 70,000 excess physicians by 2000
- Recommended reducing medical school enrollment
- Specialty imbalances identified but not addressed
- Report proved dramatically wrong

**Market-Based Reforms**:
- Managed care expansion in 1990s
- Utilization review and gatekeeping introduced
- Primary care briefly valued by HMOs
- Specialty income initially constrained

**1997 Balanced Budget Act**:
Congress capped Medicare-funded residency positions:
- Frozen at approximately 100,000 positions
- Based on 1996 counts for each hospital
- Ostensibly to control Medicare costs
- Created permanent constraint on physician supply
- Did not account for population growth or aging

### Growing Shortage Recognition (1997-2010)

**Shifting Projections**:
- COGME reversed course, projected shortages by 2003
- AAMC began advocating 30% medical school enrollment increase
- Recognition that aging population would increase demand
- Baby boomer physician retirements anticipated

**Medical School Response**:
- New medical schools founded (23 new MD schools since 2006)
- Existing schools increased class sizes
- Osteopathic schools expanded dramatically
- Caribbean and for-profit schools proliferated

**Residency Bottleneck Identified**:
- Medical school expansion without residency expansion creates "bottleneck"
- IMGs fill positions U.S. graduates cannot access
- Teaching hospitals have financial capacity for more residents
- Medicare cap prevents expansion

**Nursing Shortage Deepens**:
- Nursing faculty shortage began limiting enrollment
- Average nursing faculty age exceeded 55
- Academic salaries could not compete with clinical
- Schools turned away tens of thousands of qualified applicants

### Affordable Care Act and Beyond (2010-Present)

**ACA Workforce Provisions**:
- National Health Care Workforce Commission authorized (never funded)
- Teaching Health Center GME program created
- Primary Care Extension Program authorized
- Loan repayment programs expanded

**Limited Progress on Residency Cap**:
- Multiple bills introduced to raise cap
- 2020 legislation added 1,000 positions over 5 years (first increase since 1997)
- Still far short of projected need
- Hospital lobby supports expansion; budget hawks resist

**Scope of Practice Wars**:
- 28 states now allow full NP practice authority
- Physician organizations oppose scope expansion
- COVID-19 prompted temporary scope expansions
- State-by-state battles continue

**COVID-19 Workforce Crisis**:
- Pandemic exposed fragility of workforce
- Travel nursing costs exploded
- Burnout and retirement accelerated
- International recruitment intensified
- Telehealth expanded practice possibilities

## Key Inflection Points

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1910 | Flexner Report | Contracted physician supply, reduced diversity |
| 1965 | Medicare GME funding | Created residency training infrastructure |
| 1967 | First PA program | Established physician extender model |
| 1997 | BBA residency cap | Created permanent physician supply constraint |
| 2006 | AAMC 30% expansion call | Medical school enrollment growth |
| 2020 | COVID-19 pandemic | Accelerated burnout, retirement, shortage recognition |

## Lessons from History

1. **Supply restrictions create shortages**: The Flexner era shows how limiting training capacity restricts supply and increases costs.

2. **Geographic maldistribution requires intervention**: Market forces alone have never distributed physicians to rural and underserved areas.

3. **Pipeline changes take decades**: Medical education reforms require 10-15 years to affect practicing physician supply.

4. **Predictions often wrong**: Both oversupply and undersupply projections have proven inaccurate.

5. **Professional interests shape policy**: AMA and specialty societies have historically prioritized income protection over access.

6. **Federal policy is essential**: State-level action cannot address national shortages or the Medicare GME cap.
