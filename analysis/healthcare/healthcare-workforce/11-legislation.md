# Healthcare Workforce: Legislation

## Overview

Addressing the healthcare workforce crisis requires legislative action at federal and state levels. The most critical federal interventions include expanding Medicare-funded residency positions, strengthening loan repayment programs, reforming scope of practice at the federal level, and improving pathways for international medical graduates. State legislation focuses on scope of practice, licensure reform, and state-level workforce investment.

## Constitutional Considerations

Healthcare workforce legislation operates within established constitutional authority:

- **Commerce Clause**: Federal regulation of healthcare education and professional standards
- **Spending Clause**: Medicare GME funding, loan repayment programs, training grants
- **Immigration Authority**: Visa policies for healthcare professionals

The primary constitutional tension involves federalism: professional licensing is traditionally a state function, though federal preemption is constitutionally permissible for interstate commerce purposes.

## Federal Legislation

### Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act

**Purpose**: Substantially increase Medicare-funded graduate medical education positions to address the physician shortage.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) the United States faces a projected shortage of between 37,800 and
    124,000 physicians by 2034;
(2) Medicare-funded graduate medical education positions have been
    capped since the Balanced Budget Act of 1997;
(3) medical school enrollment has increased 30 percent since 2006,
    but residency positions have not kept pace;
(4) the physician shortage disproportionately affects primary care,
    psychiatry, and rural and underserved areas;
(5) each additional residency position produces a physician who will
    practice for an average of 30 years.

SEC. 3. DISTRIBUTION OF ADDITIONAL RESIDENCY POSITIONS.
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1886(h) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
    1395ww(h)) is amended by adding at the end the following:

    "(10) DISTRIBUTION OF ADDITIONAL RESIDENCY POSITIONS.—
        (A) ADDITIONAL POSITIONS.—For each of fiscal years 2025 through
            2031, the Secretary shall increase the otherwise applicable
            resident limit for each qualifying hospital by such number as
            the Secretary may approve, not to exceed in the aggregate—
            (i) 2,000 positions in fiscal year 2025;
            (ii) 2,000 positions in fiscal year 2026;
            (iii) 2,000 positions in fiscal year 2027;
            (iv) 2,000 positions in fiscal year 2028;
            (v) 2,000 positions in fiscal year 2029;
            (vi) 2,000 positions in fiscal year 2030; and
            (vii) 2,000 positions in fiscal year 2031.

        (B) PRIORITY FOR DISTRIBUTION.—In distributing positions under
            this paragraph, the Secretary shall give priority to—
            (i) hospitals that—
                (I) are located in a State with a resident-to-population
                    ratio in the lowest quartile;
                (II) are located in a rural area or serve a high
                    percentage of medically underserved populations; or
                (III) emphasize training in primary care, geriatrics,
                    psychiatry, or other shortage specialties;
            (ii) hospitals that demonstrate a commitment to training
                residents in community-based settings;
            (iii) hospitals that have a record of placing graduates in
                underserved areas.

        (C) SPECIALTY REQUIREMENTS.—Of the positions distributed under
            this paragraph—
            (i) at least 50 percent shall be in primary care residency
                programs (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics,
                combined internal medicine-pediatrics, and geriatrics);
            (ii) at least 10 percent shall be in psychiatry residency
                programs; and
            (iii) at least 10 percent shall be in hospitals located in
                rural areas as defined by the Secretary.

        (D) ACCOUNTABILITY.—
            (i) REPORTING.—Hospitals receiving additional positions under
                this paragraph shall report annually to the Secretary on
                the number of residents trained, specialties, and
                practice locations of graduates.
            (ii) REALLOCATION.—The Secretary may reallocate positions from
                hospitals that fail to use them within 3 years."

SEC. 4. PRESERVATION OF TEACHING HEALTH CENTER GME.
(a) PERMANENT AUTHORIZATION.—Section 340H of the Public Health Service
    Act is amended to provide permanent authorization.

(b) INCREASED FUNDING.—The per-resident amount for Teaching Health
    Center GME shall be increased to $175,000 annually, adjusted for
    inflation.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This legislation adds 14,000 Medicare-funded residency positions over 7 years, prioritizing primary care, psychiatry, and underserved areas. It includes accountability measures to ensure positions are used effectively.

**Challenges**: CBO scoring will show billions in costs over 10 years; budget hawks will oppose; some specialty societies may resist primary care prioritization.

**Refinements**: Consider phased implementation; tie positions to specific accountability metrics; explore offsetting savings from improved health outcomes.

### Conrad State 30 Improvement and Extension Act

**Purpose**: Reauthorize and expand the Conrad 30 J-1 visa waiver program for physicians serving in underserved areas.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Conrad State 30 Improvement and Extension Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) international medical graduates constitute 25 percent of the
    physician workforce and disproportionately serve underserved areas;
(2) the Conrad State 30 program places approximately 1,500 physicians
    annually in Health Professional Shortage Areas;
(3) demand for Conrad waivers exceeds available slots in many States;
(4) physicians serving under Conrad waivers often remain in underserved
    areas after their service commitment;
(5) strengthening the Conrad program is essential to addressing
    geographic maldistribution of physicians.

SEC. 3. PERMANENT REAUTHORIZATION.
Section 220(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections
Act of 1994 is amended by striking "for each of fiscal years 2019
through 2021" and inserting "for each fiscal year".

SEC. 4. INCREASE IN NUMBER OF WAIVERS.
Section 214(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended—
(1) by striking "30" each place it appears and inserting "50"; and
(2) by adding at the end: "In addition to the State allocations, the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services may approve up to 200 additional
    waivers nationally for physicians who agree to practice in facilities
    designated by the Secretary as having exceptional need."

SEC. 5. DUAL INTENT.
A physician petitioning for a J-1 visa for graduate medical education
shall not be denied solely on the basis that the physician intends to
seek permanent residence in the United States following completion of
training.

SEC. 6. PORTABILITY.
(a) A physician serving under a Conrad waiver may transfer to a different
    underserved site without loss of credit toward the service requirement,
    provided the new site also qualifies as an underserved area.

Physicians who have completed 5 years of practice in a Health Professional
Shortage Area shall be eligible for expedited adjustment of status,
exempt from any annual per-country limitations.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This legislation permanently reauthorizes Conrad 30, increases the per-state allocation from 30 to 50 waivers, adds a federal pool, and creates clearer pathways to permanent residence for physicians who serve in shortage areas.

**Challenges**: Immigration politics are contentious; broader immigration reform may be required for some provisions; processing capacity limitations.

**Refinements**: Could be paired with increased USCIS resources; could include employer sponsorship requirements; could add continuing service incentives.

(2) debt burden influences specialty and geographic practice choices;
(3) the National Health Service Corps places over 13,000 clinicians in
    underserved areas but is limited by funding;
(4) existing loan repayment amounts are often insufficient to offset
    income differences between underserved and other areas;
(5) expanding loan repayment is among the most cost-effective
    interventions to address geographic maldistribution.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS ENHANCEMENT.
(a) INCREASED MAXIMUM REPAYMENT.—Section 338B(g)(2) of the Public Health
    Service Act is amended by striking "$50,000" and inserting "$125,000"

## Regulatory Framework

### CMS Graduate Medical Education Regulations

**Authority**: Social Security Act, Section 1886(h)

**Key Regulatory Requirements**:

1. **Residency Position Allocation**
   - Process for distributing new positions under expansion legislation
   - Priority criteria for shortage specialties and underserved areas
   - Application and accountability requirements

2. **Teaching Health Center GME**
   - Per-resident payment amounts and adjustments
   - Eligible site definitions
   - Reporting and oversight requirements

3. **Indirect Medical Education Adjustment**
   - Calculation methodology
   - Quality measures for IME payment

**Implementation Timeline**: Major GME regulations typically require 18-24 months from proposed rule to implementation.

### HRSA Workforce Program Regulations

**Authority**: Public Health Service Act

**Key Programs**:

1. **National Health Service Corps**
   - Loan repayment and scholarship program rules
   - Site eligibility and approval
   - Service commitment requirements
   - Breach and penalty provisions

2. **Area Health Education Centers**
   - Program requirements
   - Funding allocation
   - Performance measures

3. **Health Professions Training Grants**
   - Primary care training
   - Graduate psychology education
   - Nursing workforce development

### DEA Prescriptive Authority Regulations

**Authority**: Controlled Substances Act

**Requirements for APRNs and PAs**:
- Individual DEA registration
- State law authorization
- Supervision requirements (if any under state law)
- Prescribing limitations

**Reform Opportunity**: Align DEA requirements with state scope of practice laws; streamline registration for authorized prescribers.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause**:
- Federal regulation of healthcare professions established
- Medical education has substantial interstate commerce effects
- Preemption of state scope of practice laws requires careful drafting

**Spending Clause**:
- Conditions on federal funding well-established
- Cannot be coercive (per *NFIB v. Sebelius*)
- Scope of practice conditions on Medicare participation likely permissible

**Tenth Amendment**:
- Professional licensing traditionally state function
- Federal standards in federal programs do not commandeer states
- Preemption of state law in federal programs more defensible than general preemption

### Preemption Analysis

**Current Preemption**:
- ERISA preempts some state health regulation
- McCarran-Ferguson reserves insurance to states
- No comprehensive federal preemption of scope of practice

**Proposed Preemption (Full Practice Authority Act)**:
- Limited to federal programs and federally-funded patients
- Does not prohibit state action in purely state-regulated contexts
- Savings clause preserves state authority to be more permissive

**Risk**: Broad preemption could face legal challenge; targeted approach more defensible.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**GME Expansion**:
- CMS conditions of participation
- Audit and oversight
- Position reallocation for non-compliance

**Scope of Practice**:
- Conditions on federal program participation
- Federal facility requirements (VA, IHS)
- Provider enrollment conditions (Medicare, Medicaid)

**Loan Repayment**:
- Service commitment enforcement
- Breach penalties
- Recruitment and retention bonuses

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Position warehousing | Hospitals could claim new GME positions without fully using them | High |
| Specialty drift | Positions designated for primary care could shift to specialties | High |
| Geographic evasion | Hospitals could claim underserved status inappropriately | Medium |
| Supervision workarounds | States could create alternative barriers to NP/PA practice | High |
| J-1 waiver gaming | Employers could cycle through waiver physicians without retention | Medium |
| Loan repayment arbitrage | Practitioners could complete minimum service then leave | Medium |
| Compact non-participation | States could join compact but create administrative barriers | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Long pipeline delays | GME expansion takes 7-10 years to produce practicing physicians | Inherent training length |
| Insufficient appropriations | Authorization does not guarantee funding for programs | Appropriations process separate from authorization |
| State-by-state scope battles | Federal legislation may not pass; state progress slow | Federalism and physician opposition |
| IMG barriers beyond Conrad | Broader immigration system problems not addressed | Immigration reform beyond healthcare scope |
| Faculty shortage unaddressed | Nursing expansion limited by faculty even with funding | Salary disparities and career path issues |
| Rural economics unchanged | Payment incentives insufficient to overcome rural practice challenges | Broader rural economic issues |
| Burnout root causes remain | Administrative burden and workload issues not fully addressed | Systemic healthcare delivery problems |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Position warehousing**: Require demonstrated use within 3 years or reallocation; annual reporting of resident counts and graduation; penalties for unfilled positions.

2. **Specialty drift**: Tie GME payments to specialty at entry; require maintenance of specialty distribution for 10 years; audit specialty designations.

3. **Geographic evasion**: Use objective HPSA criteria; regular reverification of underserved status; site visits for high-risk applicants.

4. **Supervision workarounds**: Federal legislation should explicitly address supervision, collaboration, and chart review requirements; define "full practice authority" precisely; provide federal enforcement mechanism.

5. **J-1 waiver gaming**: Extend minimum service commitment; require retention data reporting; prioritize employers with retention track records.

6. **Loan repayment arbitrage**: Create graduated incentives for longer service; offer retention bonuses; track post-service practice location.

7. **Compact non-participation**: Uniform compact rules administered by commission; federal backup for non-participating states; tie to telehealth reimbursement.

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Administrative Capacity**: HRSA and CMS must scale to administer expanded programs; include administrative funding in legislation.

- **Workforce Monitoring**: National Health Care Workforce Commission should be funded to provide ongoing assessment; create early warning system for emerging shortages.

- **Coordination**: Multiple agencies (CMS, HRSA, DHS, DOL) must coordinate; designate lead agency for workforce policy.

- **Political Durability**: Legislation should create difficult-to-reverse entitlements; engage bipartisan coalition; demonstrate outcomes.

- **State Partnership**: Federal-state collaboration essential for scope of practice, licensure, and training site development; create incentives for state action.
