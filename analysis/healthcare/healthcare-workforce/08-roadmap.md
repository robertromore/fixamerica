# Healthcare Workforce: Roadmap

## Implementation Strategy

Healthcare workforce reform requires a phased approach that addresses immediate needs while building toward long-term structural change.

## Risk Factors and Contingencies

### Political Risks

**Change in Administration**:
- Regulatory actions could be reversed
- Appropriations subject to political priorities
- State scope of practice battles continue regardless

**Mitigation**: Pursue legislation over regulation where possible; build bipartisan coalitions.

### Implementation Risks

**Training Capacity Lag**:
- New residency programs take years to develop
- Faculty shortages could limit expansion
- Clinical training sites may be insufficient

**Mitigation**: Fund planning grants; accelerate accreditation; invest in simulation.

### Financial Risks

**Budget Constraints**:
- Deficit concerns could limit appropriations
- GME expansion repeatedly stalls on cost
- State budgets under pressure

**Mitigation**: Emphasize return on investment; find offsets; private sector engagement.
