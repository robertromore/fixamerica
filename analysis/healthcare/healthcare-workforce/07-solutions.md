# Healthcare Workforce: Solutions

## Solution Framework

Addressing the healthcare workforce crisis requires coordinated interventions across multiple domains: expanding training capacity, improving geographic distribution, reducing burnout and improving retention, reforming scope of practice, and restructuring payment incentives. No single solution is sufficient; comprehensive reform requires action on multiple fronts simultaneously.

## Expand Training Capacity

### Lift the Medicare GME Cap

**Solution**: Remove or substantially increase the 1997 cap on Medicare-funded residency positions.

**Mechanism**:
- Add 15,000-25,000 new Medicare-funded residency positions over 10 years
- Prioritize primary care, psychiatry, and shortage specialties
- Require geographic distribution toward underserved areas
- Tie new positions to community-based training sites

**Evidence**:
- Each new residency position produces one physician who practices for 30+ years
- Cost-effective compared to alternatives
- 2020 legislation added 1,000 positions; expansion is politically feasible

**Implementation**: Federal legislation required; see [Legislation](11-legislation.md).

**Impact**: Could address 10-20% of projected shortage if focused on high-need specialties.

### Expand Nursing Education Capacity

**Solution**: Address nursing faculty shortage to unlock nursing school capacity.

**Mechanisms**:
- Loan forgiveness for nurses pursuing doctoral/faculty credentials
- Salary supplements for nursing faculty
- Bridge programs from clinical to academic careers
- Expand clinical training site capacity
- Invest in simulation-based training

**Evidence**:
- 91,938 qualified applicants turned away annually
- Faculty salary gap is primary barrier
- Simulation can substitute for some clinical hours

**Implementation**: Federal grant programs; state investment in nursing schools.

**Impact**: Could increase nursing graduate output 20-30% within 5 years.

### Accelerated Training Programs

**Solution**: Create pathways for faster entry into healthcare professions without compromising quality.

**Mechanisms**:
- 3-year MD programs (combined undergraduate/medical)
- Accelerated BSN programs for career changers
- Expanded LPN-to-RN bridge programs
- Competency-based advancement in residency
- Military-to-civilian training recognition

**Evidence**:
- NYU and other schools piloting 3-year MD programs
- Accelerated BSN programs successful for career changers
- Competency-based models used internationally

**Trade-offs**: Must maintain quality standards; not all trainees suitable for acceleration.

## Improve Geographic Distribution

### Strengthen Loan Repayment Programs

**Solution**: Expand and enhance loan repayment for practice in underserved areas.

**Mechanisms**:
- Increase National Health Service Corps funding
- Raise maximum loan repayment amounts to match actual debt
- Extend service commitment options (longer service = more forgiveness)
- Create state-federal matching programs
- Tax-exempt loan forgiveness (currently taxable for some programs)

**Evidence**:
- NHSC places 13,000+ clinicians in underserved areas
- Loan repayment more effective than scholarships for retention
- Current amounts often insufficient to offset income differential

**Implementation**: Increased appropriations; tax code changes.

**Impact**: Targeted intervention that directly addresses geographic maldistribution.

### Teaching Health Center Expansion

**Solution**: Shift residency training from academic medical centers to community-based sites.

**Mechanisms**:
- Increase Teaching Health Center GME (THCGME) funding
- Create residency programs in FQHCs, rural health centers
- Train residents where they are needed (they often stay)
- Integrate with NHSC for combined incentives

**Evidence**:
- THCGME residents more likely to practice in underserved areas
- Community-based training produces community-oriented physicians
- Model successfully demonstrated but chronically underfunded

**Implementation**: Federal funding stability for THCGME; expand eligible sites.

### Rural Training Tracks

**Solution**: Create dedicated rural training pathways within existing residency programs.

**Mechanisms**:
- Rural training tracks (1-2 years of residency in rural setting)
- Rural-specific curriculum and faculty
- Telehealth integration in training
- Recruitment from rural backgrounds

**Evidence**:
- Rural origin is strongest predictor of rural practice
- Rural training track graduates 70%+ likely to practice rurally
- Programs exist but are not systematically funded

**Implementation**: GME policy changes; incentive payments for rural tracks.

### Behavioral Health Crisis Response Workforce

**Solution**: Build a dedicated workforce for mental health crisis response outside traditional healthcare and law enforcement settings.

**Mechanisms**:

1. **Mobile Crisis Team Workforce Needs**
   - Crisis intervention specialists (licensed clinicians)
   - Behavioral health technicians
   - Emergency medical technicians with behavioral health training
   - Peer support specialists with lived experience
   - Team composition: 2-person teams (clinician + peer or EMT + clinician)
   - Estimated need: 50,000+ new crisis workers nationally

2. **988 Call Center Specialists**
   - Crisis counselors for phone/text/chat
   - Specialized training in suicide intervention
   - Follow-up care coordinators
   - Dispatch coordinators for mobile teams
   - Current gap: thousands of positions unfilled
   - High burnout requires robust pipeline

3. **Community College Training Programs**
   - Behavioral health technician certificates (6-12 months)
   - Crisis intervention specialist associate degrees
   - Peer support specialist certification
   - EMT-behavioral health cross-training
   - Partnerships with crisis centers for clinical training
   - Stackable credentials toward bachelor's degrees

4. **Rapid Workforce Development Strategies**
   - Apprenticeship models for crisis work
   - Incumbent worker upskilling (EMTs, 911 dispatchers)
   - Veterans transition programs (crisis management skills)
   - Career pathways from entry-level to licensed clinician
   - Loan forgiveness for crisis workforce positions

**Workforce Pipeline**:

| Role | Training Time | Credential | Entry Salary |
|------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Peer Support Specialist | 75-100 hours | State certification | $35-45K |
| Behavioral Health Technician | 6-12 months | Certificate | $40-50K |
| Crisis Intervention Specialist | 2 years | Associate degree | $50-65K |
| Mobile Crisis Clinician | 6 years | Master's + license | $60-80K |

**Evidence**: Eugene CAHOOTS program operates with non-licensed crisis workers at 1/10th the cost of police response. Peer support integration improves outcomes and reduces repeat crises.

**Challenges**: Compensation below law enforcement; high burnout in crisis work; licensure barriers for non-traditional roles; funding uncertainty discourages career entry.

**Cross-Domain Connection**: The behavioral health crisis workforce is essential to alternatives to police response for mental health emergencies. For analysis of why police currently serve as default mental health responders and the infrastructure gaps that created this situation, see [Justice: Mental Health Crisis - Root Causes](../../justice/mental-health-crisis/04-root-causes.md). For implementation of these workers in crisis response systems, see [Healthcare: Mental Health Integration - Solutions](../mental-health-integration/07-solutions.md).
