# Insurance Markets: History

## Historical Development

### Origins of Health Insurance (1920s-1940s)

- **1929**: Baylor Hospital prepaid plan (precursor to Blue Cross)
- **1930s**: Hospital and physician prepaid plans spread during Depression
- **1942**: War Labor Board exempts health benefits from wage controls
- **1943**: IRS rules employer health contributions tax-exempt
- **1945**: McCarran-Ferguson Act reserves insurance regulation to states
- **1947**: Taft-Hartley Act enables union health funds

The tax exemption created an enduring preference for employer-sponsored coverage that shapes the market to this day.

### Employer Market Dominance (1950s-1970s)

- **1950s**: Employer coverage expands rapidly (from 9% to 63% of population)
- **1954**: Tax code formally enshrines employer premium exclusion
- **1965**: Medicare and Medicaid created for elderly and poor
- **1973**: HMO Act promotes managed care development
- **1974**: ERISA establishes federal regulation of employer plans, preempts state law

By the mid-1970s, the basic structure was set: employer coverage for workers, government programs for elderly and poor, individual market as residual.

### Managed Care Era (1980s-1990s)

- **1980s**: HMO enrollment grows from 9 million to 33 million
- **1985**: COBRA requires continuation coverage
- **1993**: Clinton health reform fails
- **1996**: HIPAA provides portability protections
- **1990s**: Managed care backlash; PPO model becomes dominant
- **1997**: CHIP expands children's coverage

Managed care promised cost control but generated consumer backlash over restricted access.

### Individual Market Crisis (1990s-2000s)

- Pre-existing condition exclusions left millions uninsurable
- Medical underwriting meant sick individuals paid more or were denied
- Rescission (policy cancellation when sick) was common practice
- Individual market served only healthy people who could pass screening
- Small group market experienced severe adverse selection and rate volatility

### ACA Transformation (2010-Present)

**2010**: Affordable Care Act enacted

Key market reforms:

- Guaranteed issue (no denial for pre-existing conditions)
- Community rating (no health-based pricing)
- Essential health benefits requirements
- Individual mandate (penalty for uninsured)
- Premium tax credits (subsidies for low/moderate income)
- Medicaid expansion to 138% FPL
- Insurance exchanges for individual and small group markets

**2010-2013**: Implementation phase

- Early provisions (young adult coverage, preventive care)
- Exchange development
- State decisions on Medicaid expansion

**2014**: Major provisions take effect

- Exchanges open for enrollment
- Individual mandate effective
- Medicaid expansion (in participating states)
- Pre-existing condition protections fully implemented

**2017-2020**: Destabilization attempts

- Failed ACA repeal attempts
- Individual mandate penalty zeroed (effective 2019)
- Cost-sharing reduction payments terminated
- Short-term plan expansion
- Association health plan expansion (later blocked by courts)

**2021-Present**: Stabilization and enhancement

- American Rescue Plan enhanced subsidies (2021)
- Inflation Reduction Act extended subsidies through 2025
- Record enrollment (20+ million in 2024)
- Most markets stabilized with multiple insurers

## Key Turning Points

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1942-43 | Tax exemption for employer coverage | Established ESI dominance |
| 1974 | ERISA enactment | Preempted state regulation of employer plans |
| 2010 | ACA passage | Transformed individual market |
| 2012 | *NFIB v. Sebelius* | Made Medicaid expansion optional |
| 2017 | Mandate penalty zeroed | Weakened risk pool enforcement |
| 2021 | ARP subsidy enhancement | Made marketplace coverage affordable |

## Lessons from History

1. **Tax policy shapes markets**: The employer coverage tax exclusion created a system that persists despite policy changes

2. **Federal preemption limits state innovation**: ERISA prevents states from comprehensively regulating employer coverage

3. **Individual markets require regulation**: Unregulated individual markets fail due to adverse selection and discrimination

4. **Subsidies are essential**: Individual market only works with adequate subsidies for low/moderate income

5. **Political vulnerability persists**: ACA remains target of repeal efforts; stability depends on political support

6. **Consolidation is self-reinforcing**: Market concentration has increased despite regulatory frameworks
