# Insurance Markets

Health insurance markets in the United States are a complex patchwork of employer-sponsored coverage, individual market plans, government programs, and the uninsured. The Affordable Care Act transformed the individual market through exchanges, essential health benefits requirements, and premium subsidies, yet significant challenges remain. Approximately 156 million Americans receive coverage through employers, while 20 million purchase individual market plans, and millions more cycle between coverage types as their circumstances change. Market fragmentation, consolidation among insurers and providers, and ongoing regulatory battles continue to shape access, affordability, and quality of coverage.
