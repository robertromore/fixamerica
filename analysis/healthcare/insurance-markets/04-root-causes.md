# Insurance Markets: Root Causes

## Why Insurance Market Problems Persist

### Structural Design Flaws

**Fragmented Coverage System**

The U.S. has no coherent health insurance system, but rather multiple overlapping markets:

- Employer large group
- Employer small group
- Individual (ACA-compliant)
- Individual (non-ACA)
- Medicare
- Medicaid
- Military/VA
- Uninsured

This fragmentation causes:

- Administrative complexity (multiple eligibility rules, enrollment periods)
- Coverage transitions (gaps when changing jobs, income, age)
- Risk segmentation (healthy vs. sick pooled separately)
- Bargaining power imbalance (larger groups get better rates)

**Tax Treatment Distortions**

Employer-paid premiums are tax-free while individual coverage is (mostly) purchased with after-tax dollars:

- Creates 30-40% cost advantage for employer coverage
- Ties coverage to employment
- Encourages overinsurance for high-income workers
- Forgoes $300+ billion annually in potential tax revenue
- Regressive (benefits high-income more than low-income)

**ERISA Preemption**

Federal law preempts state regulation of self-insured employer plans:

- 64% of covered workers in self-insured plans beyond state reach
- States cannot mandate benefits for these plans
- States cannot regulate claims practices
- Creates two-tier regulatory system
- Limits state innovation

### Market Failure Dynamics

**Adverse Selection**

Without mandatory participation and subsidies:

- Healthy people opt out (premiums exceed expected costs)
- Risk pool becomes sicker
- Premiums rise, more healthy people leave
- "Death spiral" threatens market stability

The ACA addressed this with mandate/subsidies, but mandate repeal weakened enforcement.

**Information Asymmetry**

- Insurers cannot perfectly assess risk
- Consumers cannot evaluate plan quality
- Provider quality information inadequate
- Price information unavailable at point of decision
- Creates market inefficiencies and gaming

**Principal-Agent Problems**

- Employers choose plans, not employees
- Insurers profit by denying claims
- Providers profit by providing more care
- PBMs profit from opaque pricing
- Misaligned incentives throughout

### Consolidation Dynamics

**Insurer Consolidation Drivers**

- Economies of scale in administration
- Negotiating leverage with providers
- Regulatory compliance costs favor large players
- Acquisition of competitors
- Vertical integration opportunities

**Provider Consolidation Response**

- Hospitals merge for bargaining power vs. insurers
- Physician practices consolidate or join health systems
- Provider market power enables price increases
- Creates bilateral monopoly dynamics

**Self-Reinforcing Cycle**

```text
Insurer consolidation → Provider consolidation →
Higher prices → Higher premiums →
Fewer competitors → More consolidation
```

### Regulatory Capture and Political Economy

**Insurance Industry Influence**

- $174 million annual lobbying by health insurers
- Campaign contributions to key legislators
- Revolving door between industry and regulators
- Favorable regulatory interpretations
- Resistance to public option or stronger regulation

**Provider Industry Influence**

- Hospital and physician lobbying
- Opposition to payment rate regulation
- Protection of facility fees and specialty payments
- Resistance to antitrust enforcement

**Regulatory Fragmentation**

- Multiple federal agencies with partial authority
- State regulation limited by ERISA
- No single regulator for comprehensive oversight
- Gaps and inconsistencies exploited

### Ideological Constraints

**Market Fundamentalism**

- Belief that competition alone can solve healthcare market problems
- Resistance to rate regulation or price controls
- Opposition to government-provided insurance
- Ignores healthcare's unique market characteristics

**Employer Coverage Attachment**

- "If you like your plan, you can keep it" constrains reform
- Disrupting employer coverage politically toxic
- Incremental reforms preserve ESI system
- Prevents comprehensive restructuring

### Unique Healthcare Market Characteristics

**Why Standard Markets Don't Work**

| Market Condition | Standard Market | Healthcare |
|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Information | Buyers informed | Patients lack expertise |
| Demand | Price-elastic | Often inelastic (need care) |
| Competition | Many sellers | Local monopolies common |
| Product | Standardized | Heterogeneous, complex |
| Purchasing | Individual | Delegated to employers, insurers |
| Externalities | Limited | Significant (public health) |
| Financing | Pay at purchase | Insurance, tax subsidies |

These characteristics mean market-based solutions require substantial regulation and public intervention to function—yet political opposition limits such intervention.
