# Insurance Markets: Solutions

## Reform Framework

### Principles

- **Universal coverage as goal**: Every American should have affordable, adequate coverage
- **Risk pooling**: Broader pools are more stable and equitable
- **Affordability**: Coverage must be affordable for all income levels
- **Adequacy**: Benefits must be comprehensive enough to protect health and finances
- **Simplicity**: System should be navigable by ordinary people
- **Competition where useful**: Competition can drive efficiency where markets function

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Strengthen and Stabilize ACA Marketplace

**Description**: Make enhanced subsidies permanent, improve market stability, and close remaining gaps.

**Components**:

1. **Permanent subsidy enhancement**
   - Make American Rescue Plan subsidy levels permanent
   - Extend subsidies above 400% FPL (8.5% income cap)
   - Increase cost-sharing reductions for lower-income enrollees

2. **Market stabilization**
   - Federal reinsurance program
   - Auto-enrollment for subsidy-eligible tax filers
   - Continuous open enrollment for low-income
   - Strengthen navigator and outreach funding

3. **Plan quality improvements**
   - Standardized plan options for comparability
   - Enhanced network adequacy requirements
   - Prior authorization limits

**Evidence**: Markets with stable subsidy funding and reinsurance show lower premiums and more insurer participation. Enhanced subsidies reduced uninsured rate.

**Challenges**: Cost ($25-30 billion annually for permanent subsidies); political vulnerability; doesn't address employer market.

### Solution 2: Public Option

**Description**: Create a government-administered insurance plan competing with private insurers.

**Models**:

**Model A: Medicare-based Public Option**

- Use Medicare infrastructure and provider network
- Available on ACA exchanges
- Payment rates at Medicare + 10%
- No profit margin; lower admin costs

**Model B: Medicaid Buy-In**

- States offer Medicaid-like coverage to non-eligible populations
- Federally subsidized for low-income
- Leverages existing state infrastructure

**Model C: Federal Employee Plan Access**

- Open FEHB (federal employee) plans to public
- Competes on exchanges
- Uses existing private plan infrastructure

**Evidence**: State public option programs (WA, CO, NV) show early promise in reducing premiums. Medicare admin costs (2%) far below private (12-18%).

**Challenges**: Insurance industry opposition; provider payment adequacy concerns; implementation complexity; political feasibility.

### Solution 3: All-Payer Rate Setting

**Description**: Establish uniform payment rates across all payers for healthcare services.

**Components**:

1. **Rate-setting authority**
   - State or federal body sets payment rates
   - All payers (including insurers) pay same rates
   - Rates set through transparent process with stakeholder input

2. **Maryland model expansion**
   - Maryland has operated all-payer for hospitals since 1970s
   - Demonstrated cost control without quality reduction
   - Could expand to physician services, other states

3. **Price transparency enforcement**
   - Published rates for all services
   - Consumer access to pre-service estimates
   - Enforcement of price limits

**Evidence**: Maryland's system has controlled hospital cost growth below national average. International all-payer systems (Germany, France) achieve better outcomes at lower cost.

**Challenges**: Provider opposition; implementation complexity; political difficulty; federal waivers required.

### Solution 4: Insurance Market Regulation Reform

**Description**: Strengthen regulation to address market failures and protect consumers.

**Components**:

1. **Antitrust enforcement**
   - Block anticompetitive mergers
   - Challenge existing market concentration
   - Prohibit anticompetitive contract terms

2. **Network adequacy**
   - Strict standards for provider access
   - Enforcement with meaningful penalties
   - Secret shopper audits

3. **Prior authorization reform**
   - Limit scope of prior authorization
   - Require rapid decisions (24-72 hours)
   - Gold card programs for high-approval providers

4. **Transparency requirements**
   - Claims data disclosure
   - Price transparency enforcement
   - Quality reporting standardization

**Evidence**: States with stronger regulation show better consumer outcomes. Prior authorization delays harm patients and increase costs.

**Challenges**: ERISA limits state authority; industry opposition; enforcement capacity.

### Solution 5: Employer Market Reform

**Description**: Address the 156 million in employer coverage through structural reform.

**Components**:

1. **Tax exclusion reform**
   - Cap tax exclusion for high-cost plans
   - Make exclusion refundable for low-income
   - Phase toward parity with individual market

2. **Employer mandate strengthening**
   - Increase penalties for non-compliant employers
   - Expand small employer exemptions
   - Require minimum coverage standards

3. **Portability improvements**
   - Allow employees to take employer plans when leaving
   - Standardize cobra-like continuation
   - Enable employer contribution to individual market

**Evidence**: Capping tax exclusion would raise revenue, reduce overconsumption, and improve equity. Portability reduces coverage gaps during transitions.

**Challenges**: Employer opposition to tax changes; complexity of transition; political difficulty of touching employer coverage.

### Solution 6: Path to Universal Coverage

**Description**: Fundamental restructuring toward universal coverage system.

**Options**:

**Option A: Medicare for All**

- Single federal program for all residents
- Comprehensive benefits; no premiums or cost-sharing
- All providers participate
- Financed through progressive taxation

**Option B: Medicare for All Who Want It**

- Public option available to all
- Employer and individual choice to enroll
- Gradual transition as people choose public option
- Maintains private insurance market

**Option C: Regulated Multi-Payer**

- Universal mandate with subsidies
- Competing private plans with regulated benefits
- Global budgets or rate-setting for cost control
- Based on German/Swiss models

**Evidence**: Single-payer countries achieve universal coverage at lower cost. Regulated multi-payer (Germany, Switzerland) also achieves universality with multiple insurers.

**Challenges**: Political feasibility varies dramatically by approach; transition complexity; provider payment concerns; industry opposition.

## Sequencing

1. **Immediate**: Permanent subsidy enhancement; prior auth reform; transparency enforcement
2. **Near-term**: Public option creation; antitrust action; network adequacy enforcement
3. **Medium-term**: All-payer pilots; tax exclusion reform; employer market changes
4. **Long-term**: Universal coverage (Medicare for All or regulated multi-payer)
