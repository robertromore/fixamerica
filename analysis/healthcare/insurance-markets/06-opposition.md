## Opposition Arguments

### Against Public Option

| Argument | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|------------------|
| "Government takeover" | Public option competes alongside private plans |
| "Unfair competition" | Private plans compete with Medicare now; fairness depends on rules |
| "Provider underpayment" | Payment rates can be set appropriately |
| "Crowd out private innovation" | Medicare has driven innovations; competition may improve private plans |
| "Administrative inefficiency" | Medicare has lower admin costs than private insurance |

### Against Single-Payer

| Argument | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|------------------|
| "Eliminates choice" | Eliminates insurer choice; expands provider choice |
| "Rationing and wait times" | Current system rations by ability to pay |
| "Massive tax increases" | Replaces premiums, deductibles, copays |
| "Job losses" | Transition support needed; net jobs uncertain |
| "Innovation decline" | Other countries innovate; NIH funding separate issue |

### Against ACA/Market Regulation

| Argument | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|------------------|
| "Premium increases" | Premiums grew slower than pre-ACA; subsidies control costs for most |
| "Reduced choice" | Most markets have multiple insurers; pre-ACA individual market was failing |
| "Mandate is unconstitutional" | Supreme Court upheld as tax; penalty now zeroed anyway |
| "Federal overreach" | States have flexibility; federal floor necessary for portability |
