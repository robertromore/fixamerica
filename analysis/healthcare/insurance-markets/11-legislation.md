# Insurance Markets: Legislation

## Overview

Insurance market reform requires federal legislation to stabilize and enhance the ACA marketplace, create public alternatives, address consolidation, and ultimately achieve universal coverage. This legislative strategy builds on existing law while pursuing structural improvements.

## Constitutional Considerations

Congress has clear authority to regulate insurance markets under the Commerce Clause and Taxing and Spending Clause, as affirmed in *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012). The ACA's regulatory framework has survived multiple legal challenges. State regulation of insurance is preserved under McCarran-Ferguson but subject to federal preemption where Congress acts. ERISA preemption of state regulation of self-insured employer plans remains a constraint on state innovation.

## Federal Legislation

### Permanent ACA Enhancement Act

**Purpose**: Make enhanced premium subsidies permanent, expand cost-sharing reductions, and permanently stabilize the marketplace.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Permanent ACA Enhancement Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) the American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act subsidy
    enhancements have reduced uninsured rates to historic lows;
(2) marketplace enrollment has reached record levels (20+ million);
(3) temporary subsidies create uncertainty for consumers and insurers;
(4) permanent stabilization will improve market function and coverage.

SEC. 3. PERMANENT PREMIUM TAX CREDITS.
(a) ENHANCED PERCENTAGES.—Section 36B(b)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue
    Code is amended to make permanent the applicable percentage table
    established under the American Rescue Plan Act, with no household
    required to pay more than 8.5 percent of income for the benchmark plan.

(b) REMOVAL OF INCOME CAP.—Section 36B(c)(1)(A) is amended by striking
    "but does not exceed 400 percent" and inserting "regardless of
    the upper limit".

(c) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made by this section apply to
    taxable years beginning after December 31 following enactment.

SEC. 4. ENHANCED COST-SHARING REDUCTIONS.
(a) Section 1402 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
    is amended to—
    (1) increase cost-sharing reduction amounts for individuals with
        income below 200 percent of poverty to achieve 95% actuarial value;
    (2) extend cost-sharing reductions to individuals between 200 and
        250 percent of poverty at 85% actuarial value.

(b) APPROPRIATIONS.—There are hereby appropriated such sums as are
    necessary for cost-sharing reduction payments.

SEC. 5. MARKETPLACE STABILIZATION.
(a) FEDERAL REINSURANCE.—The Secretary shall establish a permanent
    federal reinsurance program for individual market plans.

(b) NAVIGATOR FUNDING.—There are authorized to be appropriated
    $500,000,000 annually for Navigator programs.

(c) CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT.—Individuals with income below 200 percent
    of poverty may enroll in marketplace coverage at any time.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect on January 1 following enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This bill makes the popular and effective subsidy enhancements permanent, ending the cycle of temporary extensions. It also strengthens cost-sharing reductions for lower-income enrollees and establishes permanent stabilization mechanisms.

**Challenges**: Cost ($25-30 billion annually); political vulnerability to repeal; doesn't address employer market.

**Refinements**: Consider indexing subsidies to healthcare cost growth; add auto-enrollment provisions; strengthen navigator requirements.

### Public Health Insurance Option Act

**Purpose**: Create a federally administered public option available on ACA exchanges and to employers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Public Health Insurance Option Act".

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT.
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
    establish a public health insurance option (the "Public Option")
    to be offered on exchanges established under the ACA beginning
    with the plan year two years after enactment.

(b) ADMINISTRATION.—The Public Option shall be administered by the
    Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

SEC. 3. BENEFITS.
(a) The Public Option shall provide at minimum—
    (1) essential health benefits as defined in section 1302(b) of
        the ACA;
    (2) coverage of all services covered by Medicare Parts A and B;
    (3) prescription drug coverage;
    (4) dental, vision, and hearing services.

(b) METAL LEVELS.—The Public Option shall be offered at Silver
    and Gold actuarial value levels.

SEC. 4. PREMIUMS AND COST-SHARING.
(a) PREMIUMS.—Premiums shall be set to cover the cost of benefits
    and administration, without profit margin, reserve requirements
    typical of private insurers, or shareholder return.

(b) COST-SHARING.—Cost-sharing shall comply with ACA requirements
    for the applicable metal level.

SEC. 5. PROVIDER PARTICIPATION.
(a) INITIAL PARTICIPATION.—For the first three years, any provider
    participating in Medicare shall participate in the Public Option
    unless affirmatively opting out in writing.

(b) ONGOING PARTICIPATION.—After three years, provider participation
    shall be voluntary.

(c) ANTI-RETALIATION.—No provider may be penalized by private
    insurers for participating in the Public Option.

SEC. 6. PAYMENT RATES.
(a) INITIAL RATES.—For the first five years, payment rates shall be
    Medicare rates plus 5 percent.

(b) SUBSEQUENT RATES.—After five years, the Secretary shall set
    rates through negotiation with providers, not to exceed 110
    percent of Medicare rates.

SEC. 7. EMPLOYER ACCESS.
(a) Employers may offer the Public Option as an employee benefit.

(b) Employer contributions shall receive equivalent tax treatment
    as contributions for private insurance.

(c) Employers choosing the Public Option satisfy any employer
    mandate requirements.

SEC. 8. FEDERAL EMPLOYEE ACCESS.
Federal employees shall have the option to enroll in the Public
Option through the FEHB program.

(c) ONGOING FINANCING.—Premium revenue shall sustain ongoing operations.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.
The Public Option shall be available for enrollment beginning with
the plan year two years after enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This bill creates a government-run insurance option that competes with private plans on ACA exchanges. Using Medicare infrastructure and provider networks, it offers lower administrative costs and serves as a benchmark for private plans.

**Challenges**: Insurance industry opposition; provider payment adequacy concerns; potential adverse selection if only sick enrollees choose public option; implementation complexity.

**Refinements**: Consider risk adjustment between public and private plans; phase in employer access; establish transition assistance for affected insurance workers.

### Insurance Market Competition Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen antitrust enforcement and address consolidation in insurance and provider markets.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Insurance Market Competition Act".

SEC. 2. ENHANCED MERGER REVIEW.
(a) HEALTHCARE MERGER STANDARDS.—The Federal Trade Commission and
    Department of Justice shall apply heightened scrutiny to mergers
    in healthcare markets, presuming anticompetitive effect where—
    (1) the combined entity would have market share exceeding 30
        percent in any geographic market;
    (2) the merger would reduce the number of competitors to fewer
        than four in any market.

(b) NOTIFICATION THRESHOLD.—The Hart-Scott-Rodino notification
    threshold for healthcare transactions is reduced to $50 million.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITED PRACTICES.
(a) The following practices are prohibited in healthcare markets—
    (1) most-favored-nation clauses in provider contracts;
    (2) anti-steering provisions preventing insurers from directing
        patients to lower-cost providers;
    (3) gag clauses preventing price disclosure;
    (4) all-or-nothing contracting requiring insurers to include all
        facilities in a system.

(b) ENFORCEMENT.—Violations are subject to civil penalties of up to
    $1,000,000 per violation and injunctive relief.

SEC. 4. MCCARRAN-FERGUSON REFORM.
(a) The McCarran-Ferguson Act (15 U.S.C. § 1011 et seq.) is amended
    to provide that the antitrust laws apply to the business of
    health insurance.

(b) State regulation of insurance otherwise remains in effect.

SEC. 5. FTC AUTHORITY.
(a) The Federal Trade Commission shall have authority to enforce

### Prior Authorization Reform Act

**Purpose**: Establish federal standards for prior authorization in all health insurance markets.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Prior Authorization Reform Act".

SEC. 2. TIMELINE REQUIREMENTS.
(a) All health insurance issuers and group health plans shall
    process prior authorization requests within—
    (1) 24 hours for urgent requests;
    (2) 72 hours for non-urgent requests;
    (3) 24 hours for prescription drug requests.

(b) Failure to respond within the required timeline shall constitute
    approval for the duration of the treatment plan.

SEC. 3. TRANSPARENCY.
(a) PUBLIC REPORTING.—Issuers shall publicly report annually—
    (1) total prior authorization requests;
    (2) approval and denial rates by service category;
    (3) average processing times;
    (4) appeal rates and outcomes.

(b) PATIENT NOTIFICATION.—Patients shall be notified of prior
    authorization requirements before service delivery where possible.

SEC. 4. GOLD CARD PROGRAMS.
(a) Issuers shall establish gold card programs exempting providers
    from prior authorization for services where prior approval rate
    exceeds 90 percent.

(b) Gold card status shall be reviewed annually.

SEC. 7. PEER-TO-PEER REVIEW.
(a) Providers may request peer-to-peer review with a physician
    in the same specialty before denial.

(b) Peer-to-peer review shall occur within 24 hours of request.

SEC. 8. EXTERNAL REVIEW.
(a) Any denial upheld on internal appeal shall automatically proceed
    to independent external review.

(b) External review decisions are binding on the issuer.

SEC. 9. ERISA APPLICATION.

```

**Explanation**: Prior authorization is widely documented as a barrier to care that delays treatment and increases administrative burden. This bill establishes uniform federal standards across all insurance types, including ERISA plans normally exempt from state regulation.

**Challenges**: ERISA preemption issues; insurer opposition; enforcement complexity across regulatory jurisdictions.

## State Model Legislation

### State Public Option Act

**Purpose**: Create a state-administered public option where federal action is delayed.

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Public Option Act".

SECTION 2. ESTABLISHMENT.
The [State Insurance Commissioner/Health Authority] shall establish
a public health insurance option available to state residents not
eligible for Medicare or Medicaid.

SECTION 3. BENEFITS.
The public option shall provide essential health benefits as
defined by the ACA, plus [state-specific additions].

SECTION 4. PREMIUMS.
(a) Premiums shall cover benefits and administration without
    profit margin.
(b) Premium rates shall be filed with and approved by the
    [Insurance Commissioner].

SECTION 5. PROVIDER PARTICIPATION.
(a) All providers participating in Medicaid shall participate
    in the public option.
(b) Payment rates shall be set at [percentage] of Medicare rates.
(c) Providers may not charge balance bills to public option enrollees.

SECTION 6. EMPLOYER ACCESS.
Employers may offer the public option as an employee benefit.

SECTION 7. EXCHANGE AVAILABILITY.
The public option shall be offered on the state exchange and
eligible for ACA premium tax credits.

SECTION 8. WAIVER.
The [Governor/Insurance Commissioner] shall seek any federal
waivers necessary to implement this Act.

SECTION 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.
This Act takes effect [date], contingent on federal waiver approval.
```

**Variation notes**: States (WA, CO, NV) have enacted public option laws with different approaches. Federal Section 1332 waivers may be required. Provider payment rates are most contentious element.

## Regulatory Framework

### CMS Regulations

**Authority**: ACA, SSA, ERISA (through DOL coordination)

**Key regulatory areas**:

1. **Essential Health Benefits**
   - Benchmark plan selection
   - Coverage adequacy standards
   - Updates to required services

2. **Network Adequacy**
   - Time and distance standards
   - Provider-to-enrollee ratios
   - Specialty access requirements
   - Enforcement mechanisms

3. **Qualified Health Plans**
   - Certification standards
   - Rate review
   - Quality rating system

4. **Special Enrollment Periods**
   - Qualifying events
   - Verification requirements
   - Continuous coverage incentives

**Implementation timeline**: Major regulations require 12-24 months from proposed rule to full implementation.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

- **Commerce Clause**: Basis for insurance market regulation
- **Taxing and Spending**: Premium tax credits, penalties
- **Supremacy Clause**: Federal preemption of state law
- *NFIB v. Sebelius* affirmed ACA framework (with Medicaid expansion limitation)

### Preemption Issues

- **ERISA preemption**: Limits state regulation of self-insured employer plans
- **McCarran-Ferguson**: Preserves state insurance regulation absent federal action
- **ACA preemption**: Federal floor; states may exceed but not undercut

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- CMS enforcement of exchange and QHP requirements
- State insurance commissioner enforcement of market rules
- DOL enforcement of ERISA requirements
- Private right of action for coverage denials
- FTC/DOJ antitrust enforcement

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| ERISA preemption | Self-insured employer plans escape state regulation | High |
| Public option adverse selection | Sickest patients concentrate in public option | High |
| Provider opt-out | Providers refuse public option at allowed rates | Medium |
| Short-term plan expansion | Non-ACA plans siphon healthy enrollees | High |
| Network adequacy gaming | Technical compliance without real access | Medium |
| Prior auth workarounds | Shift denials to other mechanisms | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Employer coverage untouched | 156 million in fragmented system | Political difficulty of reform |
| Tax exclusion preserved | Regressive, distorts markets | Entrenched benefit |
| Incremental approach | Preserves complexity | Political constraints |
| Voluntary public option | May not achieve universal coverage | Opposition to mandate |
| Consolidation continues | Market power persists | Weak enforcement history |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **ERISA preemption**: Include explicit ERISA override in prior authorization and network adequacy legislation; expand federal standards that apply to all plans; explore constitutional limits of preemption

2. **Public option adverse selection**: Implement robust risk adjustment between public and private plans; ensure public option available in all metal tiers; prohibit private plan benefit designs that discourage sick enrollees

3. **Provider opt-out**: Tie Medicare participation to public option participation; set payment rates adequately (Medicare + 5-10%); monitor access and adjust rates as needed

4. **Short-term plan expansion**: Statutory limits on duration (90 days, non-renewable); require disclosure of limitations; prohibit marketing as comprehensive coverage

5. **Network adequacy gaming**: Require appointment availability testing (not just contracted providers); secret shopper audits; tie adequacy to actual claims showing in-network utilization

6. **Prior auth workarounds**: Define all forms of utilization management; require approval rates within acceptable ranges; automatic external review for patterns of denial

### General Implementation Concerns

- **CMS capacity**: Agency needs expanded resources for new responsibilities
- **State variation**: Implementation quality varies across states
- **Political durability**: Reforms vulnerable to future administration changes
- **Transition disruption**: Changes affect millions; requires careful management
- **Unintended consequences**: Market changes may have unexpected effects
