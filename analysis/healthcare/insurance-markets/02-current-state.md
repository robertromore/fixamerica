## Market Structure

- Physician practice consolidation accelerating
- Consolidated providers command 20-40% higher prices
- "Must-have" systems dictate terms to insurers

### PBM Consolidation

- Top 3 PBMs (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx) control 80% of market
- Vertical integration with insurers
- Opaque pricing and rebate structures
- Significant impact on drug costs and access

## Coverage Adequacy

### Underinsurance

**Criteria**: High deductibles relative to income; out-of-pocket costs exceeding 10% of income

| Population | Underinsured Rate |
|------------|-------------------|
| All insured adults | 23% |
| Employer coverage | 18% |
| Individual market | 31% |
| Low-income (<200% FPL) | 42% |

### Coverage Gaps

- **Network adequacy**: Narrow networks limit provider choice
- **Prior authorization**: Delays and denials for needed care
- **Prescription coverage**: Formulary restrictions; high specialty drug costs
- **Mental health**: Parity violations; provider shortages
- **Maternity**: Variable coverage quality

### Affordability Crisis

- 46% of adults report difficulty affording healthcare
- 38% delayed or skipped care due to cost
- Medical debt affects 100 million Americans
- Bankruptcy filings cite medical bills as contributing factor

## Regulatory Landscape

### Federal Regulation

- **CMS**: Exchange oversight, essential health benefits, rate review
- **DOL**: ERISA plans (employer self-insured)
- **Treasury/IRS**: Tax treatment of premiums and HSAs
- **FTC**: Antitrust enforcement (limited in healthcare)

### State Regulation

- Insurance department oversight of fully-insured plans
- Rate review and approval
- Network adequacy standards
- Consumer protection enforcement
- ERISA preemption limits state authority over self-insured plans

### Current Regulatory Issues

- ACA preventive care mandate (under legal challenge)
- Short-term plan expansion
- Association health plans
- Individual coverage HRAs
- Section 1332 waivers

## Market Instability Factors

### Political Uncertainty

- ACA repeal attempts continue
- Subsidy funding subject to annual budget process
- Administration changes affect enforcement
- Court challenges to various provisions

### Risk Pool Concerns

- Healthy individuals may exit for non-ACA plans
- Adverse selection in some markets
- Reinsurance (state-based) mitigates but doesn't eliminate
- Individual mandate effectively eliminated (penalty zeroed)

### Insurer Behavior

- Carriers exit unprofitable markets
- Product design to attract healthier enrollees
- Prior authorization expansion
- Narrow network strategies
