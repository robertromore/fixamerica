# Insurance Markets: Citizen Actions

## What You Can Do

### Individual Actions

- **Shop during Open Enrollment**: Compare plans annually during Open Enrollment (November 1 - January 15 for ACA marketplace)
- **Check for subsidies**: Even moderate-income individuals may qualify for ACA premium tax credits
- **Know your rights**: Understand appeal processes, network adequacy requirements, and consumer protections
- **Use price transparency tools**: Request cost estimates before procedures; compare prices
- **Report problems**: File complaints with state insurance department or CMS
- **Appeal denials**: Insurance denials can often be overturned through appeals
- **Share your story**: Personal experiences shape policy debates

### If You're Uninsured

- **Check Medicaid eligibility**: Income limits vary by state; expansion states cover to 138% FPL
- **Explore marketplace options**: Most enrollees receive subsidies that make coverage affordable
- **Look for Special Enrollment Periods**: Life changes trigger enrollment opportunities
- **Use community health centers**: FQHCs provide care on sliding-scale regardless of insurance
- **Ask about charity care**: Hospitals and providers often have financial assistance programs

### Community Actions

- **Volunteer as navigator**: Help neighbors enroll in coverage
- **Support community enrollment events**: Partner with libraries, churches, schools
- **Advocate for local navigator funding**: Enrollment assistance programs need support
- **Educate about marketplace options**: Many people don't know subsidies are available
- **Support safety net providers**: Community health centers serve regardless of coverage

### Political Actions

- **Contact elected officials**: Call, write, or visit representatives about healthcare policy
- **Support coverage expansion**: Advocate for public option, enhanced subsidies, Medicaid expansion
- **Oppose market destabilization**: Monitor legislation that would undermine ACA protections
- **Testify at hearings**: Share personal experiences with coverage problems
- **Vote on healthcare**: Prioritize candidates' healthcare positions
