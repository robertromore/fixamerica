# Mental Health Integration: Current State

## Treatment Gap

### Prevalence vs. Treatment

| Condition | Prevalence | Treatment Rate |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Any mental illness | 50 million (20.6%) | 46% |
| Serious mental illness | 14.1 million (5.5%) | 65% |
| Any substance use disorder | 46.3 million (16.5%) | 10.3% |
| Co-occurring MI + SUD | 21.5 million | <10% receiving both |
| Major depression | 21 million | 61% |
| Anxiety disorders | 40 million | 36.9% |

### Access Barriers

| Barrier | Percentage Reporting |
|---------|---------------------|
| Cost/insurance issues | 42% |
| Didn't know where to go | 28% |
| Could not find provider | 27% |
| Stigma | 21% |
| Transportation | 15% |
| Long wait times | Common |

### Geographic Disparities

- 160 million Americans live in mental health professional shortage areas
- 60% of counties lack a practicing psychiatrist
- 65% of rural counties lack a psychiatrist
- Average wait for psychiatric appointment: 25 days (up to 6 months in some areas)

## Current System Structure

### Treatment Settings

| Setting | Description | Issues |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Outpatient therapy | Office-based counseling | Limited availability; cost |
| Psychiatry | Medication management | Severe shortage; long waits |
| Primary care | Most mental health treated here | Inadequate training; time constraints |
| Emergency departments | Crisis default | Psychiatric boarding; not therapeutic |
| Inpatient psychiatric | Acute stabilization | Bed shortage; short stays |
| Community mental health centers | Safety net care | Underfunded; limited capacity |
| Crisis services | 988, mobile crisis | Expanding but incomplete |

### Payer Landscape

| Payer | Mental Health Coverage |
|-------|----------------------|
| Commercial insurance | Subject to parity; prior auth issues |
| Medicare | Limited outpatient; improving |
| Medicaid | Largest payer for mental health |
| Uninsured | Community mental health; minimal |

## Mental Health Parity

### Legal Framework

- **Mental Health Parity Act (1996)**: Parity in annual/lifetime limits
- **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (2008)**: Quantitative and non-quantitative treatment limits
- **ACA (2010)**: Mental health as essential health benefit; parity applies to individual/small group
- **Consolidated Appropriations Act (2021)**: Parity compliance analysis requirements

### Enforcement Reality

| Parity Issue | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Prior authorization burden | Greater for mental health than medical |
| Network adequacy | Mental health networks narrower |
| Reimbursement rates | 20-40% lower for mental health |
| Out-of-network utilization | 5x higher for mental health |
| Enforcement | Limited; few penalties |

### Violations Common

- More restrictive prior authorization for mental health
- Lower reimbursement rates
- Narrower networks
- Different formulary requirements
- Non-quantitative treatment limits applied unevenly

## Crisis System

### 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline

- **Launched**: July 2022
- **Calls in first year**: 5 million+
- **Average answer rate**: 90%+
- **Issue**: Response after call varies dramatically by location

### Crisis Continuum

| Service | Availability | Gap |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| 988 call center | National (varies by state) | Answered but then what? |
| Mobile crisis teams | ~10% of communities | Major gap |
| Crisis stabilization centers | Limited | Most areas lack |
| Crisis residential | Rare | Alternative to inpatient |
| Emergency department | Available but inappropriate | Boarding, not treatment |

### Law Enforcement Involvement

- 10% of police calls involve mental health
- Law enforcement often default responder
- Outcomes include arrest, injury, death
- Jail as de facto psychiatric facility

## Integration Models

### Collaborative Care Model (CoCM)

- **Evidence**: Strongest evidence for primary care integration
- **Structure**: Care manager + consulting psychiatrist + PCP
- **Medicare coverage**: Since 2017
- **Adoption**: Limited (10-15% of primary care)
- **Barrier**: Workflow change; startup costs

### Co-located Services

- Mental health provider in primary care office
- Warm handoffs possible
- Separate billing; may be siloed
- More common than CoCM but less evidence

### Community Health Center Model

- FQHCs increasingly offer integrated care
- Federal funding supports integration
- Serves underserved populations
- Model for broader integration

## Workforce

### Supply Shortages

| Profession | Supply | Shortage |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Psychiatrists | 37,000 | Need 60,000+ |
| Psychologists | 106,000 | Geographic maldistribution |
| Clinical social workers | 270,000 | Primary providers in many areas |
| Psychiatric NPs | 30,000 | Growing but insufficient |
| Counselors | 450,000 | Insurance/credential barriers |

### Workforce Issues

- Low reimbursement compared to other specialties
- Psychiatry residency slots insufficient
- Burnout rates high
- Geographic maldistribution
- Diversity gaps

## Funding

### Total Mental Health Spending

- Estimated $280 billion annually
- 5.5% of total health spending
- Medicaid: Largest payer (25%)
- Self-pay significant due to access issues

### Underfunding Indicators

- Community mental health centers: 60% of 1980s funding (inflation-adjusted)
- State hospital closures without community replacement
- IMD exclusion limits Medicaid inpatient psychiatric
