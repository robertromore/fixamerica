# Mental Health Integration: Legislation

## Overview

Mental health integration requires federal legislation to enforce parity, build crisis infrastructure, develop workforce, and restructure financing. This legislative strategy addresses the gap between legal requirements and reality while building the system capacity needed for true integration.

## Constitutional Considerations

Congress has clear authority under the Commerce Clause and Spending Clause to regulate mental health coverage and fund mental health programs. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 established the legal framework; legislation here strengthens enforcement. State authority over insurance regulation is respected through federal floors, not ceilings.

## Federal Legislation

### Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act

**Purpose**: Make mental health parity law real through aggressive enforcement, transparency, and meaningful penalties.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Mental Health Parity Enforcement Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds that—
(1) the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act was enacted in 2008;
(2) fifteen years later, significant disparities persist in how insurance
    treats mental health compared to physical health;
(3) prior authorization is more restrictive for mental health services;
(4) mental health provider networks are narrower;
(5) mental health reimbursement rates are lower;
(6) enforcement has been inadequate to achieve parity.

SEC. 3. DATA TRANSPARENCY.
(a) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS REPORTING.—All group health plans and health
    insurance issuers shall submit to the Secretary annual reports
    including—
    (1) prior authorization requirements for mental health/substance
        use services compared to medical/surgical services;
    (2) denial rates by service category;
    (3) in-network vs. out-of-network utilization rates;
    (4) reimbursement rates for comparable services;
    (5) network adequacy metrics by specialty;
    (6) provider directory accuracy rates.

(b) PUBLIC REPORTING.—The Secretary shall publish aggregate data and
    identify plans with significant parity disparities.

SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT STRENGTHENING.

    of at least 100 plans annually, not limited to complaint-based
    review.

(c) PENALTIES.—
    (1) Civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per violation are
        authorized.
    (2) Continued non-compliance after notice shall result in
        enhanced penalties.
    (3) The Secretary shall publish enforcement actions.

(d) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.—Any participant or beneficiary may bring
    a civil action for parity violations, with attorneys' fees
    available to prevailing plaintiffs.

SEC. 5. SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
(a) PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.—Prior authorization for mental health and
    substance use services may not be more restrictive than for
    analogous medical/surgical services, considering—
    (1) frequency of authorization requirements;
    (2) documentation requirements;
    (3) approval timeframes;
    (4) denial rates.

(b) NETWORK ADEQUACY.—Mental health and substance use provider
    networks shall meet adequacy standards including—
    (1) time and distance standards equivalent to medical/surgical;

        non-urgent care;
    (3) provider-to-enrollee ratios by specialty.

(c) REIMBURSEMENT.—Reimbursement rates for mental health and substance
    use services shall be not less than 80 percent of Medicare rates.

SEC. 6. NON-QUANTITATIVE TREATMENT LIMITS.

    non-quantitative treatment limits, including—
    (1) fail-first protocols not applied to medical/surgical;
    (2) exclusions of specific diagnoses;
    (3) medical necessity criteria not evidence-based;
    (4) geographic restrictions not applied to medical/surgical.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Parity technical compliance | Meet letter but not spirit of law | High |
| Crisis services without capacity | Answer calls but can't dispatch | High |
| Workforce gaming | Loan repayment without retention | Medium |
| Carve-out workarounds | Integration in name only | Medium |
| Network adequacy manipulation | List providers not taking patients | High |
| IMD abuse | Use for long-term rather than crisis | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Workforce timeline | Years to train new providers | Inherent training duration |
| State variation | Uneven implementation | Federalism |
| Stigma unchanged | Access improved but utilization may lag | Cultural factors |
| Integration culture change | Billing doesn't change practice | Professional silos |
| Crisis sustainability | Grant funding may not continue | Budget constraints |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Parity technical compliance**: Specify outcomes-based measures (out-of-network utilization, denial rates); require insurer explanation of any disparity; shift burden of proof to insurer

2. **Crisis services without capacity**: Require crisis response capacity as condition of 988 funding; track outcomes (response time, hospital diversion); fund ongoing operations not just startup

3. **Workforce gaming**: Graduated loan repayment; service verification before each payment; clawback for early departure; community integration support

4. **Carve-out workarounds**: Define integration requirements specifically; require single care coordinator; measure care coordination outcomes; penalties for fragmentation

5. **Network adequacy manipulation**: Secret shopper audits; appointment availability testing; patient experience measures; directory accuracy requirements with penalties

6. **IMD abuse**: Time limits in statute; community investment requirement; outcome measurement; monitoring for inappropriate use

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Enforcement capacity**: Federal and state agencies need resources
- **State variation**: Implementation will vary; federal floors essential
- **Sustainability**: Initial investment must become ongoing funding
- **Workforce constraints**: Cannot create providers overnight
- **Culture change**: Integration requires more than payment reform
