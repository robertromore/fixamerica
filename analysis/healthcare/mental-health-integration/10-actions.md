## Effective Advocacy

### Communicating with Legislators

**What works**:

- Personal stories about mental health access challenges
- Economic data (cost of untreated mental illness)
- Local crisis examples (ED boarding, law enforcement involvement)
- Specific asks (fund 988, enforce parity, support workforce)
- Constituent meetings and testimony

**Key messages**:

1. "Mental health is health—fund and enforce parity"
2. "988 needs resources to answer every call and dispatch appropriate help"
3. "We need mental health professionals—invest in workforce"
4. "Crisis services keep people out of jails and emergency rooms"
5. "Integration saves money and saves lives"

### Building Coalitions

**Natural allies**:

- NAMI and family organizations
- Mental health professional associations
- Healthcare systems (hospitals want ED boarding solved)
- Law enforcement (many want crisis alternatives)
- Business community (workplace mental health)
- Faith communities
- Schools (youth mental health)
