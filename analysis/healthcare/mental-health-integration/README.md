# Mental Health Integration

Mental health integration refers to the coordination and unification of mental health services with primary care and the broader healthcare system. Despite the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, mental health remains siloed from physical health in most American healthcare settings. Approximately 50 million Americans experience mental illness each year, yet only 46% receive treatment. The mental health crisis has reached emergency proportions: suicide rates have increased 35% since 2000, the opioid epidemic continues to claim tens of thousands of lives annually, and emergency departments are overwhelmed with psychiatric patients who have nowhere else to go. Integrating mental health with primary care, establishing comprehensive crisis services, and building a robust behavioral health workforce are essential to addressing this crisis.
