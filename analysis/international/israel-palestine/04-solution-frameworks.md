# Solution Frameworks: Overview

## Purpose

This section examines the major proposed solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, analyzing each framework's assumptions, requirements, obstacles, and feasibility. The goal is not to advocate for a particular solution but to rigorously assess what each would require and why each has failed to be implemented.

> **Note:** This analysis is written from a U.S. policy perspective as of early 2026. All proposed solutions face severe obstacles; none appears achievable under current conditions. Understanding why requires examining each framework honestly.

## Executive Summary

### The Core Dilemma

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict resists resolution because the core aspirations of the two peoples are fundamentally in tension:

- **Israelis** seek security, recognition as a Jewish state, and control over territory they consider their historical homeland
- **Palestinians** seek self-determination, return of refugees, and sovereignty over territory that was taken from them

Every proposed solution requires at least one side to abandon what it considers non-negotiable—which is why every proposed solution has failed.

### The Major Frameworks

**Two-State Solution (International Consensus):**

The dominant framework since the 1990s: partition into Israel (within approximately the 1967 lines) and an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. This is endorsed by the UN, EU, Arab League, and (nominally) the United States.

*Current status:* Widely declared dead or dying. Settlement expansion has fragmented the West Bank; the current Israeli government explicitly opposes Palestinian statehood; Palestinian leadership is divided and lacks legitimacy to negotiate.

**One-State Solutions:**

Several variants exist:

- **Binational state:** Power-sharing between Jewish and Palestinian national communities (modeled on Belgium or pre-war Lebanon)
- **Democratic secular state:** One-person-one-vote democracy without ethnic character
- **Greater Israel:** Israeli sovereignty over all territory, with varying treatment of Palestinians (from annexation with citizenship to permanent disenfranchisement)

*Current status:* No one-state option has significant political support from those who would need to implement it. Israelis reject options that would end the Jewish state; Palestinians reject options that would formalize their subjugation.

**Confederation/Hybrid Models:**

Various proposals combine elements: two states linked by confederation; open borders with separate citizenship; graduated autonomy arrangements.

*Current status:* Interesting on paper but requires prior resolution of core disputes to implement.

**Status Quo Management:**

Not a solution but the default: continued Israeli control of the West Bank and siege of Gaza, punctuated by periodic violence, with no agreed political horizon.

*Current status:* This is what exists. It is sustainable for Israel in the short term but creates cascading humanitarian, legal, and diplomatic costs.

### Why Solutions Fail

All proposed solutions face some combination of:

| Obstacle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **No partner** | Each side claims the other is unwilling or unable to make peace |
| **Spoilers** | Actors who benefit from conflict can undermine any agreement |
| **Fait accompli** | Facts on the ground (settlements, division) constrain options |
| **Asymmetric power** | Israel has no incentive to compromise; Palestinians have no leverage |
| **Mutual trauma** | October 7 and Gaza's destruction have hardened attitudes |
| **Domestic politics** | Israeli coalition opposes any Palestinian state; PA lacks legitimacy |
| **External enablement** | U.S. support removes Israeli incentive for concessions |

### The Fundamental Question

The question is not which solution is "best" in the abstract but rather:

1. **What outcomes are actually achievable** given political realities?
2. **What would it take** to change those realities?
3. **What is the U.S. interest** and what levers does the U.S. have?

This section examines each framework through that lens.

## Framework for Analysis

Each solution framework is analyzed using consistent criteria:

### Core Elements

- **Definition:** What does this solution actually entail?
- **Historical basis:** Where does it come from? Who supports it?
- **Key parameters:** Borders, security, refugees, Jerusalem, recognition
- **Required conditions:** What would need to be true for this to work?

### Feasibility Assessment

- **Israeli acceptance:** What would Israeli politics need to look like?
- **Palestinian acceptance:** What would Palestinians need to agree to?
- **Regional support:** What role for Arab states?
- **International backing:** What would external powers need to do?
- **Implementation challenges:** Practical obstacles beyond political will

### Obstacles and Spoilers

- **Who opposes:** Which actors would resist this outcome?
- **How they would resist:** Political, violent, or diplomatic opposition
- **What could overcome resistance:** Is there a credible path?

### Implications for U.S. Policy

- **Compatibility with U.S. interests:** Does this serve American goals?
- **U.S. leverage:** What tools does the U.S. have?
- **Political feasibility:** What would U.S. domestic politics allow?

## A Note on "Peace Plans"

Dozens of peace plans have been proposed since 1937. They typically fail for predictable reasons:

1. **They are imposed externally** without genuine buy-in from parties
2. **They ignore political constraints** on leaders who would have to sell them
3. **They underestimate spoilers** who benefit from continued conflict
4. **They assume good faith** that may not exist
5. **They treat symptoms** rather than underlying power dynamics

Any realistic assessment must grapple with why previous plans failed—not just propose another one.

## Historical Context: What Has Been Tried

| Proposal | Year | Outcome |
|----------|------|---------|
| Peel Commission | 1937 | Partition proposed; rejected by both sides |
| UN Partition Plan | 1947 | Accepted by Jews, rejected by Arabs; war followed |
| Rogers Plan | 1969 | Israeli withdrawal proposal; rejected by Israel |
| Camp David (Carter) | 1978 | Egypt-Israel peace; Palestinian autonomy deferred |
| Reagan Plan | 1982 | Autonomy in association with Jordan; rejected |
| Madrid Conference | 1991 | First direct Israeli-Palestinian talks; framework only |
| Oslo Accords | 1993 | Mutual recognition; interim arrangements; collapsed |
| Camp David (Clinton) | 2000 | Final status talks; failed; Second Intifada followed |
| Clinton Parameters | 2000 | Detailed proposal; insufficient time; rejected |
| Arab Peace Initiative | 2002 | Full normalization for full withdrawal; ignored |
| Road Map | 2003 | Phased approach; never implemented |
| Geneva Initiative | 2003 | Civil society detailed agreement; no political backing |
| Annapolis | 2007-08 | Negotiations; Olmert offer; no conclusion |
| Kerry Initiative | 2013-14 | Nine months of talks; collapsed |
| Trump Plan | 2020 | Rejected by Palestinians; never implemented |

The pattern is consistent: proposals emerge, encounter political obstacles, and fail. The question is whether this pattern is inevitable or whether different conditions could produce different outcomes.
