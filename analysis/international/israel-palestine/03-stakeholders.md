# Stakeholders

## Purpose

This document maps all significant actors in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, their core interests, their power to influence outcomes, and their positions on key issues. Understanding stakeholders is essential for assessing which solutions are feasible and what obstacles they face.

> **Note:** Stakeholder positions have evolved significantly since October 7, 2023. This analysis reflects conditions as of early 2026.

## Israeli Stakeholders

### Israeli Government

**Current Configuration (Early 2026):**

The Netanyahu coalition represents the most right-wing government in Israeli history, comprising:

| Party | Leaders | Seats | Key Positions |
|-------|---------|-------|---------------|
| Likud | Benjamin Netanyahu | 32 | Prime Minister; center-right anchor |
| Religious Zionism | Bezalel Smotrich | 7 | Finance Minister; West Bank civil administration |
| Jewish Power (Otzma Yehudit) | Itamar Ben-Gvir | 6 | National Security Minister |
| Shas | Aryeh Deri | 11 | Ultra-Orthodox Sephardic; Interior (until removed) |
| United Torah Judaism | Various | 7 | Ultra-Orthodox Ashkenazi; Housing |
| Noam | Avi Maoz | 1 | Far-right religious |

**Core Interests:**

- **Security:** Preventing another October 7; eliminating Hamas's military capability; deterring Iran and Hezbollah; maintaining freedom of military action
- **Territorial:** Maintaining control over West Bank; expanding settlements; preventing Palestinian sovereignty
- **Political:** Coalition survival; avoiding accountability for October 7 failures; Netanyahu's personal survival (corruption trial)
- **Demographic:** Maintaining Jewish majority between river and sea; encouraging Palestinian emigration (explicitly stated by some ministers)
- **Religious:** For religious parties: maintaining religious status quo in Israel; expanding religious influence; protecting holy sites

**Red Lines:**

- No Palestinian state with real sovereignty
- No division of Jerusalem
- No return of Palestinian refugees to Israel
- No withdrawal to 1967 lines
- No recognition of Hamas in any governing role
- No ICC jurisdiction over Israeli citizens
- For far-right partners: no freeze on settlement expansion; no PA role in Gaza

**Key Figures:**

**Benjamin Netanyahu** - Prime Minister since 2022 (previously 1996-1999, 2009-2021). Israel's longest-serving leader. Master political tactician; personally opposed to Palestinian statehood while sometimes paying lip service to it diplomatically. Under corruption indictment; dependent on far-right coalition partners; resisted accountability for October 7. Primary goal: political survival.

**Bezalel Smotrich** - Finance Minister with authority over West Bank civil administration. Settler leader from Kedumim. Has described himself as a "proud homophobe" and a "fascist" (later partially walked back). Advocates annexation of West Bank and encouraging Palestinian emigration. Uses financial levers to weaken PA and expand settlements.

**Itamar Ben-Gvir** - National Security Minister. Former member of Kach (a banned terrorist organization under Israeli law). History of incitement against Arabs; convicted of support for terrorism and incitement to racism. Has distributed weapons to settlers; expanded Jewish access to Temple Mount; threatened to collapse government over any hostage deal he deems capitulation.

**Yoav Gallant** - Defense Minister (Likud). Former IDF general. More moderate on some issues; has clashed with Netanyahu over post-war Gaza planning and hostage negotiations. Subject to ICC arrest warrant alongside Netanyahu.

**Power Assessment:** The government holds formal authority over Israeli policy but is constrained by coalition dynamics—Ben-Gvir and Smotrich can veto any moderation by threatening to collapse the coalition. This gives the far-right effective veto power over peace initiatives.

### Israeli Security Establishment

**Composition:**

- **IDF (Israel Defense Forces):** Military leadership; Chief of Staff and senior generals
- **Shin Bet (Shabak):** Internal security; responsible for West Bank and preventing terrorism
- **Mossad:** External intelligence; operations abroad; Iran focus
- **National Security Council:** Advisory body; strategic planning

**Core Interests:**

- Eliminating threats to Israeli security
- Maintaining military capability and deterrence
- Preserving professional, non-political military
- Avoiding open-ended commitments without political objectives
- Intelligence primacy in the region

**Notable Positions:**

The security establishment has historically been more pragmatic than the political right:

- Multiple former Shin Bet directors have publicly called for political solutions, warning occupation is unsustainable (documented in the film "The Gatekeepers")
- Former IDF Chiefs of Staff have advocated separation from Palestinians
- Current and former security officials have warned that weakening the PA creates a vacuum filled by worse alternatives
- Many security leaders have opposed certain settlement expansion as creating security vulnerabilities
- Post-October 7: Security establishment has questioned whether "total victory" over Hamas is achievable without political strategy

**Tensions with Political Leadership:**

- Netanyahu has resisted establishing formal commission of inquiry into October 7 failures
- Gallant and military leadership have pushed for clearer post-war Gaza strategy; government has refused
- Security establishment frustrated by lack of "day after" planning
- Some officers have privately questioned whether military objectives align with stated war aims

**Power Assessment:** The security establishment wields significant influence through professional expertise and public trust (though damaged post-October 7). However, they implement policy set by civilians and cannot override political decisions. Their warnings are frequently ignored by the current government.

### Israeli Public Opinion

**Key Demographic Divisions:**

| Group | % of Population | General Orientation |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Secular Jews | ~45% | Diverse; many center-left on economics, right on security |
| Traditional (Masorti) Jews | ~25% | Moderate religious; often politically centrist |
| Religious Zionist | ~12% | Right to far-right; pro-settlement |
| Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) | ~13% | Focus on religious interests; security hawks; low military participation |
| Arab/Palestinian citizens | ~21% | Diverse; focus on equality; excluded from most coalitions |

**Post-October 7 Shifts:**

- Hardening of attitudes across the spectrum
- Increased support for harsh measures against Gaza
- Decreased support for two-state solution among Jewish Israelis
- Increased distrust of security establishment and government
- Deep division over hostage deal vs. military victory
- Ongoing protests by hostage families and their supporters

**Public Opinion on Key Issues (Jewish Israelis):**

| Issue | Approximate Support |
|-------|---------------------|
| Two-state solution | ~30-35% (down from ~50% pre-Second Intifada) |
| Maintaining security control over West Bank | ~70%+ |
| Palestinian state with full sovereignty | ~20-25% |
| Annexation of West Bank | ~25-35% |
| Hostage deal involving significant concessions | ~50% (deeply divided) |
| Continued military operations in Gaza | ~60%+ |

**Generational Patterns:**

- Younger Jewish Israelis (18-35) tend to be more hawkish than older generations
- Having grown up during Second Intifada, Gaza rockets, and October 7, they are skeptical of peace prospects
- The "peace generation" of Oslo is now elderly or deceased
- Youth more likely to support annexation, less likely to support territorial compromise

**Core Concerns:**

- **Security:** Dominant concern; October 7 reinforced existential fears
- **Jewish identity:** Maintaining Israel as Jewish state; demographic anxiety
- **Economic:** Cost of living; housing prices (less salient since October 7)
- **Religious/secular tensions:** Military exemptions; judicial reform
- **Hostages:** Deeply emotional issue cutting across political lines

**Power Assessment:** Israeli public opinion matters in a democracy, but current political system amplifies right-wing and religious parties. Anti-occupation voices have minimal political representation. Hostage families have become a significant pressure group but haven't changed fundamental policy.

### Israeli Settlers

**Population and Distribution:**

| Location | Population | Characteristics |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem) | ~500,000 | Mix of ideological and economic settlers |
| East Jerusalem | ~220,000 | Often not self-identified as "settlers"; established neighborhoods |
| **Total** | **~720,000** | Tripled since Oslo Accords (1993) |

**Types of Settlers:**

**Ideological Settlers:**

- Motivated by religious/nationalist beliefs in Jewish right to biblical Land of Israel
- Concentrated in smaller settlements and outposts throughout West Bank
- Often in the "hilltop youth" movement; some engage in violence
- See settlements as fulfilling divine mandate; oppose any territorial compromise
- Politically organized; disproportionate influence in Likud and Religious Zionist parties

**Economic/Quality-of-Life Settlers:**

- Moved to large "settlement blocs" near Green Line for affordable housing
- Communities like Modi'in Illit, Beitar Illit (ultra-Orthodox), Ma'ale Adumim
- Less ideologically committed; might accept land swaps that keep them in Israel
- Estimated 70-80% of settlers live in these larger blocs

**Core Interests:**

- Maintaining and expanding settlements
- Security from Palestinian attacks
- Infrastructure connecting settlements to Israel
- For ideological settlers: preventing any Palestinian sovereignty; ultimate annexation

**Political Influence:**

- Grossly disproportionate to population
- Smotrich and Ben-Gvir represent settler interests in government
- Settler councils have direct line to ministries
- IDF resources devoted to settlement security
- Settlement expansion continues regardless of international pressure
- Can effectively veto peace agreements by threatening violence or coalition collapse

**Violence and Extremism:**

- Settler violence against Palestinians has increased dramatically since October 7
- "Price tag" attacks: vandalism, arson, and violence against Palestinians in retaliation for any perceived slight
- Some settlers have killed Palestinians with impunity
- Military rarely intervenes; perpetrators rarely prosecuted
- US and EU have sanctioned some extremist settlers
- Some ideological settlers have explicitly called for ethnic cleansing

**Red Lines:**

- Any evacuation of settlements (trauma of 2005 Gaza disengagement)
- Palestinian sovereignty over any West Bank territory
- Restrictions on settlement expansion
- Division of Jerusalem

**Power Assessment:** Settlers punch far above their weight politically. Any peace agreement requiring evacuation faces potential violent resistance and certain coalition collapse. The settler movement has effectively established facts on the ground that constrain all future options.

### Israeli Civil Society

**Peace/Human Rights Organizations:**

- **B'Tselem:** Documents human rights violations in occupied territories; declared situation "apartheid"
- **Breaking the Silence:** Collects testimonies from IDF soldiers about occupation practices
- **Yesh Din:** Legal advocacy for Palestinian rights
- **Physicians for Human Rights Israel:** Healthcare access advocacy
- **Standing Together:** Jewish-Arab grassroots organizing
- **Peace Now:** Oldest peace movement; monitors settlements; weakened politically

These organizations face government hostility, NGO funding restrictions, and public hostility, especially post-October 7.

**Other Civil Society:**

- **Business community:** Generally pragmatic; concerned about economic impacts of conflict; some support normalization
- **Academia:** Diverse views; some critical voices face pressure; international academic boycott affects institutions
- **Media:** Pluralistic but rightward shift; critical coverage of military operations has decreased
- **Religious leadership:** Diverse; some rabbis advocate coexistence; others support maximalist positions

**Power Assessment:** Israeli civil society critical of occupation has been marginalized. Organizations face legal restrictions, defunding campaigns, and social opprobrium. They document and advocate but have minimal policy influence under current government.

## Palestinian Stakeholders

### Palestinian Authority

**Structure:**

- **President:** Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), 89 years old, in office since 2005 (term officially ended 2009)
- **Prime Minister:** Mohammad Mustafa (appointed 2024, replacing Mohammed Shtayyeh)
- **Palestinian Legislative Council:** Non-functional since 2007; last elected 2006
- **Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO):** Umbrella organization; technically represents all Palestinians including diaspora; Abbas chairs

**Governance Reality:**

- Controls civil administration in Areas A and B of West Bank (~40% of territory)
- No control over borders, airspace, or Area C (~60% of West Bank)
- Security forces coordinate with Israel
- Dependent on Israel for tax revenue transfers (which Israel can withhold)
- Dependent on international donors for budget
- Authority has eroded; cannot operate freely in Jenin, Nablus refugee camps

**Core Interests:**

- Institutional survival
- International recognition and legitimacy
- Path to Palestinian statehood
- Preventing Hamas takeover of West Bank
- Economic stability for PA employees and constituents
- Personal interests of leadership (corruption widely alleged)

**Positions:**

- Officially committed to two-state solution based on 1967 lines
- Accepts negotiations and international law as path forward
- Opposes armed resistance (officially)
- Pursues recognition through UN and international institutions
- Has joined ICC; supports international legal action against Israel

**Legitimacy Crisis:**

- No elections since 2006 (2021 elections canceled)
- Widely seen as corrupt, authoritarian, and ineffective
- Security coordination viewed as collaboration with occupier
- Young Palestinians largely view PA as irrelevant
- Abbas has no clear successor; multiple potential claimants
- PA blamed for failing to protect Palestinians or achieve political progress

**Red Lines:**

- Cannot formally abandon two-state solution or 1967 lines
- Cannot accept solution without East Jerusalem as capital
- Cannot formally renounce refugee right of return
- Cannot be seen as abandoning Gaza to Israeli control

**Power Assessment:** The PA has limited real power—constrained by Israel, dependent on donors, lacking legitimacy among its own population. It survives because alternatives seem worse (to Israel, donors, and some Palestinians) and because it provides employment and services. It cannot deliver Palestinian consent to any agreement that doesn't meet minimum demands, and it may not survive Abbas's departure.

### Hamas

**Nature:**

Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) is simultaneously:

- An Islamist ideological movement
- A political party (won 2006 Palestinian elections)
- A social service provider
- A military organization (Qassam Brigades)
- Designated a terrorist organization by US, EU, Israel, and others

**Pre-October 2023 Status:**

- Governed Gaza since 2007 (population ~2.2 million)
- Provided social services (schools, clinics, welfare)
- Maintained extensive military infrastructure (tunnels, rockets)
- Received funding from Iran, Qatar, and others
- Maintained tense ceasefire with Israel punctuated by periodic conflicts

**Post-October 2023 Status:**

- Military capabilities significantly degraded but not eliminated
- Governmental structures destroyed
- Senior leaders killed (Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar) or in hiding
- Political leadership abroad (Qatar, Turkey, Lebanon)
- Continues guerrilla resistance in Gaza
- Still holds some hostages
- No longer effectively governing; survival mode

**Core Interests:**

- Organizational survival
- Maintaining armed resistance capability
- Preventing Israeli/PA control of Gaza
- Maintaining regional support network
- Eventually: Islamic governance of all historic Palestine

**Ideology and Evolution:**

- 1988 Charter: Explicitly antisemitic; called for destruction of Israel; rejected any compromise
- 2017 Document: More pragmatic; accepted Palestinian state on 1967 lines without recognizing Israel; distanced from Muslim Brotherhood; reduced antisemitic language
- Maintains "resistance" ideology; views armed struggle as legitimate
- Provides social services that build popular support
- Combines religious and nationalist appeals

**Regional Support:**

- **Iran:** Primary state sponsor; funding, weapons, training
- **Qatar:** Hosts political leadership; provided funding for Gaza (with Israeli acquiescence)
- **Turkey:** Political support; hosts some officials
- **Hezbollah:** Coordination; shared Iranian patronage

**Red Lines:**

- Recognition of Israel
- Disarmament
- Exclusion from Palestinian governance
- Abandoning right of return

**Power Assessment:** Hamas has been severely degraded but not destroyed. It retains ability to conduct guerrilla operations, may hold hostages as leverage, and maintains external support. Its very survival after Israel's massive assault could be framed as victory. It cannot be excluded from any realistic post-war arrangement, but Israel refuses any role for it.

### Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)

**Nature:**

- Smaller Islamist militant group founded 1981
- Closer to Iran than Hamas (ideologically and operationally)
- Focused exclusively on armed resistance (no governance role)
- Designated terrorist organization

**Post-October 2023 Status:**

- Participated in October 7 attack
- Military capabilities degraded in Gaza operations
- Leadership largely intact (based abroad)
- Continues operations in West Bank

**Core Interests:**

- Armed resistance to Israel
- Liberation of all historic Palestine
- Islamic governance

**Power Assessment:** PIJ is a spoiler—can conduct attacks that undermine ceasefires but cannot shape political outcomes. It is dependent on Iran and operates in Hamas's shadow.

### Other Palestinian Factions

**Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP):**

- Marxist-Leninist; founded 1967
- Known historically for airplane hijackings
- Designated terrorist organization
- Now marginal; some presence in West Bank and diaspora
- Opposes Oslo framework and two-state solution from the left

**Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP):**

- Leftist; split from PFLP
- Largely inactive militarily
- Participates in PLO institutions

**These smaller factions have minimal current power but represent constituencies opposed to Oslo-era compromises.**

### Palestinian Civil Society

**Human Rights Organizations:**

- **Al-Haq:** Oldest Palestinian human rights organization; documents violations
- **Addameer:** Prisoner rights and support
- **Al-Mezan (Gaza):** Human rights documentation
- **Defense for Children International - Palestine:** Child rights
- **Palestinian Centre for Human Rights:** Legal advocacy

Israel declared several of these organizations "terrorist" in 2021, leading to international controversy.

**Other Civil Society:**

- **Business community:** Limited; dependent on Israeli-controlled economy; some diaspora entrepreneurs
- **Academic institutions:** Universities under strain; Gaza's universities largely destroyed
- **Professional associations:** Doctors, lawyers, engineers—provide services and advocacy
- **Women's organizations:** Advocacy for rights within Palestinian context
- **Youth organizations:** Various; frustrated by lack of political horizon

**Core Concerns:**

- Human rights documentation and advocacy
- Prisoner support
- International legal accountability
- Service provision under impossible conditions
- Preserving Palestinian presence and identity

**Power Assessment:** Palestinian civil society documents, advocates, and provides services, but has limited ability to influence outcomes. Under attack from Israel (terrorism designations, raids) and constrained by PA authoritarianism and Hamas control.

### Palestinian Refugees

**Population:**

UNRWA registered refugees (includes descendants):

| Location | Population |
|----------|------------|
| Jordan | ~2.4 million |
| Gaza | ~1.5 million |
| West Bank | ~900,000 |
| Syria | ~570,000 (many displaced by civil war) |
| Lebanon | ~480,000 |
| **Total** | **~5.9 million** |

**Living Conditions:**

- **Jordan:** Most have citizenship; relatively integrated; some in camps
- **Lebanon:** No citizenship; severe restrictions on employment and property; confined to camps
- **Syria:** Had relative integration; devastated by civil war; many displaced again
- **West Bank/Gaza:** Under occupation/blockade; camps are dense urban areas
- **Diaspora (Gulf, West, etc.):** Varied; often professional class; politically active

**Core Interests:**

- Right of return (to original homes or their vicinity in what is now Israel)
- Compensation for lost property
- Recognition of Nakba and historical injustice
- UNRWA services (education, healthcare, registration)
- Dignity and resolution of status

**Generational Perspectives:**

- **First generation (few remaining):** Direct memory of displacement; keys and deeds as symbols
- **Second/third generation:** Inherited identity and claims; political activism; some integration in host countries
- **Youth:** Varied; some maintain strong return identity; others focused on practical futures

**The Right of Return Issue:**

The right of return is the most emotionally charged and practically difficult issue:

- Palestinians insist on UN Resolution 194 language affirming return
- Israel refuses mass return as demographic threat to Jewish state
- Past proposals have offered limited return plus compensation, which Palestinian leadership has been unable to accept publicly
- Refugee populations are a key constituency; no leader can abandon their claims
- Practical implementation of mass return is unrealistic; symbolic acknowledgment may be essential

**Power Assessment:** Refugees as individuals have little power. Collectively, the right of return issue has veto power over any agreement—no Palestinian leader can sign away refugee rights and survive politically. The issue is a potential deal-breaker in any final status negotiation.

### Palestinian Diaspora

**Geographic Distribution:**

Beyond UNRWA-registered refugees, Palestinians live worldwide:

- **Gulf States:** Large professional/worker populations (hundreds of thousands); limited political rights; vulnerable to expulsion
- **Americas:** Growing communities in US, Chile, Brazil, Central America; politically active; lobbying capacity
- **Europe:** Significant communities in UK, Germany, Scandinavia; advocacy organizations
- **Australia:** Smaller but active community

**Political Role:**

- Represented in PLO through Palestinian National Council
- Fund PA and Palestinian institutions
- Diaspora organizations (American Muslims for Palestine, Palestinian Youth Movement, etc.)
- Campus activism in US and Europe
- Social media amplification
- BDS movement heavily diaspora-driven

**Core Interests:**

- Right of return
- Palestinian statehood
- End of occupation
- International accountability for Israel
- Preserving Palestinian identity and culture
- For some: one democratic state over all historic Palestine

**Power Assessment:** Diaspora Palestinians influence through advocacy, funding, and political engagement in their host countries. They are a growing voice, especially among younger generations, but cannot directly shape outcomes. They tend to hold more maximalist positions than Palestinians living under occupation (who face daily realities).

## Regional Actors

### Egypt

**Interests:**

- Border security; preventing instability spillover into Sinai
- Maintaining US aid (~$1.3 billion annually) and relationship
- Regional influence; mediator role
- Preventing permanent responsibility for Gazan refugees
- Domestic stability (population sympathizes with Palestinians)

**Role in Conflict:**

- Controls Rafah crossing (only non-Israeli access to Gaza)
- Key mediator between Israel and Hamas
- Security coordination with Israel on Sinai
- Hosts ceasefire negotiations
- Has kept border largely closed during Gaza war

**Position:**

- Maintains cold peace with Israel (since 1979)
- Supports two-state solution rhetorically
- Prioritizes stability over Palestinian cause
- Refuses to absorb Gaza refugees
- Balances US/Israel relationship against domestic opinion

**Red Lines:**

- No permanent responsibility for Gaza population
- No significant instability threatening Sisi regime
- Maintaining US aid and international legitimacy

**Power Assessment:** Egypt has significant leverage through Rafah crossing control and mediator role. It is essential to any Gaza arrangement but prioritizes its own interests over Palestinian aspirations.

### Jordan

**Interests:**

- Regime survival (Hashemite monarchy in majority-Palestinian country)
- Custodianship of Jerusalem holy sites (Al-Aqsa)
- Preventing mass Palestinian displacement into Jordan
- Economic stability (dependent on US aid, Gulf support)
- Security cooperation with Israel (intelligence, border)

**Role in Conflict:**

- Peace treaty with Israel (1994)
- Waqf administers Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif
- Hosts largest Palestinian refugee population
- Western buffer against instability
- Close US ally

**Position:**

- Strongly supports two-state solution (existential interest)
- Most vocal peace partner in criticizing Israeli actions
- King Abdullah has warned annexation/displacement could end peace treaty
- Balances security relationship with domestic pressure

**Red Lines:**

- Any change to Jerusalem holy sites status quo
- Mass Palestinian displacement to Jordan
- Annexation of West Bank

**Power Assessment:** Jordan is vulnerable but important. Its stability matters to Israel and the US. It has leverage through holy sites custodianship and peace treaty. King Abdullah is the most credible Arab voice for Palestinian statehood.

### Saudi Arabia

**Interests:**

- Regional leadership; countering Iran
- Economic transformation (Vision 2030); international investment
- Legitimacy (both domestic and international)
- Security guarantees (especially against Iran)
- Relationship with United States

**Evolution:**

- Traditional supporter of Palestinian cause (rhetorically)
- 2002 Arab Peace Initiative: comprehensive offer of normalization for withdrawal
- Pre-October 7: Moving toward normalization without Palestinian state
- Post-October 7: Crown Prince MBS states Palestinian state required for normalization

**Current Position:**

- Publicly conditions normalization on "credible path" to Palestinian state
- Seeks US security treaty as part of any deal
- Wants civilian nuclear program
- Will not normalize while Gaza burns (public opinion constraint)
- May accept less than full Palestinian statehood if framed correctly

**Red Lines:**

- Cannot normalize while Gaza destruction ongoing
- Needs something on Palestinian state to sell domestically
- Requires US security commitment

**Power Assessment:** Saudi Arabia is the prize Israel seeks for normalization. Its leverage is enormous—full normalization would be transformational for Israel. The question is whether any formula can satisfy both Saudi need for Palestinian progress and Israeli refusal of Palestinian state.

### United Arab Emirates

**Interests:**

- Security against Iran
- Economic diversification and technology acquisition
- International legitimacy and soft power
- Regional influence

**Role:**

- First Gulf state to normalize (Abraham Accords 2020)
- Expanding economic ties with Israel
- Did not condition normalization on Palestinian progress
- Has suspended some cooperation post-October 7 but maintains relations

**Position:**

- Pragmatic self-interest over Palestinian solidarity
- Views Israel as technology and security partner
- Supports humanitarian aid to Gaza
- Has not broken relations despite Gaza war

**Power Assessment:** UAE has demonstrated that normalization without Palestinian progress is possible. This weakened Palestinian leverage. However, UAE cannot drive regional consensus and has limited ability to influence Israeli behavior.

### Qatar

**Interests:**

- Regional influence beyond its size
- Mediator role; hosting all sides
- Relationship with US (hosts largest US military base in Middle East)
- Al Jazeera as soft power tool
- Distinct identity from Saudi/UAE

**Role:**

- Hosts Hamas political leadership
- Funds Gaza (with Israeli approval pre-October 7)
- Key mediator in hostage negotiations
- Al Jazeera provides platform for Palestinian narratives

**Position:**

- Talks to everyone; positions itself as essential intermediary
- Pro-Palestinian coverage but pragmatic diplomacy
- Will not expel Hamas; sees hosting as leverage

**Power Assessment:** Qatar is indispensable for any negotiation involving Hamas. Its mediator role gives it influence beyond its size. However, it cannot deliver outcomes—only facilitate talks.

### Iran

**Interests:**

- Regional hegemony; leadership of "resistance axis"
- Countering US and Israeli influence
- Regime survival; legitimacy through anti-Israel stance
- Nuclear program advancement (distracted adversaries helpful)
- Shiite influence in Arab world

**Role:**

- Primary state sponsor of Hamas, Hezbollah, PIJ, Houthis, Iraqi militias
- Provides funding, weapons, training, coordination
- October 7 and aftermath served Iranian interests (disrupted Saudi normalization; tied down Israel)
- Direct attacks on Israel (drone/missile strike April 2024)

**Position:**

- Rejects Israel's existence
- Supports "resistance" until liberation of all Palestine
- Uses Palestinian cause for regional influence regardless of Palestinian interests

**Power Assessment:** Iran has significant ability to spoil any peace through proxies. It benefits from continued conflict and has no interest in resolution. Its "axis of resistance" can make life difficult for Israel but cannot defeat it militarily. Iran is a spoiler, not a partner.

### Hezbollah

**Nature:**

- Lebanese Shiite militia and political party
- Far more capable than Hamas (~150,000+ rockets, precision missiles, experienced fighters)
- Iranian proxy but also autonomous Lebanese political force
- Part of Lebanese government (ministers, MPs)

**Role Since October 7:**

- Opened secondary front; daily exchanges of fire
- ~60,000 Israelis displaced from north
- ~100,000 Lebanese displaced from south
- Has not launched full-scale war (yet)
- Tied Israel's military resources

**Interests:**

- Organizational survival and power in Lebanon
- Support for Palestinian resistance (secondary to Lebanese interests)
- Following Iranian direction
- Deterring Israeli attack on Lebanon

**Power Assessment:** Hezbollah is the most dangerous military threat to Israel after Iran itself. A full war would be devastating for both sides. Hezbollah's threat constrains Israeli action but also makes resolution harder—Israel demands security guarantees on northern border that are difficult to achieve.

### Turkey

**Interests:**

- Regional influence; neo-Ottoman ambitions
- Domestic politics (Erdogan uses Palestine for popularity)
- Economic ties (Israel is significant trade partner)
- Leadership of Muslim/Palestinian cause

**Role:**

- Harsh rhetorical criticism of Israel (Erdogan compared Netanyahu to Hitler)
- Hosts Hamas figures
- Trade restrictions post-October 7
- Humanitarian aid to Gaza
- Maintains diplomatic relations

**Position:**

- Vocally pro-Palestinian
- Uses issue for domestic consumption
- Actual policy more pragmatic than rhetoric
- Not willing to break relations or sacrifice trade entirely

**Power Assessment:** Turkey has voice but limited practical influence. Its rhetoric exceeds its actions. It cannot shape outcomes but can provide rhetorical support for Palestinian positions.

## International Actors

### United States

**Relationship with Israel:**

The US-Israel relationship is among the closest in American foreign policy:

- $3.8 billion annual military aid (10-year MOU through 2028)
- Supplemental packages during conflicts (additional billions since October 7)
- Diplomatic protection (UN veto; opposition to ICC)
- Intelligence sharing
- Joint military exercises and development (Iron Dome, Arrow)
- Commitment to Israel's "qualitative military edge"
- Deep political, cultural, and personal ties

**Interests:**

- Israel's security and survival
- Regional stability
- Counterterrorism
- Preventing nuclear proliferation (Iran)
- Maintaining alliance relationships
- Domestic political considerations (pro-Israel constituencies)
- Human rights and international law (secondary, inconsistently applied)

**Domestic Political Dynamics:**

| Constituency | Position | Influence |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| AIPAC and pro-Israel lobby | Strong support for Israel; oppose conditioning aid | High; significant campaign contributions |
| Evangelical Christians | Support Israel (theological reasons); oppose Palestinian state | High in Republican Party |
| Jewish Americans | Diverse; majority support Israel but increasingly critical of occupation/current government | Moderate; concentrated in key states |
| Progressive Democrats | Critical of occupation; support conditioning aid; some support BDS | Growing; younger voters |
| Arab/Muslim Americans | Pro-Palestinian; oppose unconditional support | Growing; concentrated in Michigan |
| Foreign policy establishment | Generally pro-Israel; some concern about unconditional support | Moderate |

**Position Since October 7:**

- Full support for Israel's right to respond to October 7
- Provided additional weapons and funding
- Blocked UN ceasefire resolutions
- Rhetorical pressure for humanitarian access and civilian protection
- Limited practical pressure on Israel
- Pushed for "day after" planning (rejected by Israel)
- Continued pursuit of Saudi normalization

**Biden Administration Approach:**

- "Bear hug" strategy: support Israel while trying to influence privately
- Public criticism limited; private pressure unclear in effectiveness
- Refused to condition aid on humanitarian access or civilian protection
- Faced growing domestic criticism from progressives and Arab Americans
- ICC arrest warrants created diplomatic awkwardness

**Trump Administration Approach (2017-2021, potentially returning):**

- Moved embassy to Jerusalem
- Recognized Israeli sovereignty over Golan Heights
- Closed PLO office in Washington
- Cut aid to Palestinians and UNRWA
- "Deal of the Century" that Palestinians rejected
- Facilitated Abraham Accords without Palestinian progress

**Red Lines (US):**

- Opposition to Israeli ethnic cleansing (stated)
- Opposition to Israeli reoccupation of Gaza (stated)
- Neither has been enforced with consequences

**Power Assessment:** The US has enormous leverage over Israel—military aid, diplomatic protection, international legitimacy—that it has rarely used. Domestic politics make conditioning aid politically costly. The US is essential to any peace process but has been unwilling to use its leverage to extract Israeli concessions.

### European Union

**Relationship with Israel and Palestinians:**

- Israel: Major trade partner; research cooperation (Horizon); some defense ties
- Palestinians: Largest donor to PA and UNRWA; humanitarian aid; recognition by some members

**Positions:**

- Supports two-state solution
- Considers settlements illegal
- Has labeled settlement products (distinguished from Israeli products)
- Multiple members recognized Palestine in 2024 (Spain, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia)
- Generally critical of Israeli actions but limited enforcement

**Internal Divisions:**

- Germany: Strong pro-Israel orientation (Holocaust guilt); reluctant to criticize
- France: More balanced; significant Muslim population; active diplomacy
- UK: Generally pro-Israel; some pressure for accountability
- Ireland: Strongly pro-Palestinian; recognizes Palestine; vocal critic
- Central/Eastern Europe: Often strongly pro-Israel
- Scandinavian countries: Generally critical of occupation; donors to Palestinians

**Actions:**

- Humanitarian aid to Gaza
- Statements calling for ceasefire
- Recognition of Palestine by several members
- No meaningful sanctions on Israel
- Some ministers have called for arms embargoes; not enacted

**Power Assessment:** The EU has economic leverage it hasn't used. Internal divisions prevent unified action. It is a significant humanitarian donor but has limited political influence on outcomes.

### United Nations

**Bodies and Roles:**

**Security Council:**

- Can pass binding resolutions (rarely does on Israel-Palestine due to US veto)
- Has passed foundational resolutions (242, 338, 2334)
- Regular vetoes by US of critical resolutions

**General Assembly:**

- Passes regular resolutions critical of Israel (non-binding)
- Granted Palestine observer state status (2012)
- Cannot compel Israeli compliance

**UNRWA:**

- Provides services to 5.9 million Palestinian refugees
- Education, healthcare, food aid, employment
- Perennial funding crises
- Israel and US have accused it of Hamas ties; cut funding
- Essential to refugee survival; politically contested

**Human Rights Council:**

- Standing agenda item on occupied territories (Item 7)
- Regular commissions of inquiry
- Israel and US view as biased
- Documented systematic violations

**UN Agencies:**

- OCHA: Humanitarian coordination
- WHO: Health emergency response
- WFP: Food assistance
- UNICEF: Children's welfare
- All report catastrophic conditions in Gaza

**International Court of Justice:**

- 2004: Separation barrier illegal
- 2024: Occupation illegal; settlements must be evacuated; apartheid finding
- Genocide case ongoing (South Africa v. Israel)
- Advisory opinions not binding but carry moral/legal weight

**International Criminal Court:**

- Investigation into situation in Palestine
- 2024: Arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, Hamas leaders
- Israel not a member; disputes jurisdiction
- Creates legal exposure for Israeli officials

**Power Assessment:** The UN documents, legitimizes international consensus, and provides essential services but cannot compel Israeli compliance. US veto blocks binding Security Council action. The ICC and ICJ create legal consequences but lack enforcement mechanisms.

### Russia

**Interests:**

- Distraction of US/Western attention from Ukraine
- Influence in Middle East
- Arms sales
- Counterweight to US hegemony

**Position:**

- Traditional support for Palestinians (Soviet legacy)
- Relationship with Israel (large Russian-Israeli population; Syria coordination)
- Calls for ceasefire; opposes US approach
- Cannot be central mediator given Ukraine war

**Power Assessment:** Russia is preoccupied with Ukraine and has limited regional influence. It can complicate US diplomacy but cannot drive outcomes.

### China

**Interests:**

- Middle East stability (oil imports; Belt and Road)
- Expanding influence at US expense
- Portraying US as hypocritical on international law
- Trade with all parties

**Position:**

- Rhetorical support for Palestinians
- Offered to mediate (no takers)
- Uses conflict to criticize US "rules-based order"
- Limited actual engagement

**Power Assessment:** China is a rising power with Middle East interests but has avoided deep involvement in Israel-Palestine. It benefits from highlighting US inconsistency but has not offered alternatives.

### Global South

**General Position:**

- Strong sympathy for Palestinian cause
- View conflict through anti-colonial lens
- See Western double standards (Ukraine vs. Palestine)
- Support for Palestine in international fora
- South Africa's ICJ case reflects this alignment

**Power Assessment:** The Global South shapes international legitimacy and moral framing. Its support for Palestine grows while Western support for Israel becomes more isolated. This affects Israel's standing but not Israeli policy.

## Stakeholder Mapping

### Power/Interest Matrix

**High Power, High Interest:**

- Israeli government
- Israeli settlers (on settlement/annexation issues)
- United States
- Hamas
- Iran (via proxies)

**High Power, Lower Direct Interest:**

- Saudi Arabia
- Egypt
- European Union
- China (potentially)

**Lower Power, High Interest:**

- Palestinian Authority
- Palestinian civil society
- Palestinian refugees
- Israeli peace movement
- Jordan

**Lower Power, Lower Interest:**

- Russia (preoccupied elsewhere)
- Most Global South countries (supportive but not engaged)

### Veto Players

Actors who can block any agreement:

| Actor | Veto Power Over |
|-------|-----------------|
| Israeli government | Any agreement; can refuse to negotiate or implement |
| Israeli settlers | Territorial compromise (through violence threat or coalition leverage) |
| United States | International enforcement; can block UN action |
| Hamas | Any agreement that excludes them (through violence) |
| Palestinian refugees | Any agreement that abandons right of return (through legitimacy crisis) |
| Iran/Hezbollah | Security arrangements (through military threat) |

### Potential Bridge Actors

Actors who could facilitate agreement:

- **Qatar:** Unique access to Hamas; trusted by multiple parties
- **Egypt:** Essential for Gaza; mediator experience
- **Jordan:** Credibility on Jerusalem; Palestinian population gives legitimacy
- **Saudi Arabia:** Normalization leverage could incentivize Israeli concessions (if it would use it)
- **US:** Has leverage if willing to use it
- **Former Israeli security officials:** Credibility on security; some advocate for political solutions

### Spoilers

Actors who benefit from continued conflict or oppose any resolution:

- **Iranian regime:** Benefits from Israel being tied down; uses conflict for regional influence
- **Israeli far-right:** Benefits politically from conflict; opposes any Palestinian sovereignty
- **Hamas hardliners:** Derive legitimacy from resistance; oppose recognition of Israel
- **PIJ:** Exists only for armed resistance
- **Settler extremists:** Will violently oppose any territorial compromise

## Key Insights

### Why Resolution Is So Difficult

1. **Veto players on all sides:** Multiple actors can block any agreement
2. **Spoilers benefit from conflict:** Some actors gain power/legitimacy from continued violence
3. **Asymmetric power:** Israel holds most cards but has no incentive to compromise
4. **Fragmented Palestinian leadership:** No one can deliver Palestinian consent
5. **US won't use leverage:** The key external power won't condition support
6. **Fait accompli on the ground:** Settlements make two-state solution physically difficult
7. **Mutual dehumanization:** Decades of conflict have hardened attitudes

### What Would Need to Change

For any resolution to be possible:

1. **Israeli political shift:** Government willing to accept Palestinian sovereignty
2. **Palestinian reunification:** Unified leadership capable of negotiating and delivering
3. **US pressure:** Willingness to condition aid on Israeli compliance
4. **Regional buy-in:** Arab states offering incentives (normalization) with conditions
5. **Spoiler management:** Containing those who benefit from conflict
6. **Grassroots legitimacy:** Populations on both sides willing to accept compromise

None of these conditions currently exists.
