## Approach

This analysis aims to be:

- **Historically grounded** - Understanding how we got here
- **Multi-perspective** - Representing Israeli, Palestinian, and international viewpoints
- **Solution-oriented** - Focusing on what could work, not just what's wrong
- **Realistic** - Acknowledging constraints and obstacles
- **Policy-relevant** - Connecting to actionable US policy options
