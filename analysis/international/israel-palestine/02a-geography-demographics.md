# Geography and Demographics

> **Note:** This document describes territorial and demographic conditions as of early 2026. For the overview and links to other current state topics, see [Current State Overview](02-current-state.md).

## Israel (within Green Line)

**Territory:** Israel within its internationally recognized borders (the 1949 armistice lines/Green Line) comprises approximately 20,770 square kilometers (about the size of New Jersey). Israel treats the Golan Heights (captured from Syria in 1967) as sovereign Israeli territory, though this is not internationally recognized except by the United States.

**Population:** Approximately 9.8 million people (2024), including:

- ~7.2 million Jews (~74%)
- ~2.1 million Arabs (~21%), mostly Palestinian citizens of Israel
- ~500,000 others (~5%), including non-Arab Christians, those without religious classification, and foreign workers

**Demographics:** Israel's Jewish population includes:

- Ashkenazi Jews (European origin)
- Mizrahi/Sephardic Jews (Middle Eastern/North African origin)—now the majority of Israeli Jews
- Ethiopian Jews (~170,000)
- Russian-speaking immigrants (~1 million, arrived 1990s)
- Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) community (~13% and growing rapidly due to high birth rates)

**Political System:** Parliamentary democracy with proportional representation. The Knesset (120 seats) elects the Prime Minister. The 3.25% electoral threshold allows small parties to win seats, giving religious and ideological parties outsized influence in coalition formation. The judiciary, including the Supreme Court, has been a check on executive power—though recent judicial reform efforts sought to weaken this.

**Economy:** Advanced high-tech economy with GDP per capita of approximately $55,000 (2024). Major sectors include technology, pharmaceuticals, defense industries, and agriculture. Israel is a global leader in cybersecurity and startup innovation. Economic inequality is significant; Arab and Haredi populations have lower economic participation.

**Security Situation:** Israel maintains one of the world's most capable militaries, with universal conscription (for Jewish citizens), advanced air and missile defense systems (Iron Dome, David's Sling, Arrow), and nuclear weapons capability (unacknowledged). Since October 2023, security concerns have dominated national life—the October 7 attack shattered assumptions about intelligence capability and border security. Ongoing tensions with Hezbollah on the northern border have created a secondary front.

## Palestinian Citizens of Israel

**Population:** Approximately 2.1 million Palestinian citizens of Israel (~21% of the population) are descendants of Palestinians who remained within Israel's borders after 1948. They hold Israeli citizenship and vote in elections but occupy an ambiguous position—part of the state but connected to the people it conflicts with.

**Legal Status:** Palestinian citizens have formal legal equality but face documented disparities:

- **Land and housing:** Arab municipalities receive less land allocation and planning approval; the Jewish National Fund holds significant land exclusively for Jewish use; Arab towns are often denied expansion while new Jewish towns are approved
- **Education funding:** Arab schools historically received less per-pupil funding, though gaps have narrowed
- **Employment:** Higher unemployment rates; underrepresentation in senior positions in government and major corporations
- **Infrastructure:** Arab towns often have inferior roads, public transportation, and services
- **Nation-State Law (2018):** Declared Israel the nation-state of the Jewish people; demoted Arabic from official language status; some Palestinian citizens view it as constitutionalizing second-class status

**Identity Tensions:** Palestinian citizens navigate complex identity:

- Israeli by citizenship, Palestinian by heritage
- Many identify as "Palestinian citizens of Israel" or "Arab Israelis"—terminology itself is contested
- Connected to Palestinians in the occupied territories by family, culture, and solidarity
- Serve in some state institutions but largely exempt from military service (except Druze and some Bedouin)
- Viewed with suspicion by some Jewish Israelis; accused of disloyalty during conflicts

**Political Participation:**

- Vote and run for Knesset; Arab parties typically win 10-15 seats
- Historically excluded from governing coalitions until Ra'am (United Arab List) joined in 2021—a breakthrough that collapsed in 2022
- Some advocate integration and reform within Israel; others support binational or Palestinian national frameworks
- Voter turnout has varied; some boycott elections as legitimizing a discriminatory system

**Post-October 7 Situation:**

- Heightened tensions; some Palestinian citizens arrested for social media posts or expressions of solidarity with Gaza
- Mixed cities (Lod, Acre, Jaffa) saw violence in May 2021; fears of recurrence
- Increased surveillance and pressure on dissent
- Some report hostile atmosphere in workplaces and public spaces
- Community caught between Israeli identity and Palestinian solidarity

## West Bank

**Territory:** Approximately 5,860 square kilometers of land west of the Jordan River, captured by Israel from Jordan in 1967. The territory remains under Israeli military occupation, though governance is divided.

**Oslo-era Divisions (still in effect):**

| Zone | % of West Bank | Control | Description |
|------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| Area A | ~18% | Full PA control | Major Palestinian cities (Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin, etc.) |
| Area B | ~22% | PA civil / Israeli security | Palestinian towns and villages |
| Area C | ~60% | Full Israeli control | Settlements, roads, military zones, undeveloped land |

This "temporary" arrangement from 1995 has become permanent. Area C—where Israel controls planning and construction—contains most of the West Bank's land and resources.

**Palestinian Population:** Approximately 3.2 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The majority live in Areas A and B, in dense urban centers and refugee camps. Movement between areas requires passing Israeli checkpoints.

**Israeli Settlements and Settlers:** Over 700,000 Israeli Jews now live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem:

- ~500,000 in West Bank settlements
- ~220,000 in East Jerusalem neighborhoods built on occupied territory

Settlements range from small hilltop outposts to city-sized communities (Ma'ale Adumim: ~40,000; Modi'in Illit: ~80,000). They are connected by a network of roads that bypass Palestinian areas, fragmenting Palestinian territory. Under international law, all settlements are illegal; Israel disputes this.

**Movement Restrictions:** Palestinians face hundreds of checkpoints, roadblocks, and barriers:

- Permanent military checkpoints control movement between major areas
- "Flying" checkpoints appear unpredictably
- The separation barrier (~700 km) runs through the West Bank, not on the Green Line
- Settlers use dedicated roads forbidden to Palestinians
- Palestinians need permits to enter Israel, Jerusalem, or certain West Bank zones

The result: trips that should take minutes can take hours; economic activity is constrained; families are separated.

**Palestinian Authority Governance:** The PA, led by President Mahmoud Abbas (age 89 in 2026), administers Palestinian population centers but has severely limited powers:

- No control over borders, airspace, or electromagnetic spectrum
- Dependent on Israel for tax revenue transfer (which Israel can withhold)
- Security coordination with Israel makes it appear collaborative with occupation
- Widely seen as corrupt, authoritarian, and illegitimate by Palestinians
- No elections since 2006; no clear succession plan
- Authority has eroded in areas like Jenin and Nablus, where armed groups operate increasingly independently

**Economic Conditions:** GDP per capita approximately $3,500—about 1/15th of Israel's. Unemployment high, particularly among youth. Economy structurally dependent on Israel (for labor, imports, currency). Private sector constrained by movement restrictions and inability to develop Area C. International aid provides significant portion of PA budget.

**Security Coordination:** The PA maintains security forces that coordinate with Israeli military to prevent attacks on Israelis—a deeply unpopular arrangement that many Palestinians view as collaboration. Israeli forces operate throughout the West Bank, conducting arrests and raids even in Area A. Since 2023, violence has increased significantly: armed groups in Jenin and Nablus operate semi-independently; settler violence against Palestinians has escalated; Israeli military raids have intensified.

## Gaza Strip

**Territory:** Approximately 365 square kilometers—one of the most densely populated places on earth. The strip is approximately 41 km long and 6-12 km wide, bordered by Israel to the north and east, Egypt to the southwest, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west.

**Pre-October 2023 Conditions:** Before the October 7, 2023 attack:

- Population: ~2.2 million, with ~70% refugees or descendants of refugees
- Under Israeli/Egyptian blockade since 2007
- Hamas governance since 2007
- Unemployment: ~45%, with youth unemployment over 60%
- Poverty rate: ~80%
- Limited electricity (often 4-8 hours/day)
- Severe water and sanitation problems (95% of water unfit to drink)
- Movement restrictions: most Gazans had never left the Strip
- Four major military conflicts since 2008, each causing massive destruction with limited reconstruction

Gaza was already in humanitarian crisis before October 2023—the UN had warned it would become "unlivable" by 2020.

**October 7, 2023 Attack:** Hamas and other militant groups breached the border fence and launched a large-scale attack on southern Israel, killing approximately 1,200 people (mostly civilians), taking ~250 hostages, and committing atrocities that shocked Israel and the world. The attack originated from Gaza and was planned/executed primarily by Hamas's military wing.

**Post-October 2023 Destruction:** Israel's military response devastated Gaza:

- **Casualties:** Tens of thousands of Palestinians killed (estimates vary significantly; exact figures disputed). The Gaza Health Ministry reported over 40,000 deaths by late 2024; actual figures may be higher due to bodies under rubble.
- **Displacement:** At various points, over 90% of Gaza's population has been displaced—most multiple times. Residents were ordered to move south, then from area to area, with nowhere truly safe.
- **Infrastructure destruction:**

    - Estimated 60-70% of housing damaged or destroyed
    - Hospitals: most non-functional; those operating face severe shortages
    - Schools: majority damaged or destroyed; many used as shelters
    - Water and sanitation systems: largely non-functional
    - Roads, power grid, communications: extensively damaged

**Humanitarian Catastrophe:** As of early 2026:

- **Famine conditions:** UN and humanitarian organizations have warned of famine, particularly in northern Gaza. Malnutrition is widespread, especially among children.
- **Aid access:** Severely restricted. Israel controls all entry points and has limited humanitarian aid flow. Trucks entering Gaza carry a fraction of pre-war levels.
- **Healthcare collapse:** Medical system effectively destroyed. Lack of medicine, equipment, and functioning facilities. Disease outbreaks reported.
- **Shelter:** Most displaced Gazans live in overcrowded shelters, tents, or makeshift structures.
- **No safe zones:** Despite Israeli designation of "safe zones," these have been repeatedly struck.

The scale of destruction has been called unprecedented in modern urban warfare by humanitarian observers.

**Governance Vacuum:** Hamas's governmental structures have been largely destroyed, but Israel has not articulated a viable alternative:

- Hamas military wing degraded but not eliminated; continues guerrilla operations
- Civil administration collapsed; no functioning government services
- International proposals for PA role in governance rejected by various parties
- Israel opposes any arrangement that could be seen as Hamas victory
- No agreement on "day after" governance

**Blockade Status:** The Israeli-Egyptian blockade continues and has intensified:

- Israel controls all access points and inspects all goods
- Egypt's Rafah crossing subject to complex arrangements
- Humanitarian aid insufficient for population needs
- Reconstruction materials largely blocked due to "dual use" concerns

**Reconstruction Challenges:** Rebuilding Gaza will require:

- Estimated $50-80+ billion (early estimates; likely higher)
- Years to decades even with full access
- Resolution of governance questions
- Lifting of blockade restrictions on construction materials
- International donor commitment
- Addressing unexploded ordnance throughout the territory

Previous reconstruction efforts after the 2014 war were incomplete after a decade; the current destruction is exponentially greater.

## East Jerusalem

**Territory:** East Jerusalem refers to the approximately 70 square kilometers of Jerusalem that was under Jordanian control from 1948-1967, captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, and subsequently annexed. Israel expanded the municipal boundaries significantly beyond the pre-1967 city limits to include surrounding Palestinian villages and land for future development.

**Legal Status:** Israel considers all of Jerusalem its "eternal, undivided capital" and applied Israeli law to East Jerusalem in 1980. The international community, including the United States until 2017, did not recognize this annexation. In 2017, President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved the US embassy there—a decision that remains controversial. Most countries maintain embassies in Tel Aviv. The UN and most states consider East Jerusalem occupied territory.

**Population:** Approximately 950,000 people live in Jerusalem municipality:

- ~570,000 Jews (~60%)
- ~370,000 Palestinians (~39%)
- ~10,000 others (~1%)

Palestinians in East Jerusalem hold a unique legal status: they are "permanent residents" of Israel but not citizens (unless they apply and meet criteria). This status can be revoked if they live outside Jerusalem for extended periods—creating anxiety about leaving even temporarily. They can vote in municipal elections but not national elections.

**Palestinian Neighborhoods:** East Jerusalem's Palestinian residents live in neighborhoods including Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan, Issawiya, Jabal Mukaber, Sur Baher, and others. These areas face:

- Chronic underinvestment in infrastructure and services compared to Jewish neighborhoods
- Restrictive zoning that makes legal construction nearly impossible
- Home demolitions for unpermitted construction (permits are rarely granted)
- Eviction pressures from settler organizations claiming historical Jewish ownership
- Separation from West Bank by the barrier, despite being within municipal boundaries

**Settlement Expansion:** Jewish neighborhoods built on occupied East Jerusalem territory house approximately 220,000 Israelis. These include:

- **Established neighborhoods:** French Hill, Ramot, Gilo, Pisgat Ze'ev, Neve Ya'akov—large residential areas that most Israelis do not consider "settlements"
- **Settler enclaves:** Smaller properties in Palestinian neighborhoods (Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan, Old City Muslim Quarter) purchased or claimed by settler organizations seeking to establish Jewish presence

Settlement construction continues, with new projects announced regularly. Each announcement draws international condemnation but construction proceeds.

**The Old City:** The walled Old City (~1 square kilometer) contains sites sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam:

- **Jewish Quarter:** Rebuilt after 1967; includes Western Wall plaza
- **Muslim Quarter:** Largest quarter; Palestinian residential area; gates to Haram al-Sharif
- **Christian Quarter:** Churches, monasteries; Church of the Holy Sepulchre
- **Armenian Quarter:** Smallest; Armenian Orthodox community

**The Holy Sites:**

The Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif compound is the most sensitive location:

- **For Jews:** Site of the First and Second Temples; holiest site in Judaism; Western Wall at its base is the primary prayer site
- **For Muslims:** Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock; third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina

The "status quo" arrangement since 1967:

- Jordan's Waqf (Islamic trust) administers the compound
- Jews may visit but historically not pray there
- Israel controls security access
- Non-Muslims enter through one gate during limited hours

This fragile arrangement is under increasing pressure. Jewish groups advocating Temple Mount prayer have grown; some Israeli politicians support changing the status quo. Palestinians view any change as existential threat to Al-Aqsa. Tensions over the site have triggered violence multiple times, including the 2000 intifada and periodic clashes since.

**Barrier and Access:** The separation barrier cuts through East Jerusalem, separating some Palestinian neighborhoods from the city center. Residents of areas like Kafr Aqab (inside municipal boundaries but beyond the barrier) face chaotic conditions—technically under Israeli jurisdiction but practically neglected. The barrier also separates East Jerusalem from the West Bank, disrupting economic and family ties.

**Services and Infrastructure:** Palestinian neighborhoods receive a fraction of municipal services compared to Jewish areas:

- Road maintenance, sanitation, schools, parks, and emergency services are chronically underfunded
- Building permits are nearly impossible to obtain; illegal construction is common and subject to demolition
- School shortage forces Palestinian children into overcrowded facilities or private schools

This disparity reflects both discriminatory resource allocation and the ambiguous legal status that leaves Palestinians in a governance gap.

## Water Resources

Water scarcity is a critical dimension of the conflict, with control over water resources reflecting broader power asymmetries.

**The Mountain Aquifer:** The primary water source for the West Bank is the Mountain Aquifer system, which has three basins underlying the West Bank and extending into Israel. Israel controls allocation:

- Israel extracts approximately 80% of the Mountain Aquifer's sustainable yield
- Palestinians are allocated approximately 20%, insufficient for population needs
- Palestinian drilling requires Israeli permits, which are rarely granted
- Many Palestinian wells have run dry as Israeli and settlement wells draw from the same aquifer at greater depths

**Per Capita Disparities:**

| Population | Water consumption (liters/person/day) |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Israeli citizens | ~250-300 |
| West Bank Palestinians | ~70-80 |
| Israeli settlers | ~300+ (similar to Israel proper) |
| WHO recommended minimum | 100 |

West Bank Palestinians receive less than the WHO-recommended minimum for basic needs.

**Settlement Water Use:** Israeli settlements in the West Bank have abundant water—swimming pools, irrigated agriculture, green lawns—while neighboring Palestinian villages face chronic shortages. The visual contrast is stark: lush settlements adjacent to dry Palestinian communities drawing from the same aquifer.

**Gaza's Water Crisis:** Gaza's situation is catastrophic:

- The Coastal Aquifer, Gaza's only freshwater source, is 96% contaminated and unfit for human consumption
- Over-extraction (largely due to population density and lack of alternatives) has caused seawater intrusion
- Sewage contamination from inadequate treatment facilities
- Pre-October 2023: only 4% of Gaza's water met drinking standards
- Post-October 2023: water infrastructure largely destroyed; desalination plants damaged; population depends on trucked water and humanitarian aid

**Infrastructure Control:** Israel controls:

- Water allocation from shared aquifers
- Permits for Palestinian wells and water infrastructure
- The national water company Mekorot, which sells water to the PA at prices Palestinians consider exploitative
- Movement of water tankers and equipment through checkpoints

**Climate Change:** Increasing water scarcity due to climate change intensifies competition. Droughts are becoming more frequent; the Jordan River's flow has diminished dramatically. Water conflict may worsen regardless of political developments.

**Water as Political Tool:** Palestinians accuse Israel of using water control as a tool of occupation—restricting supply during summer months, demolishing water infrastructure, and prioritizing settler needs. Israel argues it supplies Palestinians with more water than Oslo agreements require and that Palestinian infrastructure problems are due to PA mismanagement.
