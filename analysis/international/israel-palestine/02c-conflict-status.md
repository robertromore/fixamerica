## Military Operations

### Gaza Operations

Israeli military operations in Gaza have continued, with varying intensity, since October 2023:

**Phases:**

1. **Initial invasion (October-December 2023):** Large-scale ground operation; northern Gaza depopulated; intense urban combat
2. **Southern operations (January-May 2024):** Operations expanded to Khan Younis, then Rafah despite international objections
3. **Ongoing operations (2024-2026):** Cycles of withdrawal and re-entry; "mowing the grass" pattern; no area fully secured

**Current Military Posture:**

- Israel maintains presence in key corridors (Philadelphi corridor along Egyptian border, Netzarim corridor bisecting Gaza)
- Regular operations throughout Gaza; no area considered pacified
- Hamas continues guerrilla attacks; tunnels remain operational
- Israeli casualties continue, though at lower rate than initial invasion

**Military Assessment:**

- Hamas military capabilities significantly degraded but not eliminated
- Senior Hamas leaders killed (including Mohammed Deif, reportedly); others remain
- Estimated 10,000-15,000 Hamas fighters killed; unknown number remain
- Hamas has demonstrated ability to reconstitute in areas Israel previously cleared
- IDF acknowledges conflict could continue indefinitely without political resolution

### West Bank Operations

Military operations in the West Bank have intensified significantly:

- Large-scale raids in Jenin, Nablus, and Tulkarem refugee camps
- Near-daily arrest operations throughout the territory
- Armed groups (Lion's Den, Jenin Battalion) continue to resist
- Settler violence has increased; military often fails to intervene
- Palestinian death toll in West Bank highest in decades
- Some analysts describe conditions as approaching third intifada

### Northern Front

The Lebanon border remains tense:

- Daily exchanges of fire continued through 2024-2025
- ~60,000 Israelis displaced from northern communities
- ~100,000 Lebanese displaced from southern Lebanon
- Hezbollah and Israel engaged in a war of attrition
- Multiple escalation crises narrowly averted
- Ceasefire arrangements remain fragile

## Ceasefire and Negotiation Status

### Negotiation Efforts

Multiple rounds of negotiations have occurred since October 2023:

| Round | Date | Mediators | Outcome |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|
| Initial | Nov 2023 | Qatar, Egypt, US | Week-long pause; ~105 hostages released |
| Multiple rounds | 2024 | Qatar, Egypt, US | Various proposals; no sustained agreement |
| Ongoing | 2025-2026 | Qatar, Egypt, US | Intermittent talks; brief pauses |

### Key Sticking Points

- **Permanent ceasefire:** Hamas demands permanent end to operations; Israel refuses to commit before achieving objectives
- **Israeli withdrawal:** Hamas demands full withdrawal; Israel insists on security presence
- **Hostage releases:** Phased vs. all-at-once; which prisoners exchanged
- **Hamas role:** Israel demands Hamas cannot govern post-war; Hamas demands to remain
- **Reconstruction:** Who controls; what conditions

### Current Status (Early 2026)

- Negotiations continue intermittently
- Brief humanitarian pauses occur but don't hold
- Neither side willing to accept the other's minimum demands
- International pressure for ceasefire has not overcome domestic political constraints
- US role has been criticized as insufficiently forceful in pushing for ceasefire

### The "Day After" Impasse

No agreed plan exists for Gaza's post-war governance:

- Israel: Rejects Hamas rule but also opposes PA return; proposes undefined "local" governance
- PA: Willing to return only as part of path to statehood; demands Israeli commitment to two-state solution
- US: Proposes "revitalized PA" with Arab backing; rejected by Israeli government
- Arab states: Willing to participate only with credible statehood path
- International community: Various proposals floated; none accepted by all parties

This impasse means military operations continue without political endgame.

## Displaced Populations

### Israeli Displacement

**Northern Communities:**

- ~60,000 Israelis evacuated from communities near Lebanon border
- Some have been displaced for over two years
- Communities (kibbutzim, moshavim, towns) essentially abandoned
- Economic and social fabric of the region devastated
- Residents demand security guarantees before return; Hezbollah rockets remain threat
- Government provides housing assistance but communities may never recover

**Gaza Envelope:**

- Survivors of October 7 communities (Kfar Aza, Be'eri, Nir Oz, etc.) largely remain displaced
- Some communities debating whether to rebuild
- Trauma among survivors is profound; many cannot imagine returning
- Security concerns persist despite military operations
- Some families have lost multiple generations

### Palestinian Displacement

**Within Gaza:**

The scale of displacement is unprecedented:

| Metric | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Total displaced at peak | ~2 million (~90% of population) |
| Currently displaced (early 2026) | ~1.5-1.8 million |
| Times displaced (average) | 4-10 times per family |
| Housing destroyed | 60-70% of total stock |
| Able to return home | Very few; most homes destroyed or in "buffer zones" |

**Displacement Patterns:**

- Ordered to evacuate north to south repeatedly
- "Safe zones" designated then struck
- Crowded into ever-smaller areas (Muwasi, Rafah, central zones)
- Living in tents, schools, makeshift shelters
- Families separated; registration systems collapsed
- Unable to return to northern Gaza (effectively depopulated)

**West Bank:**

- Increased displacement from Area C due to demolitions and settler violence
- Bedouin communities in Jordan Valley particularly affected
- Movement restrictions have tightened
- Some families fleeing violence in northern West Bank

### Refugee Concerns

Palestinians fear permanent displacement:

- Historical parallel to 1948 Nakba weighs heavily
- Egypt and other neighbors refuse to accept refugees
- International community warned against forced transfer
- Some Israeli ministers have publicly called for "voluntary emigration"
- Palestinians determined to remain despite conditions

### Humanitarian Access

Aid delivery remains catastrophically insufficient:

- Israel controls all access points
- Trucks entering Gaza far below pre-war levels
- Distribution within Gaza dangerous and chaotic
- UN and aid workers have been killed in significant numbers
- Israel has blocked some aid organizations entirely
- Northern Gaza faces famine conditions
- Disease outbreaks reported throughout the Strip
