# Economic Conditions

> **Note:** This document describes economic conditions as of early 2026. For the overview and links to other current state topics, see [Current State Overview](02-current-state.md).

## Israeli Economy

**Pre-October 7 Baseline:** Israel had one of the world's most dynamic economies—GDP per capita ~$55,000, thriving tech sector, low unemployment, strong growth. The economy was a source of national pride and international investment.

**Post-October 7 Impact:**

- **GDP contraction:** The economy shrank in Q4 2023; growth remained sluggish through 2024-2025
- **Military mobilization:** Calling up 300,000+ reservists removed workers from the economy; some sectors faced acute labor shortages
- **Tourism collapse:** International tourism—a significant sector—largely ceased
- **Foreign investment:** Some investors paused or withdrew; "startup nation" image tarnished by prolonged conflict
- **Credit rating:** Major agencies downgraded Israel's credit rating, citing war costs and political instability
- **Budget strain:** War costs estimated at tens of billions of dollars; deficit widened significantly
- **Northern displacement:** ~60,000 Israelis evacuated from north; communities economically devastated; agriculture disrupted

**Sectoral Impacts:**

- **Tech sector:** Resilient but affected by reservist call-ups; some companies relocated operations
- **Construction:** Dependent on Palestinian workers from West Bank; work permits restricted post-October 7
- **Agriculture:** Labor shortages; northern farms in rocket range abandoned
- **Retail and services:** Consumer spending dropped; businesses in affected areas shuttered

**Long-term Concerns:**

- Cost of Gaza operations and potential reconstruction involvement
- Ongoing northern security costs
- Brain drain if conflict continues
- International isolation affecting trade relationships
- Haredi exemption from military service creates economic as well as social tensions

## Palestinian Economy

### West Bank

- **Pre-October 7:** GDP per capita ~$3,500; high unemployment; economy structurally dependent on Israel
- **Post-October 7:**
    - Work permits for Palestinian laborers in Israel suspended or restricted for months
    - Hundreds of thousands lost primary income source
    - Movement restrictions tightened; economic activity further constrained
    - PA revenue collapsed as Israel withheld tax transfers
    - Private sector devastated by uncertainty and access restrictions
    - Unemployment spiked; poverty deepened

### Gaza

The Gaza economy has effectively ceased to exist:

- **Pre-October 7:** Already in humanitarian crisis—45% unemployment, 80% poverty, economy strangled by blockade
- **Post-October 7:**
    - Economic infrastructure systematically destroyed
    - Businesses, factories, markets—gone
    - Banking system collapsed
    - Agricultural land devastated
    - Fishing industry (historically significant) destroyed
    - No formal economic activity; survival economy based on aid
    - Estimated 90%+ unemployment

### Reconstruction Estimates

- Gaza reconstruction: $50-80+ billion (early estimates; likely higher given continued destruction)
- Timeline: Decades even with full international commitment and access
- Comparison: Post-WWII Marshall Plan (inflation-adjusted) was ~$150 billion for all of Europe

## Economic Interdependence

The Palestinian and Israeli economies are deeply intertwined, though asymmetrically:

- Palestinians work in Israel and settlements (when permitted)
- Palestinian economy uses Israeli shekel
- Imports/exports pass through Israeli-controlled crossings
- PA collects taxes through Israeli customs (Paris Protocol 1994)
- This dependence gives Israel economic leverage but also means Palestinian economic collapse affects Israel

## International Aid Dependence

- PA budget heavily dependent on international donors
- UNRWA provides basic services to refugees (education, healthcare)
- Post-October 7: UNRWA funding crisis; PA near collapse; humanitarian aid insufficient for Gaza
- Reconstruction will require massive international investment—uncertain given donor fatigue and governance questions
