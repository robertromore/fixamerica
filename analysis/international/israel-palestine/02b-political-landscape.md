# Political Landscape

> **Note:** This document describes political conditions as of early 2026. For the overview and links to other current state topics, see [Current State Overview](02-current-state.md).

## Israeli Politics

**Government Structure:** Israel is a parliamentary democracy. The 120-seat Knesset is elected by proportional representation with a 3.25% threshold. The president (largely ceremonial) tasks a party leader with forming a government; the Prime Minister needs a coalition commanding a Knesset majority. This system gives small parties—particularly religious and ideological parties—significant leverage in coalition negotiations.

**Current Government (as of early 2026):** The government formed after the November 2022 elections is the most right-wing in Israeli history:

- **Likud** (Benjamin Netanyahu) - Center-right, dominant party
- **Religious Zionism / Jewish Power** (Bezalel Smotrich, Itamar Ben-Gvir) - Far-right nationalist; includes settlers, advocates annexation
- **Shas** (Aryeh Deri) - Ultra-Orthodox Sephardic
- **United Torah Judaism** - Ultra-Orthodox Ashkenazi

Key figures:

- **Benjamin Netanyahu** - Prime Minister, Israel's longest-serving leader; under corruption indictment; dependent on far-right coalition partners
- **Bezalel Smotrich** - Finance Minister with authority over West Bank civil administration; settler leader; has advocated for annexation and described himself as a "fascist homophobe"
- **Itamar Ben-Gvir** - National Security Minister; former follower of Meir Kahane's banned Kach party; history of incitement; has expanded settler access to Temple Mount

This government has pursued aggressive settlement expansion, weakened Palestinian Authority, and attempted judicial reforms that sparked massive protests.

**Political Spectrum on the Palestinian Issue:**

| Position | Parties/Groups | Stance |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| **Far Right** | Religious Zionism, Jewish Power | Annexation; no Palestinian state; encourage emigration; "decisive victory" |
| **Right** | Likud mainstream | Oppose Palestinian state; manage conflict; expand settlements; security control |
| **Center-Right** | New Hope, Yisrael Beiteinu | Separation from Palestinians; possible limited autonomy; no full sovereignty |
| **Center** | Yesh Atid, National Unity | Vague on two-state; prioritize security; open to negotiations in principle |
| **Center-Left** | Labor | Support two-state in principle; little political power; skeptical of current feasibility |
| **Left** | Meretz (collapsed) | Active two-state advocacy; largely collapsed as political force |
| **Arab Parties** | Hadash, Ra'am, Balad, Ta'al | Various positions; focus on Palestinian citizens' rights; some support binational frameworks |

The political center of gravity has shifted dramatically rightward over two decades. The "peace camp" that supported Oslo is largely defunct. Parties openly advocating two-state solution struggle to win seats.

**Public Opinion Trends:**

- Support for two-state solution has declined among Jewish Israelis since the Second Intifada and Gaza disengagement
- October 7 further hardened attitudes; surveys show increased support for harsh measures against Gaza
- Majority support maintaining security control over West Bank regardless of political arrangements
- Generational divide: younger Jewish Israelis tend to be more hawkish, having grown up during intifadas and rocket attacks
- Palestinian citizens of Israel (~21% of population) largely excluded from political coalitions until 2021 (Ra'am briefly joined)

**Security Establishment Views:** Israel's security establishment (IDF leadership, Shin Bet, Mossad—current and former) often differs from political right:

- Many former security chiefs have advocated for political solutions, warning that occupation cannot be sustained indefinitely
- Military leaders have opposed some settlement expansion as creating security vulnerabilities
- Security chiefs have warned that weakening PA could lead to worse alternatives
- These views carry weight but have not translated into policy under current government

**Post-October 7 Politics:** The October 7 attack created a profound political crisis:

- Massive intelligence and military failure that Netanyahu's government has not fully accounted for
- War cabinet initially included opposition figures (Benny Gantz) who have since departed
- Commissions of inquiry into failures have been resisted by Netanyahu
- Government stability remains precarious despite wartime unity pressures

**The Hostage Crisis:**

The approximately 250 hostages taken on October 7 became central to Israeli politics and the war's trajectory:

- **Initial numbers:** ~250 hostages taken to Gaza, including Israeli citizens, foreign nationals, and dual citizens; ages ranged from infants to elderly
- **November 2023 deal:** A week-long pause saw ~105 hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and increased aid to Gaza
- **Subsequent releases:** Small numbers released through negotiations or military operations
- **Deaths in captivity:** Multiple hostages confirmed killed—some by captors, some by Israeli military strikes, some from medical neglect
- **Remaining hostages (early 2026):** Estimates vary; dozens believed still held, though how many remain alive is uncertain

**Hostage Families as Political Force:**

Hostage families have become the most potent domestic pressure group:

- Regular mass demonstrations demanding government prioritize hostage return over military objectives
- Split between families: some demand deal at any price; others support continued military pressure
- Families meet with world leaders, address international forums, and maintain constant media presence
- Accuse Netanyahu government of prioritizing political survival and military goals over hostage lives
- "Deal now" movement clashes with "total victory" rhetoric from government

**The Negotiation Dilemma:**

Hamas has demanded ceasefire and Israeli withdrawal as conditions for hostage release. Israel faces a painful tradeoff:

- Accepting Hamas demands would mean ending military operations without achieving stated goals
- Continuing operations risks hostage deaths and prolongs their captivity
- Each failed negotiation round hardens positions on both sides
- Qatar, Egypt, and the US have mediated; deals have collapsed repeatedly
- Netanyahu's coalition partners (Ben-Gvir, Smotrich) threaten to collapse government if he accepts a "surrender deal"

The hostage issue illustrates how October 7's human toll continues to shape Israeli politics, military decisions, and the prospects for any ceasefire.

**Israeli Society: Internal Divisions:**

Beyond government politics, Israeli society is experiencing profound internal tensions:

**Judicial Reform Crisis:**

- In 2023, the Netanyahu government proposed sweeping judicial reforms to limit Supreme Court power
- Hundreds of thousands protested weekly for months—the largest sustained protests in Israeli history
- Reservists threatened to refuse service; tech companies warned of economic exodus
- October 7 paused but did not resolve the crisis; underlying tensions remain
- The dispute reflects deeper divisions over Israel's character: liberal democracy vs. Jewish state prioritizing religious/nationalist values

**Secular-Religious Divide:**

- Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) exemption from military service is increasingly contested
- War intensified resentment: secular Israelis serve and die while Haredim do not
- Supreme Court ruled exemption unconstitutional; implementation remains contested
- Haredi population growing rapidly (~13% now); exemption is politically explosive
- Government depends on Haredi parties, limiting reform options

**Post-October 7 Trauma and Cohesion:**

- October 7 was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust
- Profound national trauma; widespread PTSD among survivors, families, and soldiers
- Initial unity gave way to bitter disputes over war conduct and accountability
- Society divided over hostage deal vs. military victory prioritization
- Trust in institutions (military, intelligence, government) severely damaged
- Some communities (kibbutzim near Gaza) may never recover

**Reservist Strain:**

- Extended reserve duty (months, not weeks) has exhausted soldiers and families
- Some reservists publicly question war aims and tactics
- Small but growing refusal movement, particularly among those who opposed judicial reform
- Military acknowledges retention and morale challenges

**The "Day After" Divide:**

- No consensus on what comes after military operations end
- Right wing: continued security control, no Palestinian governance role, possible resettlement
- Center: international involvement, reformed PA, demilitarization
- Left (marginal): immediate negotiations, end of occupation
- Absence of agreed vision complicates military and diplomatic strategy

## Palestinian Politics

**The Fundamental Split:** Palestinian politics has been defined by the Fatah-Hamas division since Hamas's 2006 electoral victory and 2007 takeover of Gaza. This split means:

- No unified Palestinian leadership or negotiating position
- Two separate governments (PA in West Bank, Hamas in Gaza—though Gaza's governance is now in chaos)
- No Palestinian elections since 2006
- Deep mutual mistrust between factions

**Palestinian Authority / Fatah:**

The Palestinian Authority governs (with severe limitations) the West Bank's Palestinian population centers. It is dominated by Fatah, the party founded by Yasser Arafat.

Key characteristics:

- **Leadership:** President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), age 89 in 2026, in office since 2005. His four-year term has extended indefinitely without elections. No clear succession plan.
- **Legitimacy crisis:** Widely seen by Palestinians as corrupt, authoritarian, and collaborationist. Security coordination with Israel is deeply unpopular.
- **Limited power:** The PA cannot control borders, airspace, or most land. Israel can withhold tax revenues (and has). The PA increasingly cannot maintain order in some areas.
- **International role:** Maintains diplomatic relations with ~140 countries; holds UN observer state status; represents Palestinians in international forums
- **Position on peace:** Officially committed to two-state solution and negotiations; has pursued UN recognition and international legal action (ICC)

The PA's situation has deteriorated significantly:

- Authority has eroded in northern West Bank (Jenin, Nablus), where armed groups operate semi-independently
- Israeli raids occur throughout PA-controlled areas
- Financial crisis is chronic; civil servants periodically go unpaid
- Young Palestinians largely view PA as irrelevant or illegitimate

**Hamas:**

Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) is an Islamist organization founded in 1987 as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Key characteristics:

- **Ideology:** Islamist nationalist; historically rejected Israel's existence; 2017 charter showed some moderation (accepted 1967 borders as basis for state without recognizing Israel)
- **Governance:** Controlled Gaza 2007-2023; provided social services alongside military activities
- **Military wing:** Qassam Brigades; extensive tunnel network; rocket arsenal; responsible for October 7 attack
- **Designation:** Listed as terrorist organization by US, EU, Israel, and others

Post-October 7 status:

- Military capabilities significantly degraded but not eliminated
- Top leadership largely killed or in hiding; some leaders abroad (Qatar, Turkey, Lebanon)
- Governmental structures destroyed; no longer effectively governing Gaza
- Continues guerrilla resistance; holds some hostages
- Regional support network (Iran, Hezbollah) weakened but not severed

**Other Palestinian Factions:**

| Faction | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)** | Smaller Islamist militant group; close Iranian ties; participated in October 7; designated terrorist organization |
| **Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)** | Marxist-Leninist; historically significant; diminished but active; designated terrorist organization |
| **Democratic Front (DFLP)** | Leftist faction; minor current influence |
| **Palestinian People's Party** | Communist party; very small |
| **Independent figures** | Some prominent individuals (Marwan Barghouti, imprisoned; Salam Fayyad, former PM) have followings outside party structures |

**Marwan Barghouti** deserves special note: A Fatah leader serving multiple life sentences in Israeli prison for murder convictions related to the Second Intifada, he consistently polls as the most popular potential Palestinian leader. Some see him as the only figure who could unite Palestinian factions; Israel shows no willingness to release him.

**Generational Divide:**

- **Oslo generation:** Leadership that negotiated the peace process; aging; seen as failed by younger Palestinians
- **Intifada generation:** Came of age during Second Intifada; skeptical of negotiations; more supportive of armed resistance
- **Post-Oslo generation:** Born after 1993; never knew life without checkpoints and settlements; view two-state solution as dead; some support one-state frameworks, others armed struggle

Youth frustration is intense: no political horizon, no economic opportunity, no mobility, aging illegitimate leadership. This fuels both apathy and radicalization.

**Diaspora Palestinians:**

Over half of all Palestinians live outside historic Palestine:

- **Jordan:** ~2.4 million Palestinian refugees (plus descendants); largest concentration; many have Jordanian citizenship
- **Lebanon:** ~500,000; denied citizenship and many rights; live in camps with restricted employment
- **Syria:** ~500,000 (pre-civil war); many displaced again by Syrian conflict
- **Gulf states:** Significant professional/worker populations; limited political rights
- **Americas, Europe:** Growing communities; active in advocacy; younger diaspora increasingly vocal

The diaspora maintains connection through:

- UNRWA services (in some locations)
- Palestinian civil society organizations
- Social media and cultural production
- Right of return as political demand

Diaspora Palestinians are represented in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which technically remains the umbrella organization for Palestinian political representation, though its relevance has diminished.

**Political Paralysis:**

The Palestinian political system is frozen:

- No elections since 2006 (planned 2021 elections canceled)
- No reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas despite multiple attempts
- No legitimate process for leadership transition
- No agreed Palestinian negotiating position
- No clear path forward that commands broad support

This paralysis weakens Palestinian negotiating capacity and feeds narratives that there is "no partner for peace."

**Palestinian Prisoners:**

The issue of Palestinian prisoners is central to Palestinian society and politics:

**Scale:**

- Israel holds approximately 9,000-10,000 Palestinian prisoners (numbers fluctuate)
- Post-October 7, mass arrests increased this number significantly
- Palestinians use the term "prisoners" or "detainees"; Israel often uses "security prisoners" or "terrorists"
- Nearly every Palestinian family has had a member imprisoned at some point

**Categories of Detention:**

| Type | Description | Numbers (approx.) |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Convicted prisoners** | Tried and sentenced in military courts | ~5,000 |
| **Administrative detainees** | Held without charge or trial; renewable 6-month orders | ~3,000+ (post-Oct 7 surge) |
| **Minors** | Children under 18; tried in military courts | ~200-300 |
| **Women** | Female prisoners | ~80-100 |

**Administrative Detention:**

- Israeli military can detain Palestinians indefinitely without charge based on secret evidence
- Detention orders are 6 months, renewable indefinitely
- Detainees and lawyers cannot see evidence against them
- Some Palestinians have been held for years without charge
- Human rights groups condemn the practice; Israel says it's necessary for security
- Post-October 7: administrative detention expanded dramatically

**Conditions and Treatment:**

- Held in Israeli prisons, often inside Israel (complicating family visits)
- Human rights organizations have documented:
    - Overcrowding and poor conditions
    - Limited family visits (especially from Gaza—often none)
    - Inadequate medical care
    - Reports of abuse and torture during interrogation
    - Solitary confinement used punitively
- Post-October 7: conditions reportedly deteriorated further; some deaths in custody reported

**Political and Social Significance:**

- Prisoner releases are major Palestinian demands in any negotiation
- The 2011 Gilad Shalit exchange released 1,027 Palestinian prisoners for one Israeli soldier—including Yahya Sinwar
- November 2023 hostage deal released ~240 Palestinian prisoners (women and minors) for Israeli hostages
- Prisoners and their families are a politically organized constituency
- Hunger strikes by prisoners draw major attention
- "Prisoner's Day" is observed annually; prisoners are honored as resistance figures

**Child Prisoners:**

- Israel is the only country that systematically prosecutes children in military courts
- Palestinian children as young as 12 can be detained
- Common charges: stone-throwing, which can carry multi-year sentences
- Documented issues: nighttime arrests, interrogation without parents or lawyers, coerced confessions
- International human rights organizations have condemned the practice

The prisoner issue illustrates the asymmetry of the conflict: Israel holds thousands of Palestinians; Palestinians occasionally capture Israeli soldiers or civilians (creating hostage situations). For Palestinians, prisoners are a constant reminder of occupation; for Israelis, releases of convicted attackers are painful concessions that risk future violence.

## Regional Context

**The Shifting Arab World:**

The traditional Arab consensus on Palestine—no recognition, no negotiation, no peace with Israel—has fractured. While public opinion in Arab countries remains strongly pro-Palestinian, governments have increasingly pursued their own interests.

**Abraham Accords and Normalization:**

The 2020 Abraham Accords marked a watershed: UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan established relations with Israel without conditioning normalization on Palestinian statehood.

Current status of Arab-Israeli relations:

| Country | Relationship | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Egypt** | Peace treaty (1979) | Cold peace; security cooperation; closed Rafah border during Gaza war |
| **Jordan** | Peace treaty (1994) | Strategic partnership; custodianship of Jerusalem holy sites; large Palestinian population creates domestic pressure |
| **UAE** | Full relations (2020) | Expanding economic ties; suspended some cooperation post-October 7 |
| **Bahrain** | Full relations (2020) | Limited scope; follows Saudi lead |
| **Morocco** | Full relations (2020) | Linked to US recognition of Western Sahara claims |
| **Sudan** | Partial normalization (2020) | Implementation stalled amid Sudanese civil war |
| **Saudi Arabia** | No formal relations | Was discussing normalization pre-October 7; now demands Palestinian state as condition |

The October 7 attack and Gaza war disrupted but did not reverse normalization. Arab governments faced intense public pressure but maintained relations (with some cooling). The larger question—Saudi normalization—now appears contingent on meaningful progress toward Palestinian statehood.

**Iran and the "Axis of Resistance":**

Iran positions itself as the primary state supporter of Palestinian armed resistance, channeling support through what it calls the "axis of resistance":

- **Hamas:** Received Iranian funding, weapons, and training for decades; relationship more pragmatic than ideological (Hamas is Sunni, Iran is Shiite)
- **Hezbollah (Lebanon):** Iran's most capable proxy; significant military force; opened secondary front after October 7 with cross-border attacks and rocket fire
- **Houthis (Yemen):** Attacked Red Sea shipping and launched missiles/drones toward Israel in solidarity with Gaza
- **Iraqi militias:** Attacked US bases and threatened Israeli targets

Iran benefits from regional conflict that distracts from its nuclear program and legitimizes its regional role. The Gaza war expanded Iran's influence even as its proxies suffered losses.

**Hezbollah and the Northern Front:**

The Israel-Lebanon border became an active front after October 7:

- Daily exchanges of fire displaced ~60,000 Israelis from northern communities and ~100,000 Lebanese from southern Lebanon
- Casualties on both sides, though far fewer than Gaza
- Risk of full-scale war remained elevated throughout 2024-2025
- US diplomatic efforts focused on preventing escalation
- Any Gaza resolution must address northern security

Hezbollah is far more capable than Hamas: an estimated 150,000+ rockets and missiles, precision-guided munitions, experienced fighters from Syrian civil war, and a political role in Lebanese government. A full-scale Israel-Hezbollah war would be devastating for both countries and could draw in Iran directly.

**Egypt:**

Egypt occupies a critical but uncomfortable position:

- Controls Rafah crossing, the only non-Israeli access point to Gaza
- Has kept border largely closed, citing security concerns and refusal to absorb Palestinian refugees
- Quietly coordinates with Israel on Gaza security
- Domestic population strongly supports Palestinians; government must balance this against security relationship with Israel and US
- Mediates ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas

Egypt fears both instability spillover and being pressured to accept Gazan refugees permanently—which would relieve Israel of responsibility and potentially destabilize Sinai.

**Jordan:**

Jordan is uniquely exposed:

- Population is majority Palestinian origin (estimates vary from 50-70%)
- Hashemite monarchy's legitimacy partly rests on custodianship of Jerusalem holy sites
- Peace treaty with Israel is unpopular domestically
- Any mass Palestinian displacement threatens Jordanian stability
- Economy dependent on US aid and Gulf support

Jordan has been most vocal among peace partners in criticizing Israeli actions, while maintaining security cooperation. King Abdullah has warned that annexation or mass displacement could end the peace treaty.

**Gulf States:**

The wealthy Gulf monarchies (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait) have shifted from pan-Arab solidarity to pragmatic self-interest:

- **Saudi Arabia:** Regional heavyweight; normalization was being discussed pre-October 7; Crown Prince MBS now publicly conditions it on Palestinian state path
- **UAE:** Most enthusiastic normalizer; views Israel as technology and security partner; strategic hedge against Iran
- **Qatar:** Hosts Hamas political leadership; plays mediator role; funds Gaza (with Israeli agreement pre-October 7)
- **Kuwait:** Most traditionally pro-Palestinian Gulf state; no normalization moves

Gulf states fund UNRWA, humanitarian aid, and reconstruction—but rarely challenge Israeli actions forcefully. Their primary concerns are Iran, domestic stability, and economic diversification.

**Turkey:**

Under Erdogan, Turkey has become vocally pro-Palestinian:

- Harsh criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza
- Hosts Hamas figures
- Trade restrictions imposed post-October 7
- Public rhetoric among most aggressive of any major country
- Still maintains diplomatic relations; economic ties significant

Turkey uses the Palestinian cause for domestic political benefit and regional positioning but has limited practical influence.

**The Arab Street vs. Arab Governments:**

Throughout the region, public opinion is far more pro-Palestinian than government policy:

- Massive protests across Arab world after October 7 and during Gaza operations
- Social media amplifies Palestinian voices and images of destruction
- Governments suppress some protest activity while channeling anger away from themselves
- Gap between rulers and ruled on Palestine creates legitimacy challenges

This disconnect limits how far Arab governments can go in normalizing with Israel while Gaza burns—but hasn't fundamentally reversed the normalization trend.

## International Framework

**United Nations:**

The UN has been deeply involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1947, though its effectiveness is severely limited by great power dynamics.

Key UN bodies and roles:

- **UN General Assembly (UNGA):** Regularly passes resolutions critical of Israeli actions; not legally binding; Palestine has observer state status (since 2012)
- **UN Security Council (UNSC):** Can pass binding resolutions but US routinely vetoes measures critical of Israel; has passed some significant resolutions (242, 338, 2334)
- **UNRWA:** Provides services to Palestinian refugees; ~5.9 million registered refugees across the region; perennial funding crises; Israel and US have accused it of Hamas ties and cut funding
- **UN Human Rights Council:** Frequently criticizes Israel; has standing agenda item (Item 7) on occupied territories; Israel and US view as biased
- **UN Special Rapporteurs:** Issue reports on human rights in occupied territories; often highly critical

Key UN Security Council Resolutions:

| Resolution | Year | Key Provisions |
|------------|------|----------------|
| **181** | 1947 | Partition plan (never implemented) |
| **242** | 1967 | "Land for peace" formula; withdrawal from territories; right to secure borders |
| **338** | 1973 | Ceasefire after Yom Kippur War; reaffirms 242 |
| **1397** | 2002 | First to explicitly mention two-state solution |
| **2334** | 2016 | Declared settlements illegal; Obama abstained (didn't veto) |

The "land for peace" formula in Resolution 242 remains the nominal basis for international consensus, though its interpretation is disputed (withdrawal from "territories" vs. "the territories").

**International Law:**

Multiple international legal frameworks apply to the conflict:

**Occupation Law:**

- Fourth Geneva Convention (1949) governs treatment of civilian populations under occupation
- Prohibits: transfer of occupying power's population into occupied territory (settlements); collective punishment; destruction of property except for military necessity
- Israel disputes that Geneva Convention applies to West Bank and Gaza, arguing they were not sovereign territory of a state party

**International Humanitarian Law:**

- Distinction between combatants and civilians
- Proportionality in military operations
- Protection of civilian infrastructure (hospitals, schools, etc.)
- Both Israel and Palestinian armed groups have been accused of violations

**Human Rights Law:**

- International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
- International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
- Convention on the Rights of the Child
- Applies to all people under state control, including occupied populations

**International Criminal Court (ICC):**

The ICC has become increasingly relevant:

- Opened investigation into situation in Palestine (2021)
- ICC Pre-Trial Chamber issued arrest warrants (2024) for Israeli leaders including Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant, as well as Hamas leaders, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity
- Israel is not an ICC member and disputes jurisdiction
- US does not recognize ICC jurisdiction over non-member states
- Arrest warrants create legal exposure for Israeli officials traveling internationally

**International Court of Justice (ICJ):**

The ICJ has issued significant rulings:

- **2004 Advisory Opinion:** Found Israel's separation barrier in West Bank violates international law; Israel does not recognize ICJ jurisdiction on the matter
- **2024 Advisory Opinion:** Found Israeli occupation unlawful; called for end to occupation and evacuation of settlements; declared Israel's treatment of Palestinians apartheid; not binding but carries moral weight
- **Genocide Case (ongoing):** South Africa brought case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza; ICJ ordered provisional measures directing Israel to prevent genocidal acts; final ruling pending

These rulings strengthen the international legal case against occupation and current military operations but lack enforcement mechanisms.

**Recognition of Palestine:**

As of early 2026:

- **~145 countries** recognize the State of Palestine
- Recognition has accelerated since October 7 (Spain, Ireland, Norway, Slovenia, others joined in 2024)
- **Major non-recognizers:** United States, most of Western Europe historically (though this is changing), Canada, Australia, Japan
- Palestine has observer state status at UN; membership blocked by US veto threat
- Recognition is symbolic but shifts diplomatic weight and moral framing

**The "Rules-Based International Order" Problem:**

The conflict exposes contradictions in Western advocacy for international law:

- US and allies emphasize international law regarding Ukraine but appear to apply different standards to Israel
- This inconsistency undermines credibility in Global South
- Many countries see double standards as evidence of Western hypocrisy
- China and Russia exploit this for diplomatic advantage

**Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) Movement:**

The BDS movement, launched in 2005 by Palestinian civil society, calls for:

1. Ending the occupation and dismantling the barrier
2. Full equality for Palestinian citizens of Israel
3. Right of return for refugees

BDS tactics include:

- Consumer boycotts of Israeli products and companies operating in settlements
- Divestment campaigns targeting universities, pension funds, churches
- Pressure for government sanctions

BDS impact and controversy:

- Limited economic impact on Israel overall
- Some notable divestment decisions (individual companies, some university funds)
- Significant cultural and academic boycott participation
- Israel treats BDS as strategic threat; has established government ministry to counter it
- Critics call BDS antisemitic or unfairly singling out Israel; supporters call it nonviolent resistance
- Many US states have passed anti-BDS laws restricting government contracts with boycott participants
- Debate over BDS intersects with free speech and antisemitism discussions on US campuses

**International Aid:**

The Palestinian economy depends heavily on international aid:

- UNRWA provides education, healthcare, and services to refugees
- European Union is largest donor to Palestinian Authority
- US provided ~$500 million annually pre-Trump; funding has fluctuated with administrations
- Gulf states provide significant support, often tied to specific projects
- Aid dependence creates vulnerability to political conditions

Post-October 7, UNRWA faced existential crisis as Israel accused some staff of participating in the attack and major donors paused funding. Some funding has resumed but the agency remains under pressure.

**The International Consensus:**

Despite disagreements on specifics, a rough international consensus exists:

- Two-state solution based on 1967 lines with agreed modifications
- Jerusalem as shared capital
- Just solution for refugees
- Security guarantees for Israel
- End of occupation

This consensus is reflected in the Arab Peace Initiative (2002), various UN resolutions, Quartet statements, and most international peace proposals. However:

- Israeli government rejects key elements (Palestinian sovereignty, 1967 borders as baseline)
- Palestinian factions disagree on acceptable compromises
- The gap between international consensus and on-the-ground reality grows wider each year
- October 7 and the Gaza war have made implementation even less feasible in the near term
