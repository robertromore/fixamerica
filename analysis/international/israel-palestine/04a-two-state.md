# Two-State Solution

> **Note:** This document analyzes the two-state solution as of early 2026. For the overview and links to other solution frameworks, see [Solution Frameworks Overview](04-solution-frameworks.md).

## Definition

The two-state solution proposes partition of the territory between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea into two sovereign states:

- **Israel:** A Jewish state within approximately the 1967 borders (with possible land swaps)
- **Palestine:** An independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital

This framework has been the international consensus since the 1990s and remains official U.S., EU, and UN policy.

## Historical Development

### Origins

The idea of partition predates Israeli statehood:

- **Peel Commission (1937):** First official partition proposal
- **UN Resolution 181 (1947):** Partition plan that led to Israel's creation
- **UN Resolution 242 (1967):** "Land for peace" formula implying eventual two states
- **UN Resolution 338 (1973):** Affirmed 242 after Yom Kippur War

For decades, most Israelis supported a "Greater Israel" while the PLO rejected Israel's existence. The two-state solution was a fringe position on both sides.

### PLO Acceptance (1988)

The PLO's 1988 Declaration of Independence marked a fundamental shift:

- Accepted UN Resolution 181 (partition)
- Implicitly recognized Israel
- Declared Palestinian state in West Bank and Gaza
- Renounced terrorism (formalized in 1993)

This represented the Palestinian mainstream accepting less than full historical claims.

### Oslo Accords (1993-1995)

The Oslo process was meant to lead to two states:

- **Mutual recognition:** Israel recognized PLO as Palestinian representative; PLO recognized Israel
- **Interim arrangements:** Palestinian Authority would govern parts of West Bank and Gaza
- **Final status:** Borders, Jerusalem, refugees, security to be negotiated within five years

Oslo established the framework but never reached final status. The process collapsed in 2000.

### Camp David and Clinton Parameters (2000)

The most detailed two-state parameters emerged from Clinton administration efforts:

**Clinton Parameters (December 2000):**

| Issue | Proposed Resolution |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Territory** | Palestinian state on 94-96% of West Bank; land swaps for remainder |
| **Jerusalem** | Divided by demographics; Jewish areas to Israel, Arab areas to Palestine |
| **Holy Sites** | Palestinian sovereignty over Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount surface; Israeli sovereignty over Western Wall |
| **Refugees** | Right of return to Palestine, not Israel; compensation; limited family reunification |
| **Security** | Demilitarized Palestinian state; Israeli withdrawal over 3 years; international force |

Both sides expressed reservations; neither accepted before time ran out. Whether this was a missed opportunity remains debated.

### Geneva Initiative (2003)

Israeli and Palestinian civil society leaders produced a detailed model treaty showing what a two-state agreement could look like:

- 97.5% of West Bank to Palestine with land swaps
- Jerusalem divided; international regime for Old City holy sites
- Refugee return to Palestine plus compensation; symbolic Israeli admission of some refugees
- Phased implementation over years

The Geneva Initiative proved the technical parameters are solvable. The problem has never been the details—it's the political will to accept them.

### Arab Peace Initiative (2002)

The Arab League offered comprehensive peace:

- Full normalization with Israel by all Arab states
- In exchange for full Israeli withdrawal to 1967 lines
- Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as capital
- "Just solution" to refugee issue per UN Resolution 194

This remains the most comprehensive peace offer on the table. Israel has never formally responded.

### Subsequent Failures

Every subsequent initiative followed the same pattern:

- **Annapolis (2007-08):** Talks produced no agreement; Olmert offered more than any Israeli leader but was leaving office
- **Kerry Initiative (2013-14):** Nine months of talks collapsed over settlements and Palestinian UN moves
- **Trump Plan (2020):** Offered Palestinians archipelago of autonomy without real sovereignty; rejected without negotiation

## What Two States Would Require

### Territorial Parameters

**The 1967 lines** (Green Line) are the baseline, with modifications:

**Land swaps:** Israel would annex major settlement blocs near the Green Line (perhaps 3-5% of the West Bank); Palestine would receive equivalent territory from pre-1967 Israel.

| Settlement Bloc | Population | Likely Status |
|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| Modi'in Illit | ~80,000 | Annexed to Israel |
| Beitar Illit | ~60,000 | Annexed to Israel |
| Ma'ale Adumim | ~40,000 | Annexed to Israel (contentious—cuts West Bank) |
| Ariel | ~20,000 | Disputed—deep in West Bank |
| Gush Etzion | ~25,000 | Annexed to Israel |

**Problem:** These blocs can accommodate 70-80% of settlers, but ~150,000-200,000 settlers live outside them, deep in the West Bank. Evacuating them would require massive political capital Israel's leaders don't have.

**Contiguity:** Palestine must be territorially contiguous. Ma'ale Adumim's location threatens to bisect the West Bank. Gaza and West Bank must be connected (tunnel, corridor, or other arrangement).

### Jerusalem

The most emotionally charged issue. Parameters typically propose:

- **Division by demographics:** Jewish neighborhoods to Israel; Arab neighborhoods to Palestine
- **Capitals:** West Jerusalem is Israel's capital; East Jerusalem is Palestine's capital
- **Old City:** Various arrangements proposed:
    - International administration
    - Special regime with shared sovereignty
    - Division by quarter (Jewish/Armenian to Israel; Muslim/Christian to Palestine)
- **Holy Sites:** The most sensitive:
    - Western Wall: Israeli sovereignty
    - Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount: Palestinian or Waqf sovereignty over surface; various arrangements for subsurface and access

**Problem:** Any division of Jerusalem is politically toxic in Israel. The current government explicitly opposes it. Religious Zionists seek Jewish prayer rights on the Temple Mount, which Palestinians view as existentially threatening to Al-Aqsa.

### Refugees

The most difficult issue for Palestinians:

**Right of return:** UN Resolution 194 (1948) states refugees "wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so." Palestinians interpret this as an individual right; Israel views mass return as demographic elimination of the Jewish state.

**Typical parameters:**

- Return to Palestine (the new state), not Israel
- Compensation for lost property (international fund)
- Limited family reunification in Israel (perhaps 10,000-50,000 over years)
- Acknowledgment of suffering without full acceptance of responsibility
- International resettlement assistance

**Problem:** Palestinian leaders have never been able to publicly accept that refugees will not return to homes inside Israel. Doing so risks delegitimizing their leadership among refugee constituencies.

### Security

Israel's paramount concern:

**Typical parameters:**

- Demilitarized Palestinian state (no army, heavy weapons, or air force)
- Palestinian security forces for internal order
- Israeli control of airspace
- International force (perhaps NATO) in Jordan Valley
- Early warning stations
- Phased Israeli withdrawal
- Security coordination with regional states

**Problem:** "Demilitarized" makes Palestine look like less than a real state. Israeli security establishment questions whether any arrangements are sufficient after October 7 demonstrated catastrophic intelligence and border security failures.

### Recognition

**Israel demands:**

- Recognition as a Jewish state
- End of conflict/all claims
- Palestinian commitment to prevent terrorism

**Palestinians resist:**

- "Jewish state" language seen as prejudging refugee return and Palestinian citizens' status
- End of claims before all issues resolved risks abandoning leverage
- Cannot guarantee no violence from actors they don't control

## Current Status: Why Two States Is in Crisis

### Settlements

The most fundamental obstacle:

**Scale:** Over 700,000 settlers now live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem—triple the number at Oslo.

**Geography:** Settlements are distributed throughout the West Bank, connected by a network of roads, making contiguous Palestinian territory nearly impossible without massive evacuation.

**Political power:** Settlers are disproportionately represented in Israeli politics. The current coalition includes settler parties. Any government that tried to evacuate settlements would face coalition collapse, potential violence, and certain electoral defeat.

**Legal infrastructure:** Settlement land is privately owned, zoned, and serviced. Evacuation would require expropriation, compensation, and relocation—an enormous undertaking Israel's government refuses to contemplate.

**The arithmetic:** Even if 70-80% of settlers in blocs could be accommodated, 150,000-200,000 would need to move. Israel evacuated 8,000 settlers from Gaza in 2005; it traumatized Israeli society and is seen by many as having led to Hamas takeover. Evacuating 20-25 times that number is politically unimaginable in current Israeli politics.

### Israeli Politics

The Israeli political landscape has shifted fundamentally:

**No constituency for territorial compromise:**

- Labor Party (historic peace camp) has collapsed to single digits
- Centrist parties avoid two-state rhetoric
- Religious Zionist and ultra-Orthodox parties oppose any Palestinian state
- The Netanyahu coalition is the most right-wing in history
- October 7 hardened Israeli attitudes; trust in negotiations has collapsed

**Coalition dynamics:** Ben-Gvir and Smotrich can veto any moderation. They have explicitly stated they will collapse the government over any movement toward Palestinian statehood.

**Public opinion:** Jewish Israeli support for two states has declined from ~50% (pre-Second Intifada) to ~30%. Among younger Israelis, support is even lower. October 7 convinced many Israelis that territorial withdrawal brings rockets and terror, not peace.

**Assessment:** There is no plausible path to an Israeli government that would negotiate a viable two-state agreement in the foreseeable future.

### Palestinian Politics

Palestinian leadership cannot deliver two states either:

**Legitimacy crisis:** The PA has no democratic mandate (no elections since 2006). It is widely seen as corrupt, authoritarian, and complicit with occupation.

**Hamas-Fatah split:** Palestinians are divided between Fatah-controlled West Bank and Hamas-controlled Gaza. No unified leadership can negotiate or implement an agreement.

**Abbas succession:** President Abbas is 89 with no clear successor. His departure could trigger succession crisis.

**Constraints on compromise:** No Palestinian leader can sign away the right of return and survive politically. Refugee constituencies would reject any leader who did so.

**October 7 aftermath:** Hamas's attack, whatever one thinks of it, demonstrated that the PA's negotiation strategy produced nothing while armed resistance captured world attention. This undermines advocates of compromise.

**Assessment:** There is no Palestinian leadership positioned to negotiate and implement a two-state agreement.

### Gaza

The October 2023 war changed the situation fundamentally:

- Gaza is destroyed; no functioning governance
- Hamas is degraded but not eliminated
- Israel refuses any arrangement that could be seen as Hamas victory
- No agreed "day after" plan
- Reconstruction will take decades
- Gaza-West Bank link is more theoretical than ever

Any two-state solution must include Gaza, but Gaza is currently ungovernable.

### International Context

The international community remains nominally committed to two states but is unable or unwilling to act:

- **United States:** Rhetorically supports two states but won't condition aid; domestic politics prevent pressure on Israel
- **European Union:** Divided; individual countries recognize Palestine but EU takes no collective action
- **Arab states:** Abraham Accords showed normalization possible without Palestinian progress; Saudi leverage unused
- **United Nations:** Can pass resolutions but not compel compliance; U.S. veto blocks enforcement

### The Fait Accompli Argument

Many analysts argue two states is no longer physically possible:

- Settlements fragment the West Bank into disconnected enclaves
- Infrastructure (roads, water, power) integrates settlements with Israel
- East Jerusalem has been absorbed into greater Jerusalem
- Administrative, economic, and legal integration has advanced
- Reversing this would require political will that doesn't exist

Whether this is true depends on what "viable state" means. A Palestinian state in fragmented territory with Israeli-controlled borders, airspace, and aquifer might technically exist but wouldn't satisfy Palestinian aspirations.

## Arguments For Two States

Despite obstacles, proponents argue:

### It's the Only Solution with International Legitimacy

- UN, EU, Arab League, and (nominally) U.S. all support it
- It's the basis for international law (UN resolutions)
- Any other solution lacks comparable legitimacy

### Demographics Favor It

- Without two states, Israel faces a choice: democracy or Jewish majority
- Between the river and sea, Arabs will soon outnumber Jews
- Two states preserves Israel as a Jewish democratic state

### The Alternative is Worse

- Status quo leads to permanent occupation/apartheid
- One state means either endless conflict or end of Jewish state
- Two states is the only outcome both peoples might eventually accept

### Parameters Are Known

- Every negotiation has converged on similar terms
- Technical solutions exist (Geneva Initiative)
- What's missing is political will, which could change

### History Shows Surprises Happen

- Begin made peace with Egypt despite Likud ideology
- Rabin shook Arafat's hand despite decades of enmity
- Political transformations can occur suddenly

## Arguments Against Two States

Critics argue:

### It's Dead on the Ground

- 700,000+ settlers won't be moved
- Infrastructure integration is irreversible
- No Israeli government will evacuate settlements
- The window has closed

### It Never Addressed Core Issues

- Palestinian right of return was never accommodated
- Jerusalem was never truly resolved
- Security arrangements left Palestine less than sovereign
- The "state" offered was always a Bantustan

### It Legitimized Occupation

- Oslo gave Israel cover to expand settlements while "negotiating"
- Interim arrangements became permanent
- The "peace process" managed conflict without resolving it

### Neither Leadership Can Deliver

- Israeli politics doesn't permit it
- Palestinian politics doesn't permit it
- There is no partner on either side

### October 7 Changed Everything

- Israeli trauma precludes territorial withdrawal
- Security establishment opposes reduced presence
- Hamas demonstrated what happens when Israel withdraws

## Feasibility Assessment

### Israeli Acceptance

**What would be required:**

- Collapse of current coalition
- Rise of centrist/left coalition willing to negotiate
- Public shift accepting territorial compromise
- Willingness to evacuate 150,000+ settlers
- Security establishment endorsement
- Overcoming October 7 trauma

**Current trajectory:** Moving away from these conditions, not toward them.

**Assessment:** Highly unlikely in any foreseeable timeframe.

### Palestinian Acceptance

**What would be required:**

- Unified Palestinian leadership (Fatah-Hamas reconciliation or Hamas marginalization)
- Leadership with legitimacy to negotiate
- Willingness to accept limited return of refugees
- Ability to guarantee security
- Democratic renewal or succession process

**Current trajectory:** PA is weaker than ever; Hamas is degraded but not eliminated; no succession plan.

**Assessment:** Unlikely without major changes.

### External Pressure

**What would be required:**

- U.S. willingness to condition aid on settlement freeze/negotiations
- European economic pressure
- Arab states conditioning normalization on Palestinian progress
- Sustained international focus

**Current trajectory:** U.S. won't use leverage; EU is divided; Abraham Accords proceeded without Palestinian conditions.

**Assessment:** No major power is willing to apply serious pressure on Israel.

### Bottom Line

The two-state solution remains the international consensus because:

1. No alternative has comparable legitimacy
2. Abandoning it requires accepting something worse
3. Diplomatic inertia sustains official positions

But honest assessment suggests:

1. There is no plausible path to implementation under current conditions
2. The conditions required for implementation are not emerging
3. Continuing to invoke two states may be providing cover for permanent occupation

## What Would Revive Two States?

If two states were to become viable again, it would require:

### Major Israeli Political Shift

- Security establishment publicly declaring occupation unsustainable
- Centrist/left coalition forming around territorial compromise
- Public trauma response shifting from fortress mentality to seeking political solution
- International isolation making status quo costly

### Palestinian Political Renewal

- New leadership with legitimacy and mandate
- Fatah-Hamas reconciliation or clear Hamas defeat
- Strategic decision to accept parameters similar to Clinton/Geneva
- Grassroots support for negotiated outcome

### Changed External Environment

- U.S. conditioning aid on settlement freeze and good-faith negotiations
- Saudi Arabia conditioning normalization on credible Palestinian state path
- EU economic pressure (settlement product bans, etc.)
- Sustained international diplomatic offensive

### Crisis That Changes Calculus

- Economic crisis making conflict costs unbearable
- Regional war that forces new arrangements
- Internal Israeli crisis (civil conflict over character of state)
- Leadership emergence with vision and courage

None of these appears imminent, but history shows conditions can change rapidly.

## Implications for U.S. Policy

### Current U.S. Position

The United States nominally supports two states but:

- Refuses to condition aid on Israeli behavior
- Vetoes UN resolutions critical of Israel
- Does not pressure Israel on settlements
- Domestic politics make pressure costly
- Has not articulated consequences for ongoing annexation

This creates a contradictory policy: supporting two states in theory while enabling their impossibility in practice.

### Policy Options

**Option 1: Continue current approach**

- Maintain rhetorical commitment to two states
- Avoid conditioning aid
- Hope for future opportunities
- Manage conflict without resolving it

*Assessment:* This is the path of least resistance but likely leads to permanent occupation.

**Option 2: Active pressure**

- Condition some aid on settlement freeze
- Support UN resolutions
- Recognize Palestine
- Articulate consequences for annexation

*Assessment:* Would face fierce domestic political opposition; uncertain effectiveness.

**Option 3: Acknowledge reality**

- State publicly that two states is not currently achievable
- Focus on rights and conditions rather than final status
- Prevent formal annexation while not pretending partition is imminent

*Assessment:* Honest but offers no path forward; risks being seen as abandoning Palestinians.

**Option 4: Regional approach**

- Focus on Saudi normalization with Palestinian conditions
- Build Arab coalition for Palestinian state
- Use normalization leverage to extract Israeli concessions

*Assessment:* Current Israeli government won't accept Palestinian state even for Saudi normalization.

## Conclusion

The two-state solution remains the internationally endorsed framework for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It offers the only outcome that both peoples might eventually accept—a Jewish democratic state alongside an independent Palestine.

However, honest assessment in early 2026 must acknowledge:

1. **The conditions for two states don't exist.** Israeli politics has moved decisively against territorial compromise. Palestinian leadership lacks the legitimacy and unity to negotiate and implement an agreement. Settlements have fragmented the territory.

2. **No actor is positioned to change this.** The United States won't use its leverage. Arab states have shown normalization doesn't require Palestinian progress. The EU is divided. The UN is blocked.

3. **October 7 has hardened both societies.** Israeli trauma reinforces opposition to withdrawal. Palestinian despair at decades of failed negotiations combined with the devastation of Gaza undermines faith in compromise.

4. **Continuing to invoke two states may enable occupation.** If the "peace process" provides diplomatic cover for settlement expansion without ever producing peace, it serves Israeli interests, not Palestinian ones.

This does not mean two states is permanently impossible—only that it is not achievable under current conditions, and those conditions are not changing in favorable directions.

The question becomes: What policies make sense when the official solution is not implementable? This question frames the analysis of alternative frameworks.
