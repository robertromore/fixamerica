# Framework Comparison

## Purpose

This document provides a side-by-side comparison of the major solution frameworks to assess their relative strengths, weaknesses, and viability.

## Comparison Matrix

| Criterion | Two-State | One-State (Binational) | Confederation |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| **International Support** | High | Low | Emerging |
| **Israeli Acceptance** | Declining | Very Low | Low |
| **Palestinian Acceptance** | Mixed | Mixed | Unknown |
| **Addresses Settlements** | Partially (swaps) | Fully (irrelevant) | Fully (remain in place) |
| **Addresses Refugees** | Partially | Fully | Partially to Fully |
| **Preserves Jewish State** | Yes | No | Yes (within Israel) |
| **Palestinian Self-Determination** | Yes | Contested | Yes |
| **Security Viability** | Challenged | Very Challenged | Challenged |
| **Implementation Path** | Exists (Oslo framework) | None | Would need creation |

## Issue-by-Issue Analysis

### Settlements

| Framework | Approach | Challenges |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Two-State | Major blocs to Israel via swaps; others evacuated | Political resistance to evacuation; swap equity |
| One-State | Settlers become citizens of unified state | Land ownership disputes; power dynamics |
| Confederation | Settlers remain as Israeli citizens under Palestinian sovereignty | Security; reciprocity; enforcement |

### Jerusalem

| Framework | Approach | Challenges |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Two-State | Division along demographic lines; special holy sites regime | Physical complexity; religious site control |
| One-State | Unified city in unified state | Governance disputes; identity |
| Confederation | Shared/joint capital of both states | Symbolic challenges; practical governance |

### Refugees

| Framework | Approach | Challenges |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Two-State | Return to Palestinian state; limited return to Israel; compensation | Right of return symbolism; numbers |
| One-State | Full return rights | Absorption capacity; property |
| Confederation | Return to either state with citizenship in Palestine | Numbers; Israeli concerns; property |

### Security

| Framework | Approach | Challenges |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Two-State | Demilitarized Palestine; Israeli security arrangements | Palestinian sovereignty; enforcement |
| One-State | Unified security forces | Integration; trust; power dynamics |
| Confederation | Coordinated security; possible joint forces | Trust; coordination; asymmetry |

## Viability Assessment

### Two-State: Declining but Not Dead

*To be developed*

- Obstacles growing
- Still most internationally supported
- Would require significant changes

### One-State: Theoretically Coherent, Practically Remote

*To be developed*

- Neither side wants it
- Would require massive transformation
- Risk of civil conflict

### Confederation: Innovative but Untested

*To be developed*

- Growing intellectual interest
- Addresses key obstacles creatively
- Requires unprecedented cooperation

## Hybrid Approaches

*To be developed*

- Phased approaches
- Parallel state structures
- Interim arrangements

## Conclusion

*To be developed*

- No easy solutions
- All frameworks face serious obstacles
- Key variables that could shift viability
