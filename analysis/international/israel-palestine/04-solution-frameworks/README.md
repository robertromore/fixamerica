# Solution Frameworks

## Overview

This section analyzes the major frameworks proposed for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Each framework is evaluated on its merits, challenges, and viability.

## Frameworks Analyzed

| Framework | Description | Primary Advocates |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Two-State Solution](two-state.md) | Independent Israeli and Palestinian states based roughly on 1967 lines | International consensus, most governments |
| [One-State Solution](one-state.md) | Single state with various governance models | Some academics, activists on both sides |
| [Confederation](confederation.md) | Two sovereign states with shared institutions | Growing academic/policy interest |
| [Comparison](comparison.md) | Side-by-side analysis of frameworks | - |

## Evaluation Criteria

Each framework is assessed against:

1. **Feasibility** - Can it realistically be implemented?
2. **Security** - Does it address Israeli and Palestinian security needs?
3. **Self-determination** - Does it satisfy national aspirations?
4. **Rights** - Does it protect individual and collective rights?
5. **Sustainability** - Can it endure over time?
6. **Justice** - Does it address historical grievances?
7. **Practicality** - What are the implementation challenges?

## Key Questions for All Frameworks

- What happens to Israeli settlements?
- What is the status of Jerusalem?
- How are Palestinian refugees addressed?
- What are the security arrangements?
- How is water and resources managed?
- What are the economic arrangements?
- What role do external actors play?
