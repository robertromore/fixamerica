# Other Frameworks

> **Note:** This document analyzes alternative approaches as of early 2026. For the overview and links to other solution frameworks, see [Solution Frameworks Overview](04-solution-frameworks.md).

## Overview

Beyond the major frameworks (two-state, one-state, confederation), other approaches to the conflict deserve examination:

| Approach | Core Idea |
|----------|-----------|
| **Status quo management** | Not solving the conflict but managing it |
| **Economic peace** | Prosperity as substitute for political resolution |
| **Regional integration** | Abraham Accords model—bypass Palestinians |
| **International law approach** | Enforcement through ICC, ICJ, sanctions |
| **Grassroots reconciliation** | Bottom-up civil society transformation |
| **Separation/disengagement** | Unilateral Israeli withdrawal without agreement |

These are not typically presented as "solutions" equivalent to two-state or one-state frameworks. But they reflect actual policies being pursued and deserve analysis.

## Status Quo Management

### What It Means

Status quo management accepts that the conflict cannot be resolved in the foreseeable future and focuses instead on:

- Preventing escalation to major war
- Maintaining security (primarily Israeli)
- Managing humanitarian conditions (minimally)
- Preserving diplomatic fiction of ongoing "peace process"

This is not an official policy anyone endorses—no one says "our policy is permanent occupation"—but it describes what is actually happening.

### Current Status Quo

**West Bank:**

- Israeli military control of entire territory
- PA administers Palestinian population centers with limited autonomy
- Settlement expansion continues
- Security coordination prevents major attacks
- Periodic raids and arrests maintain control
- Living conditions decline but don't produce mass revolt

**Gaza (pre-October 2023):**

- Hamas governs under Israeli blockade
- "Mowing the grass" approach: periodic military operations degrade Hamas capabilities
- Blockade maintains minimum humanitarian conditions to prevent total collapse
- No political resolution pursued
- Occasional escalations managed through ceasefires

**Gaza (post-October 2023):**

- Massive military operation destroyed Hamas governance
- No replacement governance established
- Humanitarian catastrophe ongoing
- Israel controls all access but refuses responsibility
- No "day after" plan

### Israeli Perspective

For many in Israel, the status quo was acceptable:

- Security cooperation kept terrorism low
- Economic costs of occupation were manageable
- International criticism was weatherable
- No domestic political cost—Israeli public supported it
- "We have no partner" absolved Israel of action

October 7 shattered the illusion that the status quo was stable. But the response has been military, not political—addressing the symptom (Hamas), not the cause (occupation).

### Why Status Quo Persists

**Power asymmetry:** Israel can maintain control indefinitely with current resources
**Domestic politics:** Israeli public doesn't demand change; any compromise is costly
**External enablement:** U.S. support removes pressure
**Palestinian division:** No unified Palestinian position to respond to
**International passivity:** Condemnation without consequences

### Problems with Status Quo

**October 7 demonstrated instability:**

- The "managed conflict" exploded catastrophically
- 1,200 Israelis killed—worst day since the Holocaust
- Status quo clearly did not provide security

**Humanitarian costs:**

- Gaza destroyed; mass civilian casualties
- West Bank conditions deteriorating
- Generations growing up under occupation

**Legal exposure:**

- ICC arrest warrants for Israeli leaders
- ICJ ruling that occupation is illegal
- Growing international isolation

**Demographic pressure:**

- Arabs becoming majority between river and sea
- Cannot maintain both Jewish state and democracy indefinitely

**Moral corruption:**

- Occupation corrupts Israeli society
- Military ethics erode
- Democratic values undermined

### Assessment

Status quo management is not a solution—it is the absence of a solution. It can persist but at increasing cost in lives, legitimacy, and stability. October 7 showed that "managing" the conflict rather than resolving it produces periodic catastrophes.

The question is whether Israel (and the U.S.) will continue this approach despite the evidence, or whether catastrophe will force reconsideration.

## Economic Peace

### The Concept

Economic development as substitute for political resolution:

- Improve Palestinian living standards
- Create economic interdependence
- Prosperity reduces incentives for violence
- Political issues can wait; economics comes first

This has been associated with Benjamin Netanyahu, who has explicitly rejected political negotiations while advocating "economic peace."

### Historical Versions

**1990s development approach:**

- Oslo assumed economic development would accompany political process
- International donors poured billions into Palestinian economy
- Theory: rising living standards would create constituency for peace

**Netanyahu's "economic peace":**

- Explicitly delinked from political resolution
- Improve conditions without addressing sovereignty
- Increased work permits for Gazans (pre-October 7)
- Palestinian economic growth without Palestinian state

**Trump administration "Peace to Prosperity":**

- Economic vision accompanying political plan
- $50 billion investment promised
- Assumed Palestinians would accept less than statehood for economic benefits

### Why It Doesn't Work

**Politics can't be bypassed:**

- Palestinians don't want better economic conditions under occupation—they want freedom
- No population has accepted permanent subjugation in exchange for prosperity
- National movements cannot be bought off

**Economic development under occupation is limited:**

- Movement restrictions constrain business
- Israeli control of borders, water, land limits growth
- Area C (60% of West Bank) unavailable for Palestinian development
- Political instability deters investment

**Dependency, not development:**

- Palestinian economy is structurally dependent on Israel
- Work permits can be revoked (as they were post-October 7)
- Tax revenues can be withheld
- This is leverage, not partnership

**History:**

- Pre-October 7 Gaza had the most work permits in years
- Economic conditions in Gaza were improving slightly
- It didn't prevent October 7

### Assessment

Economic peace is not a framework for resolution—it's a framework for avoiding resolution. It may marginally improve conditions while maintaining occupation, but it cannot address the fundamental conflict.

Palestinians are not fighting because they're poor. They're fighting because they're occupied. Economic development under occupation addresses the wrong problem.

## Abraham Accords Model

### The Concept

Normalization between Israel and Arab states without Palestinian consent or progress:

- Arab states have their own interests (security, economy, technology)
- Palestinian cause shouldn't hold these hostage
- Normalization first; Palestinian issues later (or never)
- Regional integration benefits everyone; Palestinians will eventually accept

### What Happened

**Abraham Accords (2020):**

- UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan normalized relations with Israel
- No Palestinian consent sought
- No Israeli commitments on Palestinian issues
- Various quid pro quos (F-35s for UAE, Western Sahara recognition for Morocco, etc.)

**Saudi pursuit (2023):**

- Biden administration working on Saudi-Israel normalization
- Saudi demands: U.S. security treaty, civilian nuclear program
- Palestinian dimension unclear—would some token gesture suffice?
- October 7 disrupted timeline but didn't end pursuit

### Implications for Palestinians

**Weakened leverage:**

- Traditional Palestinian strategy assumed Arab support
- Normalization without Palestinian progress undermines this
- "Arab street" pressure on governments has diminished
- Palestinians increasingly isolated

**Counter-argument:**

- Saudi normalization now reportedly requires Palestinian state path
- October 7 reminded Arab governments of domestic sentiment
- Full normalization may still require Palestinian progress

### Assessment

The Abraham Accords model is a framework for Israel to achieve regional integration without addressing Palestinians. It has worked to some degree—four countries normalized.

Whether it can work with Saudi Arabia—the prize—remains uncertain. Saudi normalization would be transformational for Israel and might indeed produce pressure for some Palestinian concessions. Or it might demonstrate that Palestinians are truly abandoned.

This is not a solution framework for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict—it's a framework for sidelining Palestinians while Israel pursues other interests.

## International Law Approach

### The Concept

Rather than negotiated settlement, achieve Palestinian rights through international law enforcement:

- ICC prosecutions of Israeli leaders
- ICJ rulings establishing legal violations
- UN General Assembly resolutions
- Sanctions by states and private entities
- BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement

### Current Status

**International Court of Justice (ICJ):**

- 2004: Separation barrier illegal in occupied territory
- 2024: Occupation itself is illegal; must end; settlements must be evacuated
- Ongoing genocide case (South Africa v. Israel)
- Advisory opinions lack direct enforcement but establish legal consensus

**International Criminal Court (ICC):**

- Investigation of situation in Palestine ongoing since 2021
- 2024: Arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant, and Hamas leaders
- Israel not a member; disputes jurisdiction
- Warrants create legal exposure for Israeli officials traveling to ICC member states

**UN General Assembly:**

- Regular resolutions critical of Israel (non-binding)
- 2012: Palestine upgraded to observer state status
- 2024: Multiple resolutions demanding ceasefire
- Growing recognition of Palestine (~145 countries)

**BDS Movement:**

- Consumer boycotts, academic boycotts, corporate divestment
- Some successes (companies exiting settlements; academic association boycotts)
- Limited overall economic impact
- Significant as political and moral pressure

### Limitations

**Enforcement gap:**

- International law lacks enforcement mechanisms
- Israel ignores rulings it rejects
- U.S. blocks Security Council enforcement
- ICC warrants are only effective in member states

**Time horizon:**

- Legal processes take years
- South Africa sanctions took decades to change behavior
- Palestinians cannot wait generations

**Israeli response:**

- Delegitimization of international institutions
- Accusations of antisemitism
- Legislation against BDS
- Refusal to cooperate with investigations

**American veto:**

- U.S. has blocked UN enforcement consistently
- U.S. opposes ICC jurisdiction over Israel
- Without U.S. shift, international law approach lacks teeth

### Assessment

International law establishes moral and legal clarity but lacks enforcement power. It can:

- Document violations for historical record
- Create legal exposure affecting Israeli leaders' travel and commerce
- Build moral case for future pressure
- Support Palestinian claims in any eventual negotiation

It cannot, by itself, end the occupation or achieve Palestinian statehood. It is a tool, not a solution framework.

## Grassroots Reconciliation

### The Concept

Bottom-up transformation rather than top-down negotiation:

- People-to-people contact builds relationships
- Civil society cooperation creates constituencies for peace
- Changed attitudes eventually produce changed politics
- Peace requires popular acceptance, which requires relationship-building

### Examples

**Joint organizations:**

- Combatants for Peace (former Israeli soldiers and Palestinian fighters)
- Parents Circle Families Forum (bereaved families from both sides)
- Standing Together (Jewish-Arab political organizing in Israel)
- Seeds of Peace (youth leadership programs)

**Professional cooperation:**

- Medical collaborations
- Environmental partnerships (water, nature conservation)
- Business relationships
- Academic exchanges (before boycotts)

### Value

- These organizations save and change individual lives
- They demonstrate that cooperation is possible
- They preserve hope and relationships during dark times
- They could form the basis for implementation if political agreement is reached

### Limitations

**Scale:**

- Thousands of participants in a population of millions
- Cannot reach sufficient scale to change political dynamics
- Most Israelis and Palestinians have no contact with each other

**Power imbalance:**

- Grassroots work assumes some equality between parties
- Occupation is inherently unequal
- "Normalization" with occupier is criticized by Palestinian activists

**Political irrelevance:**

- Grassroots support for peace existed during Oslo; leaders failed anyway
- Grassroots opposition to peace (settlers, Hamas) has political power; grassroots peace movements don't
- Israeli civil society critical of occupation has been marginalized

**Post-October 7:**

- Joint organizations have faced enormous pressure
- Contact between societies largely severed
- Trust at historic low; reconciliation activities seem impossible now

### Assessment

Grassroots reconciliation is valuable but cannot substitute for political resolution. It works best as complement to a peace process—building support for agreements leaders negotiate. Without political progress, grassroots work becomes increasingly difficult and marginal.

It is not a framework for resolution but a necessary component of any framework's success.

## Unilateral Separation/Disengagement

### The Concept

Israel withdraws from Palestinian territory unilaterally, without agreement:

- Evacuates settlements in some areas
- Draws its own borders
- Builds barriers
- Maintains security control from outside
- Doesn't negotiate because "there's no partner"

### Precedent: Gaza 2005

**What happened:**

- Sharon government unilaterally withdrew from Gaza
- Evacuated 8,000 settlers
- Demolished settlements
- Withdrew military (maintaining blockade)
- No negotiation with Palestinians

**Israeli narrative:**

- "We left Gaza and got rockets"
- Withdrawal led to Hamas takeover
- Proved that withdrawal brings terrorism
- Never again

**Palestinian narrative:**

- Withdrawal without agreement left no government
- Blockade continued; Gaza remained occupied in effect
- No coordination meant no functioning transition
- Israel created the chaos it blames on Palestinians

### Proposed West Bank Separation

Various Israeli leaders have proposed unilateral separation from the West Bank:

**Concept:**

- Define unilateral borders incorporating settlement blocs
- Build barriers along that line
- Leave settlements outside the barrier (unclear fate)
- Maintain security control over Jordan Valley
- Declare Israeli border; let Palestinians figure out the rest

**Proponents:**

- Some in Israeli center-left see this as "saving Israel" from demographic threat
- Avoids negotiating with "non-partner"
- Preserves Jewish majority within defined borders
- Could be implemented domestically without Palestinian consent

### Problems

**Doesn't end conflict:**

- Palestinians won't accept unilaterally imposed borders
- Jordan Valley control means not a real Palestinian state
- Jerusalem issues unresolved
- Refugees unaddressed
- Continued resistance likely

**Settlers:**

- Many settlers are outside proposed separation lines
- Evacuating them faces same political obstacles as negotiated solution
- Current government would never accept evacuation

**Security:**

- Does withdrawing military control improve or damage security?
- Gaza precedent suggests withdrawal without agreement produces vacuum
- October 7 originated from territory Israel "left"

**International rejection:**

- Unilateral borders won't be recognized
- Doesn't end occupation in international law
- Israel remains responsible for territory it controls

### Assessment

Unilateral separation is a framework for Israel to manage the conflict without negotiation, not for resolving it. It might define defensible Israeli borders but doesn't produce Palestinian self-determination.

In practice, it shares many of the political obstacles of negotiated solutions (settler evacuation) while lacking the benefits (international recognition, end of conflict).

## The Problem with "Alternatives"

The proliferation of approaches beyond two-state and one-state frameworks reflects desperation more than creativity. Each approach:

**Status quo:** Not a solution—it's the absence of one

**Economic peace:** Avoids political resolution rather than achieving it

**Abraham Accords:** Sidelines Palestinians rather than addressing them

**International law:** Establishes rights but can't enforce them

**Grassroots reconciliation:** Complements political resolution but can't substitute for it

**Unilateral separation:** Imposes Israeli preferences without achieving peace

None of these is a framework for ending the conflict. They are strategies for managing it, avoiding it, or addressing peripheral aspects of it.

## What This Reveals

The survey of alternative approaches reinforces a sobering conclusion:

**There is no solution available under current conditions.**

- Two-state: Israeli politics won't allow it; Palestinian politics can't deliver it
- One-state: Neither side accepts any variant
- Confederation: Requires solving two-state problems first
- Status quo: Produces periodic catastrophes
- Alternatives: Don't address the core conflict

The obstacle is not lack of creative thinking. The obstacle is the underlying conditions:

1. Israel has no incentive to compromise (power asymmetry, U.S. support)
2. Palestinians have no leverage (occupation, division, weakness)
3. Both societies have been traumatized and distrust each other
4. Spoilers can undermine any progress
5. External powers won't apply pressure

Until these conditions change, no framework will succeed. The question for policy is:

**What could change these conditions?**

That is the subject of the comparative assessment.
