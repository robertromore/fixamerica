# Comparative Assessment

> **Note:** This document provides comparative analysis and U.S. policy implications as of early 2026. For the overview and links to other solution frameworks, see [Solution Frameworks Overview](04-solution-frameworks.md).

## Purpose

This document synthesizes the analysis of solution frameworks to answer three questions:

1. **Feasibility:** Which frameworks are actually achievable under various scenarios?
2. **Conditions:** What would need to change for different outcomes to become possible?
3. **U.S. Policy:** What can and should the United States do?

## Feasibility Matrix

### Assessment Criteria

Each framework is assessed against:

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Israeli acceptance** | Would any plausible Israeli government agree? |
| **Palestinian acceptance** | Would Palestinians accept and could leaders deliver? |
| **Implementation** | Are there practical mechanisms to achieve it? |
| **Stability** | Would the outcome be sustainable? |
| **International support** | Would external powers back it? |

### Comparative Assessment (Early 2026)

| Framework | Israeli | Palestinian | Implementation | Stability | International | Overall |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Two-state (viable) | Very Low | Uncertain | Very Low | Medium | High | **Not achievable** |
| Two-state (Bantustan) | Medium | Very Low | Medium | Very Low | Low | **Unstable** |
| Democratic one-state | Zero | Low | Zero | Unknown | Low | **Impossible** |
| Binational state | Very Low | Low | Very Low | Very Low | Low | **Not achievable** |
| Greater Israel + citizenship | Zero | Medium | Low | Very Low | Very Low | **Impossible** |
| Greater Israel - citizenship | High | Zero | High | Low | Very Low | **De facto reality** |
| Confederation | Very Low | Low | Very Low | Unknown | Medium | **Not achievable** |
| Status quo | High | Zero | High | Low | Low | **Current trajectory** |

### Key Findings

**No framework is currently achievable that provides:**

- Palestinian self-determination
- Israeli security acceptance
- International legitimacy
- Long-term stability

**The trajectory is toward Greater Israel without citizenship:**

- Israeli politics supports this
- It's implementable (Israel has the power)
- International opposition exists but lacks enforcement
- It's unstable but sustainable for now

**The gap between what's legitimate and what's achievable:**

- Two-state has international legitimacy but isn't achievable
- Status quo/Greater Israel is achievable but lacks legitimacy
- No framework bridges this gap

## Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: Current Trajectory Continues

**What happens:**

- Israel maintains control over all territory
- Settlements expand; Area C is incrementally annexed
- PA weakens further; may collapse
- Gaza remains destroyed and blockaded
- Periodic military operations continue
- International isolation grows slowly
- U.S. continues unconditional support

**Likely outcomes:**

- De facto one-state without citizenship (apartheid)
- Periodic violence (October 7-scale or smaller)
- Growing international isolation but no enforcement
- Palestinian resistance continues indefinitely
- Israel's democratic character erodes

**Probability:** High (this is the default)

### Scenario 2: International Pressure Materializes

**What would trigger it:**

- U.S. domestic political shift (progressive movement gains power)
- European economic sanctions
- Saudi Arabia conditions normalization on Palestinian state
- ICC/ICJ pressure forces consequences

**What happens:**

- Israel faces economic or diplomatic costs
- Costs change Israeli political calculation
- Israeli public begins to question status quo
- Negotiation becomes preferable to isolation

**What could result:**

- Renewed two-state negotiations
- Some settlement evacuation
- Palestinian state with varying degrees of sovereignty

**Probability:** Low-Medium (requires major external shifts)

### Scenario 3: Palestinian Political Transformation

**What would trigger it:**

- New Palestinian leadership emerges with legitimacy
- Fatah-Hamas reconciliation or one side decisively wins
- Genuine democratic elections held
- Mass nonviolent movement captures international attention

**What happens:**

- Palestinians have unified position and credible leadership
- International support increases
- Negotiations become possible
- Israeli "no partner" excuse removed

**What could result:**

- Two-state negotiations with credible Palestinian party
- Increased international pressure on Israel
- Potential for agreement if Israeli politics also shifts

**Probability:** Low (Palestinian political system is paralyzed; October 7 aftermath complicates)

### Scenario 4: Israeli Political Transformation

**What would trigger it:**

- Coalition collapse; centrist government forms
- Security establishment publicly declares occupation unsustainable
- October 7 accountability process discredits current leadership
- Economic crisis makes status quo costly

**What happens:**

- New Israeli government open to territorial compromise
- Settlement freeze announced
- Negotiations begin seriously

**What could result:**

- Two-state agreement or interim arrangements
- Settler evacuation (some)
- Palestinian state with significant sovereignty

**Probability:** Low (Israeli politics has moved away from this; no near-term path)

### Scenario 5: Regional War

**What could trigger it:**

- Israel-Hezbollah escalation becomes full war
- Iran-Israel direct conflict
- Regional conflagration involving multiple states

**What happens:**

- Massive casualties and destruction
- International intervention
- Post-war settlement imposed or negotiated

**What could result:**

- Regional conference (like post-WWI or post-WWII)
- Externally imposed boundaries
- International forces
- Unpredictable outcomes

**Probability:** Medium (tensions are high; miscalculation possible)

### Scenario 6: Israeli Internal Crisis

**What would trigger it:**

- Judicial/constitutional crisis escalates
- Civil conflict between secular and religious
- Economic crisis
- Mass emigration of secular professionals

**What happens:**

- Israel consumed by internal conflict
- External issues become secondary
- Potential for fundamental political change

**What could result:**

- Unpredictable—could produce more moderate government or more extreme
- Internal focus might reduce external pressure
- Or crisis could create opening for external intervention

**Probability:** Medium (tensions exist but crisis not imminent)

## What Would Need to Change

For any resolution framework to become viable, fundamental conditions must change:

### The Core Obstacles

| Obstacle | Current Status | What Would Change It |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Israeli political consensus against Palestinian state** | Strong | Coalition collapse; security establishment shift; external pressure; internal crisis |
| **U.S. unconditional support** | Unchanged | Domestic political shift; progressive movement; extreme Israeli action crossing redlines |
| **Palestinian division** | Entrenched | Generational transition; one side winning; genuine reconciliation process |
| **Mutual distrust** | At historic high | Time; leadership change; confidence-building measures; external mediation |
| **Settlement facts on ground** | Expanding | Serious evacuation effort (requires Israeli political shift first) |
| **Post-October 7 trauma** | Acute | Time; accountability processes; changed security environment |

### Necessary Conditions for Two-State

For two-state to become achievable:

1. **Israeli political shift:** Government willing to evacuate significant settlements and accept Palestinian sovereignty
2. **Palestinian reunification:** Unified leadership with legitimacy to negotiate and deliver
3. **U.S. pressure:** Willingness to condition aid or apply serious diplomatic pressure
4. **Regional leverage:** Saudi normalization tied to Palestinian state progress
5. **International coordination:** EU, UN acting in concert with U.S.
6. **Security arrangements:** Framework addressing Israeli concerns post-October 7

Each of these is currently absent. All would need to materialize.

### Necessary Conditions for Stable One-State

For democratic one-state to become achievable:

1. **Israeli acceptance of end of Jewish state:** This would require complete transformation of Israeli society—not foreseeable
2. **Palestinian acceptance of integration rather than self-determination:** Uncertain
3. **Power-sharing trust:** After October 7 and Gaza? Not in any near horizon
4. **External enforcement:** No one would impose this

This framework is not achievable under any realistic scenario.

### Necessary Conditions for Status Quo to Become Untenable

For Israel to abandon the current trajectory:

1. **Costs must exceed benefits:** Currently, costs are manageable
2. **Security must fail:** October 7 demonstrated failure, but response was military, not political
3. **International isolation must bite:** Currently it doesn't
4. **Domestic opposition must grow:** Currently marginalized

The status quo could become untenable through:

- Another catastrophic security failure
- Economic crisis linked to isolation
- Mass Palestinian uprising
- U.S. political shift
- Regional war with uncontrollable consequences

## Implications for U.S. Policy

### U.S. Interests

The United States has genuine interests in this conflict:

| Interest | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Israeli security** | Israel is an ally; its survival matters |
| **Regional stability** | Conflict destabilizes broader Middle East |
| **Counterterrorism** | Conflict feeds extremism |
| **International law** | Credibility of rules-based order |
| **Human rights** | Values require protecting civilian lives |
| **Oil/energy** | Regional instability affects markets |
| **Relations with Arab/Muslim world** | Conflict damages U.S. standing |

These interests pull in different directions. Unconditional support for Israel serves the first but undermines the others.

### Current U.S. Policy

**Stated position:**

- Support for two-state solution
- Israel's right to self-defense
- Opposition to settlements (officially)
- Support for humanitarian access
- Opposition to "extremism" on both sides

**Actual policy:**

- Unconditional military aid ($3.8 billion annual + supplemental)
- Diplomatic protection (UN vetoes)
- Refusal to condition aid on Israeli behavior
- Minimal pressure on settlement expansion
- Statements on humanitarian access without enforcement

**Gap between stated and actual:**

The gap enables Israel to pursue policies (settlement expansion, Gaza operations) that contradict stated U.S. support for two states. The "peace process" provides cover without progress.

### Policy Options

#### Option 1: Continue Current Approach

**What it means:**

- Maintain rhetoric of two states
- Continue unconditional support
- Avoid pressure on Israel
- Manage conflict without resolving it

**Consequences:**

- Status quo continues
- De facto annexation proceeds
- Humanitarian crises recur
- U.S. credibility on human rights erodes
- October 7-scale events may recur

**Political feasibility:** High (path of least resistance)

#### Option 2: Active Pressure for Two-State

**What it means:**

- Condition some aid on settlement freeze
- Support UN resolutions
- Recognize Palestine
- Articulate consequences for annexation
- Push for negotiations with deadlines and consequences

**Consequences:**

- Severe domestic political backlash
- AIPAC and evangelical opposition
- Israel might resist pressure
- Could produce Israeli political shift—or backlash
- Uncertain effectiveness

**Political feasibility:** Low-Medium (requires committed president willing to spend political capital)

#### Option 3: Acknowledge Reality

**What it means:**

- State publicly that two states is not currently achievable
- Stop pretending "peace process" exists
- Focus on rights and conditions, not final status
- Oppose formal annexation
- Demand humanitarian standards

**Consequences:**

- Loses rhetorical leverage of "two states"
- More honest but offers no path forward
- May be seen as abandoning Palestinians
- Could reduce pressure on both sides

**Political feasibility:** Medium (might appeal to those frustrated with hypocrisy)

#### Option 4: Rights-Based Framework

**What it means:**

- Stop focusing on which framework (two-state, etc.)
- Focus on what rights people have regardless of framework
- Demand equal treatment under law
- Demand freedom of movement
- Demand end to collective punishment
- Let final status remain open while insisting on rights

**Consequences:**

- Doesn't solve national aspirations question
- Could be more achievable than comprehensive resolution
- Addresses immediate suffering
- May be attacked as abandoning two-state
- Could gradually shift facts on ground toward equality

**Political feasibility:** Low-Medium (novel approach with uncertain reception)

#### Option 5: Regional Approach

**What it means:**

- Focus on Saudi normalization
- Use normalization as leverage for Palestinian progress
- Build regional coalition for Palestinian state
- Integrate conflict resolution into broader regional architecture

**Consequences:**

- Saudi leverage could be powerful
- But current Israeli government rejects Palestinian state even for Saudi normalization
- May require waiting for Israeli political change
- Regional dynamics are complex

**Political feasibility:** Medium (administration has pursued this)

### What the U.S. Cannot Do

- **Impose a solution:** Neither Israelis nor Palestinians will accept externally imposed arrangements
- **Force Israeli political transformation:** Only Israelis can change their politics
- **Unify Palestinians:** Only Palestinians can do this
- **Guarantee security:** No arrangement can eliminate all risk
- **Make everyone happy:** Any outcome involves sacrifice

### What the U.S. Can Do

- **Change Israeli calculations:** Aid conditioning, diplomatic consequences, support for international accountability
- **Support Palestinian institution-building:** Strengthen PA capacity; support democratic development
- **Set redlines:** Articulate what the U.S. will not support (formal annexation, ethnic cleansing, certain weapons use)
- **Maintain humanitarian minimums:** Demand aid access; prevent famine; protect civilians
- **Preserve options:** Prevent actions that foreclose future possibilities (massive settlement expansion, Gaza ethnic cleansing)
- **Lead internationally:** Coordinate with EU, Arab states for coherent pressure

### Recommendations

Given the analysis, the following U.S. policy approach would best serve American interests:

1. **Acknowledge reality:** Stop pretending two states is imminent while doing nothing to achieve it. Be honest about obstacles.

2. **Establish redlines with consequences:**
   - Formal annexation triggers aid review
   - Ethnic cleansing triggers sanctions
   - Collective punishment of civilians triggers humanitarian intervention

3. **Condition some aid:** Even symbolic conditioning would signal change. Not all aid must be conditional—but some should be.

4. **Support accountability:** Stop blocking ICC/ICJ. Let international law apply.

5. **Invest in Palestinian institutions:** Support PA reform; support civil society; create alternatives to Hamas.

6. **Pursue regional integration with conditions:** Saudi normalization should require meaningful Palestinian progress, not just gestures.

7. **Support Israelis who want change:** Israeli civil society, security experts who oppose endless occupation—they need American support against their own extremists.

8. **Think long-term:** This conflict will not be resolved in any U.S. presidential term. Policy should prevent worst outcomes while preserving possibilities for eventual resolution.

## Conclusion

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has no available solution under current conditions. Every framework—two-state, one-state, confederation—faces insurmountable obstacles. The trajectory is toward permanent Israeli control without Palestinian rights.

This is unsustainable in the long run—morally, legally, and probably practically. But "unsustainable" can last for decades.

The United States has the power to change conditions—but not the political will. U.S. policy enables the status quo while rhetorically supporting an alternative that U.S. actions make impossible.

Changing this would require:

- A president willing to spend political capital
- A domestic political shift making this possible
- A belief that long-term stability matters more than short-term comfort

Whether this will happen is uncertain. What is certain is that without such change, the current trajectory continues: periodic catastrophes, growing injustice, eroding legitimacy, and no peace.

The frameworks examined in this section are not equally desirable or equally achievable. Two-state remains the most legitimate; status quo is the most achievable; the gap between legitimacy and achievability is the core problem.

Bridging that gap—making the legitimate achievable—is the challenge for U.S. policy and for all who seek genuine resolution of this conflict.
