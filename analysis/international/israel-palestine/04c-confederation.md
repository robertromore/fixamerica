# Confederation and Hybrid Models

> **Note:** This document analyzes confederation and hybrid proposals as of early 2026. For the overview and links to other solution frameworks, see [Solution Frameworks Overview](04-solution-frameworks.md).

## Overview

Confederation models attempt to bridge the gap between two-state and one-state frameworks. They recognize that:

- Complete separation may be physically impossible given settlement integration
- Complete integration is politically impossible given national identities
- Some hybrid arrangement might offer elements of both

These proposals remain largely academic, with limited political traction on either side. They are worth examining as potential creative solutions—or as illustrations of why the conflict resists resolution.

## Israeli-Palestinian Confederation

### The Basic Concept

Two separate sovereign states—Israel and Palestine—linked in a confederation with shared institutions:

| Domain | Arrangement |
|--------|-------------|
| Sovereignty | Two separate states with international recognition |
| Citizenship | Separate citizenship; residents can live in either state |
| Borders | Open or minimal barriers; free movement of people |
| Security | Joint security coordination; possibly shared military |
| Economy | Common market; shared currency or currency peg |
| Jerusalem | Joint capital; special arrangements for holy sites |
| Institutions | Confederal council for shared governance |

### Land for All / Two States One Homeland

The most developed confederation proposal comes from civil society organizations ("Land for All" / "Two States One Homeland"):

**Core principles:**

1. Two sovereign states based on 1967 lines with minor adjustments
2. Open borders and freedom of movement throughout the land
3. Right of residents to live in either state without changing citizenship
4. Most settlers stay in place as Israeli citizens living in Palestine (like expats)
5. Some Palestinian refugees return to Israel as Palestinian citizens living in Israel
6. Jerusalem serves as capital of both states with joint administration of holy sites
7. Confederal institutions manage shared concerns

**Key innovations:**

- **Separation of residence from citizenship:** You can be an Israeli citizen living in Hebron, or a Palestinian citizen living in Haifa, without either being anomalous
- **Settlers don't have to move:** Most settlements remain; residents are Israeli citizens in Palestinian territory
- **Some refugees return:** Palestinians can live in their ancestors' villages as Palestinian citizens—right of return to the land without demographic change to either state
- **Soft borders:** No walls, checkpoints, or daily barriers—like the European Union

### Arguments For Confederation

**Addresses physical reality:**

- 700,000+ settlers won't be moved
- Families on both sides live throughout the territory
- Confederation accommodates existing population distribution

**Preserves national identities:**

- Both peoples get their own state
- Jewish state and Palestinian state both exist
- National aspirations are fulfilled

**Addresses emotional issues:**

- Refugees can return to the land (if not to sovereignty)
- Jerusalem can be shared without division
- Settlers don't face evacuation trauma

**European precedent:**

- EU shows sovereign states can share currency, open borders, and institutions
- Schengen zone demonstrates free movement without abandoning national identity
- This is not utopian—it exists in Europe

**Creative compromise:**

- Neither side gets everything
- Both sides get core needs met
- Might be sellable when pure options are not

### Arguments Against Confederation

**Requires prior resolution of core issues:**

The confederation model assumes agreement on:

- Mutual recognition
- Borders (to know which state someone is in)
- Jerusalem (to know how to share it)
- Security (to enable open borders)
- Refugees (who returns and under what status)

In other words, confederation requires solving all the problems that have made two states impossible—and then adding another layer of complexity on top. It's not an alternative to solving two-state issues; it's an addition.

**Security concerns:**

- Open borders after decades of violence? Israeli security establishment would reject this
- How do you prevent terrorism when anyone can move anywhere?
- October 7 demonstrated what happens when borders are breached
- No Israeli government post-October 7 would accept open borders

**Settler acceptance:**

- Would settlers accept living under Palestinian sovereignty?
- Current settlers are ideologically committed to Jewish rule over the land
- Living as "expats" in a Palestinian state contradicts their purpose
- Many would refuse; some would violently resist

**Palestinian acceptance:**

- Would Palestinians accept settlers remaining?
- Settlers have been occupiers; their presence is a wound
- Is this "return" or continued colonization with legal cover?
- Many Palestinians would see this as legitimizing the theft of their land

**Asymmetric confederation:**

- Israel is vastly more powerful economically and militarily
- "Equal" confederation would actually be Israeli dominance
- Like EU? More like relationship between Germany and Greece—formally equal, actually not

**Who governs the border?:**

- If borders are open, who controls immigration from outside?
- If someone enters Palestine from Jordan, can they then enter Israel?
- Shared external border requires deep coordination—unlikely given mistrust

**Incremental impossibility:**

- Confederation requires trust built over time
- Current conditions preclude trust-building
- The conditions for confederation are the conditions for peace—which don't exist

### Feasibility Assessment

**Israeli acceptance:** Extremely unlikely. Post-October 7, open borders are unthinkable. The security establishment would reject it. Coalition politics would block it. The settler movement—whose cooperation is required—would oppose settlers living under Palestinian sovereignty.

**Palestinian acceptance:** Uncertain. Some civil society support, but mainstream leadership has not endorsed it. Many Palestinians would see settlers staying as legitimizing the occupation. Would refugees actually accept living in Israel as Palestinian citizens without Israeli citizenship rights?

**International support:** Some academic and civil society interest. Not endorsed by any government. Would require massive international guarantees that no one is offering.

**Implementation path:** Would require:

1. First solving two-state issues (borders, Jerusalem, refugees, security)
2. Then adding confederal layer
3. Then trusting both societies to accept open borders

Each step is currently impossible. The first step has been attempted for 30 years without success.

**Assessment:** Creative and interesting on paper, but requires solving all existing problems plus additional ones. Not a shortcut around two-state obstacles—adds to them.

## Regional Confederation

### The Concept

Expand the frame: instead of just Israel-Palestine, create a broader regional confederation:

**Potential configurations:**

- **Israel-Palestine-Jordan:** Revives the "Jordanian option"—Palestine linked to or confederated with Jordan
- **Israel-Palestine-Jordan-Egypt:** Four-state framework for regional integration
- **Broader Levant:** Lebanon, Syria (post-war), and others

### Jordanian Federation/Confederation

**Historical context:**

- Jordan controlled the West Bank 1948-1967
- Jordan's population is majority Palestinian-origin
- "Jordan is Palestine" has been proposed by some Israelis as alternative to West Bank Palestinian state
- King Hussein renounced Jordan's claim to West Bank in 1988

**Current version:**

- Palestine and Jordan form confederation or federation
- West Bank Palestinians become Jordanian-Palestinian citizens
- Jordan provides state infrastructure Palestine lacks
- Israel deals with Jordan rather than weak Palestinian entity

**Why it won't happen:**

- **Jordan rejects it:** The Hashemite monarchy fears Palestinian majority would threaten the throne. Jordan explicitly and repeatedly refuses any solution that makes it responsible for Palestinians.
- **Palestinians reject it:** Palestinians want their own state, not to be part of Jordan. This is seen as denying Palestinian self-determination.
- **It doesn't solve anything:** Israel would still need to withdraw from territory; security issues would remain; refugees wouldn't be addressed.

### Regional Integration Model

**Concept:**

- Multiple states create an EU-like structure
- Free trade, open borders, shared institutions
- Israel-Palestine issues resolved within regional framework
- Arab states provide guarantees and resources

**Appeal:**

- Spreads costs and risks
- Gives Israel regional integration it wants
- Gives Palestinians Arab backing they need
- Creates stake for all parties in success

**Why it won't happen:**

- Requires first solving Israeli-Palestinian conflict to enable regional integration
- Arab states won't deeply integrate with Israel while occupation continues
- Abraham Accords show normalization without Palestinian progress is possible—reduces incentive

### Assessment

Regional frameworks share the same flaw as bilateral confederation: they require prior resolution of the issues that make resolution impossible. They are not alternatives to solving the conflict—they are additions to a solution that doesn't exist.

## Graduated Sovereignty / Phased Approaches

### The Concept

Rather than a final agreement, a phased process building toward either two states or confederation:

**Phase 1: Improved interim arrangements**

- Enhanced Palestinian Authority powers
- Reduced Israeli presence in Area A
- Economic development and institution building

**Phase 2: Expanded autonomy**

- Area B under full Palestinian control
- Restricted Israeli operations
- More permits, more movement

**Phase 3: Provisional statehood**

- International recognition of Palestine with provisional borders
- Continued negotiation on Jerusalem, refugees, final borders

**Phase 4: Final status**

- Resolution of remaining issues
- Full statehood or confederation

### Arguments For

**Builds trust incrementally:**

- Small steps rather than giant leap
- Each phase demonstrates good faith
- Security can be tested at each stage

**Acknowledges reality:**

- Final agreement is impossible now
- Interim improvements are possible
- Don't let perfect be enemy of good

**Creates stakeholders:**

- Economic development creates interest in peace
- Institutions built now can become state structures
- International investment requires stability

### Arguments Against

**Oslo tried this—it failed:**

- The phased approach of the 1990s produced settlements, not statehood
- Israel used "interim" period to create facts on the ground
- Phases became permanent without reaching final status

**Incentives are wrong:**

- Israel benefits from phases that never end
- Why complete the process if interim situation works for the powerful party?
- Palestinians have experienced this—they're not fooled

**Conditions are worse than Oslo:**

- More settlers now
- More fragmented territory
- Less trust
- October 7 has made incrementalism harder, not easier

### Assessment

Phased approaches failed in the 1990s when conditions were more favorable. Proposing them now, without addressing why they failed before, offers no path forward.

## Parallel States

### The Concept

A radical proposal from some academics: two states occupying the same territory simultaneously.

**How it would work:**

- Israel and Palestine both exist throughout the entire territory
- Individuals choose which state's citizen they are
- Each state has authority over its citizens, wherever they live
- Physical territory is shared; sovereignty is personal, not territorial

**Historical precedent:**

- Medieval Europe had overlapping jurisdictions
- Religious communities in Ottoman Empire had personal-law autonomy
- Digital world already has non-territorial governance (corporations, online communities)

### Why It's Not Serious

- No modern precedent for parallel sovereign states in same territory
- Who controls the army? The police? The courts?
- What happens when Israeli law says one thing and Palestinian law says another?
- This is a thought experiment, not a political proposal
- No constituency anywhere supports this

### Assessment

Intellectually provocative but practically meaningless. No path to implementation; no significant support.

## What Hybrid Models Reveal

The proliferation of creative hybrid proposals reveals something important: **the core conflict resists resolution through any framework.**

Every proposal—two-state, one-state, confederation, hybrid—faces the same obstacles:

1. **Power asymmetry:** Israel has no incentive to compromise
2. **Mutual distrust:** Neither side trusts the other's commitments
3. **Spoilers:** Extremists on both sides can undermine any arrangement
4. **External enablement:** U.S. support allows Israel to avoid pressure
5. **Fait accompli:** Physical facts on the ground constrain options

Hybrid proposals don't solve these problems—they assume them away. They describe what a solution might look like without explaining how to get there.

This doesn't mean creative thinking is useless. It means:

- Solutions require changing the underlying conditions, not just proposing new formulas
- Without changed conditions, no formula will succeed
- Changed conditions could make multiple formulas workable

The question is: **What would change the conditions?**

## Conditions for Hybrid Viability

For any confederation or hybrid model to become viable, the following would likely be necessary:

### Changed Israeli Politics

- Government willing to accept Palestinian sovereignty
- Public support for sharing the land
- Security establishment endorsement
- Settler movement acceptance or marginalization

### Changed Palestinian Politics

- Unified leadership with democratic legitimacy
- Acceptance of arrangements that don't satisfy maximum demands
- Capacity to guarantee security
- Grassroots support for compromise

### Changed Regional Context

- Arab states actively pressuring Israel, not just normalizing
- Saudi Arabia conditioning normalization on Palestinian progress
- Regional security arrangements that reduce Israeli anxiety

### Changed International Context

- U.S. willingness to use leverage
- Coordinated international pressure
- Consequences for non-compliance

### Changed Conditions on the Ground

- Reduced violence and increased trust
- Economic interdependence creating stakes in peace
- Civil society relationships across the divide

None of these conditions exists today. The value of hybrid proposals is less as implementable plans than as visions of what might be possible if conditions changed.

## Implications for U.S. Policy

### What Hybrid Models Suggest

**Flexibility matters:** The U.S. should not be rigidly committed to a single framework. If two states becomes impossible, alternatives should be considered.

**Process matters more than formula:** The obstacle is not lack of creative solutions—it's lack of conditions for any solution. U.S. policy should focus on creating conditions rather than choosing formulas.

**Incrementalism has failed:** Phased approaches require trust that doesn't exist and create opportunities for the powerful party to delay indefinitely.

### What the U.S. Should Focus On

Rather than endorsing a specific framework, U.S. policy might:

1. **Name goals:** Equal rights, self-determination, security—without specifying the constitutional form
2. **Create conditions:** Use leverage to change Israeli calculations; support Palestinian institutional development
3. **Prevent worst outcomes:** Block formal annexation; demand humanitarian access; maintain legal frameworks
4. **Stay flexible:** Be prepared to support whatever arrangement the parties genuinely agree to

## Conclusion

Confederation and hybrid models offer creative approaches to a seemingly intractable conflict. They deserve consideration as part of the solution-framework landscape.

However, honest assessment reveals:

1. **They are not shortcuts:** Confederation requires solving two-state issues first, then adding more complexity
2. **They face the same obstacles:** Power asymmetry, distrust, spoilers, and external enablement block all frameworks
3. **They lack constituencies:** Neither Israeli nor Palestinian mainstream supports these proposals
4. **They assume conditions that don't exist:** Open borders, trust, mutual acceptance

The proliferation of hybrid proposals reflects desperation more than progress. When conventional solutions fail, people propose unconventional ones—but unconventional proposals fail for the same reasons.

The path forward lies not in finding the right formula but in changing the conditions that make all formulas impossible. Hybrid models might become viable if those conditions changed—but they offer no mechanism for changing them.
