# One-State Frameworks

> **Note:** This document analyzes various one-state proposals as of early 2026. For the overview and links to other solution frameworks, see [Solution Frameworks Overview](04-solution-frameworks.md).

## Overview

As the two-state solution has become increasingly difficult to envision, one-state frameworks have received renewed attention. The term "one-state solution" encompasses very different visions:

| Framework | Core Idea | Supported By |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Democratic secular state** | One-person-one-vote democracy, no ethnic character | Some Palestinians, international left |
| **Binational state** | Power-sharing between two national communities | Some academics, civil society |
| **Greater Israel with citizenship** | Israeli sovereignty with equal citizenship for Palestinians | Tiny fringe |
| **Greater Israel without citizenship** | Israeli sovereignty with disenfranchised Palestinians | De facto current trajectory; explicit goal of Israeli far-right |

These frameworks differ fundamentally in values and outcomes. Analyzing them together as "one-state solutions" can obscure that some seek equality while others seek domination.

## The Reality: One State Already Exists

Before analyzing proposals, a key observation: functionally, one state already exists between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea. Israel controls:

- All borders, airspace, and coastline
- Movement of people and goods
- Water resources
- Electromagnetic spectrum
- The currency (shekel)
- Security throughout the territory

The Palestinian Authority exercises limited autonomy within Israeli-controlled territory. Gaza's separation is enforced by Israeli blockade, not sovereignty.

The question is not whether there will be one state but rather: **What kind of state will it be?**

Currently, approximately 7.2 million Jews and 7.3 million Arabs live under Israeli authority (including those in Gaza under blockade and siege). The political question is how these people will be governed.

## Democratic Secular State

### Definition

A single democratic state in all of historic Palestine/Eretz Israel where all citizens have equal rights regardless of religion or ethnicity. The state would have no official ethnic or religious character—neither Jewish nor Islamic.

### Origins

This was originally the PLO's position before 1988:

- 1968 PLO charter called for "a democratic state in Palestine" where Jews, Christians, and Muslims would live as equals
- Framed as dismantling the "Zionist entity," not genocide of Jews
- Influenced by anti-colonial movements; modeled on post-apartheid aspirations
- Abandoned by mainstream PLO in favor of two-state solution by 1988

The idea has been revived by academics, some Palestinian activists, and international left voices as two states has stalled.

### Key Features

**Political system:**

- Parliamentary democracy with one-person-one-vote
- Constitutional protections for minorities
- No state religion or ethnic designation
- Equal citizenship for all current residents
- Right of return for Palestinian refugees (and presumably continuation of Law of Return for Jews)

**Transition:**

- Some proposals envision negotiated transition
- Others assume transformation through international pressure or internal change
- No agreed mechanism for implementation

### Arguments For

**Moral clarity:**

- Equal rights is the principled position
- Partition legitimizes ethnic separation
- A democratic state is the standard solution to ethnic conflict globally

**Demographic reality:**

- Jews and Palestinians already live interspersed
- Settlement expansion has made separation impossible
- One-state is the de facto reality; question is equal rights

**Historical justice:**

- Addresses Nakba and right of return
- Doesn't require Palestinians to accept loss of 78% of homeland
- Treats all human beings equally

**Comparative examples:**

- South Africa transitioned from apartheid to democracy
- Northern Ireland achieved power-sharing within single UK state
- Multi-ethnic democracies exist (Switzerland, Belgium)

### Arguments Against

**Jewish opposition is absolute:**

- Zionism's core purpose was Jewish self-determination
- Equal rights in a Jewish-minority state means ending the Jewish state
- Israeli Jews will not accept this voluntarily—it would require conquest or collapse
- Historical Jewish vulnerability makes majority status existentially important

**Palestinian right-wing also opposes:**

- Some Palestinians seek Islamic state, not secular democracy
- Hamas's vision is Islamic governance, not Western liberal democracy
- "Secular state" concept is Western imposition

**Practicality:**

- No mechanism to achieve it
- Would require either Israeli consent (impossible) or external imposition (also impossible)
- Civil war more likely than peaceful transition

**Lebanon precedent:**

- The one Arab country that tried multi-confessional democracy collapsed into civil war
- Power-sharing arrangements are unstable when demographic balances shift
- Without shared national identity, democracy becomes ethnic competition

**South Africa analogy fails:**

- South African whites were 10% of population; Israeli Jews are ~50%
- South Africa had external economic pressure; Israel has unconditional U.S. support
- South African whites had nowhere to go; Israeli Jews would fight rather than accept minority status
- ANC and Afrikaner leadership negotiated; no comparable Israeli-Palestinian dialogue exists

### Feasibility Assessment

**Israeli acceptance:** Essentially zero. No significant Israeli constituency supports ending the Jewish state. The security establishment, the public, and all major parties oppose it. Israelis would fight a civil war rather than accept.

**Palestinian acceptance:** Theoretical support among some intellectuals and diaspora, but Hamas seeks Islamic state, and PA is committed to two-state framework. No unified Palestinian movement demands democratic secular state.

**International support:** Some academic and left support, but no government endorses this. Not the position of UN, EU, Arab League, or U.S.

**Implementation path:** None exists. Would require either:

- Israeli voluntary acceptance (impossible)
- External conquest (no one would attempt)
- Internal collapse followed by transition (speculative; more likely to produce civil war)

**Assessment:** Not achievable in any realistic scenario. Functions more as moral critique of the current situation than practical program.

## Binational State

### Definition

A single state with recognized Jewish and Palestinian national communities sharing power. Unlike the democratic secular state, the binational model explicitly recognizes two peoples with collective rights, not just individual citizens.

### Models

**Belgian model:**

- Federal structure with national communities having autonomy
- Linguistic/national regions with their own institutions
- Power-sharing at federal level
- Consensus requirements protecting minority communities

**Consociational democracy:**

- Grand coalition governments including all major groups
- Mutual veto over vital interests
- Proportionality in civil service, budgets, etc.
- Community autonomy in cultural/educational matters

**Ottoman millet system (historical):**

- Religious communities governed their own personal status
- Autonomy in education, law, welfare
- Overarching imperial structure

### Key Features

**Political system:**

- Two recognized national communities: Jewish Israeli and Palestinian Arab
- Power-sharing arrangements at central government level
- Veto rights for each community on vital interests
- Autonomy for each community in cultural, educational, religious matters
- Possible territorial sub-units with community majorities

**Transition:**

- Would require negotiated agreement between communities
- Constitutional convention with both peoples represented
- International guarantees

### Arguments For

**Recognizes both peoples:**

- Unlike secular democratic state, acknowledges Jewish national rights
- Unlike partition, acknowledges Palestinian presence throughout the land
- Both peoples maintain collective identity and self-governance

**Addresses settlement reality:**

- Doesn't require relocating populations
- Jews and Arabs can live throughout the territory
- Follows from existing intermingling

**Historical resonance:**

- Both peoples have historical claims to the land
- Neither will disappear; arrangement must accommodate both
- Could build on existing institutions (religious communities already have autonomy in personal status)

**Working examples exist:**

- Belgium has functioned (if imperfectly) for nearly 200 years
- Switzerland manages four national communities
- Northern Ireland's Good Friday Agreement created power-sharing

### Arguments Against

**No trust:**

- Power-sharing requires minimum trust between communities
- After October 7 and Gaza's destruction, trust is at historic low
- Each community fears the other gaining advantage and using power against it

**Asymmetric power:**

- Israel holds all military and economic power
- Why would Israel agree to share power when it can dominate?
- Power-sharing agreements work when parties have similar leverage; here one side is occupied

**Lebanon precedent:**

- Lebanese consociationalism was frozen in 1943 demographics
- When demographics shifted, civil war resulted
- Palestinian-Israeli demographics are shifting; any formula would face same problem

**Neither side accepts it:**

- Israelis reject sharing sovereignty over the Jewish state
- Palestinians reject arrangements short of full self-determination
- This is a third-party academic proposal without constituency

**Veto gridlock:**

- Mutual veto produces paralysis
- Belgian government formation takes years
- Israeli-Palestinian version would be permanently gridlocked on every issue

**Violence would destroy it:**

- Any terrorist attack by one community would shatter the arrangement
- Spoilers on both sides would attack precisely to undermine coexistence
- No mechanism to contain violence

### Feasibility Assessment

**Israeli acceptance:** Extremely unlikely. Would mean sharing sovereignty over Jerusalem, security, immigration—Israelis reject this comprehensively.

**Palestinian acceptance:** Unlikely. Falls short of self-determination; would legitimize settlers; doesn't address refugees adequately.

**International support:** Some academic support; no government endorses.

**Implementation path:** Would require both communities to agree—neither has any reason to. No external power can impose it.

**Assessment:** Theoretically interesting but lacks any path to implementation. Functions as thought experiment more than realistic option.

## Greater Israel with Citizenship

### Definition

Israeli sovereignty over all territory between the river and the sea, with full Israeli citizenship extended to all Palestinian residents.

### Key Features

- Formal annexation of West Bank and Gaza
- All Palestinians become Israeli citizens with voting rights
- One democratic state—but framed as expanded Israel rather than new state
- End of occupation through incorporation

### Arguments For

**Ends occupation:**

- Palestinians would have citizenship and rights
- No more military rule, checkpoints, permits
- Equal under law

**Democratic:**

- One-person-one-vote
- Same standard Israel claims internally
- Addresses apartheid accusations

**Resolves border questions:**

- No need to draw lines
- No settlement evacuation
- Territorial disputes end

### Why No One Supports This

**Israeli Jews reject it:**

- Would end Jewish majority (~50% or less immediately)
- Higher Palestinian birth rates would ensure Arab majority over time
- End of Jewish state through demography rather than violence

**This is exactly what two-state proponents fear:**

- The demographic argument for partition is precisely to avoid this outcome
- Israeli mainstream views this as national suicide

**Palestinian concerns:**

- Would they actually get equal rights, or would it become legal apartheid?
- Would Israel actually treat them equally given decades of discrimination?
- Is citizenship in Israel what Palestinians want, or self-determination?

**Assessment:** Theoretically coherent but politically non-existent. No one advocates this.

## Greater Israel without Citizenship

### Definition

This is not presented as a "solution" but describes the trajectory Israel is currently on—and the explicit goal of some in the Israeli right:

Israeli sovereignty over all territory between the river and the sea, with Palestinians either:

- Permanently disenfranchised (apartheid)
- Expelled ("voluntary emigration" or forced transfer)
- Confined to disconnected enclaves with limited autonomy

### The Current Reality

This is substantially the current situation in the West Bank:

- Israel controls all territory
- Palestinians in the West Bank are not citizens (except those in annexed East Jerusalem, who have residency not citizenship)
- They live under military law while settlers live under Israeli civil law
- They cannot vote in the government that controls their lives
- This has continued for 57 years with no end in sight

### Explicit Advocacy

Some in the current Israeli government advocate formalizing this:

**Bezalel Smotrich:**

- Has published plans for annexation without citizenship
- Advocates encouraging Palestinian emigration
- Openly calls for Jewish sovereignty over all the land

**Itamar Ben-Gvir:**

- Supports annexation
- Has advocated "encouraging voluntary emigration"
- Does not accept Palestinian political rights in the land

**"Decisive Plan" and similar:**

- Various Israeli right-wing plans propose annexation without citizenship
- Some propose limited autonomy in population centers (like Gaza before 2005)
- Some explicitly propose transfer

### Implications

If this trajectory continues:

**Legal situation:**

- International law calls this apartheid (ICJ, 2024)
- ICC has jurisdiction and has issued arrest warrants
- Israel faces increasing international isolation

**Demographic:**

- Palestinians are not disappearing; they will remain and grow
- Permanent disenfranchisement creates permanent conflict
- Historical examples of permanent occupation (colonial Algeria) ended in violence

**Palestinian response:**

- Continued resistance, violent and non-violent
- International advocacy and BDS
- No acceptance or normalization

**International response:**

- Increasing isolation
- Potential sanctions (currently blocked by U.S.)
- Growing comparison to apartheid South Africa

### Assessment

This is not a "solution" in any meaningful sense—it is the absence of a solution; the continuation of conflict in perpetuity. It is sustainable only as long as:

- Israel has overwhelming military superiority
- The United States provides unconditional support
- The costs of resistance don't exceed Israeli tolerance

History suggests such arrangements eventually end, but the timeline is unpredictable.

## Why One-State Proposals Fail

All one-state frameworks face fundamental obstacles:

### The National Identity Problem

Both Israelis and Palestinians have developed powerful national identities:

- **Israelis** see themselves as a nation that achieved self-determination after 2,000 years
- **Palestinians** see themselves as a nation denied self-determination for 100+ years

Both peoples want what other peoples have: their own state expressing their national character. Proposals that deny this face deep resistance.

### The Security Dilemma

After decades of violence, neither community trusts the other:

- Israelis believe Palestinians would use power to harm Jews
- Palestinians believe Israelis will never treat them equally

Any arrangement requiring trust between communities faces this obstacle.

### The Power Asymmetry

Israel holds overwhelming power and has no incentive to share it:

- Why would the stronger party agree to diminish its position?
- Without external pressure, Israel can maintain the status quo
- U.S. support removes any pressure

### The Spoiler Problem

On both sides, actors benefit from conflict:

- Israeli settlers want expansion, not coexistence
- Hamas wants resistance, not integration
- Any one-state arrangement would be attacked by extremists on both sides

### No Path to Implementation

None of the one-state proposals has a credible mechanism:

- Israeli consent won't be given
- External imposition is impossible
- Internal transformation is speculative

This leaves one-state proposals as moral critiques rather than actionable policies.

## Implications for U.S. Policy

### What the U.S. Should Not Do

**Endorse one-state:** No one-state proposal is achievable or has significant support from the parties. U.S. endorsement would be both futile and damaging to relations with Israel.

**Pretend the status quo is acceptable:** The current trajectory—Greater Israel without citizenship—violates American values and international law. Ignoring this makes the U.S. complicit.

### What the U.S. Could Do

**Name reality:** Acknowledge that the current situation is moving toward permanent one-state control without equal rights—what international law calls apartheid.

**Oppose formal annexation:** Even if de facto annexation continues, formal annexation should have consequences.

**Support rights:** Even without a political solution, demand equal treatment under law, freedom of movement, access to courts—the rights that any human being should have regardless of which state controls the territory.

**Distinguish between outcomes:** Greater Israel with equal rights (if somehow achieved) would be very different from Greater Israel with permanent disenfranchisement. The former is theoretically acceptable; the latter is not.

## Conclusion

One-state frameworks range from visionary (democratic secular state) to oppressive (Greater Israel without citizenship). What they share is that none is achievable through any realistic political process:

- **Democratic secular state:** Would require Israelis to voluntarily end the Jewish state—this will not happen
- **Binational state:** Would require trust and power-sharing between peoples who have neither—this will not happen
- **Greater Israel with citizenship:** Would end Jewish majority—no Israeli government will accept this
- **Greater Israel without citizenship:** Is the current trajectory but is not a "solution"—it is perpetual conflict

The significance of one-state discourse is not that these frameworks are achievable but that they highlight the moral and practical bankruptcy of the status quo. If two states becomes impossible and one-state with equal rights is rejected, what remains is permanent domination—which is neither just nor stable.
