## Policy Proposals

### Public Funding for Local Journalism

**The Case for Public Investment**

Every other major democracy invests significantly in public media. The U.S. spends approximately $1.40 per capita compared to $100+ in the UK and Germany. Journalism is a public good that markets alone will not adequately provide.

**Proposal: National Local News Fund**

| Funding level | $5-10 billion annually |
| Source | General revenue, spectrum auction proceeds, or digital advertising tax |
| Distribution | Formula-based to states and communities |
| Independence | Insulated from political interference |
| Eligible outlets | Nonprofit and for-profit local news organizations |

**Design Principles**

- No federal control over content
- State-level distribution through independent commissions
- Automatic formula allocation (not discretionary grants)
- Diversity requirements
- Accountability for funds use

**International Models**

| Country | Model |
|---------|-------|
| Canada | Local Journalism Initiative ($50M/year for reporters) |

## Alternative Approaches

### Schools of Thought

**Market-Based Approaches**

| Approach | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Subscription model | Works for national, not local |
| Advertising innovation | Undermined by platform dominance |
| Events and services | Supplements, doesn't replace core revenue |
| Micropayments | Hasn't achieved scale |

Verdict: Markets alone have failed; public intervention needed.

**Libertarian Approaches**

| Approach | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| No intervention | Status quo is failing |
| Section 230 repeal | Would make problems worse |
| Defamation only | Insufficient for misinformation at scale |
| Competition enforcement | Necessary but not sufficient |

Verdict: Some antitrust elements valuable; insufficient alone.

**Public Utility Approach**

| Approach | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Regulate platforms as utilities | May constrain innovation |
| Common carrier rules | Addresses some but not all issues |
| Must-carry requirements | Helps distribution, not production |

Verdict: Some elements useful; not comprehensive solution.

**Public Media Approach**

| Approach | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Dramatically expand public media | Promising but politically difficult |
| BBC-style national service | Cultural resistance in U.S. |
| Local public media network | More feasible, builds on existing |

Verdict: Significant expansion needed; must be designed for independence.

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

Combine multiple strategies:

1. **Public investment** in local journalism
2. **Platform accountability** through payments and transparency
3. **Antitrust enforcement** against monopolies
4. **Tax incentives** for sustainability
5. **Public media expansion** as baseline
6. **Ownership reform** to prevent extraction

No single solution is sufficient. The crisis is multi-causal and requires multi-pronged response.

## What Has Worked Elsewhere

### International Models

**Australia: News Media Bargaining Code**

| Element | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Mandatory negotiation | Platforms negotiated deals |
| Threat of arbitration | Incentivized good-faith bargaining |
| $200M+ annually | Significant new revenue for publishers |
| Small publisher inclusion | Some benefit for small outlets |

Lessons: Legislation can force platform payments; design matters for small publishers.

**Canada: Online News Act**

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Similar to Australia | Passed 2023 |
| Platform response | Meta blocked news initially |
| Outcome | Negotiations ongoing |

Lessons: Platforms will threaten withdrawal; persistence may be necessary.

**European Union: Digital Services Act**

| Element | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Algorithm transparency | Required disclosure |
| Researcher access | Data for study |
| Risk assessments | Platforms must evaluate harms |
| Enforcement | Significant fines |

Lessons: Comprehensive regulation is possible; enforcement is key.

**BBC Model (UK)**

| Element | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| License fee funding | Sustainable, independent revenue |
| Royal Charter | Political insulation |
| Universal service | Serves all communities |
| High trust | Quality builds credibility |

Lessons: Public media can be independent and trusted; design matters.

| Infrastructure investment | Government can enable press |

**Fairness Doctrine (1949-1987)**

| Element | Lesson |
|---------|--------|
| Balance requirement | Worked for decades |
| Limited to broadcast | Spectrum scarcity rationale |
| Ended voluntarily | Not struck down |

Lessons: Content requirements can be constitutional and effective.

## Trade-offs

### Funding vs. Independence

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Government funding creates dependency | Automatic formulas, not discretionary grants |
| Political pressure | Independent boards, trust fund structure |
| Perception of bias | Transparent distribution, diverse funding |
| Crowding out private investment | Supplement, don't replace |

### Regulation vs. Free Speech

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Content regulation is unconstitutional | Focus on disclosure, structure, not content |
| Government can't define truth | Fund journalism, don't regulate truth |
| Chilling effects | Clear rules, safe harbors |
| Slippery slope | Narrow, targeted interventions |

### Platform Accountability vs. Innovation

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Regulation stifles innovation | Apply to dominant platforms only |
| Compliance costs | Scale requirements to company size |
| Reduced competition | Antitrust enables competition |
| Section 230 is necessary | Reform, don't repeal |

### Local vs. National

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| National solutions miss local needs | State and local distribution |
| One-size-fits-all | Flexibility for different markets |
| Capture by major outlets | Small publisher set-asides |

### Immediate vs. Long-Term

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Crisis requires urgent action | Phased implementation |
| Long-term structural change | Near-term relief while building |
| Pilots delay action | Learn from pilots, but don't stop there |

## Summary: Priority Solutions

### Highest Impact

| Solution | Why Highest Priority |
|----------|---------------------|
| National Local News Fund | Directly addresses collapse |

### Most Feasible

| Solution | Why Feasible |
|----------|--------------|
| Tax credits for journalism | Bipartisan appeal |

| State-level action | Doesn't require federal action |

### Necessary but Difficult

| Solution | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| Section 230 reform | Partisan disagreement on direction |
| Antitrust enforcement | Industry opposition, lengthy process |
| Full public media expansion | Political resistance |

### Long-Term Structural

| Solution | Horizon |
|----------|---------|
| Ownership reform | Requires sustained advocacy |
