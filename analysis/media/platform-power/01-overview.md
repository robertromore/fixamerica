# Platform Power: Overview

## Executive Summary

A handful of technology platforms—primarily Google, Facebook/Meta, Apple, Amazon, and to a lesser extent X (Twitter) and TikTok—have become the dominant gatekeepers of information in American society. These companies control how news is discovered, distributed, and monetized, wielding unprecedented power over public discourse without the editorial responsibilities or regulatory frameworks that governed previous media gatekeepers. Their algorithmic systems prioritize engagement over accuracy, their business models extract advertising revenue from news publishers, and their content moderation decisions shape what speech is amplified or suppressed. This concentration of informational power in private hands poses fundamental challenges to democracy, journalism, and the information ecosystem.
