# Broadcast Regulation: Root Causes

## Why Regulation Has Weakened

### Ideological Shift

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Deregulation ideology** | Reagan-era market faith |
| **First Amendment absolutism** | Regulation seen as censorship |
| **Property rights framing** | Spectrum as private property |
| **Neoliberal consensus** | Bipartisan market preference |

### Industry Capture

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Lobbying** | Industry shapes rules |
| **Revolving door** | FCC-industry movement |
| **Campaign contributions** | Political influence |
| **Legal resources** | Industry can litigate |
| **Information asymmetry** | Industry knows more |

### Scarcity Rationale Erosion

| Argument | Counter |
|----------|---------|
| **"More channels now"** | Consolidation limits diversity anyway |
| **"Internet provides alternatives"** | Different reach, different audiences |
| **"Cable, satellite, streaming"** | Broadcast still matters for local |
| **"Scarcity is artificial"** | But spectrum is still limited |

### Technological Change

| Change | Regulatory Impact |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Cable expansion** | Argued against broadcast-only rules |
| **Internet emergence** | "Level playing field" arguments |
| **Digital transition** | More channels per station |
| **Streaming** | Traditional broadcast less central |

## Root Causes by Issue

### Ownership Concentration

| Root Cause | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **Economies of scale** | Larger groups more profitable |
| **Deregulation** | Rules allowed consolidation |
| **Investor pressure** | Wall Street rewards size |
| **Network leverage** | Big groups negotiate better |
| **Fixed costs** | Technology enables centralization |

### Diminished Public Interest

| Root Cause | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **Enforcement weakness** | FCC rarely acts |
| **License renewal rubber stamp** | No accountability |
| **Vague standards** | "Public interest" undefined |
| **Industry lobbying** | Oppose specific requirements |
| **First Amendment concerns** | Courts skeptical of content rules |

### Local Service Decline

| Root Cause | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **Main studio elimination** | No local presence required |
| **Centralized operations** | Cost-cutting |
| **Network programming** | Less local content |
| **Revenue pressure** | News is expensive |
| **Ownership distance** | Absentee owners |

### Political Broadcasting Loopholes

| Root Cause | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **Issue ads** | Not covered by equal time |
| **Super PAC spending** | Outside candidate rules |
| **Dark money** | Sponsorship ID insufficient |
| **Digital exclusion** | Rules apply to broadcast only |

## Structural Factors

### FCC Structure

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Political appointments** | Partisan shifts |
| **5-member commission** | Deadlock possible |
| **Industry expertise** | Revolving door |
| **Limited resources** | Enforcement capacity |
| **Court review** | Industry can appeal |

### Congressional Dynamics

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Committee jurisdiction** | Commerce committees |
| **Campaign contributions** | Industry influence |
| **Deregulation consensus** | Bipartisan support |
| **Lobbying** | Industry presence |
| **Complexity** | Technical issues favor industry |

### Judicial Factors

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **First Amendment scrutiny** | Content rules suspect |
| **APA review** | Rules must be justified |
| **Standing** | Hard to challenge |
| **Industry litigation** | Resources to appeal |
| **Scarcity skepticism** | Some judges doubt rationale |

## Comparative Analysis

### Why Other Countries Regulate More

| Country | Factor |
|---------|--------|
| **UK** | Public service tradition |
| **Canada** | Cultural protection concerns |
| **EU** | Stronger consumer protection |
| **Australia** | Local content priority |

### Why U.S. Different

| Factor | U.S. Distinction |

| **Federalism** | National rules only |

## Feedback Loops

### Deregulation Cycle

```
Deregulation → Consolidation → More lobbying power →
      ↑                                             ↓
Less diverse voices ← Less local service ← More deregulation ←
```

### Enforcement Cycle

```
Weak enforcement → Violations not punished → More violations →
        ↑                                                     ↓
Industry captures FCC ← Deregulation pressure ←───────────────┘

| **Enforcement emphasis** | Low (agency discretion) |
