# Broadcast Regulation: Overview

## Executive Summary

Broadcast regulation—the framework governing radio, television, and related spectrum uses—has been transformed by technological change and decades of deregulation. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates broadcasting under a "public interest" standard, but deregulation since the 1980s has weakened public interest obligations while consolidation has concentrated ownership. As traditional broadcasting declines relative to streaming and digital platforms, fundamental questions arise about whether broadcast regulation remains relevant and how the public interest standard should evolve for the digital age.
