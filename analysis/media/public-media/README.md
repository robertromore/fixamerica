# Public Media: Overview

Public media—non-commercial broadcasting and digital content serving the public interest—plays a vital but undervalued role in America's information ecosystem. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), National Public Radio (NPR), the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and hundreds of local public stations provide educational programming, local news, and trusted information that commercial media increasingly cannot sustain. Despite proven value, American public media receives far less government support per capita than peer democracies. Strengthening public media can help address the local news crisis, counter misinformation, and ensure all Americans have access to quality information.
