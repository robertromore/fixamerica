# Local Journalism: Root Causes

## Economic Causes

### The Advertising Revenue Collapse

The fundamental economic cause of local journalism's collapse is the migration of advertising revenue to digital platforms.

**Revenue Shift**

| Year | Newspaper Ad Revenue | Google Ad Revenue | Facebook Ad Revenue |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 2000 | $48.7 billion | Minimal | N/A |
| 2005 | $47.4 billion | $6.1 billion | Minimal |
| 2010 | $22.8 billion | $29.3 billion | $1.9 billion |
| 2015 | $16.4 billion | $67.4 billion | $17.1 billion |
| 2020 | $8.8 billion | $147 billion | $86 billion |
| 2023 | ~$9 billion | $238 billion | $117 billion |

**Why Advertising Left**

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Targeting precision** | Platforms offer exact demographic targeting |
| **Measurability** | Digital ads provide detailed analytics |
| **Cost efficiency** | Lower cost per impression on platforms |
| **Audience migration** | Readers moved to platforms |
| **Self-serve simplicity** | Small businesses can buy Google/Facebook ads easily |

### The Classified Advertising Destruction

Classified advertising was the "river of gold" that subsidized journalism.

| Category | What Replaced It |
|----------|------------------|
| **Help wanted** | Indeed, LinkedIn, Monster |
| **Real estate** | Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com |
| **Automotive** | Cars.com, CarGurus, Autotrader |
| **General classifieds** | Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace |
| **Personals** | Dating apps |

**Scale of Loss**

- 2000: $19.6 billion in classified revenue
- 2020: $2.0 billion in classified revenue
- Loss: $17.6 billion annually (90% decline)

### The Retail Advertising Decline

Local retail advertising also collapsed:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Big box stores** | Replaced local retailers who advertised |
| **E-commerce** | Amazon doesn't need local newspaper ads |
| **Chain restaurants** | National advertising, not local |
| **Mall decline** | Major local advertisers disappeared |

### Structural Economic Problems

| Problem | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **High fixed costs** | Printing, distribution expensive regardless of circulation |
| **Perishable product** | Yesterday's news has no value |
| **Free online alternatives** | Hard to charge for commodity news |
| **Subscription economics** | Digital subscriptions don't match print economics |
| **Dual revenue dependency** | Need both ads and subscriptions; losing both |

## Ownership Causes

### Hedge Fund Extraction

Hedge funds and private equity have accelerated local news decline through:

| Practice | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Asset stripping** | Sell real estate, equipment |
| **Staff reduction** | Cut 50-75% of newsroom |
| **Consolidation** | Merge operations, reduce local focus |
| **Debt loading** | Saddle papers with acquisition debt |
| **Short-term horizon** | Extract cash, don't invest |
| **Profit over mission** | Journalism subordinate to returns |

**The Alden Model**

Alden Global Capital exemplifies extraction:

1. Buy distressed newspaper company at low price
2. Immediately cut staff 30-50%
3. Sell headquarters and printing facilities
4. Centralize production across papers
5. Reduce print frequency (daily → 3x/week)
6. Continue cutting until paper collapses or stabilizes at minimal operation

### Chain Ownership Problems

Even before hedge funds, chain ownership created problems:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Distant management** | Out-of-town owners don't understand community |
| **Profit mandates** | Chains demanded 20%+ margins |
| **Template journalism** | Standardized approach across markets |
| **No reinvestment** | Profits extracted, not reinvested |
| **Debt burdens** | Acquisitions financed with debt |

### Public Company Pressure

When newspapers were publicly traded:

| Pressure | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **Quarterly earnings** | Focus on short-term profit |
| **Analyst expectations** | Pressure to maintain margins |
| **Stock price** | Cuts boosted stock; investment didn't |
| **Executive compensation** | Tied to financial metrics, not journalism |

## Technological Causes

### Platform Intermediation

Digital platforms fundamentally changed news distribution:

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Aggregation** | Google News surfaces content without compensation |
| **Social sharing** | Facebook becomes news distributor |
| **Algorithm curation** | Platforms decide what users see |
| **Unbundling** | Individual articles shared, not newspapers |
| **Traffic dependency** | Publishers depend on platform referrals |

### The Attention Economy

| Factor | Effect on Local News |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Infinite content** | Local news competes with entire internet |
| **Algorithmic feeds** | Local news loses to viral content |
| **Mobile consumption** | Short attention, headline scanning |
| **Push notifications** | National news dominates |
| **Social media time** | Displaces news reading |

### Distribution Disintermediation

| Traditional | Digital |
|-------------|---------|
| Newspaper owned delivery | Platforms control distribution |
| Subscriber relationship | Platform relationship |
| Bundle of content | Individual articles |
| Local advertising | National programmatic ads |

## Structural Causes

### Market Failure

Local journalism exhibits classic market failure characteristics:

| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Public good** | Benefits all, not just subscribers |
| **Positive externalities** | Accountability benefits non-readers |
| **Free rider problem** | Non-subscribers benefit from journalism |
| **Merit good** | People undervalue what they need |
| **Information asymmetry** | Readers can't assess quality before consuming |

### Geographic Mismatch

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ad market mismatch** | National advertisers don't need local papers |
| **Scale disadvantage** | Too small for efficient digital operations |
| **Audience fragmentation** | Local audiences split across many sources |
| **Metro blur** | Suburban readers don't identify with city paper |

### Competition Dynamics

| Competitor | Advantage Over Local News |
|------------|--------------------------|
| **National newspapers** | Scale, resources, prestige |
| **Social media** | Engagement, immediacy |
| **Podcasts** | Convenience, personality |
| **TV news** | Visual medium, free |
| **Blogs/newsletters** | Low cost, niche focus |

## Policy Causes

### Regulatory Failures

| Policy Gap | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **No platform regulation** | Tech companies extract value without contributing |
| **Section 230 immunity** | Platforms not liable for content; no incentive to pay for it |
| **Tax policy** | No incentives for local news |
| **Antitrust non-enforcement** | Platform monopolies unchallenged |
| **Broadcast deregulation** | Local TV ownership concentrated |

### Postal Subsidy Decline

| Era | Postal Support |
|-----|----------------|
| **1792** | Newspapers given preferential postal rates |
| **19th-20th century** | Below-cost delivery subsidized distribution |
| **1970s-present** | Subsidies reduced; rates increased |
| **Current** | Minimal postal advantage for newspapers |

### Missing Public Investment

| Country | Public Media Spending Per Capita |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| Norway | $180 |
| Germany | $142 |
| United Kingdom | $97 |
| Canada | $29 |
| **United States** | **$1.40** |

## Cultural Causes

### Declining News Habits

| Trend | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Generational shift** | Younger people don't read newspapers |
| **News avoidance** | Many avoid news entirely |
| **Trust decline** | 32% trust in media (Gallup) |
| **Partisan frames** | "Media" seen through political lens |

### Community Disconnection

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Mobility** | People move; don't develop local roots |
| **Commuting** | Work outside community of residence |
| **Online communities** | Replace geographic community ties |
| **Nationalized politics** | Local issues seem less important |

## Interconnected Causes

### The Vicious Cycle

```
Advertising Declines
        ↓
   Staff Cuts
        ↓
  Quality Declines
        ↓
 Readers Leave
        ↓
Advertising Declines More
        ↓
   More Staff Cuts
        ↓
      (repeat)
```

### Reinforcing Dynamics

| Dynamic | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Quality-audience spiral** | Less staff → worse coverage → fewer readers → less revenue |
| **Extraction acceleration** | Hedge funds cut faster than market decline requires |
| **Platform dependency** | More reliance on platforms → less direct reader relationship |
| **Talent flight** | Best journalists leave → quality drops → more leave |
| **Trust erosion** | Lower quality → less trust → fewer subscribers |
