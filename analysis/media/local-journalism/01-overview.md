# Local Journalism: Overview

## Executive Summary

Local journalism is the foundation of democratic accountability at the community level. When local newspapers and news outlets close, corruption flourishes, civic participation declines, and communities lose their shared identity and voice. Since 2005, over 2,900 newspapers have closed in the United States, leaving more than 200 counties with no local news coverage and over 1,500 more with only a single source. These "news deserts" correlate with lower voter turnout, less competitive local elections, higher municipal borrowing costs, and reduced civic engagement.

The collapse is primarily economic: digital platforms captured the advertising revenue that once sustained local news, while corporate consolidation extracted value from remaining papers rather than investing in journalism. The result is a crisis that threatens the very foundation of local democracy—the ability of citizens to know what their government is doing and hold officials accountable.

## Why This Matters

### For Local Democracy

| Function | Impact Without Local News |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **Government watchdog** | Corruption, waste, and abuse go unreported |
| **Electoral information** | Voters lack information about local candidates |
| **Public meeting coverage** | Citizens don't know what officials decide |
| **Budget scrutiny** | Spending decisions escape public review |
| **Court coverage** | Justice system operates without oversight |

### For Communities

| Area | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Civic engagement** | Voter turnout declines 8-10% in news deserts |
| **Economic development** | Business decisions lack information context |
| **Public health** | Local health crises go unreported |
| **Education** | School board decisions escape scrutiny |
| **Community identity** | Shared stories and connections lost |

### Research Findings

Studies document concrete harms from local news loss:

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Municipal borrowing costs rise 5-11 basis points | Gao, Lee, Murphy (2020) |
| Split-ticket voting declines, nationalized voting increases | Hayes & Lawless (2018) |
| CEO compensation increases when local papers close | Knyazeva, Pozen (2022) |
| Fewer candidates run for local office | Rubado & Jennings (2019) |
| Corruption convictions decline (less detection) | Gao, Lee, Murphy (2019) |

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Newspapers closed since 2005 | 2,900+ | Northwestern Medill |
| Counties with no newspaper | 204 | UNC Hussman |
| Counties with one newspaper | 1,562 | UNC Hussman |
| Newspaper employment decline 2008-2020 | 57% | Bureau of Labor Statistics |
| Local TV newsroom jobs lost 2008-2020 | 28% | Pew Research |
| Daily newspaper circulation (2022) | 20.9 million | Pew Research |
| Daily newspaper circulation (2005) | 53.3 million | Pew Research |
| Estimated weekly newspaper readers | 90+ million | News Media Alliance |

## The Collapse Timeline

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pre-2005** | Newspapers profitable but facing early online competition |
| **2005-2008** | Craigslist decimates classified advertising |
| **2008-2010** | Financial crisis accelerates closures; hedge funds begin buying |
| **2010-2015** | Google/Facebook capture growing digital ad market |
| **2015-2020** | Hedge fund strip-mining intensifies; COVID accelerates decline |
| **2020-present** | Continued closures; nonprofit and startup models emerge |

## What's Being Lost

### Types of Coverage Declining

| Coverage Type | Community Impact |
|---------------|------------------|
| **City council/county board** | Local policy made without scrutiny |
| **School board** | Education decisions unexamined |
| **Local courts** | Justice system lacks transparency |
| **Police/public safety** | Accountability diminished |
| **Local business** | Economic information gap |
| **Community events** | Social fabric weakens |
| **High school sports** | Youth recognition lost |
| **Obituaries** | Community memory fades |

### The Accountability Gap

Without local reporters:

- City managers operate without oversight
- Police misconduct goes unreported
- School spending escapes scrutiny
- Development deals lack transparency
- Corruption becomes harder to detect

## Emerging Models

### Promising Approaches

| Model | Examples | Strengths | Challenges |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Nonprofit newsroom** | Texas Tribune, Voice of San Diego, VTDigger | Mission-driven, foundation support | Fundraising intensive |
| **Public benefit corporation** | Philadelphia Inquirer | Balanced mission/sustainability | Rare ownership structure |
| **Cooperative ownership** | Colorado Sun | Community investment | Capital requirements |
| **University partnerships** | Various | Student labor, academic mission | Sustainability |
| **Philanthropic acquisition** | Baltimore Banner, Salt Lake Tribune | Deep pockets | Donor dependence |
| **Government-funded** | New Jersey Civic Information Consortium | Public investment | Independence concerns |
