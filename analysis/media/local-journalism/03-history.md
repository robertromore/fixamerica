## Lessons from History

## What History Suggests

### Patterns to Note

1. **Technology disruption is recurring** - Each new medium threatens predecessors
2. **Business models can be rebuilt** - Penny press, then advertising, then subscriptions
3. **Public interest requires investment** - Quality journalism has never been fully market-supported
4. **Consolidation precedes collapse** - Warning signs came decades before crisis
5. **New models emerge from crisis** - Nonprofit, digital-native outlets are innovation

### Questions History Raises

- Has advertising-supported journalism ever been sustainable long-term?
- What level of public investment has journalism historically required?
- How have other democracies maintained local news?
- What would it take to rebuild local news from scratch?
