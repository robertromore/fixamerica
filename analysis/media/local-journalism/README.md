# Local Journalism: Overview

Local journalism is the foundation of democratic accountability at the community level. When local newspapers and news outlets close, corruption flourishes, civic participation declines, and communities lose their shared identity and voice. Since 2005, over 2,900 newspapers have closed in the United States, leaving more than 200 counties with no local news coverage and over 1,500 more with only a single source. These "news deserts" correlate with lower voter turnout, less competitive local elections, higher municipal borrowing costs, and reduced civic engagement.
