# Local Journalism: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Saving local journalism requires a multi-pronged legislative approach: tax incentives to support subscribers, employers, and advertisers; platform accountability to ensure digital platforms compensate news creators; public investment to fill market failures; and structural reforms to encourage sustainable ownership models. This document provides draft legal text adapted from existing proposals and new frameworks.

```

**Explanation**:

- Section 3: 50% payroll tax credit for journalist wages (up to $50K per journalist)
- Section 4: 80% tax credit for small business advertising (up to $5K)
- Phases down over time to avoid permanent subsidy dependence

**Challenges**:

- Revenue cost (~$1.7 billion/year)
- Defining "local newspaper" precisely
- Preventing abuse by non-journalism outlets
- Sunset provisions may cause uncertainty

### Journalism Competition and Preservation Act

(b) LIMITATION.—The exemption provided under subsection (a) shall
not apply to negotiations that—
    (1) relate to the price of a news subscription, or

(a) DUTY TO NEGOTIATE.—A covered platform shall negotiate in good
faith with news content creators regarding compensation for the display

    binding final offer arbitration.
    (2) ARBITRATION PROCEDURES.—The arbitrator shall select either
    the final offer of the covered platform or the final offer of the
    news content creator, considering—
        "(A) the value of the content to the platform,
        "(B) the platform's revenue derived from content display,
        "(C) the benefit to news content creators from platform
        distribution, and
        "(D) the public interest in preserving journalism.

SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

(a) COVERED PLATFORM.—The term "covered platform" means an online
platform that—
    (1) has not fewer than 50,000,000 United States-based monthly

```

**Explanation**:

- Provides final-offer arbitration as backstop
- Prevents platform retaliation against negotiating publishers

**Challenges**:

- Platform opposition (may remove news rather than pay)
- Defining "news content creator" to exclude bad actors
- International coordination complexity
- Risk of benefiting large publishers over small

    information;
    (2) more than 2,900 newspapers have closed since 2005, leaving
    many communities without local news coverage;
    (3) research demonstrates that the absence of local journalism
    is associated with higher government borrowing costs, reduced
    civic participation, and increased corruption;

## Regulatory Framework

### FCC Local News Rules

**Proposed Rulemaking**: Enhanced local news requirements for broadcast licensees.

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Local content minimum** | 15% of programming from local news |
| **Staffing disclosure** | Report local journalism employees |
| **Community needs assessment** | Document local information gaps |
| **Diversity requirements** | Reflect community demographics |

### Postal Rate Reform

**Proposed Action**: Restore preferential postal rates for newspapers.

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Reduce periodical rates** | 30% reduction for local papers |
| **Rural delivery support** | Subsidize distant delivery |
| **Digital transition support** | Technology assistance |

## Constitutional Considerations

### First Amendment Analysis

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Content-based restriction** | All provisions are content-neutral |
| **Government speech** | No government control over content |
| **Prior restraint** | No restriction on publication |
| **Compelled speech** | No editorial requirements |

**Key Principles**:

1. Public funding does not equal government control (PBS/NPR precedent)
2. Structural requirements (nonprofit status, local focus) are content-neutral
3. Independent governance structures prevent political interference
4. Multiple funding sources maintain editorial independence

### Commerce Clause

JCPA requires platforms to negotiate; this is regulation of interstate commerce clearly within Congressional power.

### Taxation Power

Tax incentives are within Congress's taxing authority; prior precedents for targeted tax credits (renewable energy, R&D, etc.).

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Definition gaming** | Non-journalism outlets claiming credits | High |
| **Platform workarounds** | Removing news rather than paying | High |
| **Hedge fund eligibility** | Extraction-focused owners getting credits | Medium |
| **Content factory abuse** | Low-quality outlets claiming benefits | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Insufficient funding** | Won't fully replace lost revenue | Political constraints |
| **Slow implementation** | Outlets closing during phase-in | Legislative process |
| **Geographic gaps** | Some areas still underserved | Market structure |
| **Independence concerns** | Public funding raises questions | Historical distrust |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Definition refinement**: Require minimum original reporting percentage
2. **Platform backstop**: Include must-carry provisions as fallback
3. **Ownership conditions**: Require reinvestment commitments for tax credits
4. **Quality standards**: Tie benefits to journalism employment levels
5. **Expedited implementation**: Allow emergency grants during transition
6. **Independence safeguards**: Multiple firewalls between funding and content
