# Media and Information: Overview

A functioning democracy requires citizens to have access to accurate, diverse information about public affairs. America's media ecosystem is in crisis: local journalism is collapsing, media ownership has concentrated into a handful of corporate giants, social media platforms amplify misinformation while evading accountability, and partisan news sources have fragmented the shared reality necessary for democratic deliberation. Since 2005, over 2,900 newspapers have closed, leaving half of U.S. counties with limited or no local news coverage. Meanwhile, platform monopolies like Meta and Google capture the majority of digital advertising revenue while algorithmic feeds prioritize engagement over accuracy.
