# Media and Information: Root Causes

## Overview

The crisis in American media and information is not the result of any single factor but emerges from the interaction of economic disruption, technological transformation, regulatory failure, and cultural shifts. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective interventions.

## Economic Causes

### The Collapse of the Advertising Business Model

**The Fundamental Problem**

For over a century, journalism was subsidized by advertising. Readers paid a fraction of the true cost; advertisers paid the rest. This model depended on newspapers controlling the connection between advertisers and audiences.

| Era | Advertising Revenue Model |
|-----|---------------------------|
| Print monopoly | Classified ads, display ads, inserts funded journalism |
| Early digital | Hoped digital ads would replace print revenue |
| Platform era | Google/Meta captured advertising relationship |
| Current | Revenue divorced from journalism production |

**Why Digital Advertising Doesn't Work for News**

| Print Advertising | Digital Advertising |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Geographic monopoly | Infinite inventory |
| Scarcity created value | Abundance destroyed pricing |
| Bundled with news | Can target without content |
| Local businesses depended on paper | National platforms more efficient |
| $30-50 CPM (cost per thousand) | $1-5 CPM for display |

**The Craigslist Effect**

Classified advertising funded local news:

| Category | Pre-2000 Revenue | Current Revenue |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Help wanted | Newspapers | Indeed, LinkedIn |
| Real estate | Newspapers | Zillow, Redfin |
| Auto sales | Newspapers | Cars.com, Carvana |
| Personals | Newspapers | Dating apps |
| General classifieds | Newspapers | Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace |

Result: $20 billion in annual classified revenue eliminated from newspapers.

### Platform Economics

**The Attention Extraction Model**

| Platform Incentive | Consequence for News |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Maximize engagement | Sensational content rewarded |
| Maximize time on platform | Users don't visit news sites |
| Personalization | Filter bubbles form |
| Free content | Devalues paid journalism |
| Network effects | Winner-take-all markets |

**Revenue Capture**

| Entity | Share of Digital Ad Spending |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Google | ~29% |
| Meta | ~22% |
| Amazon | ~11% |
| All news publishers | <5% |

Platforms captured the advertising relationship while externalizing the cost of content creation to publishers.

### Private Equity and Hedge Fund Extraction

**The Vulture Capitalism Model**

| Stage | Hedge Fund Action | Impact |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Acquisition | Buy undervalued paper | Often below asset value |
| Cost cutting | Fire 50-75% of staff | Quality collapses |
| Asset stripping | Sell real estate, equipment | Cash extracted |
| Debt loading | Borrow against the paper | Risk transferred to paper |
| Final extraction | Sell or close | Community loses news |

**Why This Happens**

- Newspapers have valuable real estate
- Pension obligations can be reduced in bankruptcy
- Tax advantages from depreciation
- No regulatory barriers to acquisition
- No accountability for community harm

## Technological Causes

### The Unbundling of News

**What the Internet Disrupted**

| Bundled Product | Unbundled Replacement |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Daily newspaper | Infinite websites |
| Sports section | ESPN, team sites, Twitter |
| Weather | Weather apps, websites |
| Stock quotes | Financial apps |
| Comics/puzzles | Dedicated apps |
| Local events | Facebook Events, Eventbrite |
| Obituaries | Legacy.com, funeral home sites |
| News | Aggregators, social feeds |

The newspaper was a bundle; the internet unbundled it, and each piece found a more efficient provider—except accountability journalism.

### Algorithmic Amplification

**How Algorithms Prioritize Content**

| Signal | Effect on News |
|--------|----------------|
| Engagement (likes, shares, comments) | Outrage and conflict rewarded |
| Click-through rate | Clickbait headlines incentivized |
| Time on page | Longer doesn't mean better |
| Social signals | Tribal content spreads faster |
| Recency | Breaking news over analysis |
| Personalization | Echo chambers form |

**The Misinformation Advantage**

Research shows false information spreads faster because it:

- Triggers stronger emotional responses
- Is more novel (not constrained by facts)
- Confirms existing biases
- Has no editorial review slowing distribution
- Can be manufactured at scale cheaply

### The Attention Economy

**Competition for Attention**

| Competitor | Time Captured |
|------------|---------------|
| Social media | 2+ hours/day average |
| Streaming video | 4+ hours/day average |
| Gaming | 1+ hour/day (gamers) |
| News consumption | Declining |

News competes against entertainment optimized for engagement. Journalism rarely wins.

## Regulatory Causes

### Deregulation and Consolidation

**The Regulatory Retreat**

| Year | Action | Consequence |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1981 | Radio deregulation | Public interest requirements weakened |
| 1984 | TV deregulation | Fewer community obligations |
| 1987 | Fairness Doctrine eliminated | Partisan media flourishes |
| 1996 | Telecommunications Act | Massive ownership consolidation |
| 2017 | Cross-ownership rules eliminated | Newspapers and TV can combine |
| 2020s | Platform immunity preserved | No accountability for amplification |

**The 1996 Telecommunications Act Failure**

Predicted: Competition would improve service and diversity
Actual result:

- Radio stations per owner: 40 → 1,200+
- TV station consolidation accelerated
- Newspaper chains expanded
- Competition decreased
- Local voices reduced

### Section 230 and Platform Immunity

**The Liability Shield**

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (1996):

> "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."

| Intended Purpose | Actual Effect |
|------------------|---------------|
| Protect early internet innovation | Immunizes trillion-dollar platforms |
| Allow good-faith moderation | No requirement to moderate |
| Enable startup growth | Entrenches dominant platforms |
| Prevent state-by-state rules | Blocks accountability |

**The Amplification Problem**

Section 230 was written for passive hosts, not algorithmic amplifiers. Platforms now:

- Actively curate and recommend content
- Design for engagement, not quality
- Profit from viral misinformation
- Face no liability for harms

### Underfunded Public Media

**The Choice Not to Fund**

| Country | Per Capita Public Media Spending |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| Germany (ARD/ZDF) | ~$140 |
| United Kingdom (BBC) | ~$100 |
| Japan (NHK) | ~$65 |
| Canada (CBC) | ~$30 |
| **United States (CPB)** | **~$1.40** |

The U.S. made a deliberate policy choice to rely on commercial media, leaving journalism to market forces.

**Consequences of Underfunding**

- No robust national news service
- Local public media starved
- Dependence on philanthropy and corporate underwriting
- Vulnerability to political pressure
- No counterweight to commercial media incentives

## Political Causes

### The "Liberal Media" Campaign

**Origins and Strategy**

Starting in the 1960s-70s, conservative strategists deliberately worked to undermine trust in mainstream media:

| Tactic | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| "Liberal media" framing | Created perception of bias |
| Alternative media ecosystem | Built parallel information channels |
| Attack fact-checking | Undermined corrections |
| "Both sides" pressure | Forced false equivalence |
| Distrust as identity | Made distrust a political marker |

**The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**

As conservatives abandoned mainstream media, journalists increasingly identified as liberal, creating actual demographic imbalance in newsrooms—which further fed the narrative.

### Polarization and Identity

**Media as Tribal Marker**

| Media Source | Viewer/Reader Identity |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Fox News | Republican, conservative |
| MSNBC | Democrat, liberal |
| NPR/PBS | Educated, liberal-leaning |
| Local news | Shrinking, less partisan |
| Social media | Algorithmic echo chambers |

News consumption has become a signal of political identity rather than a source of shared information.

### Political Attacks on Press

**Erosion of Press Legitimacy**

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| 1960s-70s | Nixon's "enemies list" includes journalists |
| 1980s-90s | Talk radio attacks "mainstream media" |
| 2000s | "Blogosphere" challenges legacy media |
| 2010s | Social media bypasses traditional gatekeepers |
| 2016-present | "Fake news" and "enemy of the people" rhetoric |

Political leaders learned they could attack the messenger rather than address the message.

## Cultural Causes

### The Decline of Civic Culture

**Community Disconnection**

| Trend | Impact on News |
|-------|----------------|
| Declining civic participation | Less interest in local affairs |
| Residential mobility | Less community attachment |
| Digital entertainment | News competes against streaming |
| Declining newspaper habit | Generational shift away from news |
| Trust erosion | Skepticism extends to journalism |

### Information Abundance and Attention Scarcity

**The Paradox of Choice**

| Information Environment | User Behavior |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Print era scarcity | Read what was available |
| Early internet | Seek out diverse sources |
| Social media era | Algorithm chooses |
| Current abundance | Overwhelm, retreat to familiar |

Too much information can lead to disengagement, not enlightenment.

### The Credentialing of Journalism

**Who Becomes a Journalist**

| Era | Typical Path |
|-----|--------------|
| Early 20th century | Variety of backgrounds, no degree required |
| Mid-century | J-school optional |
| Late 20th century | J-school increasingly expected |
| 21st century | Internships require wealth, connections |

Journalism has become less economically diverse, with entry barriers that favor the affluent. This affects coverage and public trust.

## Interconnections

### How Causes Reinforce Each Other

```text
Economic collapse → Fewer journalists → Less local coverage →
                                                    ↓
            Declining trust ← Platform dominance ← Community disconnection
                    ↓                                       ↓
            Media as identity → Polarization → Political attacks on press
                    ↓                                       ↓
            Alternative media ecosystem ← Misinformation thrives
```

### The Vicious Cycles

**Cycle 1: Economic-Quality Spiral**

1. Revenue declines
2. Staff cuts
3. Quality declines
4. Readers leave
5. Revenue declines further

**Cycle 2: Trust-Polarization Spiral**

1. Trust in media declines
2. People seek partisan sources
3. Media becomes more partisan
4. Shared reality erodes
5. Trust declines further

**Cycle 3: Local News Death Spiral**

1. Local paper closes or shrinks
2. Corruption goes unchecked
3. Civic engagement declines
4. Community cohesion weakens
5. Fewer people would pay for local news

## What's NOT the Root Cause

### Misdiagnosed Problems

| Often Blamed | Actual Role |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Biased journalists" | Symptom of economic/cultural forces |
| "People don't read" | News consumption shifted, didn't disappear |
| "Young people don't care" | Different consumption patterns, not apathy |
| "Too much news" | The business model failed, not demand |
| "Technology is bad" | Technology is neutral; design choices matter |

### The Structural Nature of the Crisis

The crisis is not primarily about bad actors or poor decisions. It reflects:

- Fundamental economic disruption (legitimate market shift)
- Policy choices (deregulation, underfunded public media)
- Platform design (engagement over accuracy)
- Historical path dependence (ad-funded model vulnerability)

Solutions must address structures, not just behaviors.
