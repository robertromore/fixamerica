# Media and Information: Roadmap

## Implementation Strategy Overview

Reform of America's media and information ecosystem requires action across multiple fronts simultaneously: federal legislation, state-level innovation, regulatory reform, industry transformation, and civil society mobilization. No single action will be sufficient; success requires sustained, coordinated effort.

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Now)

### Contingency Plans

**If Federal Action Stalls**

2. Support alternative distribution
3. Accelerate direct funding
4. International coordination on platform rules

**If Public Media Becomes Politicized**

## Success Scenario

### What Victory Looks Like

**By Year 5**

- Every county has access to local accountability journalism
- Platform monopolies broken or regulated
- Sustainable funding for local news established
- Public media serving all communities
- Misinformation reduced through platform accountability
- Media trust recovering

**By Year 10**

- Robust, diverse local news ecosystem
- Business models sustainable without ongoing crisis

- Platforms unaccountable and dominant
- Misinformation unchecked
- Democratic accountability impossible
- Trust collapse complete

The stakes are high. The window for action is closing. But with sustained effort across all fronts, a healthy information ecosystem is achievable.
