# Media Consolidation: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Addressing media consolidation requires action at multiple levels: FCC rulemaking to restore ownership limits, congressional legislation to codify limits and require transparency, antitrust enforcement to block harmful mergers, and state-level action to fill federal gaps. This document provides draft legal text for key reforms.

## Federal Legislation

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Media Ownership Transparency Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) media ownership has become increasingly opaque due to complex
    corporate structures, hedge fund acquisitions, and private equity
    involvement;
    (2) the public has a right to know who controls the media outlets
    that inform democratic discourse;
    (3) current disclosure requirements are inadequate to reveal true
    beneficial ownership; and
    (4) transparency is necessary for effective regulation and public
    accountability.

SEC. 3. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP DISCLOSURE.

(a) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this Act, "beneficial owner" means
any natural person who, directly or indirectly—
    (1) exercises substantial control over a covered media entity;
    (2) owns or controls 5 percent or more of any class of equity
    interests in a covered media entity; or
    (3) receives 5 percent or more of the economic benefit of a
    covered media entity.

    (3) geographic market; and
    (4) ownership percentage.

SEC. 5. PENALTIES.

(a) CIVIL PENALTIES.—Any covered media entity that fails to file
required disclosures or files materially false disclosures shall be
subject to civil penalties of not less than $10,000 and not more than

this Act in any license renewal or transfer proceeding.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Media Ownership Diversity Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
    (1) media ownership concentration has increased dramatically
    following deregulation;
    (2) concentration has resulted in reduced local news coverage,
    newsroom layoffs, and homogenized content;
    (3) diverse media ownership is essential to democratic discourse;
    (4) the FCC has failed to maintain ownership limits necessary
    to serve the public interest.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to restore media ownership
diversity by establishing meaningful ownership limits.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL TELEVISION OWNERSHIP LIMIT.

Section 202(c) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is amended to
provide that no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast
television stations that in the aggregate reach more than 25 percent
of the households in the United States.

SEC. 4. LOCAL TELEVISION OWNERSHIP LIMIT.

(a) PROHIBITION ON DUOPOLIES.—Except as provided in subsection (b),
no entity may have an attributable interest in more than one
broadcast television station in any designated market area.

(b) EXCEPTION.—The FCC may grant a waiver permitting an entity to
own two stations in a market only if—
    (1) there would remain at least 8 independently owned stations
    in the market after the combination;

    stations in the market; and
    (3) the applicant demonstrates specific public interest benefits.

SEC. 7. REVIEW PROCESS.

(a) BIENNIAL REVIEW.—The FCC shall conduct a biennial review of
media ownership rules to determine whether they remain necessary
to serve the public interest.

(b) PRESUMPTION.—In conducting such review, there shall be a
presumption in favor of maintaining or strengthening ownership limits.

SEC. 8. DIVESTITURE.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—Any entity exceeding the ownership limits

### Journalism Preservation Through Ownership Reform Act

**Purpose**: Address hedge fund and private equity ownership practices.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Journalism Preservation Through
Ownership Reform Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) hedge funds and private equity firms have acquired hundreds
    of newspapers and other news outlets;
    (2) these acquisitions are often followed by severe staff
    reductions, asset stripping, and degraded journalism;
    (3) communities lose essential local news coverage when
    extraction-focused owners acquire local outlets;
    (4) traditional antitrust analysis fails to capture the public
    interest harms of such acquisitions.

(a) FINANCIAL BUYER.—A "financial buyer" means any entity—
    (1) that is registered as an investment adviser or private fund;
    (2) whose primary business is investing for financial returns
    rather than operating media businesses; or
    (3) that uses significant debt financing to acquire news
    organizations.

primarily engaged in gathering and disseminating news to the public.

SEC. 4. SPECIAL REVIEW FOR FINANCIAL BUYERS.

(a) REQUIRED REVIEW.—Any acquisition of a news organization by a
financial buyer shall be subject to review by the Federal Trade
Commission.

(b) FACTORS.—In reviewing such acquisitions, the FTC shall consider—
    (1) the likely effect on journalism employment;
    (2) the acquirer's history with previously acquired news
    organizations;
    (3) the level of debt financing;
    (4) the impact on local news coverage; and
    (5) alternatives to the proposed acquisition.

(c) PRESUMPTION.—There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an
acquisition by a financial buyer that would result in significant
debt burden or has a pattern of staff reductions is contrary to
the public interest.

SEC. 5. CONDITIONS ON APPROVAL.

If the FTC approves an acquisition subject to this Act, it may
impose conditions including—
    (1) limits on debt levels;
    (2) minimum staffing requirements;
    (3) prohibitions on asset sales for a specified period;
    (4) requirements for reinvestment of profits; and
    (5) reporting and monitoring requirements.

SEC. 6. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

(a) CAUSE OF ACTION.—Any person employed by a news organization
acquired by a financial buyer may bring a civil action against the
acquirer for violations of conditions imposed under Section 5.

(b) REMEDIES.—The court may award—
    (1) injunctive relief;
    (2) actual damages;
    (3) attorney's fees; and
    (4) such other relief as the court deems appropriate.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall apply to acquisitions announced after the date of
enactment.

## FCC Rulemaking

### Proposed Ownership Rule Changes

| Current Rule | Proposed Change |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **No national TV cap** | 25% national reach cap |
| **Duopoly waivers common** | Strict duopoly prohibition |
| **No radio national limit** | 50-station national cap |
| **No cross-ownership ban** | Restore newspaper-broadcast ban |

### Rulemaking Petition Template

Key elements for filing with FCC:

1. Statement of interest
2. Description of market failures
3. Proposed rule changes
4. Public interest justification
5. Legal authority
6. Requested action

## Constitutional Considerations

### First Amendment Analysis

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| **Editorial control** | Ownership rules don't affect content |
| **Prior restraint** | No restriction on publication |
| **Government speech** | No government viewpoint preference |

**Key Precedent**: *FCC v. National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting* (1978) upheld ownership limits as serving diversity without restricting speech.

### Commerce Clause

Congress has clear authority to regulate interstate media commerce.

### Due Process

| Requirement | Satisfaction |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Notice** | Rulemaking provides notice |
| **Hearing** | Comment periods allow participation |
| **Rational basis** | Public interest justifies limits |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Shell company structures** | Hide true ownership | High |
| **Sidecar arrangements** | Circumvent limits | High |
| **Definition gaming** | Avoid "news organization" definition | Medium |
| **Waiver abuse** | Exceptions become rule | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Enforcement resources** | FCC capacity limited | Budget constraints |
| **Divestiture difficulty** | Finding buyers hard | Market conditions |
| **Retroactivity limits** | Can't undo past mergers easily | Legal constraints |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen definitions** to prevent gaming
2. **Close sidecar loophole** explicitly
3. **Mandatory disclosure** of all related entities
4. **Enhanced monitoring** resources
5. **Automatic triggers** for review
6. **Private enforcement** rights
