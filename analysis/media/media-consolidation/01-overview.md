# Media Consolidation: Overview

## Executive Summary

Media consolidation—the concentration of media ownership into fewer, larger entities—fundamentally threatens the diversity of voices, local accountability, and democratic discourse in America. Since the 1980s, ownership limits have been steadily relaxed, allowing a handful of corporations to control the majority of what Americans read, watch, and hear. Today, just five companies control over 90% of national media, hedge funds own hundreds of local newspapers, and a few broadcast giants dominate local television. This concentration prioritizes shareholder returns over journalism quality, eliminates local voices, and homogenizes content.

The consequences are severe: local newsrooms are gutted to extract profits, investigative journalism is slashed as too expensive, and community-specific coverage disappears in favor of syndicated content. Media consolidation is not just a business story—it is a threat to the information ecosystem that democracy requires.
