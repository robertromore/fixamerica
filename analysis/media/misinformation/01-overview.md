# Misinformation: Overview

## Executive Summary

Misinformation—false or misleading information spread regardless of intent—and disinformation—deliberately false information spread to deceive—have become defining challenges of the digital age. The same technologies that democratized information access have enabled the rapid spread of falsehoods about elections, public health, science, and current events. Misinformation undermines public health responses, erodes trust in institutions, polarizes society, and threatens democratic decision-making. While misinformation has always existed, digital platforms have amplified its reach and impact, creating an information environment where falsehoods can spread faster than facts.
