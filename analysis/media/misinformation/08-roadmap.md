# Misinformation: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Framework

### Core Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **First Amendment compliance** | No government speech regulation |
| **Structural over content** | Address systems, not specific claims |
| **Multi-stakeholder** | Government, platforms, civil society |
| **Evidence-based** | Research-informed interventions |
| **Adaptive** | Evolve with changing landscape |

### Theory of Change

```
Platform accountability + Media literacy + Trust rebuilding
        ↓                     ↓                  ↓
Reduce amplification    Resistant population   Quality information
        ↓                     ↓                  ↓
            Healthier information environment
```
