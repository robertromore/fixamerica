## The Crisis Today

### Local Journalism Collapse

**The News Desert Crisis**

America is experiencing an unprecedented collapse of local journalism:

| Metric | Current State |
|--------|---------------|
| Newspapers closed since 2005 | 2,900+ |
| Remaining daily newspapers | ~1,200 (down from 1,700) |
| Counties with no local news | 204 (6.5% of U.S. counties) |
| Counties with only one source | 1,562 (50% of counties) |
| "Ghost newspapers" (minimal staff) | 1,000+ |

**Employment Collapse**

| Period | Newsroom Employment | Change |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| 2008 | 71,000 | Baseline |
| 2014 | 53,000 | -25% |
| 2020 | 31,000 | -57% |
| 2024 | ~25,000 | -65% |

**What's Being Lost**

- City hall coverage
- School board reporting
- Local court coverage
- Community event coverage
- Investigative journalism on local corruption
- Coverage of local elections

### Media Consolidation

**Newspaper Ownership Concentration**

| **Lee Enterprises** | 77 dailies | Targeted by Alden |
| **McClatchy** | 30 papers (bankrupt 2020) | Sold to hedge fund |

**Hedge Fund Impact**

When hedge funds acquire papers:

- Staff cuts of 50-75% common
- Real estate sold, leased back
- Pension obligations reduced
- Quality declines, circulation falls
- Papers often closed after extraction

**Broadcast Consolidation**

|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Nexstar | 200+ | 68% of U.S. households |
