## Power Analysis

### Who Has the Most Power?

| Stakeholder | Power Source | Constraint |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Platform companies | Market dominance, resources | Public pressure, regulation threat |
| Congress | Legislative authority | Gridlock, lobbying |
| Hedge funds | Capital, no accountability | None currently |
| Major foundations | Resources | Scale limitations |
| Public | Collective action | Coordination problems |

### Who Is Most Affected?

| Stakeholder | Impact Level | Voice Level |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Rural communities | High | Low |
| Local journalists | High | Moderate |
| Marginalized groups | High | Low |
| Platform companies | Low | High |
| Hedge fund owners | Low | High |

### Power Imbalance

The stakeholders with the most power to change the system (platforms, Congress, hedge funds) have the least incentive to do so. Those most harmed (communities, journalists, democracy) have the least power.

This imbalance explains why the crisis persists despite widespread awareness.
