# Media and Information: History

## Origins of American Media

### Colonial Era and Early Republic (1690-1830)

**The First Amendment Foundation**

The First Amendment (1791) established press freedom as fundamental to democracy:

> "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press."

**Early Press Characteristics**

### The Penny Press Revolution (1830s-1860s)

**Mass Media Emerges**

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Cheap printing technology | Papers cost 1 cent vs. 6 cents |
| Mass literacy | Broader readership |
| Advertising model | Revenue from ads, not subscriptions |

| 1920 | KDKA Pittsburgh - first commercial broadcast |
| 1927 | Radio Act - federal licensing begins |
| 1934 | Communications Act - FCC created |

**The Public Interest Standard**

Broadcasters received free spectrum in exchange for serving "public interest, convenience, and necessity":

## Deregulation and Consolidation (1980s-2000s)

## Lessons from History

### What Worked

| Era | Successful Element | Why It Worked |
|-----|-------------------|---------------|
| Muckraking | Investigative journalism | Exposed corruption, drove reform |
| Broadcast news golden age | Shared facts, trusted anchors | Public interest requirements |
| Public broadcasting | Educational, quality content | Dedicated funding, independence |
| Local ownership | Community connection | Accountability to community |

### What Failed

| Policy | Why It Failed |
|--------|---------------|
| Deregulation | Assumed markets would provide public goods |
| Fairness Doctrine repeal | Enabled partisan media bubbles |
| 1996 Telecom Act | Consolidation harmed diversity |
| Platform immunity (Section 230) | No accountability for amplification |
| Minimal public media funding | Left journalism to market forces |

### Patterns That Repeat

1. **New technology disrupts business models**: Penny press, radio, TV, internet each disrupted prior media
2. **Consolidation follows deregulation**: Ownership limits removed → concentration
3. **Sensationalism sells**: Yellow journalism, cable news, viral content
4. **Public goods require public support**: Markets alone don't produce quality journalism
5. **Regulation shapes outcomes**: FCC rules created and then destroyed broadcast news quality
