# Media and Information: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Legislation addressing the media and information crisis must navigate the First Amendment's strong protections for speech and press. This means reforms generally cannot regulate content directly but must instead focus on structural interventions: funding mechanisms, ownership rules, platform accountability for business practices (not speech), and transparency requirements. The legislative framework below emphasizes approaches that have survived or would likely survive constitutional scrutiny.

## Constitutional Amendments

Constitutional amendments are generally **not required** for media reform because:

- Funding journalism does not restrict speech
- Ownership limits regulate structure, not content
- Platform accountability can be structured as business regulation
- Transparency requirements are generally permissible

However, one amendment could clarify platform accountability:

### Digital Platform Accountability Amendment

**Purpose**: Clarify that algorithmic amplification is not protected speech and that platforms may be held accountable for the consequences of their design choices without violating the First Amendment.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. The protections of the First Amendment shall not be
construed to prohibit Congress or the States from establishing
reasonable regulations governing the algorithmic amplification,
recommendation, or promotion of content by digital communications
platforms, provided such regulations do not directly regulate the
content of speech.

Section 2. Nothing in this article shall be construed to require
any platform to host, remove, or modify any particular content.

Section 3. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.

Section 4. This article shall take effect two years after
ratification.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 1: Permits regulation of algorithmic design choices while preserving content protections
- Section 2: Clarifies this doesn't create hosting mandates
- Section 3: Standard enforcement clause
- Section 4: Allows implementation time

**Potential Challenges**:

- Amendment process is extremely difficult
- Tech industry opposition would be intense
- Defining "algorithmic amplification" may prove difficult
- May not be necessary if courts uphold statutory approaches

**Refinements**:

- Focus on statutory approaches first; amendment only if courts strike down platform accountability laws
- Consider narrower language focused on "commercial algorithmic systems"

## Federal Legislation

### Local Journalism Sustainability Act

**Purpose**: Provide tax incentives to sustain local news employment and encourage subscriptions, based on bipartisan bill introduced in Congress.

```

**Explanation**:

- Three-pronged approach targeting employment, subscriptions, and advertising
- Employment credit incentivizes hiring journalists (50% first year, 30% thereafter)
- $50,000 cap per journalist prevents subsidy capture by highly-paid national outlets
- Subscription credit up to $250 encourages reader support
- Small business advertising credit keeps ad revenue flowing to local news
- 5-year sunset allows congressional review

**Potential Challenges**:

- Cost estimates vary widely ($1.5-2.5B annually)
- Definition of "local news" may be gamed
- Hedge fund owners could claim credits while cutting staff
- May primarily benefit larger local outlets

**Refinements**:

- Add net employment requirements to prevent claiming credits while downsizing
- Tighten definitions to exclude "pink slime" sites
- Consider nonprofit eligibility with modifications

Preservation Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) A free and diverse press is essential to a well-functioning
democracy.

from effectively negotiating with dominant platforms.

(5) Collective negotiation is necessary to address the imbalance
of bargaining power between platforms and news publishers.

    (2) are expressly or constructively exclusionary, or designed to
    reduce competition among news content creators.

(c) Duration.—The safe harbor under subsection (a) shall expire
8 years after the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 4. MANDATORY ARBITRATION.

(a) Requirement.—If a covered platform and one or more news content
creators have been engaged in good-faith negotiations for not less
than 180 days and have not reached an agreement regarding the terms
described in section 3(a), any party may initiate final-offer
arbitration.

(b) Final-Offer Arbitration.—

    (1) Each party shall submit to the arbitration panel a proposed
    agreement on the terms described in section 3(a).

    consider—

        (A) the direct and indirect benefit of the content of the
        news content creator to the covered platform,

        (B) the direct and indirect benefit to the news content
        creator of access to the covered platform,

        (C) the cost to the covered platform of providing access to
        news content, and

        (D) similar agreements that have been reached between news
        content creators and covered platforms.

(c) Small Publisher Protections.—

    (1) A covered platform may not refuse to negotiate with or
    discriminate against a news content creator on the basis of
    size or viewpoint.

## Regulatory Framework

### FCC Broadcast Ownership Rule Restoration

**Existing Authority**: Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 303, 307, 309, 310

**Draft Regulation**:

```text
47 CFR Part 73 - Radio Broadcast Services

SUBPART - LOCAL OWNERSHIP LIMITATIONS

§ 73.3555 Multiple ownership.

(a) Local television ownership limit. An entity may have a
cognizable interest in television broadcast stations that in the
aggregate reach no more than 39 percent of television households
nationwide.

(b) Local radio ownership limit. In a radio market with—

    (1) 45 or more full-power commercial and noncommercial radio
    stations, an entity may have a cognizable interest in up to
    8 commercial radio stations, not more than 5 of which may be
    in the same service (AM or FM);

    (2) between 30 and 44 (inclusive) full-power commercial and
    noncommercial radio stations, an entity may have a cognizable
    interest in up to 7 commercial radio stations, not more than
    4 of which may be in the same service;

    (3) between 15 and 29 (inclusive) full-power commercial and
    noncommercial radio stations, an entity may have a cognizable
    interest in up to 6 commercial radio stations, not more than
    4 of which may be in the same service;

    (4) 14 or fewer full-power commercial and noncommercial radio
    stations, an entity may have a cognizable interest in up to
    5 commercial radio stations, not more than 3 of which may be
    in the same service, except that an entity may not have a
    cognizable interest in more than 50 percent of the stations
    in such market.

(c) Newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership limit. No license shall be
granted to any party if such party directly or indirectly owns,
operates, or controls a daily newspaper and the party, or any
entity under common control with such party, seeks a broadcast
license for a station whose principal community contour encompasses
the entire community in which the newspaper is published.

(d) Local television/radio cross-ownership. In markets with fewer
than 10 independently owned media voices, an entity may not have
a cognizable interest in both television and radio stations in
the same market.

(e) Public interest consideration. In evaluating any application
that would result in common ownership approaching the limits in
this section, the Commission shall consider whether the proposed
ownership structure will—

    (1) serve the public interest in diverse and local programming,

    (2) maintain or increase local news and public affairs
    programming, and

    (3) promote competition in local media markets.
```

**Explanation**:

- Restores ownership limits relaxed in 2017
- Cross-ownership ban prevents newspaper-broadcast combinations
- Public interest review for combinations approaching limits

### FTC Platform Competition Rules

**Existing Authority**: Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45

**Draft Regulation**:

```text
16 CFR Part 460 - Unfair Methods of Competition Affecting Digital
News Distribution

§ 460.1 Purpose and scope.

This part establishes rules to prevent unfair methods of competition
by covered platforms that harm competition in the news publishing
industry.

§ 460.2 Definitions.

(a) "Covered platform" means an online service that—

    (1) has annual United States revenues exceeding $25,000,000,000
    or a market capitalization exceeding $500,000,000,000,

    (2) uses algorithmic systems to distribute or recommend content,
    and

    (3) derives a substantial portion of content from third-party
    publishers.

(b) "News publisher" means an entity that employs journalists to
create original news content for distribution to the public.

§ 460.3 Prohibited practices.

It shall be an unfair method of competition for a covered platform
to—

(a) Self-preference. Systematically prefer content from the
platform's own properties over comparable third-party content in
algorithmic rankings;

(b) Restrict data. Deny news publishers access to data about
engagement with their content on the platform;

(c) Discriminatory treatment. Discriminate against news publishers
in algorithmic distribution based on the content of coverage;

(d) Tying. Condition access to advertising services or other
platform features on acceptance of unfavorable content distribution
terms;

(e) Retaliation. Reduce distribution of news content in response to
a publisher's exercise of legal rights or advocacy for platform
regulation.

§ 460.4 Required practices.

A covered platform shall—

(a) Provide news publishers with transparent information about
factors affecting distribution of their content;

(b) Offer news publishers a reasonable mechanism to appeal
algorithmic decisions affecting their content;

(c) Maintain publicly available policies regarding news content
distribution.

§ 460.5 Enforcement.

Violations of this part shall be treated as unfair methods of
competition under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.
```

**Explanation**:

- Uses existing FTC authority over unfair competition
- Addresses self-preferencing, data access, discrimination
- Does not regulate content, only competitive practices

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**First Amendment Analysis**

| Provision | Constitutional Basis | Risk Level |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| Journalism tax credits | Content-neutral financial support | Low |
| Collective bargaining safe harbor | Antitrust exemption, not speech regulation | Low |
| Local news fund | Viewpoint-neutral funding | Low-Medium |
| Algorithmic transparency | Compelled disclosure of business practices | Medium |
| Platform accountability | Business regulation vs. editorial discretion | Medium-High |
| Ownership limits | Economic regulation of media structure | Low |

**Key Precedents**

| Case | Holding | Application |
|------|---------|-------------|
| *Miami Herald v. Tornillo* (1974) | Cannot compel newspaper to publish content | Funding doesn't compel content |
| *Red Lion v. FCC* (1969) | Broadcast regulation permissible | Supports platform regulation |
| *Turner Broadcasting v. FCC* (1994) | Must-carry rules constitutional | Economic regulation of distribution |
| *Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel* (1985) | Compelled commercial disclosure permissible | Supports transparency rules |
| *NetChoice v. Paxton* (pending) | Platform editorial discretion | Key pending case |

**Strongest Arguments for Reform**

1. Funding journalism doesn't regulate speech
2. Ownership limits are structural, not content-based
3. Platform amplification is conduct, not speech
4. Transparency requirements are commercial disclosure
5. Public media has operated for decades without content control

### Preemption Questions

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| State platform payment laws | Likely not preempted by Section 230; economic regulation |
| State ownership limits | May be preempted by FCC rules |
| State tax credits | No federal preemption; concurrent authority |
| State content moderation laws | Uncertain; pending litigation |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Enforcement Body | Authority |
|------------------|-----------|
| FCC | Broadcast licensing, ownership rules |
| FTC | Unfair practices, platform competition |
| DOJ Antitrust | Merger review, monopolization |
| State AGs | State law enforcement, consumer protection |
| Private litigation | Where enabled by statute |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

All major provisions should include:

- 5-8 year authorization periods
- GAO effectiveness reviews
- Automatic reporting requirements
- Congressional reauthorization requirement

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Local Journalism Sustainability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Definition gaming | "Pink slime" sites could qualify as local news | High |
| Hedge fund capture | Credits claimed while cutting staff | High |
| Geographic gaming | Claiming journalists serve areas they don't | Medium |
| Contract workers | Using contractors to avoid employee definition | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Doesn't address platform dominance | Revenue still flows to platforms | Tax credits don't change market structure |
| Benefits existing outlets | May not reach news deserts | Requires existing organization to claim |
| Limited to 5 years | Insufficient for long-term planning | Sunset provision |
| May not reach nonprofits | Many local news nonprofits excluded | Credit vs. direct funding |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Add net employment requirement: Credits only available if employment maintained or increased
2. Tighten definitions: Require 75% original local content, editorial staff in community
3. Add anti-evasion rule: Look-through to ultimate beneficial owners
4. Extend authorization: 10-year initial period with mandatory review

### National Local News Fund Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| State commission capture | Political appointees may favor allies | High |
| "Local" definition gaming | National outlets claiming local coverage | Medium |
| Funding as leverage | Implicit pressure despite independence rules | Medium |
| Exclusion criteria evasion | Creating new entities to avoid hedge fund exclusion | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| $5B may be insufficient | Crisis requires more resources | Political constraints on appropriations |
| Distribution delays | State commissions take time to establish | Implementation complexity |
| Digital advertising fee litigation | Alternative funding may be needed | Constitutional uncertainty |
| No content quality standards | Funds may support poor journalism | First Amendment constraints |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Strengthen commission independence: Staggered terms, supermajority removal, no recent political employees
2. Attribution requirements: Clear labeling of publicly funded journalism
3. Alternative funding: General appropriations backup if fee struck down
4. Quality metrics: Track audience engagement, impact, accuracy (not content control)

### Platform Transparency and Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Reasonable care" ambiguity | Standard too vague for enforcement | High |
| Algorithmic obfuscation | Compliance through complexity | High |
| Foreign subsidiary structuring | Avoiding US jurisdiction | Medium |
| Data minimization | Claiming insufficient data to comply | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No content standards | Doesn't directly address misinformation | First Amendment |
| Researcher access friction | Platforms may make access difficult | Competitive concerns |
| Enforcement capacity | FTC may lack technical expertise | Agency resources |
| Evolving technology | Rules may become outdated | Rapid innovation |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Develop industry standards: Working groups to define "reasonable care"
2. Technical expertise: Fund FTC technologist positions
3. Regular updates: Biennial rulemaking requirement
4. International coordination: Harmonize with EU DSA

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Coordination across agencies | Establish interagency working group (FCC, FTC, DOJ) |
| State-federal coordination | Model compacts for consistent implementation |
| Rapid technological change | Adaptive regulation with regular review |
| Political interference | Strong independence requirements, inspector general oversight |
| Measuring effectiveness | Standardized metrics, GAO review |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All legislation should include:

1. **5-year effectiveness review**: GAO assessment of whether goals achieved
2. **Automatic extension**: Programs continue if effective; terminated if not
3. **Metric requirements**: Clear, measurable outcomes defined in statute
4. **Adjustment authority**: Limited agency authority to modify within bounds
5. **Congressional notification**: Regular reporting to oversight committees
