# Media and Information: Overview

## Executive Summary

A functioning democracy requires citizens to have access to accurate, diverse information about public affairs. America's media ecosystem is in crisis: local journalism is collapsing, media ownership has concentrated into a handful of corporate giants, social media platforms amplify misinformation while evading accountability, and partisan news sources have fragmented the shared reality necessary for democratic deliberation. Since 2005, over 2,900 newspapers have closed, leaving half of U.S. counties with limited or no local news coverage. Meanwhile, platform monopolies like Meta and Google capture the majority of digital advertising revenue while algorithmic feeds prioritize engagement over accuracy.

The consequences extend far beyond the news industry. Without local journalism, corruption goes unchecked, civic participation declines, and communities lose their shared identity. Misinformation spreads faster than corrections, undermining public health, election integrity, and trust in institutions. The crisis is both economic—advertising revenue has migrated to platforms—and structural—the regulatory frameworks designed for broadcast media are obsolete in the digital age.

## Why This Matters

### For Democracy

- **Informed electorate**: Citizens cannot vote wisely without accurate information
- **Accountability**: Journalism exposes corruption and holds power accountable
- **Shared reality**: Democracy requires common facts for deliberation
- **Civic participation**: Local news drives engagement in community affairs

### For Communities

- **Local accountability**: Without reporters, local government goes unwatched
- **Community cohesion**: Local news connects residents to each other
- **Economic development**: News coverage affects business and investment decisions
- **Public health**: Local reporting on health issues saves lives

### For National Cohesion

- **Polarization**: Partisan media bubbles divide Americans
- **Trust**: Declining faith in media undermines trust in all institutions
- **Manipulation**: Foreign and domestic actors exploit information gaps
- **Extremism**: Misinformation fuels radicalization

## The Opportunity

Despite the crisis, there are reasons for hope and pathways for reform:

- **Public awareness**: More Americans understand local news is endangered
- **Philanthropic interest**: Foundations increasingly funding journalism
- **Nonprofit models**: Successful nonprofit newsrooms emerging
- **State action**: Several states creating journalism tax credits and funding
- **Platform accountability**: Growing pressure on tech companies to pay for news
- **International models**: Other democracies subsidizing journalism
- **New business models**: Membership, events, and diversified revenue streams
