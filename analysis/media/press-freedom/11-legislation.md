# Press Freedom: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Press freedom legislation must work within First Amendment constraints while providing meaningful protection for journalists, their sources, and the public's right to information. This document provides draft legal text for federal and state reforms.

## Federal Legislation

### PRESS Act (Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act)

**Purpose**: Establish a federal reporter's privilege protecting journalists from compelled disclosure of confidential sources.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "PRESS Act" or the "Protect Reporters
from Exploitative State Spying Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) a free and independent press is essential to democratic
    self-governance;
    (2) confidential sources enable journalists to uncover
    information in the public interest;
    (3) 40 States and the District of Columbia have enacted shield
    laws protecting journalist-source confidentiality;
    (4) the absence of a federal shield law creates uncertainty
    and inconsistent protection;
    (5) the Supreme Court in Branzburg v. Hayes did not foreclose
    statutory protection for journalists.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) COVERED JOURNALIST.—The term "covered journalist" means a person
who—
    (1) with the primary intent to investigate events and procure
    material in order to disseminate to the public news or information
    concerning local, national, or international events or other
    matters of public interest, regularly gathers, prepares, collects,
    photographs, records, writes, edits, reports, or publishes on
    such matters by—
        (A) conducting interviews;
        (B) making direct observation of events; or
        (C) collecting, reviewing, or analyzing original documents,
        records, transcripts, data, or other information; and
    (2) has such intent at the inception of the newsgathering process.

(b) DOCUMENT.—The term "document" means writings, recordings,
photographs, communications, and data of any kind.

(c) PROTECTED INFORMATION.—The term "protected information" means—
    (1) the identity of a source who provided information to a
    covered journalist as part of engaging in journalism and who
    has not consented to disclosure; and
    (2) any document that would tend to identify such a source.

SEC. 4. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM COVERED JOURNALISTS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—A Federal entity may not compel a covered journalist
to testify or produce any document in any Federal criminal or civil
proceeding if such testimony or production would tend to reveal
protected information, except as provided in subsection (b).

(b) EXCEPTIONS.—Subsection (a) shall not apply if a Federal court
determines, after providing notice and an opportunity for hearing,
that—
    (1) the party seeking to compel production has exhausted all
    reasonable alternative sources of such testimony or document;
    (2) in a criminal investigation or prosecution—
        (A) there are reasonable grounds to believe that a crime
        has occurred;
        (B) the testimony or document sought is essential to the
        investigation, prosecution, or defense; and
        (C) the government has not obtained the protected information
        from other sources; or
    (3) disclosure is necessary to prevent—
        (A) an act of terrorism against the United States or its
        allies;
        (B) significant harm to national security; or
        (C) imminent death or significant bodily harm.

(c) BALANCING TEST.—In considering whether an exception in
subsection (b) applies, the court shall balance—
    (1) the public interest in compelling disclosure; and
    (2) the public interest in protecting the free flow of
    information to the public.

SEC. 5. COMMUNICATIONS RECORDS.

(a) PROHIBITION.—A Federal entity may not compel any person to
disclose the contents of, or records or other information relating
to, a communication between a covered journalist and a source,
subject to the exceptions in section 4(b).

(b) NOTICE.—If a Federal entity seeks to compel records from a
third party related to a covered journalist, the entity shall
provide notice to the journalist and an opportunity to be heard
before the compulsion.

(c) DELAY OF NOTICE.—Notice may be delayed for up to 45 days,
renewable once for 45 days, if the court finds that notice would
pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity of a criminal
investigation or national security.

SEC. 6. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM THIRD PARTIES.

(a) IN GENERAL.—A Federal entity may not compel a third party to
produce any document that relates to the business transactions or
communications of a covered journalist with respect to protected
information without providing notice and an opportunity for the
journalist to be heard.

(b) STANDARD.—The court shall apply the standards in section 4 in
determining whether to compel production.

SEC. 7. CONSTRUCTION.

(a) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to—
    (1) limit any defenses, privileges, or protections otherwise
    available to a covered journalist; or
    (2) affect the common law or statutory rights of any individual.

(b) This Act shall be construed to provide maximum protection
consistent with the First Amendment.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall apply to any testimony or document sought on or
after the date of enactment.

- Provides qualified privilege with narrow, defined exceptions
- Uses functional definition of journalism (what you do, not who you are)
- Covers both direct compulsion and third-party records
- Includes notice requirement to enable journalists to challenge
- Preserves existing protections

## Constitutional Considerations

### First Amendment Framework

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Press Clause** | Protects newsgathering and publication |
| **No licensing** | Cannot require journalist credentials |
| **Prior restraint** | Presumptively unconstitutional |
| **Privilege** | Not constitutionally required (Branzburg) |

### Key Constraints

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| **Branzburg** | Congress can provide statutory privilege |
| **Prior restraint doctrine** | Strong protection for publication |
| **Access rights** | Limited constitutional right of access |
| **Government speech** | Officials can criticize press |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Definition gaming** | Who counts as "journalist" | Medium |
| **Exception expansion** | National security creep | High |
| **Notice delay abuse** | Extended secrecy | Medium |
| **Third-party circumvention** | Subpoena tech companies | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Espionage Act unchanged** | Still threatens sources | Political difficulty |
| **Classification unreformed** | Overclassification continues | Executive resistance |
| **State variation** | Uneven protection | Federalism |
| **Enforcement** | Violations hard to remedy | Structural |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Functional definition** of journalism that focuses on act, not status
2. **Narrow, specific exceptions** with clear standards
3. **Third-party coverage** to prevent end-run around protection
4. **Notice requirements** with limited delay authority
5. **Fee-shifting** to deter frivolous challenges
6. **Regular review** of classification practices
7. **Whistleblower enhancement** alongside shield law
