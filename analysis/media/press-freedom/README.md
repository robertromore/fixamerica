# Press Freedom: Overview

Press freedom—the ability of journalists to gather and report news without government interference—is a cornerstone of democracy. The First Amendment provides strong constitutional protection for the press, but journalists face growing threats from legal harassment, physical violence, surveillance, source prosecution, and political attacks. While the U.S. ranks high globally on press freedom metrics, recent trends show erosion, including increased hostility toward journalists, lack of federal shield law protection, and prosecution of sources and leakers. Protecting press freedom requires addressing these threats while balancing legitimate interests in national security and privacy.
