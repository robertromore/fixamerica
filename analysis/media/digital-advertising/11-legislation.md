## Constitutional Considerations

### First Amendment

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Commercial speech** | Advertising receives less protection |
| **Data as speech** | Uncertain; some courts skeptical |
| **Disclosure requirements** | Generally permissible |
| **Structural regulation** | Not speech regulation |

### Commerce Clause

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Interstate commerce** | Clear federal authority |
| **State regulation** | Cannot unduly burden interstate |
| **Preemption** | Floor vs. ceiling question |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Definition gaming** | Restructure to avoid coverage | High |
| **Consent manipulation** | Dark patterns for consent | High |
| **Jurisdictional arbitrage** | Operate from outside US | Medium |
| **First-party data** | Shift to logged-in tracking | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Enforcement resources** | Inadequate capacity | Budget |
| **Technical complexity** | Hard to verify compliance | Industry expertise |
| **Global operations** | Cross-border enforcement | Sovereignty |
| **Technology evolution** | Laws become outdated | Static rules |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Functional definitions** that capture evolving practices
2. **Meaningful consent standards** prohibiting dark patterns
3. **Adequate enforcement resources** with fee funding
4. **Regular review** and update mechanisms
5. **International coordination** provisions
6. **Technical expertise** in agencies
7. **Private enforcement** to supplement agency action
