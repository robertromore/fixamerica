# Digital Advertising: Overview

## Executive Summary

Digital advertising—the complex ecosystem of online ads, data collection, and automated transactions—has transformed media economics while creating serious problems for journalism, privacy, and democratic discourse. The shift from traditional advertising to digital has devastated local news while enriching platforms that extract value without creating content. Programmatic advertising enables misinformation to profit, surveillance capitalism invades privacy, and the duopoly of Google and Meta captures most digital ad revenue. Reforming digital advertising is essential to sustaining quality journalism and protecting consumers in the digital age.
