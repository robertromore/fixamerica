# Agriculture Policy Domain

## Domain: Agriculture

This domain examines the policies that shape the production, distribution, and sustainability of the crops, livestock, and rural economies that feed the United States.

## Executive Summary

Agriculture underpins national food security, rural livelihoods, and a web of domestic and international supply chains. The United States is among the world's largest agricultural exporters—with annual exports ranging from $170 billion to $200 billion in recent years—but the industry depends on aging infrastructure, volatile commodity markets, and climate-sensitive resources such as soil and water. Modern policy must balance the need for productivity and affordability with resilience to droughts, extreme weather, and market consolidation.

At the same time, farmers and ranchers face a generational transition: the average producer is nearly 58 years old, and aspiring new entrants must navigate rising land prices, expensive inputs, and regulatory complexity. Rural communities depend on agriculture for jobs, tax bases, and cultural identity, yet they also bear disproportionate burdens from pollution, labor shortages, and limited health care.

This domain will cover the full spectrum of issues—from soil health and climate adaptation to rural broadband and worker protections—while weaving in nutrition policy, global trade, and conservation programs to deliver actionable, evidence-based reforms.

## Scope

- Federal, state, and local programs that finance and regulate farms, ranches, and conservation efforts
- Climate resilience, water policy, and soil health as they relate to long-term productivity
- Food supply chain integrity, nutrition, and market access for small and midsize producers
- Labor policy, land access, and rural infrastructure that support agricultural communities
- Trade, competition, and governance systems that shape agricultural markets

## Key Facts

- U.S. agriculture contributes roughly 11% of GDP when upstream and downstream industries are included and supports over 18 million jobs (USDA Economic Research Service).
- The average age of principal farm operators is 58.1 years, and only 5.6% are under 35 (USDA Census of Agriculture 2022).
- Agricultural production accounts for approximately 10–12% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, with livestock, soils, and fertilizer use as major drivers (EPA inventory).
- Nearly 40% of irrigation districts report diminished surface or groundwater supplies over the last decade, intensifying competition between urban, industrial, and agricultural uses (USDA and USGS reports).
- Farm debt has risen to $531 billion, pressuring small farms and increasing default risks in rural communities (USDA Farm Income Forecast).
- Concentration in meatpacking leaves the top four poultry processors with more than 50% market share and contributes to price volatility and bargaining power imbalances (USDA AMS analyses).
- Roughly one in eight farms participates in a conservation program, but half of the nation’s private working lands still lack structural soil health management (USDA NRCS statistics).
- Food insecurity remains elevated in many rural counties even as nationwide agricultural output grows, highlighting distribution and affordability gaps (USDA Household Food Security report).
- The United States imports more than $20 billion in fruits and vegetables annually, underscoring vulnerabilities in domestic labor and logistics capacity (USDA Foreign Agricultural Service).
- Broadband access lags in 54% of agricultural counties, limiting precision agriculture adoption, education, and telehealth (FCC Broadband Deployment Report).

## Key Questions

- How can U.S. agriculture decarbonize while maintaining yields and farm incomes?
- What policy levers can boost new and diverse farmers’ access to land, credit, and technical assistance?
- How should federal spending be organized across crop insurance, conservation, and nutrition programs to reinforce both production and resilience?
- In what ways can procurement, value-added processing, and supply chain transparency reduce consolidation-related risks?
- What regulatory and labor reforms protect farmworkers while keeping farms competitive and compliant?
- How do insurance, disaster relief, and infrastructure investments need to evolve to address climate extremity and water scarcity?
- Which trade and export strategies best support domestic food security without undermining sustainable practices?

## Core Tensions

- High-yield commodity production versus diversified, regenerative practices that build long-term soil and climate resilience.
- Supporting legacy family farms while opening pathways for beginning and BIPOC producers.
- Federal funding that balances short-term disaster relief with sustained investment in conservation, research, and rural infrastructure.
- Market-based competition and consolidation pressures versus the need for worker protections and fair contract terms.

## What Success Looks Like

- Resilient working lands that sequester carbon, retain water, and deliver consistent yields across climate shocks.
- Rural economies stabilized through broadband, health care, and value-added processing that retains more farm income locally.
- Fair and transparent supply chains that allow consumers to trace impacts and enable small producers to compete.
- A diversified agricultural workforce with clear career pathways, migrant worker protections, and inclusive land-access programs.

## Relationship to Other Subtopics

The subtopics below show how soil health, labor policy, supply chains, and governance all feed into a cohesive strategy. Conservation and climate resilience subtopics inform the regulatory and federal spending conversations, while labor, rural infrastructure, and finance subtopics together shape who can participate in agriculture. Food systems, nutrition, and trade topics connect production with consumer outcomes and national security.

## Suggested Subtopics

**Resource Resilience & Production**

1. `agriculture/soil-health` – Regenerative cropping, nutrient management, and erosion control to protect productive acreage.
2. `agriculture/water-and-climate` – Irrigation modernization, groundwater safeguards, and drought response.
3. `agriculture/energy-and-circular-economy` – On-farm renewable generation, bioenergy, and waste reuse strategies.

**Rural Economies & Labor**

1. `agriculture/farm-labor-equity` – Worker protections, guest-worker policy, contracting transparency, and living wages.
2. `agriculture/rural-infrastructure` – Broadband, transportation, and resilience investments that support farms and communities.
3. `agriculture/farm-finance-and-land-access` – Credit, succession planning, equity ownership, and anti-speculation tools.

**Food Systems & Markets**

1. `agriculture/supply-chain-resilience` – Processing capacity, cold chains, and logistics to withstand disruptions.
2. `agriculture/nutrition-and-food-security` – SNAP, local procurement, and waste reduction that align agricultural production with public health.
3. `agriculture/trade-and-exports` – Balancing export competitiveness with domestic stabilizers and reciprocity.

**Governance & Innovation**

1. `agriculture/competition-and-regulation` – Anti-trust in commodity markets, transparency in contracting, and oversight of mergers.
2. `agriculture/conservation-program-delivery` – USDA programming, programmatic accountability, and leveraging private finance.
3. `agriculture/technology-and-innovation-policy` – Research funding, data privacy, and equitable deployment of precision tools.

## Cross-Domain Relationships

- **Environment**: Agriculture sits at the intersection of land use, biodiversity, and climate mitigation; policies here shape emissions and natural-resource stewardship.
- **Infrastructure**: Rural broadband, transportation, and water storage investments are prerequisites for modern farm operations.
- **Health & Food Systems**: Agricultural policy determines supply, quality, and affordability of food that drives public health outcomes.
- **Economic Opportunity**: Farm finance, trade, and labor policies influence small businesses, supply chains, and regional employment.
