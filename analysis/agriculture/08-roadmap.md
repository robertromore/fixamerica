# Agriculture Policy: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

Implementing comprehensive agricultural reform requires strategic sequencing that builds momentum, captures political windows, and creates reinforcing cycles of success. This roadmap organizes reforms into phases that account for political timing, administrative capacity, and interdependencies.

---

## Strategic Approach

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Capture windows** | Use farm bill reauthorization and budget cycles |
| **Build coalitions** | Layer reforms that unite different stakeholders |
| **Demonstrate success** | Pilot programs before scaling |
| **Reduce opposition** | Phase in changes to allow adaptation |
| **Create feedback loops** | Early wins build momentum for larger reforms |
| **Maintain flexibility** | Adapt to changing conditions |

### Political Timing

| Window | Opportunity |
|--------|-------------|
| **Farm Bill 2024-2025** | Major reauthorization; reform moment |
| **Budget cycles** | Appropriations influence |
