# Rural Infrastructure: Current State

## Overview

Rural infrastructure in the United States faces a dual challenge: historic underinvestment compounded by climate-driven stress. While the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and related programs have injected billions into rural broadband, roads, and water systems, execution lags behind need. Approximately 46 million Americans live in rural areas, and their access to basic infrastructure—reliable internet, safe bridges, clean water, dependable electricity, and healthcare—falls significantly below urban standards.
