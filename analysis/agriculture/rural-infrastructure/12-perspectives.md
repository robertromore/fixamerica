## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Bank With State Governance Guardrails

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Centrist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: A rural bank can scale investment if states guide project selection.
- **Policy**: Federal capitalization paired with state governance boards and repayment rules.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept loan emphasis; conservatives accept federal capital.
- **Viability**: High; aligns with investment and accountability goals.

### Compromise 2: Corridor Grants With Local Match and Metrics

- **Bridges**: Populist, Centrist, Progressive
- **Core agreement**: Corridors should boost rural access and market power.
- **Policy**: Grants require local match, workforce participation, and performance metrics.
- **Concessions**: Mandates soften; local ownership rises.
- **Viability**: Medium-high; depends on matching capacity.

### Compromise 3: Water Resilience First, Transit Later

- **Bridges**: Conservative, Constitutionalist, Liberal
- **Core agreement**: Water infrastructure is core to farm resilience.
- **Policy**: Prioritize water and drainage upgrades first, then pilot transit and housing.
- **Concessions**: Reformers accept sequencing; skeptics accept future pilots.
- **Viability**: High; easiest consensus path.

## Strategic Implications

- Most viable coalition centers on the resilience bank and water infrastructure upgrades.
- Key obstacle is concern about long-term operating costs for transit and housing initiatives.
- Bad-faith risk appears limited; focus on pilots with measurable outcomes and maintenance plans.
- Recommended approach: pass the bank and water acts first, then scale corridor grants and pilot transit and housing.
