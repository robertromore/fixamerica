# Rural Infrastructure: Overview

Rural infrastructure—broadband, transportation, water systems, electrical grids, and community facilities—forms the connective tissue that enables strong agricultural production and resilient rural economies. Despite historic federal investments through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, significant gaps persist: roughly one-quarter of rural residents lack adequate broadband, tens of thousands of rural bridges are structurally deficient, and water and irrigation systems built decades ago face deferred maintenance and climate stress.
