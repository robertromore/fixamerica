# Rural Infrastructure: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Framework

### Vision

By 2035, all rural Americans have access to reliable broadband, safe roads and bridges, clean water, dependable electricity, quality healthcare, and adequate housing—infrastructure that enables agricultural productivity, economic opportunity, and community resilience in the face of climate change.

### Strategic Priorities

| Priority | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Universal broadband** | Foundation for precision agriculture, telehealth, education, economic opportunity |
| **Bridge and road safety** | Eliminate backlog of deficient infrastructure; reduce fatalities |
| **Water resilience** | Adapt to climate variability; ensure drinking water quality |
| **Healthcare access** | Stabilize rural hospitals; expand telehealth; reduce EMS times |
| **Grid modernization** | Reliability, renewable integration, climate resilience |
| **Equity focus** | Prioritize tribal nations, persistent poverty counties, underserved communities |

### Sequencing Logic

The roadmap sequences investments to:

1. **Establish foundations** (Years 1-2): Create financing mechanisms, launch programs, begin high-priority projects
2. **Scale deployment** (Years 3-5): Major construction wave across all infrastructure types
3. **Complete networks** (Years 6-8): Fill remaining gaps, achieve universal coverage targets
4. **Sustain and adapt** (Years 9+): Maintenance, upgrades, climate adaptation
