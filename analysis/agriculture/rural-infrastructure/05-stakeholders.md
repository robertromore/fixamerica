# Rural Infrastructure: Stakeholders

## Overview

Rural infrastructure involves a complex ecosystem of stakeholders—from the 46 million Americans who live in rural areas to the federal agencies managing billions in investment programs, from electric cooperatives serving remote communities to telecommunications companies deciding where to deploy broadband. Understanding who is affected, who has power, and where interests align or conflict is essential for designing reforms that can build coalitions and overcome resistance.
