# Rural Infrastructure: Legislation

## Overview

Legislation should mobilize low-cost capital, align broadband and logistics investments, and embed climate resilience while maintaining rigorous oversight and community input.

## Model Federal Bills

### 1. Rural Infrastructure Resilience Bank Act

**Purpose**: Create a dedicated bank that issues loans and grants, monitors resilience metrics, and provides technical assistance for rural broadband, roads, water, and housing projects.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Rural Infrastructure Resilience Bank Act."

SEC. 2. BANK.
Establish the Rural Infrastructure Resilience Bank to provide capital, scoring, and technical assistance for multi-modal rural projects that meet resilience criteria.
```

**Explanation**: Centralizes financing while requiring maintenance plans and resilience scoring.

**Challenges**: Governance, sustaining capitalization, and integrating state and local partners.

### 2. Broadband and Logistics Corridor Act

**Purpose**: Fund corridor packages combining broadband deployment, cold storage, and freight coordination in agricultural chokepoints.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Broadband and Logistics Corridor Act."

SEC. 2. GRANTS.
Provide multi-modal grants for fiber, 5G, cold storage, and aggregation facilities within designated corridors.
```

**Explanation**: Couples connectivity with logistics to reduce waste and improve data-driven planning.

**Challenges**: Coordination across agencies (NTIA, USDA, DOT) and rights-of-way approvals.

### 3. Rural Transit and Housing Access Act

**Purpose**: Invest in transit routes, workforce housing, and supportive facilities (child care, clinics) near agricultural employment centers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Rural Transit and Housing Access Act."

SEC. 2. PROGRAM.
Award grants for transit, housing, and connected services that reduce commute times and support worker retention.
```

**Explanation**: Ensures workers can reliably reach jobs and fosters rural workforce stability.

**Challenges**: Operating subsidies, matching local funding, and ensuring equity.

### 4. Climate-Ready Water Infrastructure Act

**Purpose**: Upgrade drainage, storage, and irrigation infrastructure with climate forecasting and soil health targets.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "Climate-Ready Water Infrastructure Act."

SEC. 2. GRANTS.
Provide funding for watershed-based resilience projects that reduce flood risk and boost irrigation reliability.
```

**Explanation**: Aligns water systems with climate adaptation and nutrient runoff goals.

**Challenges**: Basin coordination and long-term maintenance funding.

## State Model Legislation

States can adopt "Rural Infrastructure Compact Acts" that:

- Form multi-jurisdictional boards for broadband, transit, and water planning.
- Match federal loans with state funds for housing and water upgrades.
- Share maintenance responsibilities and data across counties.

## Regulatory Framework

- NTIA and USDA must align BEAD, RDOF, and ReConnect mapping with DOT corridor planning and RAISE/INFRA grant schedules.
- EPA and USDA should collaborate on watershed and climate infrastructure standards and nutrient runoff reporting.
- HUD and USDA Rural Development need coordinated housing and transit criteria tied to workforce wages and agriculture needs.

## Legal Considerations

- Constitutional issues: Spending clause authority, ensuring resilience projects serve public purpose, and balancing state autonomy.
- Preemption questions: Federal standards should provide a floor while allowing states to exceed requirements.
- Enforcement mechanisms: Maintenance plan conditions, performance-based disbursements, clawback provisions for noncompliant projects.
- Sunset and review: GAO and OMB review every five years with stakeholder input to recalibrate scoring and capital needs.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Maintenance avoidance | Recipients focus on construction but fail to budget for upkeep | High |
| Corridor overstatement | Projects inflate coverage metrics or claim redundant assets | Medium |
| Broadband shadow builds | Entities claim funding but lease operations to third parties with no service obligations | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Workforce scarcity | Limited local crews delay construction and maintenance | Aging workforce, limited rural training |
| Data gaps | Lack of real-time infrastructure condition data | Fragmented state and local reporting |
| Climate mismatch | Projects neglect long-term resilience goals | Narrow funding silos |

### Rectification Procedures

1. Tie disbursements to verified maintenance plans and require multi-year funding commitments.
2. Use third-party verification and digital dashboards to validate corridor claims and broadband speed and uptime.
3. Fund rural infrastructure workforce academies and apprenticeships while aligning climate and resilience standards across agencies.

### General Implementation Concerns

Ensure multi-agency coordination, avoid duplication with existing programs (like BEAD or RAISE), and prioritize meaningful community engagement in planning.
